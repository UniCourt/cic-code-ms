     <p>
      Assignments for the benefit of creditors may be executed as heretofore; but in every case of a general assignment where the property assigned shall exceed in value the sum of One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00), the assignee or trustee shall, before he enters upon the discharge of his duties, after taking possession, and within twenty-four (24) hours thereafter, file a petition in the chancery court of the county of the assignor’s residence or place of business, or if he had no residence or place of business in this state, then of the county of the residence of some of his creditors, or where the property or some of it may be, for the administration of the trust. The assignor and all of his creditors must be made parties to the petition.

      <p>
       Notes and solvent credits of an insolvent bank which passed to an assignee by a general assignment before February 1 in any year are taxable in the hands of the assignee and he should render them to the assessor. Gerard v. Duncan, 84 Miss. 731, 36 So. 1034, 1904 Miss. LEXIS 82 (Miss. 1904).
      </p>
      <p>
       One making a general assignment for the benefit of his creditors, must, in good faith, devote the whole of his nonexempt property to the payment of his debts, parting absolutely with all control over the same, and must reserve no benefit to himself, and retain no power or control over the property. Union & Planters' Bank v. Allen, 77 Miss. 442, 27 So. 631, 1899 Miss. LEXIS 94 (Miss. 1899).
      </p>
      <p>
       The assignee in a general assignment occupies a dual relation. Weems v. Love Mfg. Co., 74 Miss. 831, 21 So. 915, 1897 Miss. LEXIS 65 (Miss. 1897).
      </p>
      <p>
       It is only where the assignment is general that the assignor can petition the chancery court under this chapter; A petition by an assignee in a partial assignment should be dismissed. Lowenstein v. Hooker, 71 Miss. 102, 14 So. 531, 1893 Miss. LEXIS 192 (Miss. 1893).
      </p>
      <h4 id="t85c01s85-1-1-JUDICIALDECISIONS01-2.Transactionsandtransferscreatingassignment.">

       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       Deeds to real property with separate instrument stating deeds were to secure payment of money did not constitute “assignment for benefit of creditors.” Stirling v. Logue, 154 Miss. 812, 123 So. 825, 1929 Miss. LEXIS 178 (Miss. 1929).
      </p>
      <p>
       It is immaterial that an assignment contained only personalty and that aiding deeds contained only land, where, in law, they constituted one instrument and one transaction. Union & Planters' Bank v. Allen, 77 Miss. 442, 27 So. 631, 1899 Miss. LEXIS 94 (Miss. 1899).
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether a deed of trust to secure a creditor shall be treated as part of a general assignment made shortly afterward by the debtor is to be determined by the purpose of the creditor in making the former. Pollock v. Sykes, 74 Miss. 700, 21 So. 780, 1897 Miss. LEXIS 59 (Miss. 1897).
      </p>
      <p>
       Sale of goods, transfer of collaterals and the execution of a deed of trust to a creditor bank, and the assignment for benefit of creditors shortly thereafter, by an insolvent corporation, did not form a general assignment for the benefit of creditors where they were separate and independent transactions. Sells v. Rosedale Grocery & Com. Co., 72 Miss. 590, 17 So. 236, 1895 Miss. LEXIS 9 (Miss. 1895).
      </p>
      <p>
       The dismissal of the petition of the assignee in a partial assignment carries with it a cross-petition filed by creditors. Lowenstein v. Hooker, 71 Miss. 102, 14 So. 531, 1893 Miss. LEXIS 192 (Miss. 1893).
      </p>
      <p>
       A conveyance by an officer (state treasurer) to indemnify the sureties on his official bond against loss by defalcation, though embracing all the grantor’s property, is not an assignment subject to the strict rules governing such instruments but is a mortgage enforceable upon the contingency of liability and dependent upon future developments. State v. Hemingway, 69 Miss. 491, 10 So. 575, 1891 Miss. LEXIS 78 (Miss. 1891).
      </p>
      <h4 id="t85c01s85-1-1-JUDICIALDECISIONS01-3.—Partialassignments.">
       <b>
        3. —Partial assignments.
       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       A partial assignment is not invalidated by the fact that shortly before its execution the assignor had fraudulently converted a part of his assets into money. Thompson v. Preston, 73 Miss. 587, 19 So. 347, 1895 Miss. LEXIS 167 (Miss. 1895).
      </p>
      <p>
       The omission of a substantial part of the assignor’s property makes it a partial assignment and preferences thereby created are not void for noncompliance with the statute relating to general assignments. Newman v. Black, 73 Miss. 239, 18 So. 543, 1895 Miss. LEXIS 81 (Miss. 1895).
      </p>
      <p>
       While an assignment purporting to convey only specific property must be treated as a partial assignment until the contrary be shown, yet if it does in fact convey all of the assignee’s property liable for his debts, it will be dealt with as a general assignment regardless of its terms. Newman v. Black, 73 Miss. 239, 18 So. 543, 1895 Miss. LEXIS 81 (Miss. 1895).
      </p>
      <p>
       Debtor’s assignment of part of estate for benefit of certain creditors and conveyance of remainder of its property to another creditor held not a general assignment. Starling & Smith Co. v. Flash, 16 So. 875 (Miss. 1894).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section [Code 1942, § 298] is not applicable to partial assessments but applies only to general assignments. Lowenstein v. Hooker, 71 Miss. 102, 14 So. 531, 1893 Miss. LEXIS 192 (Miss. 1893).
      </p>
      <p>
       A partial assignment acts only on the property embraced in it. Hence an assignment which without purporting to embrace all the assignor’s property conveys his stock of merchandise in a designated store, together with the notes and books of account pertaining thereto, is partial regardless of what the grantor thought or intended. Jones v. McQueen, 71 Miss. 98, 14 So. 146, 1893 Miss. LEXIS 155 (Miss. 1893).
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether an assignment is general or partial is to be determined by its terms. Jones v. McQueen, 71 Miss. 98, 14 So. 146, 1893 Miss. LEXIS 155 (Miss. 1893).
      </p>

        4. Effect of assignment on rights and remedies of creditors generally.
       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       A general assignment does not defeat a landlord’s rights but he must apply to the chancery court for the payment of his rent out of the proceeds of the assigned property. Rice v. Harris, 76 Miss. 422, 24 So. 880, 1898 Miss. LEXIS 111 (Miss. 1898).
      </p>
      <p>
       No jurisdiction over property is acquired by chancery court until petition of assignee is filed and bond approved, and until then creditors may attach the same in the hands of the assignee. Weimer v. Scales, 74 Miss. 1, 19 So. 588, 1896 Miss. LEXIS 94 (Miss. 1896).
      </p>
      <p>
       However, the landlord suing out an attachment cannot make an actual levy. By application to the chancery court he may proceed against the property or its proceeds. Paine v. Sykes, 72 Miss. 351, 16 So. 903, 1894 Miss. LEXIS 119 (Miss. 1894).
      </p>
      <p>
       The assignment as written is the law for the administration of the insolvent’s estate; neither the assignee nor the courts may add to or subtract therefrom and as written it must be susceptible of complete execution without depriving creditors of their legal rights or it may not stand against their attack. Rothenberg v. Bradley, 69 Miss. 1, 10 So. 922, 1891 Miss. LEXIS 87 (Miss. 1891); Selleck v. Pollock, 69 Miss. 870, 13 So. 248, 1892 Miss. LEXIS 25 (Miss. 1892); Hiller v. Ellis, 72 Miss. 701, 18 So. 95, 1895 Miss. LEXIS 34 (Miss. 1895).
      </p>
      <p>
       An assignee is not a bona fide purchaser and therefore goods assigned to him which are liable to be attached for rent, may be still subjected to the landlord’s demand. Paine v. Aberdeen Hotel Co., 60 Miss. 360, 1882 Miss. LEXIS 64 (Miss. 1882); Paine v. Sykes, 72 Miss. 351, 16 So. 903, 1894 Miss. LEXIS 119 (Miss. 1894).

       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       The failure to file schedules as provided by Code 1942, § 306 does not affect the general assignment where no preferences are made. Kaufman v. Simon, 80 Miss. 189, 31 So. 713, 1902 Miss. LEXIS 241 (Miss. 1902).
      </p>
      <p>
       The only penalty inflicted by the law upon one who executes or procures the execution to him of a fraudulent assignment is the loss of the benefits of the instrument. Weems v. Love Mfg. Co., 74 Miss. 831, 21 So. 915, 1897 Miss. LEXIS 65 (Miss. 1897).
      </p>
      <p>
       A subsequent composition agreement and the dealings of the parties thereunder cannot be considered in determining the validity of an assignment, and a deed in aid thereof. Allen v. Union & Planters' Bank, 72 Miss. 549, 17 So. 442, 1895 Miss. LEXIS 18 (Miss. 1895); English v. Friedman, 70 Miss. 457, 12 So. 252, 1892 Miss. LEXIS 112 (Miss. 1892).
      </p>
      <p>
       In the absence of exceptional circumstances, one partner cannot, without the consent of his copartner, make a general assignment for the benefit of creditors, and being prima facie invalid, the burden of proof to show consent of the other partner is upon those who would maintain it. Mayer v. Bernstein, 69 Miss. 17, 12 So. 257, 1891 Miss. LEXIS 103 (Miss. 1891).
      </p>

       Subsequent ratification by the nonexecuting partner will not affect the liens of creditors who have assailed it. Mayer v. Bernstein, 69 Miss. 17, 12 So. 257, 1891 Miss. LEXIS 103 (Miss. 1891).

       A voluntary assignment by an insolvent partnership which devotes partnership assets to the payment of individual debts of a partner is fradulent and void as to firm creditors. Rothenberg v. Bradley, 69 Miss. 1, 10 So. 922, 1891 Miss. LEXIS 87 (Miss. 1891).
      </p>
      <p>
       The intent which will void a voluntary assignment need not be an actual corrupt intent; where the thing done is unlawful and naturally results in hindering, delaying, or defrauding creditors, the law imputes a fraudulent intent and this is so whether the unlawful thing is shown by extrinsic evidence or appears on the face of the deed. Rothenberg v. Bradley, 69 Miss. 1, 10 So. 922, 1891 Miss. LEXIS 87 (Miss. 1891).

       Debtor may make assignment preferring general creditors. Bradberry v. Adams, 110 Miss. 581, 70 So. 697, 1915 Miss. LEXIS 79 (Miss. 1915).
      </p>
      <p>
       The tendency is to recognize the view that preferences were allowed at common law and that the principles of an insolvent or bankrupt law are not applicable to the making of general assignments. Pollock v. Sykes, 74 Miss. 700, 21 So. 780, 1897 Miss. LEXIS 59 (Miss. 1897).
      </p>
      <p>
       While an insolvent corporation may in good faith prefer creditors, yet the directors cannot prefer themselves. Love Mfg. Co. v. Queen City Mfg. Co., 74 Miss. 290, 20 So. 146, 1896 Miss. LEXIS 103 (Miss. 1896).
      </p>
      <p>
       The omission of a substantial part of the assignor’s property makes it a partial assignment and preferences thereby created are not void for noncompliance with the statute in relation to general assignments. Newman v. Black, 73 Miss. 239, 18 So. 543, 1895 Miss. LEXIS 81 (Miss. 1895).
      </p>
      <p>
       An assignment stating the debt of a preferred creditor somewhat in excess of the amount due him, is not thereby invalidated where it authorizes the assignee to correct the schedule of liabilities if by inadvertence there was a mistake or error in the amounts thereof. Goodbar Shoe Co. v. Montgomery, 73 Miss. 73, 19 So. 196, 1895 Miss. LEXIS 140 (Miss. 1895); H. Wetler Mfg.v Dinkins, 70 Miss. 835, 12 So. 584, 1893 Miss. LEXIS 11 (Miss. 1893); Hiller v.

      </p>
      <p>
       Where formal insolvency proceedings are waived and by consent a decree is entered directing the administrator of an insolvent decedent’s estate to make distribution among creditors, he becomes personally liable for the amounts decreed to them respectively and may prefer such a creditor in a partial assignment of his property. Allen v. Smith Bros. Co., 72 Miss. 689, 18 So. 579, 1895 Miss. LEXIS 72 (Miss. 1895); Anderson v. Tindall, 26 Miss. 332, 1853 Miss. LEXIS 97 (Miss. 1853).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a usurious debt is intentionally preferred, such preference is unlawful and avoids the assignment. Hiller v. Ellis, 72 Miss. 701, 18 So. 95, 1895 Miss. LEXIS 34 (Miss. 1895); H. Wetler Mfg.v Dinkins, 70 Miss. 835, 12 So. 584, 1893 Miss. LEXIS 11 (Miss. 1893).
      </p>
      <p>
       A release from personal liability given the assignor by a preferred creditor for a usurious debt, will not make the assignee, who had notice of the usury, a bona fide purchaser for the protection of such preference. Hiller v. Ellis, 72 Miss. 701, 18 So. 95, 1895 Miss. LEXIS 34 (Miss. 1895); H. Wetler Mfg.v Dinkins, 70 Miss. 835, 12 So. 584, 1893 Miss. LEXIS 11 (Miss. 1893).
      </p>
      <p>
       Knowledge by the assignee of the unlawful act of the assignor will avoid it although the preferred creditor has paid value. Hiller v. Ellis, 72 Miss. 701, 18 So. 95, 1895 Miss. LEXIS 34 (Miss. 1895); H. Wetler Mfg.v Dinkins, 70 Miss. 835, 12 So. 584, 1893 Miss. LEXIS 11 (Miss. 1893).

       An insolvent corporation or individual may prefer creditors by mortgage, sale or assignment in cases untainted by fraud. Sells v. Rosedale Grocery & Com. Co., 72 Miss. 590, 17 So. 236, 1895 Miss. LEXIS 9 (Miss. 1895).
      </p>
      <p>
       An assignment is not invalid because it prefers a fee to attorneys “for services and advice in and about this assignment and for the execution of this trust,” since in these matters necessary counsel fees are allowable. Memphis Grocery Co. v. Leach, 71 Miss. 959, 15 So. 113, 1894 Miss. LEXIS 12 (Miss. 1894).
      </p>
      <p>
       An assignment preferring a creditor whose debt embraces usury is not invalid if the amount directed to be paid does not exceed the principal and legal interest; the assignor may waive his personal privilege of defeating all interest. H. Wetler Mfg.v Dinkins, 70 Miss. 835, 12 So. 584, 1893 Miss. LEXIS 11 (Miss. 1893).
      </p>
      <p>
       But a general assignment directing payment to a particular attorney of a fixed sum as a fee not alone for drawing the assignment but also for services thereafter to be rendered in maintaining it if assailed and that whether the services are required or not, is fraudulent and void. Selleck v. Pollock, 69 Miss. 870, 13 So. 248, 1892 Miss. LEXIS 25 (Miss. 1892).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where one partner buys the interest of another giving his note therefor and afterward fails and makes an assignment he may prefer this debt and also a debt for money loaned him by the retiring partner after his withdrawal, notwithstanding there was no notice of the withdrawal of the retiring partner and that by reason thereof he might be personally liable for debts subsequently contracted. Richardson v. Davis, 70 Miss. 219, 11 So. 790, 1892 Miss. LEXIS 76 (Miss. 1892).
      </p>
      <p>
       A preference in favor of the tax collector for taxes on lands owned by the partners individually will avoid the assignment by an insolvent partnership. Rothenberg v. Bradley, 69 Miss. 1, 10 So. 922, 1891 Miss. LEXIS 87 (Miss. 1891).
      </p>
      <p>
       The preference of a fictitious debt makes the assignment void as to creditors, although the grantor through mistake of law supposed he owed the debt. Whether this would be so if a debt not really due were unintentionally preferred through honest mistake of fact is not decided. Rothenberg v. Bradley, 69 Miss. 1, 10 So. 922, 1891 Miss. LEXIS 87 (Miss. 1891).

       An assignment conveying lands, tenements and “hereditaments” passes to the assignee by the use of the word “hereditaments” the right of the rents and the retention by the assignor of the rent notes and the subsequent delivery of them to a third person, being wholly ineffectual to defeat the assignee’s right to the rents, will not invalidate the assignment. Allen v. Smith Bros. Co., 72 Miss. 689, 18 So. 579, 1895 Miss. LEXIS 72 (Miss. 1895); Hatch v. Sykes, 64 Miss. 307, 1 So. 248, 1886 Miss. LEXIS 62 (Miss. 1886); Kessee v.

      </p>
      <p>
       If an assignor in good faith includes in a general assignment all of his known estate, it cannot be avoided because it afterward appears that he owned land not included in it, of which he knew nothing. Nor will his subsequent bad faith with regard to such land avoid it. English v. Friedman, 70 Miss. 457, 12 So. 252, 1892 Miss. LEXIS 112 (Miss. 1892).
      </p>
      <p>
       A general voluntary assignment by an insolvent debtor is void as to creditors if he reserves of the assets for his own benefit $100, notwithstanding the assets be of great value and the sum withheld be to meet pressing family necessities. Montgomery v. Goodbar, 69 Miss. 333, 13 So. 624, 1891 Miss. LEXIS 136 (Miss. 1891); Rothenberg v. Bradley, 69 Miss. 1, 10 So. 922, 1891 Miss. LEXIS 87 (Miss. 1891).
      </p>
      <p>
       A general assignment is not objectionable because it reserves to the assignor the right, with the assent of a majority of the creditors, to appoint another assignee if the one named declines the trust. Smith v. Bowdre, 69 Miss. 692, 13 So. 829, 1892 Miss. LEXIS 39 (Miss. 1892).

       The reservation by a partner of money which legally belongs to the firm, and which in general terms the assignment purports to convey, will void the assignment. Rothenberg v. Bradley, 69 Miss. 1, 10 So. 922, 1891 Miss. LEXIS 87 (Miss. 1891).

      </p>
      <p>
       Fact that composition agreement between assignors and their creditors modified the assignment and provided that the assignors, through the trustee, should have the power to sell or mortgage the realty conveyed for the benefit of creditors, did not render the assignment void, since it merely constituted the assignors, on account of their perfect knowledge of the lands involved, agents of the assignee.

      <p>
       An extension of time allowed the trustee in which to carry out the liquidation of property assigned for the benefit of creditors of a co-partnership, provided for in a composition agreement of the partnership creditors, did not render the assignment void as to a creditor of one of the partners, where such extension was reasonable and incidental and necessary to the proper execution of the trust.

      How each debt is evidenced;

     <p>
      The amount of interest each debt bears, and if in any way the debt is usurious, the facts must be stated;
     </p>
     <p>
      The consideration for each debt; and in case of renewals the history of the transaction must be traced to the original consideration; and
     </p>
     <p>
      What security, if any, each creditor has.
     </p>
     <p>
      The other, a schedule of assets, must describe the property conveyed, and give its location and value. Both schedules-and if the data be in the face of the deed, then the assignment-must be under the oath of the assignor avowing the truthfulness of the matters of fact stated. A general assignment which does not comply with this section shall be void as to all preferences contained in it.

       Bankruptcy debtor’s exemption claims in his simplified employee pension-individual retirement accounts (SEP-IRA) extended only to amounts reasonably necessary for support of debtor as well as of any dependents. In re Henderson, 167 B.R. 67, 1993 Bankr. LEXIS 2177 (Bankr. N.D. Miss. 1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       A debtor in Mississippi may utilize Section 522(f)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code to avoid a voluntary nonpurchase-money security interest that impairs an exemption to which the debtor would be entitled but for the exclusionary language of subsection (e) of this section. In re Kennedy, 139 B.R. 389, 1992 Bankr. LEXIS 666 (Bankr. N.D. Miss. 1992).
      </p>

       Under the statute, the proceeds of a voluntary sale of a homestead are exempt under all circumstances, regardless of the vendor’s continuing to be a householder, or his acquiring another homestead, or the intent with which he keeps the proceeds. Davis v. Lammons, 246 Miss. 624, 151 So. 2d 907, 1963 Miss. LEXIS 487 (Miss. 1963).
      </p>

       Although an exemption is a personal privilege and as a general rule cannot be taken advantage of, except by the execution or attachment debtor, an exception is that his wife can make the claim for him. Reid v. Halpin, 185 Miss. 396, 188 So. 310, 1939 Miss. LEXIS 165 (Miss. 1939).

   In the event that the term “motor vehicles” was not clear and unambiguous so that the court should employ the canons of statutory construction to interpret the meaning of “motor vehicles” in Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t85c03s85-3-1ol1a" target="_self">85-3-1(a)</a></cite>, the court found as follows: (1) in other Mississippi statutes, the ordinary use of “motor vehicles” included motorcycles, (2) the Mississippi Legislature used the term “motor vehicles” in §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t85c03s85-3-1ol1a" target="_self">85-3-1(a)</a></cite> without adding language to include some types of motor vehicles but not others, (3) the sections of the Mississippi Code that discussed motorcycles demonstrated that for the purposes of traffic regulation, conveyance, registration, and taxation, the Mississippi Legislature considered motorcycles to be a type of motor vehicles. Without indication to the contrary, there was no reason to presume that the Mississippi Legislature had any different intent with respect to its treatment of motorcycles under the Exemption Statute. In re Clemons, 441 B.R. 519, 2010 Bankr. LEXIS 2943 (Bankr. N.D. Miss. 2010).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Term “motor vehicles” is clear and unambiguous and should be given its plain meaning; furthermore, (i) the plain meaning of “motor vehicles” includes motorcycles, (ii) if the Mississippi Legislature had desired to narrow the types of “motor vehicles” affected by the Exemption Statute, Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t85c03s85-3-1" target="_self">85-3-1</a></cite>, it certainly knew how to add restricting language to accomplish that goal, and (iii) accordingly, motorcycles fall within the category “motor vehicles” and as such are a type of tangible personal property included in §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t85c03s85-3-1" target="_self">85-3-1</a></cite>. A debtor may, therefore, claim a motorcycle as exempt property pursuant to § 85-3-1. In re Clemons, 441 B.R. 519, 2010 Bankr. LEXIS 2943 (Bankr. N.D. Miss. 2010).

       <p>
   State exemption statute and 11 USCS § 522(f) must be applied together, thus, debtors seeking to avoid nonpurchase-money security interests under 11 USCS § 522(f)(B) in “household goods” under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t85c03s85-3-1ol1avi" target="_self">85-3-1(a)(vi)</a></cite> were limited to the definition of “household goods” in the Mississippi statute, such that for example, a debtor could avoid a lien on only one television, but Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t85c03s85-3-1ol1aiv" target="_self">85-3-1(a)(iv)</a></cite> did expand the number of items that could be eligible for judicial lien avoidance pursuant to 11 USCS § 522(f)(1)(A). In re McCoy, 2003 Bankr. LEXIS 374 (Bankr. N.D. Miss. Apr. 23, 2003).

       As a result of the 1995 amendment limiting the range of personal property that may be exempted from seizure, a debtor is prohibited from claiming a mobile home as exempt personal property. Cobbins v. Henderson (In re Cobbins), 227 F.3d 302, 2000 U.S. App. LEXIS 23862 (5th Cir. Miss. 2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       Bank deposit or account was in nature of “intangible” personal property, which could not be exempted from garnishment under Mississippi statute authorizing debtor to claim exemption only in tangible personal property not exceeding $10,000 in value. Cartwright v. Deposit Guar. Nat'l Bank, 675 So. 2d 847, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 302 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Household goods which would normally be exempt under this section from seizure in bankruptcy proceedings, are not protected from holder of nonpossessory, nonpurchase-money security interest in goods by virtue of this section or federal exemption provisions. In re Fox, 902 F.2d 411, 1990 U.S. App. LEXIS 8925 (5th Cir. Miss. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chapter 7 debtor could not avoid nonpossessory, nonpurchase money security interest in household goods; under exemption scheme, household goods which are subject to voluntary security interest are not subject to exemption. In re Eiland, 95 B.R. 41, 1988 Bankr. LEXIS 2267 (Bankr. N.D. Miss. 1988).

   The 1966 amendment to §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t85c03s85-3-1ol110a" target="_self">85-3-1(10)(a)</a></cite> required the garnishee to withhold funds from an employee’s wages up until the return day of the writ or until the full amount of the judgment had been collected, whichever occurred first. Leasy v. Zollicoffer, 389 So. 2d 1378, 1980 Miss. LEXIS 2111 (Miss. 1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       In garnishment proceedings, where part of defendant’s salary was exempt from garnishment because paid in advance in a larger amount than would, under statute exempting $50 a month, have been exempt if none of the salary had been paid in advance, remainder of such salary held not subject to statutory exemption.

       Money collected by an attorney on a claim due his client for wages exempt under this section [Code 1942, § 307] is not exempt from the attorney’s lien. Halsell v. Turner, 84 Miss. 432, 36 So. 531, 1904 Miss. LEXIS 60 (Miss. 1904).
      </p>
      <p>
       Exemptions are highly favored by the law, and the protection may not be defeated by the intention or neglect of the garnishee; Hence, a garnishee who pays a judgment rendered against it as such, and as such takes an assignment of the judgment on which it is issued, remains liable to the judgment debtor where the debt garnished was exempt, as the monthly wages of the head of a family, and the garnishee fails to suggest the claim of exemption. City of Laurel v. Turner, 80 Miss. 530, 31 So. 965, 1902 Miss. LEXIS 281 (Miss. 1902).
      </p>
      <p>
       The price due a contractor for building a house, although he may do some unascertained portion of the work himself, is not wages within the meaning of this section [Code 1942, § 307]. Heard v. Crum, 73 Miss. 157, 18 So. 934, 1895 Miss. LEXIS 121 (Miss. 1895).
      </p>
      <p>
       The exemption of the wages of a laborer, being the head of a family, was designed for the protection of the debtor’s family and cannot be given a construction that would defeat its beneficent purpose. Hence, while the laborer being the head of a family and working for wages at eighty-one dollars per month, payable monthly, he is entitled to demand and receive his wages as they fall due monthly, notwithstanding the garnishment of his employer, and where such garnishment is returnable several months after the services thereof, neither the amount then due, when less than one hundred dollars, nor such other wages as the debtor may earn during the interval preceeding judgment under the same contract with garnishee, can be subjected by a writ of garnishment and the garnishee should be discharged. Chapman v. Berry, 73 Miss. 437, 18 So. 918, 1895 Miss. LEXIS 107 (Miss. 1895).
      </p>
      <p>
       The exemption of the wages of a laborer, the head of a family, is not of one hundred dollars yearly or monthly, but exists as often as wages within the amount are sought to be subjected to legal process. Chandler v. White, 71 Miss. 161, 14 So. 454, 1893 Miss. LEXIS 176 (Miss. 1893).
      </p>
      <p>
       The exemption of wages due a laborer who is a citizen of the state, for work done here, cannot be defeated by garnishing the debtor, a railroad company in another state, it having a line of railroad there as well as in this state. Both debtor and creditor being residents of this state, the court will give effect to our exemption laws regardless of the laws of such other state. Illinois C. R. Co. v. Smith, 70 Miss. 344, 12 So. 461, 1892 Miss. LEXIS 129 (Miss. 1892), overruled,
   Southern P. R. Co. v. A. J. Lyon & Co., 99 Miss. 186, 54 So. 728, 1911 Miss. LEXIS 188 (Miss. 1911), overruled in part, Southern P. R. Co. v. A. J. Lyon & Co., 54 So. 784 (Miss. 1911).
      </p>
      <p>
       The “laborer” whose wages to the amount of one hundred dollars are exempt from garnishment, is one who subsists by physical toil in distinction from one who subsists by professional skill. Where physical toil is the main ingredient of services rendered, although directed and made more valuable by skill, the person performing it is a laborer within the meaning of the statute. Williams v. Link, 64 Miss. 641, 1 So. 907, 1887 Miss. LEXIS 85 (Miss. 1887).
      </p>
      <p>

      If any sheriff or other officer shall levy or be about to levy an execution or attachment on any personal property claimed as exempt, and a doubt shall arise as to the liability of the property to be sold, he may demand of the plaintiff a bond, with sufficient sureties, payable to such officer, in a sufficient penalty, conditioned to indemnify and save harmless the officer against all damages which he may sustain in consequence of the seizure or sale of the property, and to pay the defendant all damages which he may sustain in consequence of the seizure or sale; and if such bond be not given, after reasonable notice, in writing, from the officer to the plaintiff, his agent or attorney, that it is required, the officer may refuse to levy, or, having levied, may dismiss the levy; but if the required bond be given, the officer shall seize and sell or dispose of the property according to the command of the process in his hands, and shall return the bond with the execution or attachment. If an officer shall seize personal property exempt from execution, he shall be liable to an action at the suit of the owner for all damages sustained thereby, unless he have taken an indemnifying bond.

       The fact that the proceeds of federal war risk insurance and adjusted compensation due a deceased veteran’s estate were exempt property did not avail a surety on an administratrix’s bond to secure the proper administration of a veteran’s estate to escape liability on the ground that such property was no part of the estate to be administered and that therefore the sureties on her bond would not be liable for her misconduct in dissipating the estate, since the appointment and qualifications of an administrator were necessary to collect such funds.

       Homestead exemption provision is intended to protect entire family from misfortunes or imprudence of primary breadwinner, and is not dependent on breadwinner’s continued status as homeowner or on his or her intention to acquire another homestead with proceeds; it is intended to protect home from forced sale and to protect debtor’s property from creditors to provide source of revenue for support of breadwinner and family. In re Williamson, 844 F.2d 1166, 1988 U.S. App. LEXIS 6404 (5th Cir. Miss. 1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       Husband may convey homestead to wife regardless of his intention toward creditors, because conveyance of homestead does not “defraud” creditors; homestead is exempt from creditors irrespective of conveyance. Joe T. Dehmer Distributors, Inc. v. Temple, 826 F.2d 1463, 1987 U.S. App. LEXIS 12486 (5th Cir. Miss. 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       Judgment based on division of community property is debt subject to homestead exemption like any other; however, judgment will defeat exemption to extent that judgment creditor shows it to be based on child support. Pickle v. Pickle, 476 So. 2d 32, 1985 Miss. LEXIS 2244 (Miss. 1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       Judgments do not constitute a lien until enrolled; additionally, the homestead exemption in effect at the time judgments are enrolled is applicable in an action to foreclose judgment liens on property sold under a deed of trust, despite the fact that the amount of the homestead exemption is subsequently increased. Hall v. Panola County Bank, 412 So. 2d 238, 1982 Miss. LEXIS 1920 (Miss. 1982).
      </p>
      <p>
       One does not own homestead rights in property unless he has some legal right to its possession. McGee v. Chickasaw County School Board, 239 Miss. 5, 120 So. 2d 778, 1960 Miss. LEXIS 260 (Miss. 1960).
      </p>
      <p>
       A tort action does not come within the constitutional provision prohibiting impairment of existing contracts, and statute increasing the homestead exemption could properly be applied to judgment which was rendered after the passage of the act, even though the cause of action arose before the statute was passed. Odom v. Luehr, 226 Miss. 661, 85 So. 2d 218, 1956 Miss. LEXIS 446 (Miss. 1956).
      </p>
      <p>
       Statutes granting homestead exemption are entitled to be liberally construed. Daily v. Gulfport, 212 Miss. 361, 54 So. 2d 485, 1951 Miss. LEXIS 457 (Miss. 1951); Biggs v. Roberts, 237 Miss. 406, 115 So. 2d 151, 1959 Miss. LEXIS 485 (Miss. 1959).
      </p>
      <p>
       Neither the cases dealing only with urban property and those dealing with an urban tract and a rural tract as constituting together one homestead are applicable to a case where rural lands are involved. Horton v. Horton, 210 Miss. 116, 48 So. 2d 850, 1950 Miss. LEXIS 328 (Miss. 1950).
      </p>
      <p>
       Exemption laws are construed liberally in favor of the owner of the property exempted. Bank of Myrtle v. Garrison, 183 Miss. 526, 184 So. 291, 1938 Miss. LEXIS 265 (Miss. 1938).
      </p>
      <p>
       Homestead exemption would prevent declaration of lien on homestead land for debts which occupants themselves owed as well as debts of others. Jones v. Lamensdorf, 175 Miss. 565, 167 So. 624, 1936 Miss. LEXIS 62 (Miss. 1936).
      </p>
      <p>
       The homestead right being a favored one in law, whenever there is serious doubt as to whether the property is or is not a homestead, the doubt should be resolved in favor of the exemptionist, sustaining, instead of defeating, the estate, which is created by sound public policy. Levis-Zukoski Mercantile Co. v. McIntyre, 93 Miss. 806, 47 So. 435, 1908 Miss. LEXIS 140 (Miss. 1908).
      </p>
      <p>
       The homestead is the preservation of the family mansion and a certain quantity of land pertaining thereto to the debtor and his family as a place of residence; The policy of the law is that the family should enjoy the property as a home, contributing to their support, and if the debtor or some member of the family do not occupy the premises as a homestead, exemption ceases. Acker v. Trueland, 56 Miss. 30, 1878 Miss. LEXIS 37 (Miss. 1878).
      </p>
      <p>
       The statute increasing exemptions is inapplicable as to existing creditors. Lessley v. Phipps, 49 Miss. 790, 1874 Miss. LEXIS 14 (Miss. 1874).
      </p>
      <p>
       The term “land,” in this statute, embraces a leasehold estate. Johnson v. Richardson, 33 Miss. 462, 1857 Miss. LEXIS 62 (Miss. 1857); McGrath v. Sinclair, 55 Miss. 89, 1877 Miss. LEXIS 109 (Miss. 1877); King v. Sturges, 56 Miss. 606, 1879 Miss. LEXIS 173 (Miss. 1879).

       Householder need not own, and thus need not sell, both land and buildings to qualify for exemption in proceeds so long as property sold was used for homestead purposes; and fact that householder and his family continued to live on land as lessees does not make householder ineligible for homestead exemption. In re Williamson, 844 F.2d 1166, 1988 U.S. App. LEXIS 6404 (5th Cir. Miss. 1988).

   The language of Mississippi Code §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t85c03s85-3-25" target="_self">85-3-25</a></cite> indicates that a homestead declaration is voluntary and not mandatory. Shows v. Watkins, 485 So. 2d 288, 1986 Miss. LEXIS 2380 (Miss. 1986).

       It is not absolutely necessary for the husband to acquire the property by inheritance in order to be entitled to claim it as a homestead. Biggs v. Roberts, 237 Miss. 406, 115 So. 2d 151, 1959 Miss. LEXIS 485 (Miss. 1959).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where at the time the husband conveyed property to his wife the parties and their children were residing on the property and had been for a number of years, no new home had been acquired by the husband, and, after the husband had left the city, the wife and the children continued to occupy the property, the property was the homestead of the parties, and the husband had a right to convey to his wife the extent and value of the homestead regardless of his intention toward his creditors. Howell v. General Contract Corp., 229 Miss. 687, 91 So. 2d 831, 1957 Miss. LEXIS 315 (Miss. 1957).
      </p>
      <p>
       The statute does not require the actual utilization of every acre of land in a tract before it can be claimed as a homestead. Daily v. Gulfport, 212 Miss. 361, 54 So. 2d 485, 1951 Miss. LEXIS 457 (Miss. 1951).
      </p>
      <p>
       Occupancy coupled with residence, citizenship, and status of being head of family perfects right so that it cannot be defeated because children remained at school when father removed. Roberts v. Thomas, 94 Miss. 219, 48 So. 408, 1908 Miss. LEXIS 46 (Miss. 1908).
      </p>
      <p>
       Land, always occupied as homestead by claimant except for about 6 weeks when she lived with her husband on his father’s place, was her homestead, although after separating from husband she rented part of land for one year and stayed elsewhere at night but kept one room of the house and a horse and other animals on the land. Levis-Zukoski Mercantile Co. v. McIntyre, 93 Miss. 806, 47 So. 435, 1908 Miss. LEXIS 140 (Miss. 1908).
      </p>
      <p>
       A decree in equity adjudging a conveyance from a husband to his wife, fraudulent as to the creditors of the husband, and directing a sale of the land to pay the debts, does not preclude the husband from moving upon the land with his family and making it his homestead; and if he make it his homestead after the rendition of the decree, it will cease to be liable to sale thereunder. Dulion v. Harkness, 80 Miss. 8, 31 So. 416, 1902 Miss. LEXIS 216 (Miss. 1902).
      </p>
      <p>
       If one has two tracts of land, either of which he might claim as his homestead, and convey one, he will be held to have selected the other as his homestead. Rutherford v. Jamieson, 65 Miss. 219, 3 So. 412, 1887 Miss. LEXIS 41 (Miss. 1887).
      </p>
      <p>
       A tenancy at will of a forty-acre tract containing the dwelling, is sufficient to carry the exemption of a detached forty acres owned in fee and cultivated. King v. Sturges, 56 Miss. 606, 1879 Miss. LEXIS 173 (Miss. 1879); Parisot v. Tucker, 65 Miss. 439, 4 So. 113, 1888 Miss. LEXIS 14 (Miss. 1888).
      </p>
      <p>
       Actual residence and occupation of the land as a home by the family is essential to give it the character of a homestead; after it has acquired that status, literal or actual residence is not required. Campbell v. Adair, 45 Miss. 170, 1871 Miss. LEXIS 64 (Miss. 1871); Hand v. Winn, 52 Miss. 784, 1876 Miss. LEXIS 292 (Miss. 1876).

       In an action to determine the validity of a deed to property alleged to be homestead in which grantor’s wife did not join, where the evidence showed that the tract in controversy and a non-contiguous tract upon which grantor’s dwelling was located were both used for timber, it was error for the chancellor to hold that the land in controversy was not homestead property, even though he found that the value of the other tract, upon which the dwelling house was situated, was in excess of the valuation mentioned in the homestead statute. Hendry v. Hendry, 300 So. 2d 147, 1974 Miss. LEXIS 1614 (Miss. 1974).

       Mere occupancy of land under a deed which confers no title will not support a claim for homestead exemption; Nor can a widow derive any homestead right from her husband who, with her, occupied at his death as tenant at will the land which he conveyed to others.

       Executrix did not waive the homestead exemption by entering into a contractual relationship with the Mississippi Division of Medicaid on behalf of a decedent because the record did not support the idea that the decedent had any knowledge of the benefits a homestead exemption provided, nor that he intentionally waived his right to the benefit of that exemption since the contract did not provide any information pertaining to, or even mention, the significance of any exemption; there was no evidence of the decedent’s intent to waive any of his rights because by entering into the contract, the decedent merely acknowledged Medicaid as a creditor of his estate, which estate had no property against which Medicaid could recover.

   The language of Mississippi Code §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t85c03s85-3-25" target="_self">85-3-25</a></cite> indicates that a homestead declaration is voluntary and not mandatory. Shows v. Watkins, 485 So. 2d 288, 1986 Miss. LEXIS 2380 (Miss. 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       A rural homesteader should ordinarily be entitled to as much as 160 acres for homestead purposes if such an amount of his land is so located as to be truly susceptible of being devoted to homestead purposes as a unit, and without giving the homestead laws an unreasonable application for the protection of the homesteader in that behalf. Horton v. Horton, 210 Miss. 116, 48 So. 2d 850, 1950 Miss. LEXIS 328 (Miss. 1950).
      </p>
      <p>
       The provisions of this section [Code 1942, § 319] authorizing the filing of a declaration of homestead are prospective, and can have no application in cases of debts contracted before the code became operative. Hinds v. Morgan, 75 Miss. 509, 23 So. 35, 1897 Miss. LEXIS 130 (Miss. 1898).

       The husband, as head of the family, may bind the wife by his selection of a homestead if it is in good faith and not for the purpose of defeating her rights. Biglane v. Rawls, 247 Miss. 226, 153 So. 2d 665, 1963 Miss. LEXIS 295 (Miss. 1963).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where grantor of the timber rights in tract exceeding one hundred sixty acres, to the deed for which timber his wife was not a party, failed to make a declaration of homestead or to petition the court for a designation of homestead, neither such grantor nor the court had the right to fix the allotment of the exempt homestead, the proper procedure in such case being an allotment by commissioners appointed by the court. Robert G. Bruce Co. v. Spears, 181 Miss. 786, 181 So. 333, 1938 Miss. LEXIS 119 (Miss. 1938).
      </p>
      <p>
       Though a declaration as to a homestead as provided by statute and declaration’s recordation are not required in all cases, it is convenient form of giving notice of purpose to return, though parties may not be actually residing thereon.

       Intention to occupy, coupled with placing of furniture on premises, insufficient to create exemption in absence of declaration. Chrismand v. Mauldin, 130 Miss. 259, 94 So. 1, 1922 Miss. LEXIS 200 (Miss. 1922).
      </p>
      <p>
       A husband who has made a homestead declaration on record designating land of greater value than three thousand dollars, may convey a part thereof before revoking the declaration without his wife’s joinder where the remainder of the land equals or exceeds said sum. Nixon v. Hewes, 80 Miss. 88, 31 So. 899, 1902 Miss. LEXIS 266 (Miss. 1902).
      </p>
      <p>
       The right to select by a statutory declaration belongs solely to the owner of the lands, and where a husband dies without making a selection of homestead by such declaration, the widow has no right to select, but may have an allotment of a homestead as provided by statute (Code 1942, § 323). Wiseman v. Parker, 73 Miss. 378, 19 So. 102, 1895 Miss. LEXIS 133 (Miss. 1895).

       Neither the cases dealing only with urban property nor those dealing with an urban tract and a rural tract as constituting together one homestead are applicable to a case where rural lands are involved. Horton v. Horton, 210 Miss. 116, 48 So. 2d 850, 1950 Miss. LEXIS 328 (Miss. 1950).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a decedent resided on one tract of land and used such tract with another as a farm unit which consisted of less than 160 acres, the widow was entitled to claim both parcels of land as a homestead although they were not contiguous. Horton v. Horton, 210 Miss. 116, 48 So. 2d 850, 1950 Miss. LEXIS 328 (Miss. 1950).

       One claiming city residence as homestead may not also claim 80-acre tract about two and one-half miles from city residence, although value of both does not exceed exemption allowed. Nye v. Winborn, 120 Miss. 1, 81 So. 644, 1919 Miss. LEXIS 57 (Miss. 1919).
      </p>
      <p>
       If a homesteader lives on a forty-acre tract of land leased by him adjoining that to which he has title, and his farm is in part on both tracts, he may claim an exemption; but the homestead must be laid off just as if he owned the tract on which he resides.

       In an action to determine the validity of a deed to property alleged to be homestead in which grantor’s wife did not joint, where the evidence showed that the tract in controversy and a non-contiguous tract upon which grantor’s dwelling was located were both used for timber, it was error for the chancellor to hold that the land in controversy was not homestead property, even though he found that the value of the other tract upon which the dwelling house was situated was in excess of the valuation mentioned in the homestead statute.

       In a proceeding to distribute the surplus fund remaining after a foreclosure sale of real property, the trial court erred in concluding that the defaulting landowners were entitled to a $15,000 homestead exemption where all but one of their creditors had obtained and enrolled judgments against them prior to the effective date of the law increasing the homestead exemption from $5,000 to $15,000; nor did the increased exemption apply to the remaining creditor where its claim was pending on the effective date of the new law.

       For a judgment debtor to avail himself of the rule that he may successfully interpose his claim of exemption as against the execution creditor at any time before sale under the execution if the debtor has actually got into the occupancy or reoccupancy of the land as a homestead at the time of the sale, the occupancy must be such as will stamp the place claimed as a homestead with the character then and there of an actual and permanent residence of the debtor and his family, and it is not sufficient that it has been made a mere part time lodging place, while the real residence of the family remains elsewhere. Bank of Cruger v. Hodge, 189 Miss. 356, 198 So. 26, 1940 Miss. LEXIS 129 (Miss. 1940).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section [Code 1942, § 328] allows only a removal which may be justly adjudged as temporary and requires a speedy return as soon as the cause of the absence can be removed. Bank of Cruger v. Hodge, 189 Miss. 356, 198 So. 26, 1940 Miss. LEXIS 129 (Miss. 1940).
      </p>
      <p>
       Homestead laws are to be liberally construed in favor of debtor; there is no abandonment unless it is clear that exemptionist moved from homestead with intention of not returning. Jackson v. Coleman, 115 Miss. 535, 76 So. 545, 1917 Miss. LEXIS 230 (Miss. 1917).
      </p>

       Ceasing to reside on a homestead renders it liable to debts, unless the removal be temporary by reason of casualty or necessity and with the purpose of speedily reoccupying. Moore v. Bradford, 70 Miss. 70, 11 So. 630, 1892 Miss. LEXIS 60 (Miss. 1892).
      </p>
      <p>
       The word “casualty” refers to accident, while “necessity” may embrace considerations of health, or travel, or public business, or private business emergency of an exceptional and temporary character. Thompson, Lampkin & Co. v. Tillotson, 56 Miss. 36, 1878 Miss. LEXIS 38 (Miss. 1878).

       One may claim homestead exemption only in property owned and occupied as residence, and husband abandoned homestead rights when he voluntarily left property without intent to return. Joe T. Dehmer Distributors, Inc. v. Temple, 826 F.2d 1463, 1987 U.S. App. LEXIS 12486 (5th Cir. Miss. 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       75-year old homeowner was not divested of his rights to claim homestead exemption by virtue of his conviction for murder and sentence of life imprisonment, despite claim that he was not entitled to the exemption because he had no legal right to occupy the property and that by voluntarily murdering victim he had abandoned any claim to homestead that he would otherwise have. Roberts v. Grisham, 493 So. 2d 940, 1986 Miss. LEXIS 2588 (Miss. 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a husband and wife, having occupied certain property as their homestead, acquired new property intending to live there permanently and make it their homestead, and moved to the new property, vacating the old homestead, the former homestead was not exempt from the claim of a creditor, and the proceeds of the sale of the former homestead which took place 2 weeks after the move to the new property, were not exempt. Patterson v. Adams, 245 So. 2d 13, 1971 Miss. LEXIS 1348 (Miss. 1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       The test whether the husband abandoned any homestead rights under statutes invalidating conveyance of the homestead is whether the husband had abandoned the conjugal relation with his wife and the occupancy of the property, but the wrongful ouster of the spouse does not constitute a wilful abandonment; and if a spouse voluntarily separates from the other and abandons the intention of living with him or her through no fault of the latter, he or she has abandoned any homestead rights. Etheridge v. Webb, 210 Miss. 729, 50 So. 2d 603, 1951 Miss. LEXIS 310 (Miss. 1951).
      </p>
      <p>
       An abandonment of a homestead may be obtained by a free and voluntary separation of the parties and the test is whether the husband was away from the homestead with the mature intention not to return to it. Etheridge v. Webb, 210 Miss. 729, 50 So. 2d 603, 1951 Miss. LEXIS 310 (Miss. 1951).

      <p>
       Evidence that decedent had formerly lived on land, but had ceased to do so for several months before his death, was insufficient to establish homestead. Wright v. Wright, 160 Miss. 235, 134 So. 197, 1931 Miss. LEXIS 202 (Miss. 1931).
      </p>
      <p>
       Confinement in jail is not abandonment of homestead. Lindsey v. Holly, 105 Miss. 740, 63 So. 222, 1913 Miss. LEXIS 257 (Miss. 1913).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the exemptionist abandons a rural homestead and acquires another in town, but finally abandons the latter with the intention of reoccupying the country home, but is prevented by protracted sickness which ended in death, the country home becomes revested with its homestead character and is exempt from his debts. Ross v. Porter, 72 Miss. 361, 16 So. 906, 1894 Miss. LEXIS 122 (Miss. 1894).

      <p>
       Absence of seven years occasioned by economic depression and necessity of head of family securing employment elsewhere, with the intention to return when he should earn sufficient money to farm the homestead, constituted an abandonment of homestead where it appeared that the obstacle to returning might never be removed. Bank of Cruger v. Hodge, 189 Miss. 356, 198 So. 26, 1940 Miss. LEXIS 129 (Miss. 1940).
      </p>

       Land, always occupied as homestead by claimant except for about six weeks when she lived with her husband on his father’s place, was her homestead although after separating from husband she rented part of land for one year and stayed elsewhere at night but kept one room of the house and a horse and other animals on the land. Levis-Zukoski Mercantile Co. v. McIntyre, 93 Miss. 806, 47 So. 435, 1908 Miss. LEXIS 140 (Miss. 1908).

       Trust deed executed by husband on 63-acre tract was not void on ground that tract constituted a “homestead” where, though tract had formerly been a homestead, husband and wife at time of execution of trust deed lived on a 188-acre tract to which they held title subject to a trust deed, and where removal from 63-acre tract was not occasioned by any casualty or necessity, and there was nothing to indicate that at time of removal there was any intention to return. Ritter v. Whitesides, 179 Miss. 706, 176 So. 728, 1937 Miss. LEXIS 81 (Miss. 1937).
      </p>
      <p>
       Recital by husband in trust deed executed by him alone, that land involved was no part of his homestead, was sufficient evidence of his selection of new homestead, when he and wife were, in fact, occupying other land for living purposes, and recordation of such trust deed prevented the parties from acquiring any but subordinate rights in the land. Ritter v. Whitesides, 179 Miss. 706, 176 So. 728, 1937 Miss. LEXIS 81 (Miss. 1937).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where husband at time of separation from wife removed from their homestead without intention to return, he thereby abandoned his and his wife’s homestead rights therein, though wife remained in possession under color of deed given in settlement of claims for support. Lewis v. Ladner, 177 Miss. 473, 168 So. 281, 172 So. 312, 1936 Miss. LEXIS 230 (Miss. 1936).
      </p>
      <p>
       That wife remained in occupancy of homestead abandoned by husband was immaterial as to existence of homestead rights, where by agreeing to a marital separation she consented to his removal. Lewis v. Ladner, 177 Miss. 473, 168 So. 281, 172 So. 312, 1936 Miss. LEXIS 230 (Miss. 1936).

      </p>
      <p>
       Moving from homestead to conduct a boarding house in a near-by town with borrowed money secured by mortgage on the homestead was abandonment thereof, although the owner intended to return if she failed to pay for the place moved to.

       Conveyance of a homestead by the husband alone in settlement of a claim for labor is governed by Code 1906, § 2159 [Code 1942, § 330] and not by Code 1906, § 2156 [Code 1942, § 327]. Chatman v. Poindexter, 101 Miss. 496, 58 So. 361, 1911 Miss. LEXIS 163 (Miss. 1911).

       A debt for labor performed in the lifetime of a deceased debtor whose estate is insolvent may, on proper proceedings in the chancery court, after its allowance as to amount by said court, be enforced against the exempt property of his estate, although not reduced to judgment and therefore not within the letter of the statute.

   Where a decedent died leaving no surviving spouse, child or grandchild, the homestead exemption expired with her death and was not valid as against unpaid claims against her estate, even though the decedent left a will devising her previously exempt homestead property to her ex-husband; the specific language of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.91.html#t91c01s91-1-21" target="_blank">91-1-21</a></cite> does not continue a decedent’s homestead exemption for anyone other than a surviving spouse, children or grandchildren, and consequently there was no exemptionist who could defeat the claim against the estate’s homestead property. Matter of Memorial Hosp. v. Franzke (In re Estate of Franzke), 634 So. 2d 117, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 132 (Miss. 1994).

       The policy of the section [Code 1942, § 329] is to free the exempt property from forfeiture to creditors if the debtor sell it; The words “disposed of” are very broad, and include any of the modes by which title may be transmitted.

      <p>
       Where a homestead is sold by a sale in which the reasonable price paid for the homestead provides no surplus above the amount of the homestead exemption and prior encumbrances, a lien does not follow the property and the proceeds of the sale are exempt. McMillan v. Aru, 773 So. 2d 355, 2000 Miss. App. LEXIS 177 (Miss. Ct. App. 2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       A lien that predates the sale of a homestead does not become effective if seller leaves the residence before the deed is recorded; once the debtor has executed a deed, there is neither statutory command nor equitable basis for the creditor to gain some advantage because the debtor then moves prior to the filing of the instrument. McMillan v. Aru, 773 So. 2d 355, 2000 Miss. App. LEXIS 177 (Miss. Ct. App. 2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       Owners who sell a homestead that has judgment liens filed against it must not by the date of sale have established a new homestead; if the homestead owner has not abandoned the old home and made a full-time residence at a new one prior to the date that a deed is executed, the exemption still exists; thus, this section countenances the normal process of selling property, with extra care needing to be shown by the seller not to establish a new homestead until the time that the conveyance is made. McMillan v. Aru, 773 So. 2d 355, 2000 Miss. App. LEXIS 177 (Miss. Ct. App. 2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       Under the statute, the proceeds of a voluntary sale of a homestead are exempt under all circumstances, regardless of the vendor’s continuing to be a householder, or his acquiring another homestead, or the intent with which he keeps the proceeds. Davis v. Lammons, 246 Miss. 624, 151 So. 2d 907, 1963 Miss. LEXIS 487 (Miss. 1963).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where, at the time the husband conveyed real property to his wife, the parties and their children were residing on the property and had been for a number of years, no new home had been acquired by the husband, and, after the husband had left the city, the wife and the children continued to occupy the property, the property was the homestead of the parties, and the husband had a right to convey to his wife the extent and value of the homestead regardless of his intention toward his creditors. Howell v. General Contract Corp., 229 Miss. 687, 91 So. 2d 831, 1957 Miss. LEXIS 315 (Miss. 1957).
      </p>
      <p>
       Judgment lien does not attach to exempt homestead, and exemptionist can convey homestead unaffected by enrolled judgment. De Bardeleben Coal Corp. v. Parker, 164 Miss. 728, 144 So. 474, 1932 Miss. LEXIS 245 (Miss. 1932).
      </p>

       Where homestead, at time of conveyance, was occupied as such, judgment lien did not extend to it and did not attach thereto when exemptionist moved. De Bardeleben Coal Corp. v. Parker, 164 Miss. 728, 144 So. 474, 1932 Miss. LEXIS 245 (Miss. 1932).

       Attempt of wife to convey homestead without joinder of husband did not subject it to liability for her debts. Levis-Zukoski Mercantile Co. v. McIntyre, 93 Miss. 806, 47 So. 435, 1908 Miss. LEXIS 140 (Miss. 1908).

       A husband who had been an exemptioner did not lose his right to exemption by a sale of the property after the death of his wife at a time when he was over sixty years of age, nor did the fact that he reacquired the homestead on a rescission of the contract for the sale of the land affect his right to exemption.

       Statute relating to settlement or compromise in cases of joint or joint and several indebtedness is intended to encourage plaintiffs to pursue their claims, while at the same time creating an atmosphere ripe for settlement.

       Under Mississippi law, nonsettling defendant, which was found 50% liable for patient’s death in medical malpractice action, was responsible for $100,000 of $200,000 verdict and was not entitled to credit for $650,000 settlement which plaintiff had reached during trial with another defendant; crediting nonsettling defendant with settlement would undermine intention of jury to hold nonsettling defendant accountable and would violate public policy. Krieser v. Baptist Mem. Hospital-North Miss., 984 F. Supp. 463, 1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20585 (N.D. Miss. 1997), aff'd, in part, modified, 166 F.3d 736, 1999 U.S. App. LEXIS 1642 (5th Cir. Miss. 1999).

       Trial court’s finding that the city was 100 % liable for driver’s injuries, caused when the driver was involved in a motor vehicle accident with a police car during a pursuit, was supported by sufficient evidence, including testimony that the police car did not have its lights or sirens on when entering the intersection.

   Mississippi law does not require apportionment of fault, Miss. Code. Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t85c05s85-5-7ol11" target="_self">85-5-7(1)</a></cite>, (7), to a plaintiff absent evidence sufficient to show, at least, negligence on the plaintiff’s part, Miss.

      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Trial court improperly apportioned liability in a case in which a lessor sought to recover for damages to his building in a construction accident, finding the lessee 50 percent at fault, a general contractor 30 percent at fault, and a sub-contractor 20 percent at fault under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t85c05s85-5-7" target="_self">85-5-7</a></cite>; the trial court improperly found that the lessee negligently performed its duties as architect because the construction contract was silent as to the duties of an architect and, absent a delineation of such duties, no duty to warn could be imputed to the lessee. Family Dollar Stores of Miss., Inc. v. Montgomery, 946 So. 2d 426, 2006 Miss. App. LEXIS 929 (Miss. Ct. App. 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Where a mother filed suit against a school district and a bus driver to recover damages after the mother’s child was hit by a school bus, Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t85c05s85-5-7ol17" target="_self">85-5-7(7)</a></cite> did not apply because the case did not involve joint tortfeasors; hence, the trial court did not err in failing to allocate fault to the mother because the mother had dropped the child off for school across the street from the school. Jackson Pub. Sch. Dist. v. Smith, 875 So. 2d 1100, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 598 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court properly applied a credit against judgment for amount received in settlement from entities not party to the litigation because the case involved multiple defendants, all alleged to have acted purposely and in concert to injure a customer by depriving him of the rightful possession of his vehicle and forcing him into a situation where he felt compelled to purchase a replacement vehicle on terms he could not afford. Brown v. N. Jackson Nissan, Inc., 856 So. 2d 692, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 891 (Miss. Ct. App. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Pursuant to the Mississippi Supreme Court, Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t85c05s85-5-7" target="_self">85-5-7</a></cite> provides for contribution only in cases where a joint judgment is obtained among the parties. Travelers Prop. &amp; Cas. Co. v. City of Greenwood Fire Dep't, 441 F. Supp. 2d 776, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 53914 (N.D. Miss. 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       Though the Mississippi Department of Transportation was not immune from suit, as the trial court properly found that a five to six inch drop-off on the shoulder of a road was a dangerous condition that was not obvious, which was created by the negligence of the Department and of which the Department knew but failed to warn against, the trial court erred by not assessing some degree of fault to plaintiff driver, who had been obliged to exercise vigilant caution when she learned the road was under construction. Miss. DOT v. Trosclair, 851 So. 2d 408, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 666 (Miss. Ct. App. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Allocation of fault to immune employers is consistent with Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t85c05s85-5-7" target="_self">85-5-7</a></cite> and is required, provided that they are not held liable for damages. Mack Trucks, Inc. v. Tackett, 841 So. 2d 1107, 2003 Miss. LEXIS 135 (Miss. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   To the extent that Accu-Fab &amp; Construction, Inc. v. Ladner, 778 So. 2d 766 (Miss. 2001), may be construed as stating that immune parties may not be assessed fault (as opposed to liability) under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t85c05s85-5-7" target="_self">85-5-7</a></cite>, that opinion is overruled. Mack Trucks, Inc. v. Tackett, 841 So. 2d 1107, 2003 Miss. LEXIS 135 (Miss. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a wrongful death action, the trial court erred by allocating the defendants’ liability for the fault attributed to an immune employer as well as their joint and several liability to reach the 50 percent goal proportionately in accordance with the jury allocation of fault to them respectively. Mack Trucks, Inc. v. Tackett, 841 So. 2d 1107, 2003 Miss. LEXIS 135 (Miss. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   The trial court erred in applying Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t85c05s85-5-7ol12" target="_self">85-5-7(2)</a></cite>-(3) (1999) as the statute abolished joint and several liability when a defendant was more than 50 percent liable, and the driver and the manufacturer were found to be 54 percent liable. Classic Coach, Inc. v. Johnson, 823 So. 2d 517, 2002 Miss. LEXIS 243 (Miss. 2002), amended, 2003 Miss. LEXIS 81 (Miss. Feb. 20, 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court erroneously instructed the jury to allocate fault to a statutory employer, and the settlement reached in a wrongful death/product liability case should not have been credited before the proportionate damage amounts were calculated respecting the non-settling defendants. Yale Materials Handling Corp. v. Brandon, 2002 Miss. LEXIS 180 (Miss. May 23, 2002), dismissed, op. withdrawn, 2003 Miss. LEXIS 21 (Miss. Jan. 16, 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Because an employer and an employee were to be considered one defendant when the liability was caused by the employee, as provided by Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t85c05s85-5-7ol13" target="_self">85-5-7(3)</a></cite>, it was not reversible error for a jury instruction not to allow the jury to apportion fault between those parties pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t85c05s85-5-7ol17" target="_self">85-5-7(7)</a></cite>; in any event, two jury instructions taken together gave the jury an opportunity to find for those parties if it was so inclined. Coho Res., Inc. v. McCarthy, 829 So. 2d 1, 2002 Miss. LEXIS 208 (Miss. 2002).
      </p>
      <p>
       The statute’s apportionment provision only applies to damages incurred due to negligence; the statute does not apply to a breach of contract. Cooper Indus. v. Tarmac Roofing Sys., 276 F.3d 704, 2002 U.S. App. LEXIS 173 (5th Cir. Miss. 2002).
      </p>
      <p>
       The collective joint and several liability of all defendants contributing to a loss is 50 percent; in other words, the statute does not authorize a prevailing plaintiff to recover 50 percent of his award from each defendant. Narkeeta Timber Co. v. Jenkins, 777 So. 2d 39, 2000 Miss. LEXIS 235 (Miss. 2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       Any tortfeasor, even absent ones, that contributed to the injury at issue must be considered by the jury when apportioning fault. Peterson v. Ladner, 785 So. 2d 290, 2000 Miss. App. LEXIS 531 (Miss. Ct. App. 2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       Responsibility may not be allocated between intentional and negligent participants in the events that caused injury; the statute does not contemplate that a willful contribution to an injury be allocated just as is negligence. Dawson v. Townsend & Sons, Inc., 735 So. 2d 1131, 1999 Miss. App. LEXIS 315 (Miss. Ct. App. 1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       Participants in an event who for some reason are not joined in the litigation, so-called “phantom defendants,” can nonetheless have their portion of fault assigned to them; a jury may not be instructed to consider only the parties actually sued, else the defendants who are present have been unfairly denied the benefits of the system of comparative fault. Dawson v. Townsend & Sons, Inc., 735 So. 2d 1131, 1999 Miss. App. LEXIS 315 (Miss. Ct. App. 1999).

       The term “fault,” as used in subsection (1), does not include intentional torts; thus, in an action against a store for injuries sustained in a crime which was allegedly caused by its failure to provide adequate security in its parking lot, the store’s percentage of fault was 100 percent since the persons who committed the crime had no “fault.” Whitehead v.

   Grant of summary judgment in favor of the other driver in the passenger’s negligence action for injuries that she received in a car accident was inappropriate because an oral surgeon’s testimony was admissible; he testified that his opinion was based on his knowledge, skill, experience, training, and education as an orthopedic surgeon and his testimony was sufficient to establish the element of proximate cause and was admissible for the jury to consider in the apportionment of damages. The other driver, as the driver of the second car to hit the vehicle in which the passenger was riding, was responsible only for the amount of the passenger’s damages that were based on his fault allocated by the jury in accord with Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t85c05s85-5-7" target="_self">85-5-7</a></cite>. Lopez v. McClellan, 2010 Miss. App. LEXIS 214 (Miss. Ct. App. Apr. 27, 2010).

   In a products liability action alleging three welding rod manufacturers’ failure to warn, the fact that the professional welder was exposed or overexposed to fumes from welding consumables manufactured by two nonparty manufacturer’s did not affect the legitimacy of the jury’s verdict against the three named manufacturers, as there was no factual or legal requirement that, in order to recover at trial, the harm caused to the professional welder by his exposure to welding fumes be caused only, or even mostly, by the three manufacturers’ products; although the three manufacturers argued to the jury that the presence of the nonparty manufacturers’ welding products in the workplace was relevant to causation, they never asked the court to instruct the jury to allocate fault to the nonparty manufacturers. The three manufacturers certainly knew how to ask for such an allocation, as they cited Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t85c05s85-5-7" target="_self">85-5-7</a></cite> and asked the court to allocate fault to the professional welder’s employer; but whatever their reasons for not seeking allocation of fault against the nonparty manufacturers, there was sufficient evidence at trial that the products manufactured by each of the three manufacturers were a proximate cause of harm to the professional welder, and the fact that the nonparty manufacturers might have proximately caused those same indivisible injuries was not a valid basis for the three manufacturers’ postverdict motion for judgment as a matter of law under Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(b). Jowers v. BOC Group, Inc., 608 F. Supp. 2d 724, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 28806 (S.D. Miss. 2009), vacated, in part, 617 F.3d 346, 2010 U.S. App. LEXIS 17862 (5th Cir. Miss. 2010).

       In a case in which an insurer and a company sought contribution from a fire department for workers’ compensation benefits paid to a career fireman, the fire department’s Fed. R. Civ. P. 12 motion to dismiss was granted because the insurer and the company asserted a cause of action for contribution for workers’ compensation benefits which had long been recognized as not existing under Mississippi law absent a joint judgment among the parties. Travelers Prop. & Cas. Co. v. City of Greenwood Fire Dep't, 441 F. Supp. 2d 776, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 53914 (N.D. Miss. 2006).

       This section was inapplicable to a wrongful death action in which defendant, as one of the alleged tortfeasors, was sued alone. Hood v. Dealers Transport Co., 472 F. Supp. 250, 1979 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12939 (N.D. Miss. 1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       In accordance with the policy established under this section, contribution between joint judgment debtors would be pro rata based upon the number of defendants rather than on the percentage of liability attributable to defendants. Celotex Corp. v. Campbell Roofing & Metal Works, Inc., 352 So. 2d 1316, 1977 Miss. LEXIS 1998 (Miss. 1977).
      </p>
      <p>
       The first paragraph of this section [Code 1942, § 335.5] created a new Mississippi rule that joint tortfeasors are to share equally. Standard Oil Co. v. Illinois C. R. Co., 421 F.2d 201, 1969 U.S. App. LEXIS 9590 (5th Cir. Miss. 1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       The effect of this statute is to create rights which did not exist before and destroyed a valid defense to an action for contribution which was available before the enactment of this statute. Klaas v. Continental Southern Lines, Inc., 225 Miss. 94, 82 So. 2d 705, 1955 Miss. LEXIS 563 (Miss. 1955).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a wrongful death case, a trial court erred in awarding a new trial on the issue of damages because it should not have reallocated fault from an immune employer to an electric company. Entergy Miss., Inc. v. Hayes, 874 So. 2d 952, 2004 Miss. LEXIS 412 (Miss. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a car collision was caused when the driver of a commercial vehicle swerved to avoid hitting an unknown driver, the issue submitted to the jury was whether the commercial driver and his employer were negligent in the operation of the vehicle; because the jury rendered a verdict that defendants were not liable, the jury was not required to answer questions on the verdict form pertaining to the allocation of fault. White v. Stewman, 932 So. 2d 27, 2006 Miss. LEXIS 315 (Miss. 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       The second paragraph of this section [Code 1942, § 335.5] tells how to count the joint tortfeasor defendants who are to share in the contribution. Standard Oil Co. v. Illinois C. R. Co., 421 F.2d 201, 1969 U.S. App. LEXIS 9590 (5th Cir. Miss. 1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       The proviso in the second paragraph of this section [Code 1942, § 335.5] places a ceiling on the liability of a principal or employer so that he (or his insurer) is not exposed to the risk of contributing twice, once for his agent’s wrong and once for his own responsibility imposed by respondeat superior. Standard Oil Co. v. Illinois C. R. Co., 421 F.2d 201, 1969 U.S. App. LEXIS 9590 (5th Cir. Miss. 1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a situation where the proviso set forth in the second paragraph of this section [Code 1942, § 335.5] is inapplicable, the first paragraph of the section requires that the defendants against whom judgment is rendered shall share equally the obligation imposed by the judgment. Standard Oil Co. v. Illinois C. R. Co., 421 F.2d 201, 1969 U.S. App. LEXIS 9590 (5th Cir. Miss. 1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where an agent was not the subject of a judgment entered against his principal, the principal runs no risk of paying twice, and the proviso in the second paragraph of this section [Code 1942, § 335.5] is inapplicable. Standard Oil Co. v. Illinois C. R. Co., 421 F.2d 201, 1969 U.S. App. LEXIS 9590 (5th Cir. Miss. 1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       There is nothing in the statute to indicate that the legislature intended to make the new law apply to judgments rendered before its effective date. Klaas v. Continental Southern Lines, Inc., 225 Miss. 94, 82 So. 2d 705, 1955 Miss. LEXIS 563 (Miss. 1955).
      </p>

       The use of the word “is” in a clause providing that “any action for damages where judgment is rendered against two or more defendants jointly and severally,” although it usually denotes present tense but by reason of the context the meaning of this word appears to have a future signification.

       One insurance company was entitled to contribution from another insurance company where both were liable for accruing interest and cost of litigation, and one would be unjustly enriched if other’s payment were to relieve it of liability; because either insurance company could have been forced to pay entire cost, they had “common liability” for purposes of contribution.

      <p>
       An electric utility company was guilty of active negligence in failing to elevate a power line after it became aware that as a result of the land beneath the line being filled in, the line was dangerously lower than the height required in safety regulations, and the utility was not entitled to noncontractual implied indemnity from an employer, also actively negligent, for damages which the employer suffered as a result of settling with the heirs of an employee who was electrocuted while operating equipment which came in contact with the line. Home Ins. Co. v. Atlas Tank Mfg. Co., 230 So. 2d 549, 1970 Miss. LEXIS 1550 (Miss. 1970).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although there is no right of contribution where the parties are joint tortfeasors or are in pari delicto, parties are not in pari delicto when one party does the act or creates a dangerous situation and the other party is liable because of passive negligence in failing to remedy the defect causing an injury, or because of a nondelegable statutory duty. Bush v. Laurel, 215 So. 2d 256, 1968 Miss. LEXIS 1348 (Miss. 1968).

      <p>
       A city, by law under a nondelegable duty to maintain its streets and sidewalks in a reasonably safe condition, cannot be considered in pari delicto with a contractor who, with the consent of the municipality, dug a ditch into which a pedestrian fell and was injured; and the city was entitled to indemnification from the contractor for all sums which it paid in settlement of the pedestrian’s claim, including court costs and attorneys’ fees.

       In an action by an insurer that had previously unsuccessfully defended its insured in a wrongful death action arising out of an automobile accident, alleging that the gas explosion responsible for the underlying death was caused by a design defect in decedent’s car and seeking to recover a portion of the judgment entered against its insured from defendants, the manufacturer of decedent’s car and the dealership that sold it to him, defendants’ motion to dismiss would be sustained where contribution among joint tortfeasors was available only when judgment was rendered against them jointly and severally and where neither defendant had been a party to the original lawsuit. Hartford Acci. & Indem. Co. v. Mitchell Buick-Pontiac & Equipment Co., 479 F. Supp. 345, 1979 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9268 (N.D. Miss. 1979).

       The settlement by a railroad company with the estate of a petroleum tank truck driver killed in a crossing accident did not constitute a release on the part of the company of its rights against the driver’s estate, thereby releasing the company’s right of contribution under this section [Code 1942, § 335.5] against the driver’s principals.

     <p>
      The owner of a stallion, jackass or bull shall have a lien on each foal begotten by his stallion or jackass, and on each calf begotten by his bull, for the price agreed to be paid therefor, and such lien shall be prior to all other incumbrances on such foal or calf and shall bind the same even in the hands of subsequent purchasers and encumbrancers for a valuable consideration without notice; but the said lien shall expire twelve months after the birth of said foal or calf unless within that time judicial proceedings have been begun to enforce the lien. If the owner shall have falsely represented the breeding, registration, or pedigree of his stallion, jackass or bull, by advertisement or otherwise, he shall not have a lien on the foal begotten by such stallion or jackass, or on the calf of such bull, as against any person who acted under the belief that such representation was true; and, in such case, the owner of the animal shall not have any claim for the service of the stallion, jackass, or bull.

       In a case in which the owner of two multimillion-dollar yachts under construction challenged a lien the unpaid paint supplier established and enforced on the yachts under the Water Craft Seizure Act, summary judgment was properly granted in favor of the owner because privity did not exist between the owner and the paint supplier; the specification of the brand of paint and the painter supplier in the contract between the owner and the independent contractor did not establish privity between the owner and the paint supplier; and the amendment to the master service agreement did not operate retroactively to create privity between the owner and the paint supplier sufficient to create a lien in the paint supplier’s favor.

       A Mississippi court could not adjudicate or judicially establish a mechanic’s lien against a tractor not situated within the boundaries of the state; under state law, a proceeding to establish a mechanic’s lien is a proceeding in rem against the property and not a proceeding in personam, even though the owner must be named as a party to the suit.

       Where the defendant contested the claim of mechanic’s lien on a truck and also objected that the account was not properly itemized, but filed no pleadings questioning the account and the defendant did not follow the statute as to the methods of contesting claims, and the answer of the defendant in effect admitted the correctness of the amount, the defendant waived any objection. Hannan Motor Co. v. Darr, 212 Miss. 870, 56 So. 2d 64, 1952 Miss. LEXIS 320 (Miss. 1952).

       Where purchaser of a car under a retained title contract incurred a bill for repairs which was necessary for preservation and the operation of the automobile and to prevent its deterioration, the mechanic was entitled to enforce a mechanic’s lien which was superior to the rights of the seller who repossessed the car upon a default on the contract.

       In enforcement of laborer’s lien against seed, giving judgment against replevin bond without proof of value of seed is error. McCoy v. Tolar, 128 Miss. 202, 90 So. 628, 1921 Miss. LEXIS 305 (Miss. 1921).

       The surrender of a truck by a garage man does not result in the garage man losing his lien thereon, except as against one deriving title or possession through the owner. Boydstun v. Cook & Co., 238 Miss. 324, 118 So. 2d 354, 1960 Miss. LEXIS 408 (Miss. 1960).

       Where a purchaser of a car under a retained title contract incurred a bill for repairs which was necessary for preservation and the operation of the automobile and to prevent its deterioration, the mechanic was entitled to enforce a mechanic’s lien which was superior to the rights of the seller who repossessed the car upon a default on the contract. Commercial Sec. Co. v. Kriner, 53 So. 2d 92 (Miss. 1951).

       A garageman surrendering possession of a repaired truck to its owner without collecting his repair charges did not lose his lien as against the holder of a deed of trust embracing the truck where there had been no breach of condition or foreclosure of the deed of trust. Watson v. Broadhead, 203 Miss. 142, 33 So. 2d 302, 1948 Miss. LEXIS 241 (Miss. 1948).

       Where machinery and equipment had been in the possession or under the control of one claiming a mechanic’s lien while being repaired, and he surrendered possession thereof to the owner, the lien was retained to the extent that is allowed in cases of liens for purchase money of goods, and was enforceable while the property remained in the hands of the owner, or in the hands of one deriving title or possession through the owner, with notice that the indebtedness represented by the mechanic’s lien was unpaid.

If such property has not been redeemed within five (5) days after the mailing of such certified letter, the person to whom such charges are payable and owing may commence suit in any court of competent jurisdiction, and upon proof of the value of the labor and materials employed in such repairs, manufacture or construction, and that such labor and materials furnished were reasonably necessary to prevent deterioration, permit operation and preserve the property, shall be entitled to judgment against the party for whom such labor was done or materials furnished, with costs, as in other cases, and to a special order for the sale of the property retained in his possession for the payment thereof, with costs, and to an execution, as in other cases, for the residue of what remains unpaid after sale of the property. The proceeds of the sale of such property in excess of the amount needed to pay the judgment and necessary expenses of the procedure required by this section shall be held by the person for a period of six (6) months, and if not reclaimed by the owner thereof within that time shall become the property of the county and be paid over to the chancery clerk of the county in which the sale was held to be deposited into the county general fund, subject however to any rights of recorded lienholders.

      The enforcement of the owner’s lien against an occupant who is in default shall be in accordance with the following:
     </p>
     <p>
      No enforcement action shall be taken by the owner, other than denial of access, as provided for in the rental agreement until the occupant has been in default continuously for a period of fourteen (14) days.
     </p>
     <p>
      During the default period the occupant shall be notified in writing. The notice shall be delivered in person or sent by United States certified mail, return receipt requested, to the last known address of the occupant. Notices shall be deemed delivered when deposited in the United States mail with postage paid. The notice shall include an itemized statement of the owner’s claim showing the sum due at the time of the notice, the date when the sum became due and any other sums that shall accrue. The notice shall also include a demand for payment of the sum due within a specified time not less than fourteen (14) days after the date of the notice, a statement that the contents of the occupant’s lease space are subject to the owner’s lien, the name, street address and telephone number of the owner, or his designated agent, whom the occupant may contact to respond to the notice, a conspicuous statement that unless the claim is paid within the time stated, the personal property will be advertised for public or private sale or will be otherwise disposed of at a specified time and place.
     </p>
     <p>
      After the expiration of the time given in the owner’s notice, the owner shall publish, in legal notices, advertisement of the sale to the highest bidder in a newspaper of general circulation where the self-storage facility is located. The notice shall include the address of the self-storage facility where the personal property is located, and the name of the occupant, and the time, place and manner of the sale.
     </p>
     <p>
      A sale to the highest bidder shall take place not sooner than fifteen (15) days after the publication. If there is no newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the self-storage facility is located, the advertisement shall be posted at least ten (10) days before the date of the sale and in not less than six (6) conspicuous places in the neighborhood where the self-storage facility is located.
     </p>
     <p>
      If no one purchases the property at the sale and if the owner has complied with the foregoing procedures, the owner may otherwise dispose of the property. Any sale or disposition of the personal property shall be held at the self-storage facility or at the nearest suitable place to the place the personal property is held or stored.

     <p>
      Every water well or oil and gas well, and any fixed machinery, gearing or other fixture that may or may not be used or connected therewith, shall be liable for services or construction and the debt shall be a lien thereon. As to oil and gas wells, the operator thereof shall have a lien upon the interest of each nonoperator owner of an interest in the mineral leasehold estate for the nonoperator’s proportionate part of the labor, material and services rendered by the operator or for the operator’s account on behalf of each nonoperator in the drilling, completion, recompletion, reworking or other operations of the oil and gas well. If the structure is a water well, the lien shall extend only to all pumps, pipes, equipment therein and all water well appurtenances. If the structure is an oil or gas well, the lien shall extend to the nonoperator’s interest in the mineral estate and the fixtures and equipment in the producing unit assigned to the well by the State Oil and Gas Board. The lien shall take effect, as to purchasers or encumbrancers for a valuable consideration without notice thereof, only from the time of commencing suit to enforce the lien, or from the time of filing the contract under which the lien arose, or notice thereof, in the office of the clerk of the chancery court, as hereinafter stated; delivery of material to the job is prima facie evidence of its use therein, and use of water from a water well is prima facie evidence of acceptability of the well. In the case of oil and gas wells, the lien shall take effect, as to purchasers or encumbrancers for a valuable consideration without notice thereof, only from the time of filing notice of the lien as provided by Section 85-7-133.

        Amendment Notes —
       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       The 2010 amendment, in the first sentence, inserted “or equipment rented or leased”; in the second and eighth sentences, inserted “rental or lease equipment suppliers”; and in the eighth sentence, inserted “rental or lease equipment supplier’s” and “or rental or lease equipment.”
      </p>
      <p>
       The 2014 amendment rewrote the section, which read: “Every house, building, water well or structure of any kind, and any fixed machinery, gearing or other fixture that may or may not be used or connected therewith, railroad embankment, erected, constructed, altered or repaired, and every subdivision of property or subdivided property which required services, designs or construction in designing or laying out of streets or subdividing or construction of streets, sewerage, water or other utilities to be furnished by the said subdivision or by the various owners or holders or creators of said subdivision or subdivided property or individual lot or lots in connection therewith, whether inside of a municipality or outside thereof, shall be liable for the debt contracted and owing, for labor done or materials furnished or equipment rented or leased, or architectural engineers’ and surveyors’ or contractors’ service rendered about the erection, construction, alteration or repairs thereof; and debt for such services or construction shall be a lien thereon. The architects, engineers, surveyors, laborers, rental or lease equipment suppliers and materialmen and/or contractors who rendered services and constructed the improvements shall have a lien therefor. Further, as to oil and gas wells, the operator thereof shall have such a lien upon the interest of each nonoperator owner of an interest in the mineral leasehold estate for such nonoperator’s proportionate part of such labor, material and services rendered by the operator or for the operator’s account in behalf of each nonoperator in the drilling, completion, recompletion, reworking or other operations of such oil and gas well. If such house, building, structure, or fixture be in a city, town or village, the lien shall extend to and cover the entire lot of land on which it stands and the entire curtilage thereto belonging; or, if not in a city, town or village, the lien shall extend to and cover one (1) acre of land on which the same may stand, if there be so much, to be selected by the holder of the lien. If the structure be a water well, the lien shall extend only to all pumps, pipes, equipment therein and all water well appurtenances. If the structure be an oil or gas well, the lien shall extend to the nonoperator’s interest in the mineral estate and the fixtures and equipment in the producing unit assigned such well by the State Oil and Gas Board. If the structure be a railroad or railroad embankment, the lien shall extend to and cover the entire roadbed and right-of-way, depots and other buildings used or connected therewith. If the services of the architect, surveyor, engineer, laborers, materialmen, rental or lease equipment suppliers or of the contractors shall be upon the whole subdivision, the lien shall extend to and cover the entire subdivision; but if a part only of the land is subdivided and laborers’, materialmen’s, rental or lease equipment suppliers’, architects’, surveyors’ or engineers’ services are required and contractors are employed, then the lien shall extend to only that portion of said property upon which the services were required or upon which or in connection with which the work was done or the materials or rental or lease equipment were furnished. Such lien shall take effect as to purchasers or encumbrancers for a valuable consideration without notice thereof, only from the time of commencing suit to enforce the lien, or from the time of filing the contract under which the lien arose, or notice thereof, in the office of the clerk of the chancery court, as hereinafter stated; delivery of material to the job is prima facie evidence of its use therein, and use of water from a water well is prima facie evidence of acceptability of the well. In the case of oil and gas wells, such lien shall take effect as to purchasers or encumbrancers for a valuable consideration without notice thereof, only from the time of filing notice of such lien as provided by Section 85-7-133.”

       Lien arising automatically under Mississippi construction statute was statutory lien, not judicial lien subject to avoidance as impairing Chapter 7 debtors’ homestead exemption, though creditor could not enforce lien without filing action, and creditor filed enforcement action and obtained judgment prepetition; judgment did not transform statutory lien into judgment lien. In re Wiltcher, 204 B.R. 488, 1996 Bankr. LEXIS 1747 (Bankr. S.D. Miss. 1996).

       Construction lender has no duty of reasonable diligence in disbursing to owner proceeds of construction loan, such that materialmen might recover from lender for losses caused thereby; materialmen hold lien against property only to extent that they have brought themselves within terms of statute; and, automatic stay incident to filing of petition in bankruptcy does not prohibit materialman from filing notice of its lien under statute.

       Plaintiffs contended and defendant agreed that because defendant failed to have both plaintiffs, as tenants by the entirety, execute the construction contract, the lien did not attach to the property as a means of securing the debt owed only by one plaintiff to defendant, but the other plaintiff’s alleged knowledge and consent to work being done on property she owned might amount to authorization, regardless of whether or not she was a signatory to the contract, and summary judgment was inappropriate at this stage.

   In an action by the purchaser of a house for damages against the builder, the trial court erred in sustaining the builder’s demurrer to one count of the complaint charging it with falsely filing a materialmen’s lien in 1977 against the property without providing notice to the purchaser as required by §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t85c07s85-7-197" target="_self">85-7-197</a></cite> [repealed] where the claim was not barred by the one-year statute of limitations set out in §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t85c07s85-7-201" target="_self">85-7-201</a></cite> [repealed] since the suit had been filed in 1979 within a month after the purchaser first became aware of the lien.

      Any person entitled to and desiring to have the benefit of a lien under Section 85-7-131 shall commence his suit in the circuit or county court of the county in which the property or some part thereof is situated, if the principal of his demand exceeds Two Hundred Dollars ($200.00), within twelve (12) months next after the time when the money due and claimed by the suit became due and payable following the day on which the last of the labor was performed or material or rental or lease equipment was supplied by the person bringing the action, and not after; and the suit shall be commenced by petition, describing with reasonable certainty the property upon which the lien is averred to exist, and setting out the nature of the contract and indebtedness, and the amount thereof; and the plaintiff shall file therewith in all cases, except where the whole work or materials, or both, were furnished in pursuance of a written contract for an aggregate price, a bill of particulars exhibiting the amount and kind of labor performed, and of materials furnished, and the prices at which and times when the same were performed and furnished; and such suits shall be docketed and conducted as other suits in that court, and may be tried at the first term.

      <p>
       The 2011 amendment inserted “or county” following “shall commence his suit in the circuit”; and inserted “following the day on which the last of the labor was performed
   . . . . supplied by the person bringing the action.
      </p>

       That the circuit court is the proper situs for suits to enforce a lien does not mean that a chancellor has no jurisdiction to restrain a private person’s efforts to hold himself out as possessing such a lien.

       Lien arising automatically under Mississippi construction statute was statutory lien, not judicial lien subject to avoidance as impairing Chapter 7 debtors’ homestead exemption, though creditor could not enforce lien without filing action, and creditor filed enforcement action and obtained judgment prepetition; judgment did not transform statutory lien into judgment lien.

       In view of the provisions of Code 1942, § 360, actions brought in the chancery court to enforce laborers’ and materialmen’s liens were properly transferred by the chancellor to the circuit court, and an interlocutory appeal from the order of transfer should not have been granted.

       A suit to enforce the lien may be amended after twelve months from the time the debt became due, so as to set forth more precisely the property covered by the lien; but amendment of suit for debt to suit to enforce lien cannot be done after twelve months from the time the debt became due, as the suit for the debt does not stop the running of the statute against the lien.

   Dismissal of a suit seeking to enforce a construction lien was proper as: (1) the original complaint (OC) did not name the real party in interest under Miss. R. Civ. P. 17(a), the current owner (CO) of the building; (2) the prior owner had conveyed the property before the OC was filed; (3) the amended complaint (AC) was time-barred as it was not served on the CO until after the Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t85c07s85-7-141" target="_self">85-7-141</a></cite> limitations period expired; (4) due to the lack of timely service under Miss. R. Civ.

       The holder of a deed of trust on certain personal property and a purchaser of such property from a trustee in bankruptcy, setting up the defense of statute of limitations to the enforcement of a mechanic’s lien claimed as to such property, were bound to prove that the due date of the indebtedness claimed by the mechanic’s lien claimant was such as to cause the mechanic’s lien to be barred by the statute without regard to when the labor was actually done or materials furnished.

       The conditional seller of an automobile is a necessary party to a proceeding to enforce a mechanic’s lien for repairs. Mississippi Motor Finance, Inc. v. Thomas, 246 Miss. 14, 149 So. 2d 20, 1963 Miss. LEXIS 411 (Miss. 1963).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the original lessee had assigned its leasehold interest to another, who in turn rented to a person who incurred a debt upon which a mechanic’s lien was attempted to be enforced, the original lessee was not a necessary and indispensable party to the suit. Jay Industries, Inc. v. Powell, 220 Miss. 372, 71 So. 2d 193, 1954 Miss. LEXIS 449 (Miss. 1954).

       The owner of the leasehold interest upon which a mechanic’s lien is sought to be enforced is a necessary party to the suit. Jay Industries, Inc. v. Powell, 220 Miss. 372, 71 So. 2d 193, 1954 Miss. LEXIS 449 (Miss. 1954).

       One claiming to be a bona fide holder of deed of trust against real property is proper party, under this section [Code 1942, § 361], to suit to enforce materialmen’s lien on same property. Bullock v. Hans, 208 Miss. 41, 43 So. 2d 670, 1949 Miss. LEXIS 405 (Miss. 1949).

       Where in suit to enforce a mechanic’s lien for labor done on a wrecked automobile, the bill of complaint alleged that credit company claimed some interest in such automobile, and such credit company was served with process by publication and decree pro confesso was taken against such company upon its failure to appear, and on appeal credit company was permitted to file forthcoming bond, appeal could not be defeated on ground that credit company was not a party to the suit. Universal Credit Co. v. Linn Motor Co., 195 Miss. 565, 15 So. 2d 694 (Miss. 1943).

       Holder of deed of trust was necessary party to proceedings to establish and enforce mechanic’s lien. Parsons v. Foster, 154 Miss. 363, 122 So. 387, 1929 Miss. LEXIS 124 (Miss. 1929).
      </p>
      <p>
       To a suit to enforce the lien, under the statute, all persons claiming similar liens on the same property must be made parties or their rights will not be affected, whether suits be pending to enforce the liens of such others or not. Buntyn v. Shippers' Compress Co., 63 Miss. 94, 1885 Miss. LEXIS 22 (Miss. 1885).

      </p>
      <p>
       Persons who claim the land adversely to those with whom the mechanic or materialman made his contract, are not proper parties to the suit to enforce the lien, as their interest will not be affected and cannot be adjudicated. Falconer v. Frazier, 15 Miss. 235, 1846 Miss. LEXIS 141 (Miss. 1846); English v. Foote, 16 Miss. 444, 1847 Miss. LEXIS 40 (Miss. 1847);

       Where one, who had made repairs to a truck, intervened in an action by subsequent repairmen against the conditional vendee of the truck to recover for their labor and to impress a lien upon the truck and, the truck having been condemned to be sold to pay for all the repairs, took an assignment of the subsequent repairmen’s lien and their interest in the judgment and then purchased the truck at the sale thereunder, thereby acquiring the vendee’s title, which was the ownership of the truck subject to the lien of the conditional sales contract, the mechanic’s liens were not merged into the judgment, but remained in effect as against the vendor’s assignee, and the assignee was entitled to dispossess the holder of the mechanic’s liens only when it had paid him what the purchaser of the truck owed him, if anything, for the repairs to it.

     <p>
      If such special writ of execution be for the sale of a house, building, structure, or fixture and the land, or for the sale of the same without the land, the officer shall levy on, advertise, sell, and convey the same as in other cases of land levied on for debt; and if the sale be of the house, building, structure, or fixtures alone, and the same shall have been erected or constructed and put on the land subsequently to a former encumbrance on the land, the purchaser shall acquire the same free from such former encumbrance, and his purchase shall authorize him to enter and remove such house, building, structure, or fixture from the land with reasonable dispatch; but if the house, building, structure or fixture so sold, or sold with the land, shall have been simply altered or repaired subsequently to a former encumbrance on the land, the purchaser shall acquire the same subject to such encumbrance, unless the encumbrancer consented in writing to the alteration or repairs, in which case the house, building, structure, or fixtures so altered or repaired shall be sold free from such encumbrance, and with the right in the purchaser to enter and remove the same. If the land be sold also, the purchaser shall acquire such estate therein as the owner or builder, as the case may be, had at the time the lien to enforce which the sale is made attached thereon, or at any time afterwards, subject to prior encumbrances; but buildings, structures, or fixtures erected or constructed and put on the land subsequently to prior encumbrances shall pass to the purchaser as if the sale were of such buildings, structures, or fixtures alone.

       In an action to determine the priority between a mechanic’s lien and first and second deeds of trust, the mechanic’s lien asserted by a contractor, who had repaired a fixture on the premises, was subordinate to the first deed of trust on the property, where the owner of that deed of trust did not consent in writing to the alteration or repair of the fixture, but had priority over the rights of purchasers of a trustee’s deed which foreclosed a second deed of trust, where the purchasers of that deed bought the property at foreclosure of the second deed with notice of the lien’s existence. Ziller v. Atkins Motel Co., 244 So. 2d 409, 1971 Miss. LEXIS 1334 (Miss. 1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       When in a suit for a mechanic’s and materialmen’s lien on heating equipment installed on hotel premises the contract was not recorded, and no notice of lis pendens given or writ of seizure of the property issued, and the property was claimed by the grantee of the realty from a purchaser at foreclosure of a prior deed of trust as a purchaser for value without notice of the unpaid lien, the burden was on such grantee to prove that he was a purchaser for value without notice, and in the absence of such proof, the lien claimant was entitled to recover. Hamilton Bros. Co. v. Baxter, 188 Miss. 610, 195 So. 335, 1940 Miss. LEXIS 50 (Miss. 1940).
      </p>
      <p>
       If a contract under which material was installed on realty was not recorded, and no lis pendens notice was filed at or after the time suit to enforce the mechanic’s and materialmen’s lien was instituted, and if the material should be considered as real estate fixtures, and if the grantee of the realty from a purchaser at foreclosure at a prior deed of trust was a purchaser for value without actual notice of the lien, such grantee would take the property free of the lien. Hamilton Bros. Co. v. Baxter, 188 Miss. 610, 195 So. 335, 1940 Miss. LEXIS 50 (Miss. 1940).
      </p>
      <p>
       Under this section [Code 1942, § 367], heating equipment installed on hotel premises and easily detachable therefrom without substantial impairment to the premises, would still be subject to a mechanic’s and materialmen’s lien notwithstanding a prior deed of trust covering the property, but such lien would not include the land. Hamilton Bros. Co. v. Baxter, 188 Miss. 610, 195 So. 335, 1940 Miss. LEXIS 50 (Miss. 1940).

      <p>
       The statute contemplates a prompt exercise of the right to enter and remove buildings, and a failure to do so is a waiver of it; What is “reasonable dispatch” is determinable by circumstances, but delay for two years, in the absence of explanation, will be conclusive of a waiver.

       The statute’s reference to owners as part of the category of “any such persons” means owners who have acted as laborers or materialmen, i.e., owners who have supplied materials or labor to the project. Cooper Indus. v. Tarmac Roofing Sys., 276 F.3d 704, 2002 U.S. App. LEXIS 173 (5th Cir. Miss. 2002).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   This section was applicable in a federal action on a contract bond to which the Miller Act was inapplicable, there having been made applicable to the bond by the regulation requiring it no particular statute of limitations and the court having consequently looked to the state statute of limitations applicable to actions of a similar nature. United States on behalf of Mississippi Road Supply Co. v. H. R. Morgan, Inc., 542 F.2d 262, 1976 U.S. App. LEXIS 6248 (5th Cir. Miss. 1976), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">434 U.S. 828</cite>, <cite class="s_court">98 S. Ct. 106</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">54 L.

      </p>
      <p>
       Code 1942, § 376, which applies to contractor’s performance bonds, has no application to a fidelity bond or fidelity insurance. Latham v. United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co., 267 So. 2d 895, 1972 Miss. LEXIS 1431 (Miss. 1972).
      </p>
      <p>
       The one-year statute of limitations provided for in this section [Code 1942, § 376] does not begin to run until there has been publication of notice of settlement or abandonment of the contract. Transamerica Ins. Co. v. Paine Supply Co., 194 So. 2d 490, 1967 Miss. LEXIS 1409 (Miss. 1967).

       The publication of notice required by this section [Code 1942, § 376] applies both where the obligee makes final settlement and where it has determined that the contract has been abandoned. Transamerica Ins. Co. v. Paine Supply Co., 194 So. 2d 490, 1967 Miss. LEXIS 1409 (Miss. 1967).
      </p>
      <p>
       The publication required by this section [Code 1942, § 376] cannot be waived by custom, nor, in the case of a private contract, is publication of notice contrary to public policy. Transamerica Ins. Co. v. Paine Supply Co., 194 So. 2d 490, 1967 Miss. LEXIS 1409 (Miss. 1967).

   In an action by the purchaser of a house for damages against the builder, the trial court erred in sustaining the builder’s demurrer to one count of the complaint charging it with falsely filing a materialmen’s lien in 1977 against the property without providing notice to the purchaser as required by §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t85c07s85-7-197" target="_self">85-7-197</a></cite> [repealed] where the claim was not barred by the one-year statute of limitations set out in §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t85c07s85-7-201" target="_self">85-7-201</a></cite> [repealed] because the suit had been filed in 1979 within a month after the purchaser first became aware of the lien. The fact that the notice of lien was listed in the “Notice of Construction Liens” book Liens: book established by §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t85c07s85-7-133" target="_self">85-7-133</a></cite>, rather than on the lis pendens docket established by by §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t85c07s85-7-197" target="_self">85-7-197</a></cite> [repealed], did not excuse the builder from the notice requirement of the latter statute.

       The owner of a motor vehicle that has been towed at his request or at the direction of a law enforcement officer, or towed upon request of a real property owner upon whose property a vehicle has been left without permission of the real property owner for more than five (5) days, shall be liable for the reasonable price of towing and storage of such vehicle; and the towing company to whom the price of such labor and storage costs may be due shall have the right to retain possession of such motor vehicle until the price is paid.

       Within twenty-four (24) hours, the towing company shall report to the local law enforcement agency having jurisdiction any vehicle that has been towed unless the vehicle was towed at the request of the owner of the vehicle. If the owner of a towed vehicle has not contacted the towing company within five (5) business days of the initial tow, the towing company shall obtain from the appropriate authority the names and addresses of any owner and lienholder. If the information from the appropriate authority fails to disclose the owner or lienholder, a good faith effort shall be made by the towing company to locate ownership, including a check for tag information, inspection sticker, or any papers in the vehicle that may indicate ownership. Upon location of the owner and lienholder, the towing company shall notify them by registered mail of the amount due for towing, postmarked no later than the tenth day following the initial tow. If such amount shall not be paid within thirty (30) days from the initial tow, the towing company to whom such charges are payable shall notify by certified mail any legal owner and holder of any lien, as disclosed by the motor vehicle title records or other investigation, of notice of sale of the property. If such property has not been redeemed within ten (10) days after the mailing of the certified letter, the towing company may commence sale of the property at public auction. The towing company shall publish for two (2) consecutive weeks a notice of sale in the newspaper having circulation in the county where the vehicle was initially towed. The proceeds of the sale of such property in excess of the amount needed to pay the towing, reasonable storage and necessary expenses of the procedures required by this section shall be held by the towing company for a period of six (6) months, and, if not reclaimed by the owner thereof within such time, shall become the property of the county and be paid to the chancery clerk of the county in which the sale was held to be deposited into the county general fund, subject, however, to any rights of the recorded lienholder.

       Mechanic’s lien and storage lien statutes which were advanced by a party, who repaired and then stored an excavator, did not allow attorney’s fees. Caterpillar Fin. Servs. Corp. v.

   Summary judgment award for a lien against an excavator for storage costs was inappropriate because there was nothing in the stipulation before the county court about storage costs.

A construction lien is subordinate to a construction mortgage if the construction mortgage is filed in the land records before a notice of a claim of lien is filed pursuant to Section 85-7-405 and the lender, secured party, mortgagee, beneficiary or holder of the construction mortgage obtained either: (i) an affidavit or sworn statement from the owner to the effect that no work has been performed on, or materials delivered to, the real property; or (ii) an affidavit or sworn statement from the contractor, or owner if there is no contractor, as provided in Section 85-7-413(1) (b) regarding payment for work, materials or services provided. A construction mortgage has this priority for all loan advances secured thereby regardless of whether the advances are made before or after the filing of a notice of a construction lien, and this priority will extend to amendments, restatements and refinancings of the construction mortgage.

       When any person entitled under this article to claim a lien against any real estate located in this state files a lien in the office of the clerk of the chancery court of the county in which the real estate is located, the owner of the real estate or the contractor or subcontractor employed to improve the property may, before or after foreclosure proceedings are instituted, discharge the lien upon the approval of a bond by the clerk of the chancery court. The bond shall be conditioned to pay to the holder of the lien the sum that may be found to be due the holder upon the trial of any payment action that may be filed by the lienholder to recover the amount of the claim within one hundred eighty (180) days from the time the claim of lien is filed or as otherwise required by Section 85-7-423. The bond shall be one hundred ten percent (110%) of the amount claimed under that lien and shall be either a cash bond or a bond with good security approved by the clerk of the chancery court and issued by any surety company authorized to do business in the State of Mississippi. Upon approval by the clerk of the bond, the real estate shall be discharged from the lien.

       Within seven (7) days of filing the bond required by subsection (1) of this section and any attachments, the party filing the bond shall send a notice of filing the bond and a copy of the bond by registered or certified mail or statutory overnight delivery to the lien claimant at the address stated on the lien or, if no address is shown for the lien claimant, to the person shown as having filed the lien on behalf of the claimant at the indicated address of the person and, if the bond is filed by a contractor or subcontractor, to the owner of the property and the contractor; however, if the lien claimant or the owner or contractor is an entity on file with the Secretary of State’s office, sending the notice of filing the bond and a copy of the bond to the company’s address or the registered agent’s address on file with the Secretary of State shall be deemed sufficient; failure to send the notice of filing the bond and copy of the bond shall not invalidate the bond for purposes of discharge of a claim of lien under this section. With respect to bonds secured by property, the clerk shall not accept any real property bond unless the real property is scheduled in an attached affidavit setting forth a description of the property and indicating the record owner thereof, including any liens and encumbrances and amounts thereof, the market value, and the value of the sureties’ interest therein, which affidavit shall be executed by the owner or owners of the interest; the bond and affidavit shall be recorded in the same manner and at the same cost as other deeds of real property.

       § 85-7-507.
    When lien attaches to commercial real estate.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      A lien authorized by this article attaches to the commercial real estate only when the lien claimant files a timely notice of the lien in the office of the chancery clerk in the county in which the commercial real estate is located. A notice of lien is timely if it is filed after the claimant’s performance under the written agreement for broker services and before the conveyance or transfer of the commercial real estate that is the subject of the lien, except in cases where payments of compensation are due in installments or upon renewal. When payment of compensation to a broker is due in installments or upon renewal under the written agreement for broker services, a portion of which is due or may become due after the conveyance or transfer of the commercial real estate, a single claim for a lien filed before transfer or conveyance of the commercial real estate claiming all compensation due in installments or upon renewal shall be valid and enforceable for a period of one (1) year from the date of filing as it pertains to payments due after the transfer or conveyance; however, as payments or partial payments of compensation are received, the broker shall provide partial releases for those payments, thereby reducing the amount due the broker under the broker’s lien. The notice of single claim for a lien may be renewed for a period of one (1) year by the filing of a renewal notice meeting the requirements of this article before the expiration of the expiring notice, and may be likewise renewed from year to year so long as installments of compensation or renewal compensation are due. Notwithstanding any notice of single claim for a lien filed, when payment of compensation to a broker is due in installments or contingent upon renewals under the written agreement for broker services, a portion of which is or would be due after the conveyance or transfer of the commercial real estate, any notice of lien for those payments due or becoming due after the transfer or conveyance may be recorded after the transfer or conveyance of the commercial real estate and within ninety (90) days of the date on which the payment is due; in that case the lien shall be effective as a lien against the transferee’s interest in the commercial real estate as of the date filed and, in the case of a lease or transfer of a nonfreehold interest, the lien shall be effective as a lien against the owner’s interest in the commercial real estate as of the date filed.

     <p>
      If a notice of lien has been filed with the chancery clerk and the claim has been paid in full or in part, or if a condition occurs that would preclude the lien claimant from receiving compensation, in whole or in part, under the terms of the written agreement for broker services on which the lien is based, the lien claimant shall promptly, and in no event more than thirty (30) days after a properly served written demand of the owner, lienee, or other authorized agent, file with the chancery clerk and serve upon the owner(s) of record a written release, partial release or satisfaction of the lien. If a lien claimant fails to file a suit to enforce the lien within the time prescribed by this article or fails to file an answer in a pending suit to enforce a lien within thirty (30) days after a properly served written demand of the owner, lienee, or other authorized agent, the lien shall be extinguished. Service of the demand shall be by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, or by personal service under the Mississippi Rules of Civil Procedure, as amended from time to time. The claimant shall promptly file proof of properly served written demand with the chancery clerk. The provisions of this section shall not extend to any other deadline provided by law for the filing of any pleadings or for the foreclosure of any lien governed by this article.

       § 85-7-521.
    Discharge of lien.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Unless an alternative procedure is available and is acceptable to the transferee in a real estate transaction, any claim of lien on commercial real estate filed under this article may be discharged by any of the following methods:
     </p>
     <p>
      The lien claimant of record, the claimant’s lawful agent, or the claimant’s duly authorized attorney-in-fact, in the presence of the chancery clerk or a notary public, may acknowledge in writing the satisfaction of the claim of lien on the commercial real estate indebtedness and file the same with the chancery clerk, after which the chancery clerk shall enter on the record of the claim of lien on the commercial real estate the acknowledgment of satisfaction.
     </p>
     <p>
      The owner may exhibit an instrument of satisfaction signed and acknowledged by the lien claimant of record in the presence of the chancery clerk or a notary public, which instrument states that the claim of lien on the commercial real estate indebtedness has been paid or satisfied, after which the chancery clerk shall cancel the claim of lien on the commercial real estate by entry of satisfaction on the record of the claim of lien on the commercial real estate.
     </p>
     <p>
      By failure to enforce the claim of lien on the commercial real estate within the time prescribed by this article.
     </p>
     <p>
      By filing in the office of the chancery clerk the original or attested copy of a judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction showing that the action by the claimant to enforce the claim of lien on the commercial real estate has been dismissed or finally determined adversely to the claimant.
     </p>
     <p>
      Whenever funds in an amount equal to one hundred twenty-five percent (125%) of the amount of the claim of lien on the commercial real estate are deposited with the chancery clerk to be applied to any payment finally determined to be due, after which the chancery clerk shall cancel the claim of lien on the commercial real estate. Thereafter, the lien of the claimant shall remain in place and be fully enforceable as to the funds deposited with the chancery clerk, but the lien upon the commercial real property shall be deemed released.
     </p>
     <p>
      Whenever a corporate surety bond, in an amount equal to one hundred twenty-five percent (125%) of the amount of the claim of lien on the commercial real estate and conditioned upon the payment of the amount finally determined to be due in satisfaction of the claim of lien on the commercial real estate is deposited with the chancery clerk, after which the chancery clerk shall cancel the claim of lien on the commercial real estate. Thereafter, the lien of the claimant shall remain in place and be fully enforceable as to the funds deposited with the chancery clerk, but the lien upon the commercial real property shall be deemed released.
     </p>
     <p>
      By failure to file a written release or satisfaction of a lien when required by this article or to timely file or take other action required by this article.

The tax lien enrolled in the tax lien registry shall constitute the judgment enrolled for the payment of the amount of tax, penalties, and interest referred to in Sections 27-7-57, 27-13-31 and 27-65-59, but the warrant issued for a tax lien enrolled on a tax lien registry shall direct and authorize the special agent to seize and sell the real and personal property found anywhere within this state that belongs to the taxpayer against whom the tax lien was enrolled and not just property in a specific county. Once issued, the execution of the warrants shall be in accordance with Section 27-3-33(4) for the levy on salaries, compensation or other monies due the delinquent taxpayer; Sections 27-7-61 through 27-7-67 in regard to income tax and withholding tax; Sections 27-13-35 through 27-13-41 for franchise tax; and Sections 27-65-63 through 27-65-69 for sales tax and any other tax or fee administered by the department that utilizes the administrative provisions of the sales tax law in the administration of the tax or fee. Under warrants issued for the tax liens enrolled in the tax lien registry, any property, real or personal, within the State of Mississippi is subject to levy under Section 27-3-33(4) if the person that owes the salary, compensation or other monies to the debtor is subject to service of process in this state.

      <li id="t85c13s85-13-3ol12">
       The commissioner may provide financial institutions a quarterly, electronic inquiry file containing names and identifying information of obligors. Within thirty (30) days of receipt of the inquiry file, the financial institution agreeing to use the data match system shall match the file against its own records for the purpose of identifying whether an account for an obligor is held by the financial institution and notify the department of its findings. When a match is identified, the financial institution shall provide the department the names and identifying numbers on record for the accounts, account numbers, and the account balances as of the date of response back to the department.

The levy shall require the financial institution to encumber or surrender assets held by the institution on behalf of the obligor. For a financial institution participating in the data match program, the answer shall be made at any time within thirty (30) days after the service of the levy in the form and manner determined by the commissioner.
