      </p>
      <p>
       “SECTION 2. (1) There is hereby created the Mandatory Statewide Offense-Reporting System Task Force to undertake a comprehensive review of all state and local law enforcement agencies’ use of offense reports. The task force shall be composed of nine (9) members, as follows:
      </p>
      <p>
       “(a) The President of the Mississippi Association of Chiefs of Police, or a designee;
      </p>
      <p>
       “(b) The President of the Mississippi Sheriffs’ Association, or a designee;

       “(h) The Director of the Joint Committee on Performance Evaluation and Expenditure Review, or a designee as a nonvoting member; and
      </p>
      <p>
       “(i) A member to be appointed by the Governor to serve at the will and pleasure of the Governor as the chairperson of the task force.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(2) A vacancy in the task force shall not affect its powers, but shall be filled as prescribed in subsection (1). A majority of the membership of the task force shall constitute a quorum, and shall meet at the call of the chairperson, or upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the task force. All members must be notified in writing of all meetings at least five (5) days before the date on which a meeting of the task force is scheduled.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(3) The purpose of the task force is to work toward producing uniform offense reports and to investigate whether it is possible to require a standardized offense reporting system to get a clearer picture of crime in Mississippi and allow for single-source reporting to the Department of Justice through uniform crime reporting. The task force shall investigate whether an increase in grant funding would result. A goal of the task force is to work to provide a true picture of crime in the state and movement of offenders which could help predict and prevent criminal activity. The task force shall coordinate its work with the arrest and dispositions reporting as a valuable tool for measuring the impact of programs that seek to reduce recidivism, incarceration, and provide more support services in communities. A major focus of the task force will be to recommend an automated reporting system as opposed to manual reports that are compiled every six (6) months.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(4) The Joint Committee on Performance Evaluation and Expenditure Review shall provide appropriate staff support to assist the task force in carrying out its duties. The Director of the Joint Committee on Performance Evaluation and Expenditure Review shall designate an appropriate employee to act as a point of contact for staff support to the task force. In addition, the task force may consult with employees of any state agency or department necessary to accomplish the task force’s responsibilities under this section.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(5) The members of the task force shall serve without compensation.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(6) The task force shall prepare and submit a final report that contains a detailed statement of findings, conclusions and recommendations of the task force to the Legislature, the Governor, and to local and tribal governments by October 13, 2017, and the task force shall stand dissolved on December 31, 2017. It is the intention of the Legislature that, given the importance of the matters before the task force, the task force should work toward unanimously supported findings and recommendations. The report submitted under this subsection shall be made available to the public.”

       A municipal police department has concurrent jurisdiction with state security personnel over criminal activity that occurs on state-owned property located within the municipal boundaries, but since there is no authority which gives primary jurisdiction to one agency over another, a cooperative effort should be made on the part of all agencies with jurisdiction to evaluate each occurrence of criminal activity on an individual basis and make a decision as to who should have primary jurisdiction based on the circumstances of the incident and the resources of each investigating agency.

      </h4>
      <p>
       The effective date of the bill that amended this section, House Bill No. 921, 2012 Regular Session, is “from and after the date it is effectuated under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, as amended and extended.”
   However, after the bill was submitted to the United States Attorney General under Section 5, the United States Supreme Court, in the case of Shelby County v. Holder (June 25, 2013), struck down the coverage formula that determined what jurisdictions are subject to Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, so the coverage formula can no longer be used as a basis for subjecting jurisdictions to preclearance under Section 5.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because of the Shelby County decision, the United States Attorney General is not making any determinations under Section 5 on voting or election changes made by states.
   The Supreme Court did not strike down Section 5, so it is still in effect.
   House Bill No. 921 was submitted to the United States Attorney General before the Shelby County decision was rendered.
   In a letter dated August 5, 2013, the United States Attorney General responded that he is not making determinations on the merits of any bill that is submitted under Section 5.
   The submission of House Bill No. 921 and the response from the United States Attorney General technically met the requirements of Section 5 and fulfilled the condition in the effective date of House Bill No. 921, so House Bill No. 921 became effective on the date of the response letter from the United States Attorney General, August 5, 2013.

       In order to eradicate the effects of past racial discrimination in hiring of highway patrol officers, the district court, pursuant to a mandate from the circuit court of appeals to insure an increase in the number of blacks, ordered the Department of Public Safety to submit a plan providing for a more extensive recruiting program, administration of a job related test, and, though quota hiring was not necessary, providing for, temporarily, giving first chance at employment to black applicants meeting minimal testing, physical, training and background requirements; the Department of Public Safety was also required to compile records and submit periodic reports to the district court so that court could determine whether the goal of increasing the number of blacks was met. Morrow v. Dillard, 412 F. Supp. 494, 1976 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15797 (S.D. Miss. 1976), aff'd in part and rev'd in part, 580 F.2d 1284, 1978 U.S. App. LEXIS 8724 (5th Cir. Miss. 1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       The requirement that highway patrol officers have a high school education or its equivalent bore a demonstrable relationship to successful performance of the job, was not shown to have a racially discriminatory impact, and thus did not violate the constitutional rights of minority races. Morrow v. Dillard, 412 F. Supp. 494, 1976 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15797 (S.D. Miss. 1976), aff'd in part and rev'd in part, 580 F.2d 1284, 1978 U.S. App. LEXIS 8724 (5th Cir. Miss. 1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   In case involving alleged racial discrimination in employment practices of Mississippi Highway Patrol, U. S. District Court failed to order sufficient affirmative relief to eradicate state’s unconstitutional practices, and case would be remanded, with guidelines, to fashion an appropriate decree which will have the certain result of increasing the number of blacks on the Highway Patrol. Morrow v. Crisler, 491 F.2d 1053, 1974 U.S. App. LEXIS 9461 (5th Cir. Miss.), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">419 U.S. 895</cite>, <cite class="s_court">95 S. Ct. 173</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">42 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 139, 1974 U.S. LEXIS 2927 (U.S. 1974).
      </p>
      <p>
       Highway patrolmen are not peace officers within the sense that sheriffs, constables and policemen are such to enforce general laws of state, but act within limited sphere of authority granted them under this statute [Code 1942, § 8079] and Code 1942, § 8082.

       State highway patrolman, not being peace officer, has same authority that private citizen would have to make arrest of a fleeing homicide under the same circumstances, and no more, and would be entitled to receive statutory reward the same as if he had been private citizen and had made arrest and delivery of prisoner under circumstances provided for by Code 1942, § 2482.

       Highway patrolmen are not peace officers in the sense that sheriffs, constables and policemen are such to enforce general laws of state, but act within limited sphere of authority granted them under this statute [Code 1942, § 8082] and Code 1942, § 8079.

       State highway patrolman, not being peace officer, has same authority that private citizen would have to make arrest of fleeing homicide under same circumstances, and no more, and would be entitled to receive statutory reward the same as if he had been private citizen and had made arrest and delivery of prisoner under circumstances provided for by Code 1942, § 2482.

       A highway patrolman is not vested with authority to begin chasing a motorist on the highway unless at the time he has good reason to believe, and does believe, that the motorist has or is violating the law at the time that the chase is begun.

     <p>
      The Legislature finds that the administration of jails and youth detention facilities is of statewide concern, and that the activities of jail officers are important to the health, safety and welfare of the people of this state and are of such nature as to require education and training of a professional nature of jail officers. It is the intent of the Legislature to provide for the coordination of training programs and the establishment of standards for jail officers.

       Part-time deputy sheriff is clothed with same power and authority to perform any act that any full-time deputy sheriff of county could lawfully perform while such part-time deputy is on duty. 1992 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 799.

       Mayor has authority to appoint extra deputy police officers and that any compensation is subject to approval by Board of Aldermen. 1993 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 736.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether police officer or extra deputy police officer works full time or part time is administrative decision. 1993 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 736.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 45-5-9 only applies to “extra deputies” and not to regularly appointed, full-time deputies as set forth in Section 19-25-19. 1996 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 376.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regular deputies appointed under Section 19-25-19 do not need to post bond unless required to do so by the sheriff under Section 19-25-13. With the exception of the bond requirements of Section 19-25-13, only those deputies appointed under Section 45-5-9 and designated as “extra deputies” are statutorily mandated to be bonded. 1996 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 376.

      <p>
       A sheriff has the authority under Miss. Code Section 45-5-9 to appoint volunteers to serve as deputies for the purpose of performing tasks assigned to them. 1997 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 461.
      </p>
      <p>
       The mayor may appoint extra deputy police officers pursuant to the statute, but any compensation is subject to approval by the board of aldermen. 2002 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 56.
      </p>
      <p>
       A police officer appointed by the mayor pursuant to this section must have his pay specifically approved by the Board of Alderman. A line item in an existing budget for police officers who are hired by the Board of Alderman does not constitute “approval of the governing authorities of such municipalities.” 2003 Miss. Op.

     <p>
      The Legislature finds that the administration of criminal justice is of statewide concern, and that the activities of law enforcement officers are important to the health, safety and welfare of the people of this state and are of such nature as to require selection, education and training of a professional nature upon entrance and during the careers of law enforcement officers. It is the intent of the Legislature to provide for the coordination of training programs for law enforcement officers and to set standards therefor.

       In a Mississippi Tort Claims Act case filed against the town and the chief of police resulting from the chief slapping plaintiff on her bottom while in the workplace, summary judgment was properly granted and her claim against the town for the failure to properly train and/or supervise the chief was properly dismissed because plaintiff failed to provide any legal authority that the town was required to provide training in addition to that training statutorily required by the Mississippi Law Enforcement Training Academy; the town nonetheless provided the chief with some local training before and after the incident; and the chief acted outside the course and scope of his law-enforcement duties when he committed the simple-assault.

      <p>
       The 2003 amendment inserted “or by the state military department as provided in Section 33-1-3” in the first sentence of (c).
      </p>
      <p>
       The 2004 amendment substituted “Two Hundred Fifty Dollars ($250.00)” for “One Hundred Twenty-five Dollars ($125.00)” and “One Thousand Seventy-five Dollars ($1,075.00)” for “Five Hundred Dollars ($500.00)” in (c) and (d).
      </p>
      <p>
       The 2007 amendment, in (c), added “and includes those district attorney criminal investigators who are designated as law enforcement officers,” inserted “a legal” following “person employed as,” deleted “or investigator for” preceding “a district attorney in this state,” and made a minor stylistic change; and in (e), divided the former last sentence into the present last sentence and (i) by inserting the colon following “unless” and adding “(i) The trainee is,” and added (ii) and (iii).

   1999 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 336.
      </p>
      <p>
       As long as a county board of supervisors specifies that an individual will receive less than $500.00 per month for law enforcement duties performed during a month and any other amount of compensation will be as a result of his administrative duties, the officer may be classified as part-time. 2001 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 528.
      </p>
      <p>
       The cumulative total compensation paid to a part-time law enforcement officer from all political subdivisions must be less than $500.00 per month; thus, the governing authorities of a political subdivision may not pay a part-time law enforcement officer an amount that would cause the officer’s compensation to exceed the statutory limit, but any compensation received by the part-time law enforcement officer from sources other than a political subdivision are not counted against the statutory limit. 2002 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 18.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a law enforcement officer has completed the required training and has been certified by the Board on Law Enforcement Standards and Training, he has the authority to exercise all of the powers and duties of a law enforcement officer, regardless of the compensation he receives; however, if the individual has not completed the required training he would be considered a law enforcement trainee and could only exercise the law enforcement authority if he were under the control and supervision of a properly trained officer. 2002 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 197.

       A constable may not work as a municipal police officer under the constable’s training certificate. 2003 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 201.

      </p>
      <p>
       A police officer of a municipality must be sworn before assuming any law enforcement duties, however, there is no requirement that a police officer must be sworn in by the Mayor or Vice-Mayor; a municipal
   court judge is the ‘police justice‘ of a municipality and, therefore, could administer the oath of office. 2003 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 212.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no prohibition against a part time law enforcement officer serving as a police chief, or in another supervisory capacity in which he or she will supervise full time law enforcement officers. 2004 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 288.
      </p>
      <p>
       The term “under the direct control and supervision of a law enforcement officer” mean that a law enforcement trainee must have some on-site or on-location supervision by a certified law enforcement officer. 2004 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 388.

      </p>
      <p>
       A non-certified law enforcement trainee who has personal knowledge of a crime may make an affidavit to such effect and present it to a judge. This would include information concerning traffic violations. However, any warrant that might be issued by the judge would only be able to be served by the law enforcement trainee if he were under the direct control and supervision of a certified officer. 2004 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 388.
      </p>
      <p>
       A non-certified law enforcement trainee has the same power and authority as a law enforcement officer while under the direct control and supervision of a certified law enforcement officer. 2005 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 587.
      </p>
      <p>
       Authority to hire, fire, set compensation, and define duties of municipal employees rests solely with the board of aldermen, subject to mayoral veto power. Whether a part-time police chief is sufficient to satisfy the municipality’s statutory duty to provide police protection is a factual determination to be made by the governing authority. If a municipality does not have a police chief, the board of aldermen must appoint one. An untrained part-time police officer is a law enforcement trainee who must be supervised by a certified officer and has two years from hiring to become certified. 2007 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 69, 2007 Miss. AG LEXIS 82.

   A capital murder indictment charging the defendant with the killing of a police officer “while acting in his official capacity . . . with knowledge that the victim was a peace officer” was not defective, despite the defendant’s argument that the victim was not authorized to exercise the powers of an officer pursuant to §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t45c06s45-6-11" target="_self">45-6-11</a></cite> because he had one year from the date he became employed as a law enforcement officer to obtain his certification from the State of Mississippi Board on Law Enforcement Standards and Training and the victim did not have this certification though he had been employed by the police department for 14 months, where the victim had been a part time police officer until 3 or 4 months prior to his death when he had become full time, and therefore he had 8 or 9 months until certification was necessary since he met the definition of a law enforcement officer for only 3 or 4 months in accordance with §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t45c06s45-6-3ol1c" target="_self">45-6-3(c)</a></cite>, which defines a law enforcement officer as “any person appointed or employed full time by the State or any political subdivision thereof . . . ” (emphasis added).

      <p>
       Substantial evidence supported the decision of the Mississippi Board on Law Enforcement Officer Standards and Training to deny officers’ applications to be certified as full-time law enforcement officers because the officers did not meet the minimum standards under the Board’s long-standing policy for full-time certification. Miss. Dep't of Pub. Safety v. Holden, 138 So.3d 220, 2014 Miss. App. LEXIS 233 (Miss. Ct. App. 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       Decision of the Mississippi Board on Law Enforcement Officer Standards and Training to deny officers’ applications to be certified as full-time law enforcement officers was not arbitrary or capricious because Board’s action was consistent with the Board’s policy of how an applicant became certified full-time; the plain language of the statute authorizes, but does not require, that every applicant meeting the two requirements be certified as full-time. Miss. Dep't of Pub. Safety v. Holden, 138 So.3d 220, 2014 Miss. App. LEXIS 233 (Miss. Ct. App. 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       Decision of the Mississippi Board on Law Enforcement Officer Standards and Training to deny officers’ applications to be certified as full-time law enforcement officers was not arbitrary or capricious because the plain and unambiguous language of the statute, and the use of the term “may,” gave the Board discretion to deny full-time certification for the officers, even if they had the requisite twenty-five years of law enforcement experience and received certification as part-time officers.

       Individual whose license has been canceled is not eligible for reinstatement as full-time law enforcement officer. 1990 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 25.

       Law enforcement officer, whose certification is suspended, cannot, under Miss. Code Section 45-6-11(2), be employed on part-time reserve status. Sullivan, June 8, 1993, A.G. Op. #0355.

       Any law enforcement officer who has had certificate suspended, canceled or recalled may not work, even on part-time basis, but prohibition as to part-time work does not apply to person who never had certificate or who has one that has not been suspended, canceled or recalled. 1993 Miss.

      <p>
       If a constable has been in office more than twenty-four months, as provided in Section 45-6-11, the statute would preclude a county from compensating a constable for fees generated under Section 25-7-27(1)(e), for serving warrants and other process, attending all trials in state cases in which the state fails in the prosecution, prior to satisfying the training requirement of Section 19-19-5(2). 1995 Miss.

       The town marshal must be certified by the Board of Law Enforcement Officers Standards and Training if he is a “full time law enforcement officer” under 45-6-3 or he may be grandfathered under Section 45-6-11(1). 1995 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 564.
      </p>
      <p>
       A full-time law enforcement officer who was appointed or hired prior to July 1, 1998, but has not received training or been certified as a law enforcement officer, may continue to serve in his capacity as a full-time officer with full authority as a peace officer without being under the direct control and supervision of a certified law enforcement officer for up to one year after being appointed or hired before he is required to obtain the proper training and become certified.
   1998 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 472.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a law enforcement officer has been grandfathered with respect to certification and has continued to work as a law enforcement officer without a break in service, he may continue to serve in a law enforcement capacity without certification. 2001 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 522.
      </p>
      <p>
       A law enforcement trainee has two years to become certified with such two year period being cumulative and not starting over upon termination and rehire. 2001 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 675.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless a law enforcement officer has been grandfathered with respect to certification and has continued to work as a law enforcement officer without a break in service he may not serve as chief of police. 2005 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 649.
      </p>
      <p>
       Authority to hire, fire, set compensation, and define duties of municipal employees rests solely with the board of aldermen, subject to mayoral veto power. Whether a part-time police chief is sufficient to satisfy the municipality’s statutory duty to provide police protection is a factual determination to be made by the governing authority. If a municipality does not have a police chief, the board of aldermen must appoint one. An untrained part-time police officer is a law enforcement trainee who must be supervised by a certified officer and has two years from hiring to become certified. 2007 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 69, 2007 Miss. AG LEXIS 82.

       If a law enforcement officer who was certified prior to March 11, 2004 and who participated in a pretrial diversion program prior to that date is later laterally transferred from one law enforcement agency to another, the officer may not be denied transfer of certification to the new agency because of a March 11, 2004 change in the Professional Certification Policy of the Mississippi Board of Law Enforcement Officer Standards and Training. 2007 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 148, 2007 Miss. AG LEXIS 66.

       Sheriff, rather than a circuit court, was to make hiring, firing, and compensation changes affecting bailiffs, as bailiffs were deputies of the sheriff. A circuit court order and order and opinion stating that bailiffs fell under the authority of the judiciary rather than the sheriff were void in part to the extent that they directly violated the Mississippi Constitution and statutory law.

       Unemployment compensation claimant’s failure to pass physical fitness test required to receive certification as police officer after his first year of employment was “misconduct” disqualifying him from receiving benefits; claimant’s actions were clearly in wanton disregard of employer’s interest, and claimant had ability to pass physical test within his personal control but evidence showed that he did not attempt to keep his physical fitness up to standards required to pass test.

      <p>
       Deputy sheriff is not law enforcement officer as defined in Section 45-6-3(c) at time of appointment, but is considered law enforcement officer at time he or she begins to perform law enforcement duties. 1994 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 932.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under Section 45-6-13(4), a law enforcement agency that terminates an officer within three years of the date of his employment is entitled to reimbursement of training expenses from another agency if that officer is hired by the other agency within thirty days from the termination. 1995 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 602.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under Section 45-6-13(4), only the actual expenses incurred by the police agency for the training of the officer should be reimbursed. These include the same expenses reimbursable under Section 46-6-13(2). 1995 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 576.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pursuant to Section 45-6-13(4), “law enforcement training expenses” which must be reimbursed are those listed in subsection (2), namely, “the salary and allowable tuition, living and travel expense incurred by the officers in attendance at approved training programs . . .” Proportionate share would be determined on a total 3 year basis pro rated over 36 months, for example: if the officer worked 24 months for the first entity, the second entity would have to reimburse the first for 12/36ths of the total expenses. See paragraph 20.3.1, Policy and Procedures of the Board of Law Enforcement Officers Standards and Training. 1996 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 801.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any money received from a federal grant that is used to pay for training expenses of a law enforcement officer will be included in the actual expense incurred by an entity when calculating the transfer reimbursement amount that a hiring entity is obligated to pay to the entity from which the officer is leaving; in other words, a federal grant does not change the amount of transfer reimbursement that is owed by a hiring entity to the entity from which the law enforcement officer is leaving.
   1999 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 13.
      </p>
      <p>
       A governmental entity may recover a proportionate share of the law enforcement training expenses incurred by it for any officer that leaves employment within three years after the date of his employment with that entity and immediately becomes employed by another governmental entity in a law enforcement capacity; this would include any training expenses incurred by an entity that were paid to another entity as reimbursement of the officer’s original training expenses. 1999 Miss.

       The provision of the statute which authorizes patrol officers to do and perform all acts authorized to be done by the sheriff, constables or any peace officer was intended to vest in patrol officers only such police powers as may be necessary to enable them to perform properly the duties imposed upon them by the statute as county road patrolmen.

       It was not the intention of the legislature to authorize patrol officers who were employed “to patrol roads of the county and to enforce the road and motor vehicle laws”, to take over the duties or exercise the powers of the sheriff, or constable or other peace officer, in the enforcement of the general criminal laws of the state, or in the service of criminal or civil process in cases which do not arise out of and have no relation to the performance of their duties as county road patrolmen.

   Where a former employee appealed a district court’s dismissal of his wrongful termination claim, based on the response of the Mississippi Supreme Court to a certified question as to the effect of Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t45c09s45-9-55" target="_self">45-9-55</a></cite>, he stated a claim for wrongful discharge under Mississippi law. Swindol v. Aurora Flight Scis. Corp., 832 F.3d 492, 2016 U.S. App. LEXIS 14550 (5th Cir. Miss. 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (5) did not shield an employer from liability for the wrongful discharge of an employee for storing a firearm in a locked vehicle on company property because it established freedom from liability for the actions of employees or third parties; while in subsection (1) employers cannot enforce policies or rules that had the effect of prohibiting a person from having a firearm in a locked vehicle, it also chose to grant employers immunity should an occurrence result from that prohibition. Swindol v. Aurora Flight Scis. Corp., 194 So.3d 847, 2016 Miss. LEXIS 131 (Miss. 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       Employer was liable for the wrongful discharge of an employee for storing a firearm in a locked vehicle on company property because the Legislature declared that it was legally impermissible for an employer to terminate an employee for having a firearm inside his or her locked vehicle on company property. Swindol v. Aurora Flight Scis. Corp., 194 So.3d 847, 2016 Miss. LEXIS 131 (Miss. 2016).

      <p>
       <p>
   Court certified to the Mississippi Supreme Court question of whether in Mississippi employer could be liable for wrongful discharge of employee for storing firearm in locked vehicle on company property in manner that was consistent with Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t45c09s45-9-55" target="_self">45-9-55</a></cite> because the issue presented an important and determinative question of state law that had not been addressed by Mississippi courts.

       The manner in which deadly weapons should be disposed of depends on the manner in which they were seized; specifically, Section 41-29-177 provides for the manner in which a weapon that has been seized and forfeited under the Uniform Controlled Substances Law should be disposed of; for all other deadly weapons that are seized, Section 45-9-151 should be followed; Section 21-39-21 is a general statute with regard to lost, stolen, abandoned or misplaced property, but Section 45-9-151 is specific to deadly weapons and therefore the more specific statute should be followed.

       Circuit court properly denied a trainee’s motion to cite the State Fire Academy for contempt of court because any grievance the trainee could have with his certificate was a separate administrative issue, which the Legislature expressly conferred upon the Academy, completely outside the circuit court’s order; thus, the trainee could not use his motion for contempt, based on that order, to prompt judicial review of the Academy’s decision.

      <p>
       Dismissal of a cause of action brought by a firefighter trainee who sought certification upon the completion of a training program at a firefighter academy was appropriate because the circuit court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction in that the firefighter trainee did not exhaust the firefighter trainee’s administrative remedies before seeking relief from the circuit court.

      It is the duty of every keeper or proprietor of a hotel or lodging house of over two (2) stories in height to provide and securely fasten in every lodging room above the second story which has an outside window and is used for the accommodation of guests or employees, a rope or rope ladder, for the escape of the lodgers therein in case of fire, of at least one inch (1") in diameter, which shall be fastened therein as near a window as practicable, and of sufficient length to reach therefrom to the ground on the outside of the hotel or lodging house, and made of strong material and as secure against becoming inflamed as practicable. Such rope or rope ladder shall be kept in good repair and condition. In lieu of a rope or rope ladder, there may be substituted any other appliance that may be deemed of equal or greater utility by the fire department or authority having control of the fire regulations of the city or town where such hotel or lodging house is located; but such appliance shall in all cases be so constructed as to be under the control and management of any lodger.

      The Legislature finds that the specialized and hazardous nature of fire fighting requires that fire fighters possess the requisite knowledge and demonstrate the ability to perform certain skills to carry out their responsibilities. The activities of fire fighters are important to the health, safety and welfare of the people of this state and are of such a nature to require education and training of a professional nature. It is the intent of the Legislature to require and provide minimum standards for training and to declare that the State Fire Academy is the principal facility for such purposes.

       This section codifies duty of person having possession and control of dangerous explosives to exercise highest degree of care, so that utmost caution must be used to ensure that no harm comes to other persons coming in contact with them.

      </p>
      <p>
       In action for wrongful death and personal injury to children killed or injured by explosion of Army rocket with which they were playing on private property, evidence failed to present sufficient facts for court to determine liability of defendant United States under statute requiring person engaged in business of using explosives to keep such items under control and secure from theft or pilferage, as evidence did not permit reasoned evaluation and determination of circumstances and events surrounding removal of rocket from Army camp or other military installation; mere fact that it appeared at private residence does not necessarily imply statute was violated. Moreover, occurrence of theft does not necessarily establish violation of section. Also, in absence of proof as to date of removal of rocket from government property, court could not determine if removal occurred prior to effective date of statute. Breland ex rel. Breland v. United States, 791 F. Supp. 1128, 1990 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19934 (S.D. Miss. 1990).

     </h3>
     <p>
      The Legislature finds that the transportation of radioactive waste poses a potential threat to the health and safety of the people of Mississippi. The protection of public health and safety in the event of a transportation accident involving radioactive waste requires the preparation of emergency response procedures and the training of public safety officials in the proper response to such an incident. The costs of radiological emergency response planning for transportation accidents should properly be borne by shippers of radioactive waste.

       Section 45-15-3 is designed not only to protect workers performing activities in close proximity to high power lines at the time they are performing that activity, but also to protect all other persons from the creation of a dangerous condition as a result of the erection of a building.

       The mere fact that one unintentionally, but negligently, violates this section [Code 1942, § 7015-12], by bringing equipment within eight feet of a high voltage overhead electric power line does not mean that he has committed a misdemeanor, and moreover if one violates this statute, this act alone does not insulate the power company against its own negligence in failing to exercise due care in properly constructing its lines and maintaining and inspecting them so as to keep them in a safe condition.

    Authorization of execution of compact; terms of compact.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The Legislature of the State of Mississippi hereby authorizes the Governor of the State of Mississippi to enter into a compact on behalf of the State of Mississippi with any other state legally joining therein, in the form substantially as follows:
     </p>
     <p>
      EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT ASSISTANCE COMPACT
     </p>
     <p>
      ARTICLE I — PURPOSE AND AUTHORITIES
     </p>
     <p>
      This compact is made and entered into by and between the participating member states which enact this compact, hereinafter called party states. For the purposes of this agreement, the term “states” is taken to mean the several states, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, and all United States territorial possessions.
     </p>
     <p>
      The purpose of this compact is to provide for mutual assistance between the states entering into this compact in managing any emergency or disaster that is duly declared by the Governor of the affected state(s), whether arising from natural disaster, technological hazard, man-made disaster, civil emergency aspects of resources shortages, community disorders, insurgency, or enemy attack.
     </p>
     <p>
      This compact shall also provide for mutual cooperation in emergency-related exercises, testing, or other training activities using equipment and personnel simulating performance of any aspect of the giving and receiving of aid by party states or subdivisions of party states during emergencies, such actions occurring outside actual declared emergency periods. Mutual assistance in this compact may include the use of the states’ National Guard forces, either in accordance with the National Guard Mutual Assistance Compact or by mutual agreement between states.
     </p>
     <p>
      ARTICLE II — GENERAL IMPLEMENTATION
     </p>
     <p>
      Each party state entering into this compact recognizes many emergencies transcend political jurisdictional boundaries and that intergovernmental coordination is essential in managing these and other emergencies under this compact. Each state further recognizes that there will be emergencies which require immediate access and present procedures to apply outside resources to make a prompt and effective response to such an emergency. This is because few, if any, individual states have all the resources they may need in all types of emergencies or the capability of delivering resources to areas where emergencies exist.
     </p>
     <p>
      The prompt, full and effective utilization of resources of the participating states, including any resources on hand or available from the federal government or any other source, that are essential for the safety, care and welfare of the people in the event of any emergency or disaster declared by a party state, shall be the underlying principle on which all articles of this compact shall be understood.
     </p>
     <p>
      On behalf of the Governor of each state participating in the compact, the legally designated state official who is assigned responsibility for emergency management will be responsible for formulation of the appropriate interstate mutual aid plans and procedures necessary to implement this compact.
     </p>
     <p>
      ARTICLE III — PARTY STATE RESPONSIBILITIES
     </p>
     <p>
      A. It shall be the responsibility of each party state to formulate procedural plans and programs for interstate cooperation in the performance of the responsibilities listed in this article. In formulating such plans, and in carrying them out, the party states, insofar as practical, shall:
     </p>
     <p>
      i. Review individual state hazards analyses and, to the extent reasonably possible, determine all those potential emergencies the party states might jointly suffer, whether due to natural disaster, technological hazard, man-made disaster, emergency aspects of resource shortages, civil disorders, insurgency, or enemy attack.
     </p>
     <p>
      ii. Review party states’ individual emergency plans and develop a plan which will determine the mechanism for the interstate management and provision of assistance concerning any potential emergency.
     </p>
     <p>
      iii. Develop interstate procedures to fill any identified gaps and to resolve any identified inconsistencies or overlaps in existing or developed plans.
     </p>
     <p>
      iv. Assist in warning communities adjacent to or crossing the state boundaries.
     </p>
     <p>
      v. Protect and assure uninterrupted delivery of services, medicines, water, food, energy and fuel, search and rescue, and critical lifeline equipment, services and resources, both human and material.
     </p>
     <p>
      vi. Inventory and set procedures for the interstate loan and delivery of human and material resources, together with procedures for reimbursement or forgiveness.
     </p>
     <p>
      vii. Provide, to the extent authorized by law, for temporary suspension of any statutes or ordinances that restrict the implementation of the above responsibilities.
     </p>
     <p>
      B. The authorized representative of a party state may request assistance of another party state by contacting the authorized representative of that state. The provisions of this agreement shall only apply to requests for assistance made by and to authorized representatives. Requests may be verbal or in writing. If verbal, the request shall be confirmed in writing within thirty (30) days of the verbal request. Requests shall provide the following information:
     </p>
     <p>
      i. A description of the emergency service function for which assistance is needed, such as, but not limited to, fire services, law enforcement, emergency medical, transportation, communications, public works and engineering, building inspection, planning and information assistance, mass care, resource support, health and medical services, and search and rescue.
     </p>
     <p>
      ii. The amount and type of personnel, equipment, materials and supplies needed, and a reasonable estimate of the length of time they will be needed.
     </p>
     <p>
      iii. The specific place and time for staging of the assisting party’s response and a point of contact at that location.
     </p>
     <p>
      C. There shall be frequent consultation between state officials who have assigned emergency management responsibilities and other appropriate representatives of the party states with affected jurisdictions and the United States Government, with free exchange of information, plans and resource records relating to emergency capabilities.
     </p>
     <p>
      ARTICLE IV — LIMITATIONS
     </p>
     <p>
      Any party state requested to render mutual aid or conduct exercises and training for mutual aid shall take such action as is necessary to provide and make available the resources covered by this compact in accordance with the terms hereof; provided that it is understood that the state rendering aid may withhold resources to the extent necessary to provide reasonable protection for such state. Each party state shall afford to the emergency forces of any party state, while operating within its state limits under the terms and conditions of this compact, the same powers (except that of arrest unless specifically authorized by the receiving state), duties, rights and privileges as are afforded forces of the state in which they are performing emergency services. Emergency forces will continue under the command and control of their regular leaders, but the organizational units will come under the operational control of the emergency services authorities of the state receiving assistance. These conditions may be activated, as needed, only subsequent to a declaration of a state of emergency or disaster by the Governor of the party state that is to receive assistance or commencement of exercises or training for mutual aid and shall continue so long as the exercises or training for mutual aid are in progress, the state of emergency or disaster remains in effect or loaned resources remain in the receiving state(s), whichever is longer.
     </p>
     <p>
      ARTICLE V — LICENSES AND PERMITS
     </p>
     <p>
      Whenever any person holds a license, certificate or other permit issued by any party state to the compact evidencing the meeting of qualifications for professional, mechanical or other skills, and when such assistance is requested by the receiving party state, such person shall be deemed licensed, certified or permitted by the state requesting assistance to render aid involving such skill to meet a declared emergency or disaster, subject to such limitations and conditions as the Governor of the requesting state may prescribe by executive order or otherwise.
     </p>
     <p>
      ARTICLE VI — LIABILITY
     </p>
     <p>
      Officers or employees of a party state rendering aid in another state pursuant to this compact shall be considered agents of the requesting state for tort liability and immunity purposes; and no party state or its officers or employees rendering aid in another state pursuant to this compact shall be liable on account of any act or omission in good faith on the part of such forces while so engaged or on account of the maintenance or use of any equipment or supplies in connection therewith. Good faith in this article shall not include willful misconduct, gross negligence or recklessness.
     </p>
     <p>
      ARTICLE VII — SUPPLEMENTARY AGREEMENTS
     </p>
     <p>
      Inasmuch as it is probable that the pattern and detail of the machinery for mutual aid among two (2) or more states may differ from that among the states that are party hereto, this instrument contains elements of a broad base common to all states, and nothing herein contained shall preclude any state from entering into supplementary agreements with another state or affect any other agreements already in force between states. Supplementary agreements may comprehend, but shall not be limited to, provisions for evacuation and reception of injured and other persons and the exchange of medical, fire, police, public utility, reconnaissance, welfare, transportation and communications personnel and equipment and supplies.
     </p>
     <p>
      ARTICLE VIII — COMPENSATION
     </p>
     <p>
      Each party state shall provide for the payment of compensation and death benefits to injured members of the emergency forces of that state and representatives of deceased members of such forces in case such members sustain injuries or are killed while rendering aid pursuant to this compact, in the same manner and on the same terms as if the injury or death were sustained within their own state.
     </p>
     <p>
      ARTICLE IX — REIMBURSEMENT
     </p>
     <p>
      Any party state rendering aid in another state pursuant to this compact shall be reimbursed by the party state receiving such aid for any loss or damage to or expense incurred in the operation of any equipment and the provision of any service in answering a request for aid and for the costs incurred in connection with such requests; provided, that any aiding party state may assume in whole or in part such loss, damage, expense or other cost, or may loan such equipment or donate such services to the receiving party state without charge or cost; and provided further, that any two (2) or more party states may enter into supplementary agreements establishing a different allocation of costs among those states. Article VIII expenses shall not be reimbursable under this provision.
     </p>
     <p>
      ARTICLE X — EVACUATION
     </p>
     <p>
      Plans for the orderly evacuation and interstate reception of portions of the civilian population as the result of any emergency or disaster of sufficient proportions to so warrant, shall be worked out and maintained between the party states and the emergency management/services directors of the various jurisdictions where any type of incident requiring evacuations might occur. Such plans shall be put into effect by request of the state from which evacuees come and shall include the manner of transporting such evacuees, the number of evacuees to be received in different areas, the manner in which food, clothing, housing and medical care will be provided, the registration of the evacuees, the providing of facilities for the notification of relatives or friends, and the forwarding of such evacuees to other areas or the bringing in of additional materials, supplies and all other relevant factors. Such plans shall provide that the party state receiving evacuees and the party state from which the evacuees come shall mutually agree as to reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses incurred in receiving and caring for such evacuees, for expenditures for transportation, food, clothing, medicines and medical care and like items. Such expenditures shall be reimbursed as agreed by the party state from which the evacuees come. After the termination of the emergency or disaster, the party state from which the evacuees come shall assume the responsibility for the ultimate support of repatriation of such evacuees.
     </p>
     <p>
      ARTICLE XI — IMPLEMENTATION
     </p>
     <p>
      A. This compact shall become operative immediately upon its enactment into law by any two (2) states; thereafter, this compact shall become effective as to any other state upon its enactment by such state.
     </p>
     <p>
      B. Any party state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing the same, but no such withdrawal shall take effect until thirty (30) days after the Governor of the withdrawing state has given notice in writing of such withdrawal to the Governors of all other party states. Such action shall not relieve the withdrawing state from obligations assumed hereunder prior to the effective date of withdrawal.
     </p>
     <p>
      C. Duly authenticated copies of this compact and of such supplementary agreements as may be entered into shall, at the time of their approval, be deposited with each of the party states and with the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other appropriate agencies of the United States government.
     </p>
     <p>
      ARTICLE XII — VALIDITY
     </p>
     <p>
      This compact shall be construed to effectuate the purposes stated in Article I hereof. If any provision of this compact is declared unconstitutional, or the applicability thereof to any person or circumstances is held invalid, the constitutionality of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to other persons and circumstances shall not be affected thereby.
     </p>
     <p>
      ARTICLE XIII — ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS
     </p>
     <p>
      Nothing in this compact shall authorize or permit the use of military force by the National Guard of a state at any place outside that state in any emergency for which the President is authorized by law to call into federal service the militia, or for any purpose for which the use of the Army or the Air Force would in the absence of express statutory authorization be prohibited under Section 1385 of Title 18, United States Code.

      On and after the effective date of the rules and regulations first promulgated by the board, each boiler and pressure vessel used or proposed to be used within this state, except boilers or pressure vessels exempt under Section 45-23-15, shall be thoroughly inspected as to their construction, installation and condition as follows:
     </p>
     <p>
      Power boilers and high pressure, high temperature water boilers shall receive a certificate inspection annually or as the board may require and shall also be externally inspected annually while under pressure if possible.
     </p>
     <p>
      Heating boilers shall receive a certificate inspection biennially.
     </p>
     <p>
      Pressure vessels subject to internal corrosion shall receive a certificate inspection biennially.
     </p>
     <p>
      Pressure vessels not subject to internal corrosion shall receive a certificate inspection at intervals set by the board, but internal inspection shall not be required of pressure vessels, the contents of which are known to be noncorrosive to the material of which the shell, heads or fittings are constructed, either from the chemical composition of the contents or from evidence that the contents are adequately treated with a corrosion inhibitor, or from evidence that the vessel parts are isolated from the contents with a corrosion resistant lining, provided that such vessels are constructed in accordance with the rules and regulations of the board, and provided further that evidence proving noncorrosiveness is approved by the board.
     </p>
     <p>
      Nuclear vessels within the scope of this chapter shall be inspected and reported in such form and with such appropriate information as the board shall designate.
     </p>
     <p>
      A grace period of two (2) months beyond the periods specified in paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d) may elapse between certificate inspections.
     </p>
     <p>
      The board may, in its discretion, permit longer periods between certificate inspections.
     </p>
     <p>
      Under the provisions of this chapter, the board shall provide for the safety of life, limb and property, and therefore has jurisdiction over the interpretation and application of the inspection requirements as provided for in the rules and regulations which they have promulgated. Inspection during construction and installation shall certify as to the minimum requirements for safety. Inspection requirements of operating equipment shall be in accordance with generally accepted practice and compatible with the actual service conditions, such as: (i) previous experience, based on records of inspection, performance and maintenance; (ii) location, with respect to personnel hazard; (iii) quality of inspection and operating personnel; (iv) provision for related safe operation controls; (v) interrelation with other operations outside the scope of this chapter.
     </p>
     <p>
      Based upon documentation of such actual service conditions by the owner or user of the operating equipment, the board may, in its discretion, permit variations in inspection requirements.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The Legislature finds and declares that a more effective administrative structure now is required to control the collection, storage, dissemination and use of criminal offender record information. These improvements in the organization and control of criminal offender record keeping are imperative both to strengthen the administration of criminal justice and to assure appropriate protection of rights of individual privacy. The purposes of this chapter are (a) to control and coordinate criminal offender record keeping within this state; (b) to assure periodic reporting to the Governor and Legislature concerning such record keeping; and (c) to establish a more effective administrative structure for the collection, maintenance, retrieval and dissemination of criminal history record information described in this chapter, consistent with those principles of scope and security prescribed by this chapter, and to facilitate the practical use of criminal offender record information within the criminal justice system.

Accordingly, a petitioner who pled guilty to the felony of burglary might have been eligible for relief pursuant to §§ 99-15-57 and 99-15-26 if his guilty plea had occurred on or after October 1, 1982, that being the earliest date to satisfy the “within 6 months prior to” March 31, 1983, requirement of § 99-15-57. However, the petitioner pleaded guilty to burglary on October 9, 1979, 3 years prior to October 1, 1982, and admitted that he did not fall within the criterion in any of the statutes authorizing expungement, and thus the trial court did not err in denying his petition for expungement.

    Review or challenge of criminal offender records; correction of errors in records.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The center shall make a person’s criminal records available for inspection by him or his attorney upon written request. Prior to inspection, the person must submit a set of fingerprints, sign a written authorization for the records check, and provide any other identifying information required by the center. Should such person or his attorney contest the accuracy of any portion of such records, the center shall make available to such person or his attorney a copy of the contested record upon written application identifying the portion of the record contested and showing the reason for the contest of accuracy. Forms, procedures, fees, identification and other related aspects pertinent to such access may be prescribed by the center in making access available.
     </p>
     <p>
      If an individual believes such information to be inaccurate or incomplete, he may request the original agency having custody or control of the records to purge, modify or supplement them and to so notify the center of such changes. Should the agency decline to so act or should the individual believe the agency’s decision to be otherwise unsatisfactory, the individual or his attorney may within thirty (30) days of such decision enter an appeal to the county or circuit court of the county of his residence or to such court in the county where such agency exists. The court in each such case shall conduct a de novo hearing and may order such relief as it finds to be required by law. Such appeals shall be entered in the same manner as other appeals are entered.
     </p>
     <p>
      Should the record in question be found to be inaccurate or incomplete, the court shall order it to be appropriately expunged, modified or supplemented by an explanatory notation. Each agency or individual in the state with custody, possession or control of any such record shall promptly cause each and every copy thereof in his custody, possession or control to be altered in accordance with the court’s order. Notification of each such deletion, amendment and supplementary notation shall be promptly disseminated to any individuals or agencies to which the records in question have been communicated as well as to the individual whose records have been ordered so altered. The center shall not be held liable for the failure to modify, supplement, destroy or expunge records if an agency or court fails to forward to the center proper documentation ordering such action.

       § 45-33-21.
    Legislative findings and declaration of purpose.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The Legislature finds that the danger of recidivism posed by criminal sex offenders and the protection of the public from these offenders is of paramount concern and interest to government. The Legislature further finds that law enforcement agencies’ efforts to protect their communities, conduct investigations, and quickly apprehend criminal sex offenders are impaired by the lack of information shared with the public, which lack of information may result in the failure of the criminal justice system to identify, investigate, apprehend, and prosecute criminal sex offenders.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Legislature further finds that the system of registering criminal sex offenders is a proper exercise of the state’s police power regulating present and ongoing conduct. Comprehensive registration and periodic address verification will provide law enforcement with additional information critical to preventing sexual victimization and to resolving promptly incidents involving sexual abuse and exploitation. It will allow law enforcement agencies to alert the public when necessary for the continued protection of the community.
     </p>
     <p>
      Persons found to have committed a sex offense have a reduced expectation of privacy because of the public’s interest in safety and in the effective operation of government. In balancing offenders’ due process and other rights, and the interests of public security, the Legislature finds that releasing such information about criminal sex offenders to the general public will further the primary governmental interest of protecting vulnerable populations and, in some instances the public, from potential harm.
     </p>
     <p>
      Therefore, the state’s policy is to assist local law enforcement agencies’ efforts to protect their communities by requiring criminal sex offenders to register, to record their addresses of residence, to be photographed and fingerprinted, and to authorize the release of necessary and relevant information about criminal sex offenders to the public as provided in this chapter, which may be referred to as the Mississippi Sex Offenders Registration Law.

       Because a juvenile’s adjudication of delinquency for the strict-liability crime of sexual battery against a victim under the age of fourteen involved the use of force, the juvenile had to register as a sex offender. The requirement to register as a sex offender did not punish the juvenile, but protected the public from repeat offenses. L.B.C. v. Forrest Cty. Youth Court, — So.3d —, 2017 Miss. LEXIS 443 (Miss. Nov. 30, 2017).

       Statute and the federal statutes are not in “conflict” such that the statute violated defendant’s constitutional rights; rather, the Legislature decided to expand the definitions found in the federal statutes to include, as a sex offense subject to classification and registration, the crime of kidnapping a minor under the age of sixteen, and the Legislature’s expansion of the sex-offender registration laws is permissible. Thomas v. Miss. Dep't of Corr., 248 So.3d 786, 2018 Miss. LEXIS 129 (Miss. 2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       Circuit court did not err in denying defendant’s petition for relief from registrations as a sex offender because defendant did not meet the exemption to the registration requirement set forth in subsection (h)(ii); defendant’s crime of statutory rape constituted a registrable offense, subject to the registration requirements. Williams v. State, 161 So.3d 1124, 2015 Miss. App. LEXIS 197 (Miss. Ct. App. 2015).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant failed to provide any evidence or argument to support his claim that he was not required to register in the State of California, and the record lacked any indication that defendant had received a certificate of rehabilitation in California. Based on the record before the Supreme Court, defendant’s conviction was a registrable offense. Witten v. State ex rel. Miss. Dep't of Pub. Safety, 145 So.3d 625, 2014 Miss. LEXIS 308 (Miss. 2014).

       Expungement of a misdemeanor, fourth-degree, sexual-offense conviction in Maryland by the court that entered the conviction entitled defendant to relief from his duty to register as a sex offender in Mississippi because, at the moment defendant’s Maryland conviction was expunged, the law provided that he was restored to the status he had occupied before he was convicted, which meant that – in the eyes of the law – he had no conviction for a registrable sexual offense, and, without such conviction, he had no duty to register as a sex offender.

       Mississippi Department of Corrections requiring defendant to serve his full, fifteen-year sentence, consistent with the statute, imposed by the circuit court, was not an extension or increase in defendant’s sentence because the denial of any reduction to his sentence was not equivalent the Department “resentencing” him. Thomas v. Miss. Dep't of Corr., 248 So.3d 786, 2018 Miss. LEXIS 129 (Miss. 2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       Circuit court did not err in affirming the denial of defendant’s claim that he he was being improperly classified as a sex offender and was entitled to trusty time or meritorious earned time because defendant’s conviction for kidnapping a minor under the age of sixteen made him ineligible for parole and ineligible for any reduction in his sentence.

       Because a juvenile’s adjudication of delinquency for the strict-liability crime of sexual battery against a victim under the age of fourteen involved the use of force, the juvenile had to register as a sex offender. Force was presumed as a child could not consent to sexual battery by operation of law. L.B.C. v. Forrest Cty. Youth Court, — So.3d —, 2017 Miss. LEXIS 443 (Miss. Nov. 30, 2017).

      <p>
       Circuit court erred in denying defendant’s post-trial motions because there were innumerable ways to violate the sex-offender-registration statutes, defendant’s indictment provided no specific facts, much less the essential facts, as to how he allegedly violated the statute, defendant was not provided notice as to how he failed to register or reregister as a sex offender, could not have prepared a defense, and was exposed to the possibility of being prosecuted for the same action or inaction.

       Substantial evidence supported the jury’s verdict finding defendant guilty of failing to register as a sex offender because the sex-offender registration forms reflected defendant initialed the forms as acknowledging that he received them; defendant’s girlfriend testified that defendant could indeed read and write and that she had previously accompanied Caves when he re-registered as a sex offender, and the records clerk testified that she read the sex-offender registration forms to him.

      <p>
       The 2006 amendment inserted “or for a person whose duty to register arose in another jurisdiction, the county in which the registrant resides” following “sentencing jurisdiction” in (2); added “or designation as a sexual predator in another jurisdiction” at the end of (2)(b)(vi); rewrote (2)(d); added (2)(f) and (2)(g); in (3), added “and the court is otherwise satisfied that the petitioner is not a current or potential threat to public safety” at the end of the second sentence, and added the last three sentences; and rewrote the first sentence in (4).
      </p>
      <p>
       The 2007 amendment, in (2)(a), substituted “twenty-five (25) years” for “ten (10) years” and “twenty-five-year” for “ten-year” twice, and deleted “or state” following “any other jurisdiction”; in (2)(b), added (vi) through (viii) and redesignated former (vi) as present (ix); added (2)(c) and redesignated former (2)(c) through (g) as present (2)(d) through (h); in (2)(f), substituted “A first-time
       <i>
        offender
       </i>
       fourteen (14) years of age or older” for “An offender twice,” deleted “not” preceding “be eligible for,” and added the language following “duty to register” at the end; and added (5).
      </p>
      <p>
       The 2011 amendment rewrote (2)(a); added (2)(b) through (d); and deleted former (5) which read: “The Department of Public Safety shall maintain an Internet site in a manner that will permit the public to obtain relevant information for each sex offender in the registry. The Web site shall permit the public to obtain relevant information for each offender by a single query for any given zip code or geographic radius set by the user, such as a municipality or county. The Department of Public Safety shall participate in the Dru Sjodin National Sex Offender Public Web site.”
      </p>
      <p>
       The 2013 amendment, effective January 1, 2014, in (2), substituted “required” for “having a duty” and inserted “for a registrable sex offense”; inserted “registrable” in (2)(b)(i), (2)(c)(i), (2)(d) and (2)(e); added (2)(b)(i)2 through 4, 6 and 7; deleted (2)(c)(i)5, relating to Section 97-29-45 and added (2)(c)(i)7 and 8; added (2)(d)(v) and (xvi), and deleted (2)(d)(x) relating to Section 97-29-3 and deleted former (2)(d)(xvi) which read “A first-time offender fourteen (14) years of age or older adjudicated delinquent in a youth court for the crime of rape pursuant to Section 96-3-65, or sexual battery pursuant to Section 97-3-95, is subject to lifetime registration but shall be eligible to petition to be relieved of the duty to register after twenty-five (25) years of registration”; added (5); and made minor stylistic changes throughout.

       The release of any sex offender information, including information available on the Department of Public Safety’s website, for a profit is prohibited; thus, it would violate the statute for a private company to charge a fee for a notification function which would send an alert by e-mail to registered member residents informing them that a new offender has moved within their geographic proximity and advising members to check the department’s web site for detailed information concerning the offender. 2001 Miss.

      <p>
       In a case expunging a misdemeanor, fourth-degree, sexual-offense conviction in Maryland by the court that entered the conviction, because this statute said nothing about an order that expunged a conviction, but, rather, it spoke to laws and orders affecting the maintenance of criminal history records, the supreme court declined to stretch this document-management, record-keeping statute beyond its provisions and apply it to an expungement of a conviction case.

      In addition to any other monetary penalties and other penalties imposed by law, any county or municipality by ordinance may assess an additional surcharge in an amount not to exceed Two Dollars ($2.00) on each person upon whom a county, justice or municipal court imposes a fine or other penalty for any misdemeanor other than offenses relating to vehicular parking or registration if there is established to the benefit of the citizens of the county or municipality a local crime stoppers program which is not authorized to receive funds under local and private legislation. The proceeds from the surcharge may be used by a county or municipality only to fund that county’s or municipality’s support of the local crime stoppers program as authorized by Section 45-39-15, Mississippi Code of 1972. The proceeds from the surcharge imposed by this section shall be deposited into a special fund in the Department of Public Safety’s Office of Public Safety Planning which shall promulgate rules and procedures relating to the administration of the special fund and the disbursement of monies in the fund to participating counties and municipalities. The maximum amount that a county or municipality may receive from the special fund shall be an amount equal to the deposits made into the fund by that entity, less one percent (1%) to be retained by the Office of Public Safety Planning to defray the costs of administering the special fund.
