       In view of the powers and duties vested in the port commissioners with respect to control over port and harbor facilities, it could not be said that a municipality owned warehouses, constructed by it, in a proprietary capacity rather than a public and governmental capacity, so as to preclude a suit by the state tax collector on behalf of the municipality to collect charges due on a contract for rental of such municipal warehouses.

      It shall be the duty of the commission to keep a minute book in which shall be recorded all of their acts, orders, rules and regulations. It shall be the duty of said commission to adopt rules and regulations not inconsistent with law to govern their official acts. The commissioners are hereby empowered and authorized to act as port wardens and pilot commissioners, and to perform any and all duties pertaining to such within their respective municipalities. It shall be the duty of the commission to make and publish all needful rules and regulations to govern the harbor, docks and passes within their respective jurisdictions, and to fix and prescribe tariffs, fees, fines, penalties and forfeitures for the violations of the rules and regulations of said commission, and said commission shall have the power to fix and determine all port and terminal charges, and they may enforce the collection thereof through any court of competent jurisdiction in this state. This section shall not apply to public utilities nor to railroad terminal charges covered by or carried in approved tariffs authorized by the Interstate Commerce Commission nor to lawful railroad operation and activities.
     </p>
     <p>
      It shall be the duty of the port commissioners within their respective jurisdictions to see that all port positions, such as harbormaster, pilots, boatmen, stevedores, surveyors, watchmen, police, ship chandlers, ship agents and such other persons performing services for the public shipping, carry out their duties in a manner that is not detrimental to the port and shall not be unduly burdensome to the public shipping.
     </p>
     <p>
      It shall be the duty of the commissioners to appoint annually a sufficient number of pilots, and all agents and factors necessary for the protection of the harbor and the advancement of public shipping, except that pilots shall be appointed for a term of four (4) years, and before any person shall be appointed a pilot, harbormaster, boatman, stevedore, surveyor, watchman, police, ship chandler or ship agent, his qualifications for the same shall be passed upon by said port commissioners. After satisfying themselves that any applicant for the position of pilot, harbormaster, boatman, stevedore, surveyor, watchman, police, ship chandler or ship agent is competent and well qualified to perform the duties of such position and his services are required for the protection of the harbor and the advancement of public shipping, the port commissioners shall issue a license to such applicant, provided and upon condition that such applicant shall enter into a good and sufficient bond in an amount in each case to be determined by the commissioners, the bond to be entered into not to exceed the sum of Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000.00), said bond to be payable to the city of the port of entry, conditioned according to law for the faithful performance of his duties, and in case of breach thereof, suit may be brought thereon in the name of the city for the benefit of said port commissioners. The port commissioners shall have the right to revoke any such license for neglect of duty, incompetency, inefficiency, physical disability or for any act or acts detrimental to the interests of the port. Additional pilots may be examined and licensed when in the opinion of said port commissioners the services of same are required for the protection of the harbor and the advancement of public shipping.

       Compulsory pilotage requirement applies to all vessels over 250 tons net registered tonnage entering Gulfport Ship Channel and not just to those entering vessels destined for Port at Gulfport. 1990 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 64.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because Legislature has authorized each of port commissions on coast to license their own pilots, it did not intend for pilots from one port (i.e., Gulfport) to have monopoly on pilotage; Authority may only compel vessels bound for Gulfport to take on one of its pilots. 1990 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 64.
      </p>
      <p>
       Port of destination or origination has authority to require that pilot be on board if vessel is bound for another port other than Gulfport, i.e., Biloxi, Pascagoula, etc. 1990 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 64.

      Should the election provided for in Sections 59-3-7 and 59-3-9 result in favor of the proposed bond issue, by a majority of those voting in said election voting in favor of the issuance of said bonds, the corporate authorities may issue such bonds, either in whole or in part, within one (1) year after the date of such election or within one (1) year after final favorable determination of any litigation affecting such bonds as they may deem best, and should said bonds be issued by the municipality without an election therefor as provided in the preceding section, then said bonds may be issued as herein provided. All bonds shall mature annually, with all maturities not longer than twenty (20) years, with not less than one-fiftieth (1/50) of the total issue to mature each year during the first five (5) years of the life of said bonds, and not less than one-twenty-fifth (1/25) of the said total issue to mature annually during the succeeding ten-year period of the life of said bonds, and the remainder to be divided into approximately equal payments, one (1) payment to mature during each year for the remaining life of the bonds. Said bonds shall not bear a greater rate of interest than that allowed in Section 75-17-101, Mississippi Code of 1972, payable semiannually, the denomination, form and place of payment to be fixed in the ordinance of the corporate authorities issuing said bonds, and they shall be prepared and signed by the mayor and clerk of said municipality with the seal of the municipality affixed thereto, but the coupons may only bear a facsimile signature of such mayor and clerk. Such bonds, when issued, shall constitute a lien on all the taxable property in such municipality and the corporate authorities shall annually levy a special tax on all such property sufficient to pay the principal and interest on such bonds as the same falls due.

The board may modify the proposed plan for the improvement, operation, development, or expansion of such port or harbor or any part thereof, and may impose such terms and conditions as, in its discretion, it may require to protect the interest of the state, provided that if an entire port or harbor shall be conveyed to the state that all bonds theretofore issued and outstanding for the improvement of such port or harbor by any county or city, or both acting jointly, or other authorized port or harbor agency, shall be redeemed by the issuance of bonds as herein provided or assumed in conjunction with the plan for the development of such port or harbor.

     <p>
      Any port or harbor, or any part thereof, and all facilities, structures, lands or other improvements, acquired by or conveyed to the state, shall be operated by the board acting through a state port authority for such port or harbor, except as may be otherwise provided in this chapter. Such state port authority shall be an agency of the state and shall be vested, in addition to the rights, powers and duties conferred hereunder, with the same jurisdiction and the same rights, powers and duties vested by law in the port commission or port authority or other authorized port or harbor agency having jurisdiction of such port or harbor under statutes in effect on the date of the conveyance of such port or harbor, or any part thereof, to the state. Such state port authority shall consist of five (5) qualified electors of the city or county in which such port or harbor is located. The initial terms of the members of such port authority shall be staggered, one (1) member thereof, to be appointed by the governing authorities of the municipality in which such port or harbor is located or adjacent to, to serve for an initial term of one (1) year, one (1) member thereof, to be appointed by the board of supervisors of the county in which such port or harbor is located, to serve for an initial term of two (2) years, and three (3) members thereof, to be appointed by the Governor, to serve for initial terms of three (3), four (4) and five (5) years respectively, but all succeeding appointments shall be for terms of five (5) years. The members of the state port authority shall organize in the same manner authorized by law for the port commission or port authority formerly having jurisdiction over such port or harbor, or any part thereof. Members of the state port authority shall be entitled to compensation pursuant to Section 25-3-69 and travel expenses pursuant to Section 25-3-41. In its operation of such port or harbor, or any part thereof, such state port authority shall not be responsible to the city or county, or other authorized port or harbor agency, in which such port or harbor, or any part thereof, may be located, but shall be responsible solely to the board, and the board shall have the same rights and duties and the same relationship toward such state port authority as is vested by law in the county, city or other authorized port or harbor agency in its relation to the port commission or port authority formerly having jurisdiction of such port or harbor, or part thereof. Before entering upon the duties of the office, each of said members shall take and subscribe to the oath of office required by Section 268 of the Constitution of the State of Mississippi, and shall file same with the secretary of state, and shall give bond in the sum of ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00), with a surety company or companies, authorized to do business in this state, conditioned according to law, and to be delivered to and approved by the treasurer of the State of Mississippi; the premiums on said bonds shall be paid from port funds.

      Any agreement reached between the board and the city or county, or city and county acting jointly, or authorized port or harbor agency shall be reduced to writing and set out the terms and conditions under which such planned development shall be completed, and shall specifically set out the maximum amount of bonds, if any, to be issued by the state for the completion of such planned development. No such agreement shall become effective until approved by a majority of the qualified electors of the city or county having jurisdiction of such port or harbor voting in an election called for that purpose in the same manner as in other city or county special elections. Any plan, agreement and contract which has been approved by the qualified electors of a county or municipality as herein provided, may be amended or supplemented to add additional projects thereto in the same manner as provided herein for the submission, modification and approval of the original plan, agreement and contract, save that instead of submitting such supplemental contract to the qualified electors of the county having jurisdiction of such port or harbor for approval, the governing body of the county or municipality shall, by the affirmative vote of two thirds (2/3) of all members of such governing body, adopt a resolution reciting the substantial terms of such supplemental contract and giving notice that such contract shall become effective on the date specified therein which shall be not less than twenty-five days from the date of the first publication of such resolution. Such resolution shall be published once a week for at least three successive weeks in the newspapers published and of general circulation within such county or municipality. The first of such publications shall be made at least twenty-one days prior to the date set forth in said resolution as the date upon which the supplemental contract shall become effective and the last of such publications shall be made not more than seven days prior to such date. If prior to the date set forth as aforesaid there shall be filed with the clerk of the governing body of the county or municipality a petition in writing signed by twenty per cent (20%) of the qualified electors of such county or municipality requesting an election on the question of whether or not such contract shall be effective, then such contract shall not become effective unless approved by a majority of the qualified electors of the county or municipality who vote therein at an election to be ordered by the appropriate governing body for that purpose. Notice of such election shall be given and such election shall be held and conducted in like manner as approved by law with respect to the submission of bond issues in the county or municipality. If the proposition so submitted shall fail to receive approval at such election, then such contract shall not become effective. If, however, no such petition shall be so filed, or if at such election, or subsequent election, such proposition be assented to by the majority of qualified electors voting therein then such contract shall become effective on the dates set forth in the resolution. Any such contract or supplemental contract shall require that any such city, county, or city and county acting jointly, or authorized port or harbor agency shall pledge all net revenues to be derived from the planned development to the payment of principal and interest on the bonds issued for such planned development, and shall further require such agency to pay the principal and interest on such bonds, and all premiums, fees, or other charges in connection therewith as the same shall mature or become due. The proceeds of any bonds issued for such planned development shall be expended only for the purposes set out in such approved contract. To meet the obligations imposed by this section, any such city, county, or city and county acting jointly, or authorized port or harbor agency is hereby authorized to appropriate therefor any surplus funds from any source available to said city or county, or both acting jointly, or to levy a tax therefor not to exceed five mills on all taxable property in said county or city, or both. The levies made under this provision shall not be reimbursed under the Homestead Exemption Law of 1946, being Sections 27-33-1 through 27-33-65, Mississippi Code of 1972. The ownership, operation and control of such planned development shall remain vested in the city, county, or other authorized port or harbor agency in such manner as is now or may hereafter be authorized by law.

      The board, acting jointly with the state port authority, is authorized to set aside, or lease all or portions of any lands, roads, docks, sheds, warehouses, elevators, compresses, floating dry docks, graving docks, marine railways, tugboats, or any other necessary or useful improvements constructed or acquired by it to individuals, firms, or corporations, public or private, for port, harbor, commercial or industrial purposes for a period not to exceed ninety-nine years, or to execute a conveyance of sale, except as otherwise limited by law, on such terms and conditions and with such safeguards as would best promote and protect the public interest. Any industrial lease of lands may be executed upon such terms and conditions and for such monetary rental or other consideration as may be found adequate and approved by the board in orders or resolutions authorizing the same. Any covenants and agreements of the lessee to make expenditures in determined amounts, and within such time or times, for improvements to be erected upon the land, by such lessee and to conduct thereon industrial and/or other operations in such aggregate payroll amounts and for such period of time as may be determined and defined in such lease, and to give preference in employment where practical to residents of the State of Mississippi, and to qualified residents of the city and of the county in which such port or harbor is located, shall if included in such lease constitute and be deemed sufficient consideration for the execution of any such lease in the absence of monetary rental or other considerations; and such instrument may contain reasonable provisions giving the lessee the right to remove its or his improvements upon the termination of the lease.

     <p>
      The proceeds of bonds issued under authority of this chapter shall be paid into a special fund or funds in banks qualified to act as depositories for the city or county in which the port or harbor is located, allocated in such equitable manner as the board may determine and such depositories shall qualify as such by depositing bonds or other securities authorized by law to secure deposits in state depositories. The proceeds of such bonds shall be used solely for payment of the cost of the planned development and the redeeming of any outstanding bonds and shall be disbursed upon order of the board with such restrictions, if any, as the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds may provide. If the proceeds of such bonds, by error of calculation or otherwise, shall be less than the cost of the planned development, and the redeeming of any outstanding bonds, unless otherwise provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds, additional bonds may in like manner be issued to provide the amount of such deficit which, unless otherwise provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of bonds, shall be deemed to be of the same issue and shall be entitled to payment from the same fund without preference or priority of the bonds first issued for the same purpose. If the proceeds of the bonds of any issue shall exceed the amount required for the purpose for which the bonds were issued, the surplus shall be paid into the fund established for the payment of the principal of and the interest on such bonds.

      For the purpose of this chapter, the term “Deep Draft Harbor and Terminal” means a structure, series of structures, or facility of any type located on the continental shelf off the coast designed to accommodate deep draft vessels whose draft is greater than the depths of the present United States’ harbors and waterways commonly used by oceangoing traffic, and includes all functionally-related structures and facilities which are necessary or useful to the operation of the terminal whether on land or seaward of the main structure or facility.

     <p>
      The governor, on behalf of this state, is hereby authorized to execute a compact, in substantially the form as provided hereinafter, with the State of Alabama.
     </p>
     <p>
      HISTORY:

       § 59-6-5.
    Basic form of compact.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The basic form of the compact shall be as follows:
     </p>
     <p>
      ARTICLE I. The purpose of this compact is to promote the development of a deep draft harbor and terminal to be located on the continental shelf of the United States, in the Gulf of Mexico, and to establish a joint interstate authority to assist in this effort.
     </p>
     <p>
      ARTICLE II. This compact shall become effective immediately upon ratification by the legislature of each state. Any state not mentioned in this section which is contiguous with any member state may become a party to this compact, subject to approval by the legislature of each of the member states.
     </p>
     <p>
      ARTICLE III. The states which are parties to this compact (hereinafter referred to as “party states”) do hereby establish and create a joint agency which shall be known as the Gulf Coast Superport Development Authority (hereinafter referred to as the “Authority”). The membership of which authority shall consist of the governor of each party state and five (5) other citizens of each party state, to be appointed by the governor thereof. Each appointive member of the authority shall be a citizen of that state who is interested in the promotion and development of deep draft harbor and terminals, and in the economic and industrial development of the south. The appointive members of the authority shall serve for terms of four (4) years each. Vacancies on the authority shall be filled by appointment by the governor for the unexpired portion of the term. The members of the authority shall not be compensated, but each shall be entitled to actual expenses incurred in attending meetings, or incurred otherwise in the performance of his duties as a member of the authority. The members of the authority shall hold regular quarterly meetings and such special meetings as its business may require. They shall choose annually a chairman and vice-chairman from among their members, and the chairmanship shall rotate each year among the party states in order of their acceptance of this compact. The secretary of the authority (hereinafter provided for) shall notify each member in writing of all meetings of the authority in such a manner and under such rules and regulations as the authority may prescribe. The authority shall adopt rules and regulations for the transaction of its business; and the secretary shall keep a record of all its business and shall furnish a copy thereof to each member of the authority. It shall be the duty of the authority, in general, to promote, encourage, and coordinate the efforts of the party states to secure the development of a Gulf Coast deep draft harbor and terminal. Toward this end, the authority shall have power to hold hearings; to conduct studies and surveys of all problems, benefits, and other matters associated with the development of a Gulf Coast deep draft harbor and terminal, and to make reports thereon; to acquire, by gift or otherwise, and hold and dispose of such money and property as may be provided for the proper performance of their function; to cooperate with other public or private groups, whether local, state, regional, or national, having an interest in the development of deep draft harbors and terminals; to formulate and execute plans and policies for emphasizing the purpose of this compact before the Congress of the United States and other appropriate offices and agencies of the United States; and to exercise such other powers as may be appropriate to enable it to accomplish its functions and duties in connection with the development of a deep draft harbor and terminal and to carry out the purposes of this compact.
     </p>
     <p>
      ARTICLE IV. The authority shall appoint an executive secretary, who shall be the compact administrator. His term of office shall be at the pleasure of the authority and shall receive such compensation as the authority shall prescribe. He shall maintain custody of the authority’s books, records, and papers, which he shall keep at the office of the authority, and he shall perform all functions and duties, and exercise all powers and authorities, that may be delegated to him by the authority.
     </p>
     <p>
      ARTICLE V. Each party state agrees that, when authorized by its legislature, it will from time to time make available and pay over to the authority such funds as may be required for the establishment and operation of the authority. The contribution of each party state shall be in the proportion that its population bears to the total population of the states which are parties hereto, as shown by the most recent official report of the United States Bureau of the Census, or upon such other basis as may be agreed upon.
     </p>
     <p>
      ARTICLE VI. Nothing in this compact shall be construed so as to conflict with any existing statute, or to limit the powers of any party state, or to repeal or prevent legislation, or to authorize or permit curtailment or diminution of any other harbor or terminal project, or to affect any existing or future cooperative arrangement or relationship between any federal agency or a party state.
     </p>
     <p>
      ARTICLE VII. This compact shall continue in force and remain binding upon each party state until the legislature or governor of each or either state takes action to withdraw therefrom; provided that such withdrawal shall not become effective until six (6) months after the date of the action taken by the legislature or governor. Notice of such action shall be given to the other party state or states by the secretary of state of the party state which takes such action.

All bonds shall mature annually, with all maturities not longer than twenty (20) years, with not less than one-fiftieth (1/50) of the total issue to mature each year during the first five (5) years of the life of said bonds, and not less than one-twenty-fifth (1/25) of the said total issue to mature annually during the succeeding ten-year period of the life of said bonds, and the remainder to be divided into approximately equal payments, one (1) payment to mature during each year of the remaining life of the bonds. Said bonds shall not bear a greater rate of interest than that allowed in Section 75-17-101, Mississippi Code of 1972, payable semiannually, the denomination and form and place of payment to be fixed in the ordinance of the corporate authorities issuing said bonds, and they shall be prepared and signed by the mayor and clerk of said municipality with the seal of the municipality affixed thereto, but the coupons may only bear a facsimile signature of such mayor and clerk. Such bonds when issued, shall constitute a lien on all the taxable property in such municipality and county and the corporate authorities shall annually levy a special tax on all such property sufficient to pay the principal and interest of such bonds as the same falls due, if there not be sufficient funds provided herein.

      All bonds authorized by Section 59-7-105 shall mature annually, with all maturities not longer than twenty (20) years, with not less than one-fiftieth (1/50) of the total issue to mature each year during the first five (5) years of the life of such bonds, not less than one-twenty-fifth (1/25) of the total issue to mature each year during the succeeding ten-year period of the life of such bonds, and the remainder to be divided into approximately equal annual payments, one (1) payment to mature each year for the remaining life of such bonds. Such bonds shall not bear a greater overall maximum interest rate to maturity than that allowed in Section 75-17-101, Mississippi Code of 1972. The denomination, form and place or places of payment of such bonds shall be fixed in the resolution or order of the board of supervisors issuing such bonds.

    Levy of special tax for payment of principal and interest on bonds; port bonds interest and sinking fund.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The board of supervisors of any county which shall have issued bonds under the provisions of this article shall, unless there be sufficient funds otherwise available therefor in the port bonds interest and sinking fund, annually levy a special tax upon all of the taxable property within such county at a rate which shall be sufficient to provide for the payment of the principal of and the interest on such bonds according to the terms thereof. All taxes thus collected shall be credited to a special fund in the county treasury of such county to be known and designated as the “port bonds interest and sinking fund,” and all sums credited to said fund shall be used to pay such bonds as they mature and the interest thereon as it accrues, and for no other purpose. It shall be the mandatory duty of such board of supervisors to transfer funds from said port fund to the port bonds interest and sinking fund in amounts sufficient to pay maturing principal and accruing interest on bonds issued hereunder, if balances standing to the credit of said port fund are sufficient for that purpose. To the extent that funds are thus made available for the payment of such bonds and the interest thereon, the special tax levy hereinabove provided for may be correspondingly reduced. The said bonds nevertheless shall be general obligations of the county issuing the same, and the full faith, credit and resources of such county shall be pledged to the payment thereof and the interest thereon.

    Resolution of intention to issue bonds; bond issue election generally.

     <p>
      Before issuing any bonds for any of the purposes herein enumerated, the board of supervisors shall adopt a resolution declaring its intention so to do, stating the amount of bonds proposed to be issued and the purpose for which the bonds are to be issued, and the date upon which the board proposes to direct the issuance of such bonds. Such resolution shall be published once a week for at least three consecutive weeks in at least one newspaper published in such county. The first publication of such resolution shall be made not less than twenty-one days prior to the date fixed in such resolution for the issuance of the bonds, and the last publication shall be made not more than seven days prior to such date. If no newspaper be published in such county, then such notice shall be given by publishing the resolution for the required time in some newspaper having a general circulation in such county and, in addition, by posting a copy of such resolution for at least twenty-one days next preceding the date fixed therein at three public places in such county. If twenty per cent (20%) of the qualified electors of the county shall file a written protest against the issuance of such bonds on or before the date specified in such resolution, then an election on the question of the issuance of such bonds shall be called and held as is herein provided. If no such protest be filed, then such bonds may be issued without an election on the question of the issuance thereof, at any time within a period of two years after the date specified in the above-mentioned resolution. However, the board of supervisors, in its discretion, may nevertheless call an election on such question, in which event it shall not be necessary to publish the resolution declaring its intention to issue such bonds as herein provided.

Such commission shall have jurisdiction over the port, terminals, harbors and passes leading thereto, and all vessels, boats and wharves, common carriers, and public utilities therein, using the same, within their respective counties. Such port commission shall be appointed as follows: one (1) member shall be appointed by the Governor, two (2) shall be appointed by the board of supervisors of the county, and two (2) shall be appointed by the governing body of the municipality which is the county seat of such county in such cases where the county seat of such county is situate on or adjacent to such port facilities, otherwise, four (4) members shall be appointed by the board of supervisors. A county and a municipality may by joint resolution dissolve a port commission created under this section which is governed by a commission with two (2) commissioners appointed by each. The joint resolution must provide that the municipality relinquishes its duties and obligations related to the port, and that the county assumes all duties and obligations related to the port. Any commission so dissolved shall be reconstituted to consist of five (5) members, one (1) member appointed from each supervisor district. The board of supervisors shall provide for staggered terms in its order providing for the appointment of the reconstituted port commission. Before entering upon the duties of the office, each of such commissioners shall take and subscribe to the oath of office required by Section 268 of the Constitution of the State of Mississippi, and shall give bond, to be approved by the board of supervisors, in the sum of Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000.00), conditioned upon the faithful performance of their duties. Such bond shall be made payable to the county and in case of breach thereof, suit may be brought on the relation of the county for the benefit of such port commission.

     <p>
      It shall be the duty of such port commission, from time to time, to make recommendations to the board of supervisors of such county concerning expenditures to be made for the improvement, promotion, development, construction, maintenance and operation of the harbor and port facilities of such county, and shall annually submit to such board of supervisors a proposed budget for the operation and maintenance of such harbor and port facilities, which recommendations and budget shall be subject to approval of the board of supervisors. Except as provided in Section 59-7-111, the port fund shall be subject to expenditure by the port commission.
     </p>
     <p>
      The port commission may recommend to the Legislative Budget Office, the State Fiscal Management Board, and the county board of supervisors that certain excess funds in the port fund be transferred to any industrial development authority within the county. Upon approval by the State Fiscal Management Board and the county board of supervisors, the port commission may transfer such excess funds, or any portion thereof which may be designated by the State Fiscal Management Board and county board of supervisors, as provided herein.
     </p>
     <p>
      The port commission in any county bordering the Mississippi River and having a population of more than fifty-one thousand (51,000) but less than fifty-two thousand (52,000) according to the 1980 federal census may recommend to the board of supervisors the expenditure of excess funds in the port fund for the acquisition of lands in the county to be used for industrial development purposes. Upon the acquisition of such lands, excess funds in the port fund may also be expended to provide necessary utilities and other improvements the board of supervisors deems necessary and requisite for industrial development. Any lands acquired hereunder shall be titled in the name of the county.
     </p>
     <p>
      For the purposes of this section, the term “excess funds” means monies determined to be in excess of those necessary to fund the budget for the fiscal year.

    Exercise of authority for issuance of bonds; form, terms and conditions of bonds; execution of bonds; negotiability and sale of bonds; disposition of proceeds of sale; payment of principal and interests on bonds.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The power to issue bonds or other obligations authorized by this article and Section 59-5-31, shall be vested in and may be exercised from time to time by the governing bodies of any municipality or county so authorized in such laws.
     </p>
     <p>
      Such revenue bonds may be issued without an election upon the adoption of a resolution of the board of supervisors of such county, declaring its intention to issue such bonds, and shall not be subject to any limitation as to amount, and shall not be included or computed in the statutory limitation of indebtedness of any such county. Such bonds shall bear date or dates, be in such denomination or denominations, bear interest at such rate or rates, be payable at such place or places within or without the State of Mississippi, shall mature at such time or times and upon such terms, with or without premium, shall bear such registration privileges, and shall be substantially in such form, all as shall be determined by resolution of the board of supervisors of such county. Such bonds shall mature in annual installments beginning not more than five years from date thereof and extending not more than thirty-five years from date thereof. Such bonds shall be signed by the president of the board of supervisors of such county, and the official seal of the county shall be affixed thereto, attested by the clerk of the board of supervisors of such county. The interest coupons to be attached to such bonds may be executed by the facsimile signatures of said officers. Whenever any such bonds shall have been signed by the officials herein designated to sign the bonds who were in office at the time of such signing but who may have ceased to be such officers prior to the sale and delivery of such bonds, or who may not have been in office on the date such bonds may bear, the signatures of such officers upon such bonds and coupons shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes and have the same effect as if the person so officially signing such bonds had remained in office until the delivery of the same to the purchaser or had been in office on the date such bonds may bear.
     </p>
     <p>
      All bonds and interest coupons issued under the provisions of this article shall have and are hereby declared to have all the qualities and incidents of negotiable instruments under the Mississippi Uniform Commercial Code. Such bonds and income therefrom shall be exempt from all taxation within the State of Mississippi.
     </p>
     <p>
      The board of supervisors of such county shall sell such bonds in such manner and for such price as it may determine to be for the best interest of said county, but no such sale shall be made at a price less than par plus accrued interest to date of delivery of the bonds to the purchaser. Notice of the sale of any such bonds shall be published at least one time not less than ten days prior to the date of sale and shall be published in a newspaper published in and having general circulation within the county.
     </p>
     <p>
      The proceeds of such bonds shall be paid into a special fund or funds in banks qualified to act as depositories for such county. The proceeds of such bonds shall be solely for the purposes for which they were issued, and the redeeming of any outstanding bonds, and shall be disbursed upon the order of the board of supervisors of such county, with such restrictions, if any, as the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds may provide. If the proceeds of such bonds, by error of calculation or otherwise, shall be less than the cost of the purpose for which they were issued, and the redeeming of any outstanding bonds, unless otherwise provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds, additional bonds may in like manner be issued to provide the amount of such deficit which, unless otherwise provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of bonds, shall be deemed to be of the same issue and shall be entitled to payment from the same fund without preference or priority of the bonds first issued for the same purpose. If the proceeds of the bonds of any issue shall exceed the amount required for the purpose for which the bonds were issued, the surplus shall be paid into the fund established for the payment of the principal of and the interest on such bonds.
     </p>
     <p>
      Such bonds may be issued without any other proceedings or the happening of any other conditions or things than those proceedings, conditions, and things which are specified or required by this article. The bonds authorized under the authority of this article may, in the discretion of the board of supervisors of such county, be validated in the chancery court of such county in the manner and with the force and effect provided by Sections 31-13-1 through 31-13-11, Mississippi Code of 1972, for the validation of county, municipal, school district, and other bonds.
     </p>
     <p>
      The revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this section shall be payable solely out of the revenues to accrue from the operation of such project, development, improvement or utility systems, and the full faith and credit of the county shall not be pledged therefor, nor shall any ad valorem tax be levied therefor.

The receipts from said one mill tax shall be withheld by the tax collector of said county, and/or by any other tax collecting agency authorized by law for the collection of said taxes, from receipts from state ad valorem taxes now in effect or which may be hereafter levied, so long as said state ad valorem taxes shall be not less than the said one mill tax herein levied. However, if no state ad valorem taxes equal to or greater than the said one mill tax herein levied is now or shall be hereafter levied, then and in that event, the said one mill tax herein levied shall continue to be levied and collected as herein provided in each such county or counties in or for each year in which the principal of or interest on any bonds or other obligations issued by any municipality pursuant to this article becomes due. The said tax collector, and/or any other tax collecting agency authorized by law for the collection of said taxes, shall pay over all moneys collected or to be collected as receipts from the one mill tax to any trustee or successor thereto established as hereinafter provided in Section 59-7-429, and in the event that there is no such trustee, then said tax collector, and/or any other tax collecting agency authorized by law for collection of said taxes, shall pay over all such moneys into the county depository of each such county to the credit of a fund which shall be known as a port fund. Any such moneys so paid into the county depository of each such county to the credit of said port fund may be expended at the direction of the port commission, appointed for any port or harbor through which commerce flows and having not less than eight industries engaged in the seafood industry. The provisions of this article shall be deemed to be a contract with the holders of any bonds or other obligations issued pursuant to this article.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The power to issue bonds or other obligations authorized by Section 59-7-415 shall be vested in, and may be exercised from time to time by the governing body of any such municipality described in said section. Such bonds or other obligations shall be authorized by resolution of the governing body of any such municipality and shall bear such date or dates, mature at such time or times, not exceeding twenty (20) years from their respective dates, be in such denomination, be in such form, either coupon or registered, carry such registration privileges, be executed in such a manner, be payable in such medium of payment, at such place or places, and be subject to such terms of prior redemption, with or without premium, as such resolution or resolutions may provide. Such bonds shall not bear a greater overall maximum interest rate to maturity than that allowed in Section 75-17-103. No bond shall bear more than one (1) rate of interest; each bond shall bear interest from its date to its stated maturity date at the interest rate specified in the bid; all bonds of the same maturity shall bear the same rate of interest from date to maturity; all interest accruing on such bonds so issued shall be payable semiannually or annually, except that the first interest coupon attached to any such bond may be for any period not exceeding one (1) year.
     </p>
     <p>
      No interest payment shall be evidenced by more than one (1) coupon and neither cancelled nor supplemental coupons shall be permitted. The lowest interest rate specified for any bonds issued shall not be less than seventy percent (70%) of the highest interest rate specified for the same bond issue. The interest rate of any one (1) interest coupon shall not exceed the maximum interest rate on such bonds.
     </p>
     <p>
      Each interest rate specified in any bid must be in multiples of one-eighth of one percent (1/8 of 1%) or in multiples of one-tenth of one percent (1/10 of 1%). Such bonds shall be executed by the manual or facsimile signature of the mayor and clerk of such municipality, with the seal of the municipality affixed thereto. At least one (1) signature on each bond shall be a manual signature, as specified in the resolution. The coupons may bear only the facsimile signatures of such mayor and clerk. Such bonds or other obligations may be sold at public or private sale for such price or prices as the governing body of such municipality shall determine, but in no case to exceed the rate of interest hereinbefore provided. No bonds shall be issued and sold under the provisions of this article for less than par and accrued interest.
     </p>
     <p>
      Such bonds or other obligations may be issued by any municipality described in Section 59-7-415 in a principal amount not exceeding Seven Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($7,500,000.00) outstanding at any one (1) time for any purpose or purposes authorized by Section 59-7-405. Such municipality shall have power, out of any funds available, to purchase any bonds or other obligations issued by it pursuant to this article, and all bonds or other obligations so purchased shall be cancelled, and no bonds or other obligations shall be issued in lieu thereof. In anticipation of the issuance of the definitive bonds authorized by this article, any such municipality may issue interim certificates. Such interim certificates shall be in such form, contain such terms, conditions or provisions, bear such date or dates, and evidence such agreement or agreements, relating to their discharge by payment or by the delivery of the definitive bonds, as such municipality, by resolution of its governing body, may determine. Any bonds, interim certificates or other obligations issued pursuant to this article shall be fully negotiable within the meaning and for all the purposes of the Mississippi Uniform Commercial Code, and may be validated as provided by statute.

      The proceeds of the revenue bonds shall be paid into a special fund designated as the “special project port improvement fund” in a bank or banks qualified as depositories for the county issuing bonds under the provisions of this article, and such proceeds shall be used solely for the purposes for which such bonds were issued, except as hereinafter provided, and shall be disbursed upon order of the board of supervisors of such county with such restrictions, if any, as the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds may provide. If the proceeds of such bonds, by error of calculation or otherwise, shall be less than the cost of the project for which such bonds were issued, and the redeeming of any outstanding bonds, unless otherwise provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds, additional bonds may in like manner be issued to provide the amount of such deficit which, unless otherwise provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds, shall be deemed to be of the same issue and shall be entitled to payment from the same funds without preference or priority of the bonds first issued for the same purpose. If the proceeds of the bonds of any issue shall exceed the amount required for the project for which the bonds were issued, such surplus shall be paid into the fund established for the payment of the principal of and interest on such bonds.

       A county, through its port authority, may make rules and regulations to assure compliance with a comprehensive plan in respect to an industrial park, and such rules and regulations may control the use and access of roads inside the park to the extent that such roads are not public roads, but there is no requirement that the board of supervisors approve the rules and regulations established by the port authority; the rules and regulations may restrict the unfettered access by the general public and, if someone enters the park after being instructed not to enter, or remains in the park after being instructed to leave, a charge of trespass or of disorderly conduct, or both, may lie, the determination of which must be based on the specific facts presented.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The board of supervisors of any county in which there has been created a county port authority or county development commission as provided in this chapter, acting through its county port authority or county development commission, shall have the following additional powers and authority:
     </p>
     <p>
      To set aside or lease all or portions of said harbor facilities, wharves, docks, sheds, warehouses, elevators, compresses, floating dry docks, graving docks, marine railways, tugboats or any necessary or useful improvements for special purposes for a term not exceeding ninety-nine (99) years.
     </p>
     <p>
      To sell, lease or otherwise dispose of tourism facilities, service facilities, shipyards, shipbuilding facilities, machinery and equipment, dredges, facilities and land acquired for industrial or harbor operations to individuals, firms or corporations, public or private, for industrial operations on such terms and conditions and with such safeguards as will best promote and protect the public interest, and they are hereby authorized to transfer possession and/or title to any part of all of such facilities and lands by deed, lease, contract or other customary business instrument; however, no such lease of land or facilities acquired for industrial operations shall be executed for a term in excess of ninety-nine (99) years from its date, and before the execution of the same any such deed, conveyance, lease, contract or other disposition shall be authorized by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the membership of such port authority or development commission by order or resolution entered on its minutes, which order or resolution shall set forth the substantial terms of such deed, conveyance, lease, contract or other disposition.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the letting of contracts and in the advertisement for bids thereon, for the development, construction, repair, maintenance or operation of any structures, facilities and lands required pursuant to any of the provisions of this chapter, the board of supervisors and the county port authority shall comply with all of the requirements of the general laws of the State of Mississippi governing the advertisement for bids and the letting of contracts by county boards of supervisors. In the event title to any such lands under jurisdiction of the port authority or development commission is in the name of the county, no such transaction shall be consummated until and unless the same be authorized by proper resolution of the port authority or development commission and of the county, in which event the county shall join the port authority or development commission in the execution of such instrument. Any such sale or lease may be executed upon such terms and conditions and for such monetary rental or other consideration as may be found adequate and approved by the county port authority or county development commission and the board of supervisors in orders or resolutions authorizing the same. Any covenants and obligations of the lessee or purchaser to make expenditures in determined amounts and within such time or times for improvements to be erected on the land by such lessee or purchaser and to conduct thereon industrial operations in such aggregate payroll amounts and for such period of time or times as may be determined and defined in such lease or conveyance, and to give preference in employment where practicable to qualified residents of the port of entry and of the county and/or state in which such port is situated, shall, if included in such lease or conveyance, constitute and be deemed sufficient consideration for the execution of any such lease or conveyance in the absence of a monetary rental or other considerations; any such lease may contain reasonable provisions giving the lessee the right to remove its or his improvements upon termination of the lease. Where the rentals provided in the lease will be sufficient to fully retire the cost of the particular facility or where the monetary consideration for a deed is sufficient to fully repay the cost of land acquired for industrial operations described in said deed, contracts for construction, repairs, maintenance and operation of the facility or for the sale of the land, may be negotiated and consummated without the necessity of advertising and obtaining competitive bids therefor. Such county, acting through the port authority or development commission, shall have the right to reclaim submerged lands for such purposes and shall also have the right to acquire by eminent domain proceedings, purchase or otherwise, any land or estate therein or property and rights that may be necessary for the purposes of this chapter, provided that land acquired for industrial operations by eminent domain shall be leased or shall be sold only with such provisions in the deed or lease as shall ensure that the use of the land shall be beneficial to the carrying out of the purposes of this chapter and the promotion of commerce through said port. The county, acting through the port authority or development commission, shall have no authority or power to acquire without the consent of the owner thereof any property operated or used for port, harbor or industrial operations, or for such purposes as the county, acting through the port authority or development commission, is authorized to acquire and use such property for, where such property has been sold or leased by the county, acting through the port authority or development commission, to any person, firm or corporation for industrial operations as provided in this chapter. In the exercise of eminent domain, the county, acting through the port authority or development commission, shall determine the amount and character of the land or estate therein thus to be acquired and the public necessity for such exercise and their determination shall be conclusive and shall not be subject to attack in the absence of manifold abuse of discretion or fraud on the part of said county in making such determination and said county, acting through the port authority or development commission, shall have all powers and authority vested in persons or corporations having the right of eminent domain by Sections 11-27-1 through 11-27-49 and all other statutes pertinent thereto.
     </p>
     <p>
      To accept assurances and other agreements from persons, firms and corporations who are benefited by any action of the port authority pursuant to this chapter, including agreements to save the county harmless on account of any assurances given by the county to the United States of America or any agency thereof, including the Secretary of the Army, and to enter into contracts with such persons, firms or corporations relative to the future development and use of property owned by such persons, firms or corporations.
     </p>
     <p>
      To obligate the county by contract with persons, firms and corporations owning or agreeing to purchase property in the area benefited by any action of the port authority under the provisions of this chapter for the construction, development, improvement or expansion of channels and other navigation projects by the county at its expense and the continued maintenance and operation thereof by the county at its expense for a period of time not to exceed ninety-nine (99) years, or so long as any such person, firm or corporation continues to use said property for industrial operations.
     </p>
     <p>
      To obtain liability insurance as deemed appropriate for the needs of the port authority or development commission. If liability insurance is in effect, the port authority or development commission may be sued by anyone affected to the extent of such insurance carried; however, immunity from suit is waived only to the extent of such liability insurance carried, and a judgment creditor shall have recourse only to the proceeds or right to proceeds of such liability insurance.
     </p>
     <p>
      To invest funds credited to the county development commission. A county development commission is vested with authority to designate depositories of its funds and to deposit its funds in insured, interest-bearing accounts or securities guaranteed by the good faith of the United States Treasury. All funds in excess of ninety (90) days’ operating expenses, to the extent practicable, shall be invested in United States Treasury bills, interest-bearing accounts insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or other securities of the United States Government including United States Treasury bills, notes and bonds, federal agency securities, mortgage-backed securities guaranteed as to repayment of principal by the United States Government, or repurchase agreements and mutual funds invested in obligations of the United States Government or its agencies and repurchase agreements fully collateralized by such obligations.

      </p>
      <p>
       Laws, 1985, ch. 500, § 1, referred to in this section, provides as follows:
      </p>
      <p>
       “In addition to the authority granted in House Bill 617, Regular Session of 1985 (Chapter 812); Senate Bill 2879, Regular Session of 1985 (Chapter 458); and House Bill 1142 (Chapter 879), Regular Session of 1985, and upon the execution of a lease agreement as provided in subsection (5) of Section 59-9-21, the State Bond Commission is hereby authorized and empowered to issue revenue bonds of the State of Mississippi for the purpose of constructing a surface action group base, and for the purpose of widening the East Pascagoula River channel to the extent that funds to be provided by the City of Pascagoula, Jackson County and the Jackson County Port Authority to widen such channel are not provided for such purpose. Such bonds shall not exceed the principal amount of Two Hundred Million Dollars ($200,000,000.00) and shall be secured by the lease agreement with the United States Navy or the United States Department of Defense, and such other additional security as may be required by the State Bond Commission and agreed to by the United States Navy or the United States Department of Defense. No such bonds shall be issued unless the lease is executed for a term sufficient to retire the bonds to be issued hereunder and it is clearly set forth therein that such bonds will be paid by the United States Government or an agency thereof and that there is no provision in the federal statutes which allows the termination of such lease by nonappropriation of funds for such purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(2) Such bonds shall bear date or dates, may be in such form and denominations, may be in fully registered form, may bear such conversion privileges and be payable in such installments and at such time or times not exceeding forty (40) years from the date thereof, may bear interest at such rate or rates, may be payable at such time or times and at such place or places within or without the State of Mississippi, may be redeemable prior to maturity at such time or times and upon such terms, with or without premium, and shall be substantially in such form, all as shall be determined by resolution of the State Bond Commission; however, such bonds shall not bear a greater overall maximum interest rate to maturity than that allowed in Section 75-17-103, Mississippi Code of 1972. The State Bond Commission shall sell such bonds on sealed bids at public sale, and for such price as it may determine to be for the best interest of the State of Mississippi, but no such sale shall be made at a price less than ninety-seven percent (97%) of par value plus accrued interest to date of delivery of the bonds to the purchaser. All interest accruing on such bonds so issued shall be payable semiannually or annually.
      </p>
      <p>
       “No bond issued hereunder shall bear more than one (1) rate of interest; each bond shall bear interest from its date to its stated maturity date at the interest rate specified on the bonds; all bonds of the same maturity shall bear the same rate of interest from date to maturity. All interest accruing on bonds issued hereunder shall be payable semiannually or annually, except that the first interest payment may be for any period not exceeding one (1) year. No interest payment on bearer bonds shall be evidenced by more than one (1) coupon and neither cancelled nor supplemental coupons shall be permitted. The lowest interest rate specified for any bonds issued shall not be less than sixty percent (60%) of the highest interest rate specified for the same bond issue. Each interest rate specified in any bid must be in multiples of either one-eighth of one percent (1/8 of 1%) or one-tenth of one percent (1/10 of 1%). If serial bonds, such bonds shall mature annually, and the first maturity date thereof shall not be more than five (5) years from the date of such bonds.
      </p>
      <p>
       “Notice of the sale of any such bonds shall be published at least one (1) time, the first of which shall be made not less than ten (10) days prior to the date of sale, and shall be so published in one or more newspapers having a general circulation in the City of Jackson and in one or more other newspapers or financial journals with a large national circulation, to be selected by the State Bond Commission.
      </p>
      <p>
       “Such bonds shall be signed by the Chairman of the State Bond Commission, or by his facsimile signature, and the official seal of the State Bond Commission shall be affixed thereto, attested by the Secretary of the State Bond Commission. The interest coupons, if any, to be attached to such bonds may be executed by the facsimile signatures of said officers. Whenever any such bonds shall have been signed by the officials herein designated to sign the bonds, who were in the office at the time of such signing but who may have ceased to be such officers prior to the sale and delivery of such bonds, or who may not have been in office on the date such bonds may bear, the signatures of such officers upon such bonds and coupons shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes and have the same effect as if the person so officially signing such bonds had remained in office until the delivery of the same to the purchaser, or had been in office on the date such bonds may bear.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(3) All bonds issued under this section shall be limited obligations of the State of Mississippi, the principal of, redemption premium, if any, and interest on which shall be payable solely from revenues derived for lease payments as provided in subsection (1) of this section and from such other funds as may be made available for such purpose by the lessee. Bonds and interest coupons, if any, issued under this section shall never constitute an indebtedness of the State of Mississippi within the meaning of any state constitutional provision or statutory limitation, and shall never constitute nor give rise to a pecuniary liability of the State of Mississippi or a charge against its general credit or taxing powers, and such fact shall be plainly stated on the face of each such bond. All bonds issued under this section and all interest coupons applicable thereto, if any, shall be construed to be negotiable instruments, despite the fact that they are payable solely from a specified source.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(4) The bonds issued under this section and the income therefrom shall be exempt from all taxation in the State of Mississippi.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(5) The revenue bonds authorized under this section may be issued without any other proceedings or the happening of any other conditions or things than those proceedings, conditions and things which are specified or required by this section.
      </p>
      <p>
       “The bonds authorized under this section may be validated in the Chancery Court of Hinds County, Mississippi, in the manner and with the force and effect provided now or hereafter by Chapter 13, Title 31, Mississippi Code of 1972, for the validation of county, municipal, school district and other bonds. The necessary papers for such validation proceedings shall be transmitted to the State Bond Commission, and the required notice shall be published in a newspaper published in the City of Jackson, Mississippi.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(6) The proceeds of the bonds issued under this section shall be deposited in a special fund hereby created in the State Treasury to be known as the ’Surface Action Group Base Construction Fund’. The expenditure of such funds shall be under the direction of the State Bond Commission and shall be paid by the State Treasurer upon warrants issued by the Auditor of Public Accounts, which warrants shall be issued upon requisitions signed by the Chairman of the State Bond Commission.”

       Laws, 1971, ch. 462, § 2, provides as follows:

       “SECTION 2. Nothing in this act shall affect or defeat any claim, cause of action, suit, appeal, right or interest in and to lands or beach-front property on the Gulf of Mexico which existed prior to the effective date of this act, whether or not such claim, cause of action, suit, appeal, right or interest in and to such lands or interest therein shall have begun on the date on which this act becomes effective, or shall thereafter be begun. It is expressly provided that every right, title or interest in lands held by any person or groups of persons which front on the Gulf of Mexico in the State of Mississippi shall continue in full force and effect to the same extent as if this act had not become law.”

       § 59-9-23.
    Establishment and development of industrial parks.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      In addition to the powers and authority elsewhere conferred in this chapter, the board of supervisors of any county in which there has been created a county port authority or county development commission, acting through its county port authority or county development commission, may establish industrial parks with defined boundaries to develop and utilize lands for industrial operations and in such development may provide for water, sewage, drainage or similar facilities, or transportation, power or communication facilities which are incidental to the use of the lands as industrial parks. The creation of all such parks purported to be so established prior to enactment of this section as would comply with the provisions of this section is hereby ratified and declared valid. Transportation facilities herein authorized may include railroad lines and bridges extending not more than twenty (20) miles from such industrial parks, locomotives and other equipment to be used only in said county, but if any part of any such facility shall be in another county, only with consent of such county expressed by resolution of its board of supervisors and its county port authority or county development commission. Transportation facilities owned by a county hereunder may be operated by said county or others on behalf of such county or may be leased to others by said county; the Public Service Commission shall have no jurisdiction over such transportation facilities or the financing thereof, nor, so long as said county regulates such rates, the rates charged for the use of such transportation facilities. Revenue bonds, but not general obligation bonds, may be issued to pay the cost of such transportation, power or communication facilities, under Section 59-9-41, or under any other law now or hereafter available, and any such facilities may be sold or leased as hereinafter provided. In connection with an industrial park any such county, through its county port authority or county development commission, may establish a comprehensive plan, may make rules and regulations to assure compliance with such plan, and may set and collect rates and charges for services furnished by such industrial park.

In event, however, such board of supervisors elects to delay actual delivery or sale of any part of the bonds so authorized, either until the proceeds thereof are needed, or upon the happening or occurrence of any event or thing, then and in that event the bonds so authorized and any part thereof shall be secured and be entitled to be paid, both as to principal and interest in accordance with the terms and conditions to be fixed and recited in said resolution or order. In anticipation of the issuance of the definitive bonds authorized by this chapter, any such county may issue interim certificates. Such interim certificates shall be in such form, contain such terms, conditions or provisions, bear such date or dates, and evidence such agreement or agreements relating to their discharge by payment or by the delivery of the definitive bonds, as such county, by resolution of its governing body, may determine. Whenever any county shall have issued bonds under this section or Section 59-9-41, a portion of which remains outstanding and unpaid, and the governing authority of such county desires to refund all or any portion of such bonds or to issue additional bonds under this section or Section 59-9-41, for the purpose herein or therein authorized and to consolidate all or any portion of such bonded indebtedness, such governing authority, by resolution or resolutions, may at any time authorize and direct the issuance of bonds. The proceeds of such new bonds shall be used to pay or provide for the payment of, at or prior to maturity, any outstanding and unpaid bonds (including any unpaid accrued interest thereon), and any balance of such proceeds not so utilized shall be used and expended for the purposes authorized by this chapter. In the event that such outstanding bonds, by the terms thereof, are redeemable prior to maturity at the option of such county, then such option of redemption may be exercised in the manner provided in such bonds. Such new bonds shall be issued in like manner and like incidence and shall be payable from the same source or sources and the payment thereof shall be secured in like manner as provided in this section or Section 59-9-41 provided in the case of the issuance of original bonds under this section or under Section 59-9-41. In lieu of selling such portion of such new bonds as may be required to pay or provide for the payment of such outstanding bonds, such new bonds may be issued and delivered in exchange for and upon surrender and cancellation of a like amount of such outstanding bonds.

     <p>
      In addition to the authority conferred by Section 59-9-37, the board of supervisors of such county is further authorized, in its discretion, to issue revenue bonds of such county to provide funds for any purpose or purposes set out in this chapter or in Section 59-5-31. Such revenue bonds may be issued upon compliance with Section 59-9-51, and shall not be subject to any limitation as to amount, and shall not be included or computed in the statutory limitations of indebtedness of any such county. Such bonds shall bear date or dates, be in such denomination or denominations, bear interest at such rate or rates, provided that the bonds of any issue shall not bear a greater overall maximum interest rate to maturity than that allowed in Section 75-17-103, be payable at such place or places within or without the State of Mississippi, shall mature at such time or times and upon such terms, with or without premium, shall bear such registration privileges and shall be substantially in such form, all as shall be determined by resolution of the board of supervisors of such county. Such bonds shall mature in annual installments beginning not more than five (5) years from date thereof and extending not more than thirty-five (35) years from date thereof. Such bonds shall be signed by the president of the board of supervisors of such county, and the official seal of the county shall be affixed thereto, attested by the clerk of the board of supervisors of such county. The interest coupons, if any, to be attached to such bonds may be executed by the facsimile signatures of said officers. Whenever any such bonds shall have been signed by the officers herein designated to sign the bonds who were in office at the time of such signing but who may have ceased to be such officers prior to the sale and delivery of such bonds, or who may not have been in office on the date such bonds may bear, the signatures of such officers upon such bonds and coupons shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes and have the same effect as if the person so officially signing such bonds had remained in office until the delivery of the same to the purchaser or had been in office on the date such bonds may bear.
     </p>
     <p>
      The revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this section shall be payable solely out of the revenues to accrue from the operation of such project development, improvement or utility systems, and the full faith and credit of the county shall not be pledged therefor, nor shall any ad valorem tax be levied therefor.

      The board of supervisors of a county issuing bonds under Sections 59-9-37 and 59-9-41 shall sell such bonds in such manner and for such price as it may determine to be for the best interest of said county, but no such sale (other than revenue bonds) shall be made at a price less than par plus accrued interest to date of delivery of the bonds to the purchaser. Notice of the sale of any such bonds (other than revenue bonds) shall be published at least one (1) time not less than ten (10) days prior to the date of sale and shall be published in a newspaper published in and having general circulation within such county.

      The proceeds of such bonds shall be paid into a special fund or funds in banks qualified to act as depositories for such county. The proceeds of such bonds shall be solely for the purposes for which they were issued, and the redeeming of any outstanding bonds, and shall be disbursed upon order of the board of supervisors of such county, with such restriction, if any, as the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds may provide. If the proceeds of such bonds, by error of calculation or otherwise, shall be less than the cost of the purpose for which they were issued, and the redeeming of any outstanding bonds, unless otherwise provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds, additional bonds may in like manner be issued to provide the amount of such deficit which, unless otherwise provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of bonds, shall be deemed to be of the same issue and shall be entitled to payment from the same fund without preference or priority of the bonds first issued for the same purpose. If the proceeds of the bonds of any issue shall exceed the amount required for the purpose for which the bonds were issued, the surplus shall be paid into the fund established for the payment of the principal of and the interest on such bonds.

    County-wide election on issuance of bonds under §§ 59-9-37 and 59-9-41.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      A county-wide election shall be held to determine whether such bonds, as are provided for in Sections 59-9-37 and 59-9-41, may be issued. Upon the calling of an election, notice of such election shall be signed by the clerk of the board of supervisors and shall be published once a week for at least three consecutive weeks in at least one newspaper published in such county. The first publication of such notice shall be made not less than twenty-one days prior to the date fixed for such election, and the last publication shall be made not more than seven days prior to such date. If no newspaper is published in such county, then such notice shall be given by publishing the same for the required time in some newspaper having a general circulation in such county and, in addition, by posting a copy of such notice for at least twenty-one days next preceding such election in three public places in such county. Such election shall be held, as far as is practicable, in the same manner as other elections are held in counties. At such election, all qualified electors of such county may vote, and the ballots used at such election shall have printed thereon a brief statement of the amount and purpose of the proposed bond issue and the words “FOR THE BOND ISSUE” and “AGAINST THE BOND ISSUE,” and the voter shall vote by placing a cross (x) or check (Π) opposite his choice on the proposition. When the results of the election on the question of the issuance of such bonds shall have been canvassed by the election commissioners of such county and certified by them to the board of supervisors of such county, it shall be the duty of such board of supervisors to determine and adjudicate whether or not a majority of the qualified electors who voted thereon in such election shall have voted in favor of the issuance of such bonds, and unless a majority of the qualified electors who voted thereon in such election shall have voted in favor of the issuance of such bonds, then such bonds shall not be issued. Should a majority of the qualified electors who vote thereon in such election vote in favor of the issuance of such bonds, then the board of supervisors of the county may issue such bonds, either in whole or in part, within two years from the date of such election, or within two years after the final favorable termination of any litigation affecting the issuance of such bonds, as such board shall deem best. However, the board of supervisors, in its discretion may, in lieu of the foregoing provisions, adopt a resolution reciting its intention to issue bonds for the purposes authorized by this chapter, stating the amount of bonds proposed to be issued and the date upon which further action will be taken by the board looking toward the issuance of such bonds. Such resolution shall be published once a week for at least three successive weeks in a newspaper published and of general circulation within such county. The first of such publications shall be made at least twenty-one days prior to the date set forth in said resolution as the date upon which further action will be taken by the board, and the last of such publications shall be made not more than seven days prior to such date. If, prior to the date set forth as aforesaid, there shall be filed with the clerk of such board a petition in writing signed by twenty per cent (20%) of the qualified electors of such county, requesting an election on the question of the issuance of such bonds, then such bonds shall not be issued unless authorized by a majority of the qualified electors of such county who vote thereon at an election to be ordered by such board for that purpose.

    Joint development, maintenance, operation, etc., of ports by county port authority or commission and municipality; joint bond issue.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The board of supervisors, acting through its county port authority or county development commission, and the governing authorities of the municipality in which the port of entry is located, acting through its port commission, jointly may negotiate a contract or contracts for the development, construction, repair, and maintenance and operation of seaports, wharves, piers, docks, ways, elevators, compresses, warehouses, roadways and water, air and rail terminals and other structures, facilities and lands needful for the convenient use of the same in the aid of commerce or any other property at the port of entry under the joint jurisdiction of such county port authority or county development commission and such port commission. Such county and municipality, acting through the board of supervisors of such county, and the governing authorities of such municipality are authorized to jointly issue bonds or other obligations to provide funds for such joint undertakings. Such bonds shall be issued as provided in Sections 59-9-37 through 59-9-51, but shall be jointly issued by the board of supervisors of such county and by the governing authorities of the municipality in which the port of entry is located, acting concurrently. Such bonds shall be denominated as port improvement bonds of the county and municipality issuing the same. Unless three-fifths (3/5) of the qualified electors of such county who voted in an election to be held for that purpose shall have voted in favor of the issuance of such bonds and three-fifths (3/5) of the qualified electors of the municipality in which the port of entry is located who voted in an election held for that purpose shall have voted in favor of the issuance of such bonds, then such bonds shall not be issued. Electors of such county who vote in such election vote in favor of the issuance of such bonds and should three-fifths (3/5) of the qualified electors of the municipality in which the port of entry is located who vote in such election vote in favor of the issuance of such bonds, then the board of supervisors of such county and the governing authorities of the municipality in which the port of entry is located may issue such bonds, either in whole or part, within three years after the date of such election or within three years after the termination of any litigation affecting the issuance of such bonds, as such board of supervisors and such governing authorities of the municipality in which the port of entry is located jointly shall deem best. For the payment of such bonds and interest thereon, the board of supervisors of such county and the governing authorities of the municipality in which the port of entry is located, may each pledge the two-mill ad valorem tax authorized by Section 59-9-59, or such part thereof as may be required for the payment of such bonds and interest thereon. Such county and municipality, acting jointly, may also pledge for the payment of such bonds and interest thereon, the revenues from all or any of the facilities operated or to be operated jointly by the county port authority or county development commission and port commission and any revenues accruing to such county and municipality under and by virtue of Sections 59-7-1 or 59-7-303, and not theretofore pledged or hypothecated, and any such county may also pledge any surplus funds accruing by virtue of Sections 65-33-45 or 65-33-47, Mississippi Code of 1972, and not theretofore pledged or hypothecated, and any other surplus funds available to such county or municipality from any other source. Such bonds shall not be computed as being within any statutory limitation on the issuance of municipal or county bonds, but the two-mill ad valorem tax, or such part thereof as may be necessary for the payment of such bonds and interest thereon, as well as any revenues accruing to such county and municipality under and by virtue of Sections 59-7-1 or 59-7-303, and any surplus accruing to such county under Sections 65-33-45 or 65-33-47, Mississippi Code of 1972, and not theretofore pledged or hypothecated, shall be irrevocably pledged to the payment of such bonds and interest. Any bonds, or other obligations issued pursuant to this section shall be fully negotiable within the meaning and for all the purposes of the Mississippi Uniform Commercial Code. Whenever any county and municipality, acting jointly, shall have issued bonds hereunder, a portion of which remain outstanding and unpaid, and the governing authorities of such county and municipality, acting jointly, desire to issue additional bonds hereunder for the purposes herein authorized and desire to consolidate all such bonded indebtedness, such governing authorities, by resolution or resolutions, may at any time authorize and direct the issuance of bonds. The proceeds of such new bonds shall be used to take up, pay and redeem all of such outstanding and unpaid bonds at their par value, and the balance of such proceeds shall be used and expended for the purposes authorized by this section. In the event that such outstanding bonds, by the terms thereof, shall be redeemable prior to maturity at the option of such county and municipality, acting jointly, then such option of redemption shall be exercised in the manner provided in such bonds, or in the event that such outstanding bonds, by the terms thereof, be not so redeemable prior to maturity, then the consent of the holder or holders thereof shall first be had and obtained to the end that, in either of said events, the redemption of such outstanding bonds may be accomplished concurrently with the issuance of such new bonds. Such new bonds shall be issued in like manner and like incidence and shall be payable from the same source or sources and the payment thereof shall be secured in like manner as herein provided in the case of the issuance of original bonds hereunder. In lieu of selling such portion of such new bonds as may be required to provide for the redemption of such outstanding bonds, such new bonds may be issued and delivered in exchange for and upon surrender and cancellation of a like amount of such outstanding bonds.

      All taxes collected for the payment of principal of and interest on bonds issued hereunder, shall be credited to a special fund in the county and municipal treasuries of such county and municipality and to be known and designated as the “port bonds interest and sinking fund”, and all sums credited to said fund shall be used to pay such bonds as they mature and the interest thereon as it accrues and for no other purpose. It shall be the mandatory duty of such board of supervisors and governing authorities of the municipality to transfer funds from said port funds to the port bonds interest and sinking fund in amounts sufficient to pay maturing principal and accruing interest on bonds issued hereunder. To the extent that funds are thus made available for the payment of such bonds and the interest thereon, the special tax levy herein provided for may be correspondingly reduced.

      The power to issue bonds or other obligations authorized by Sections 59-15-1 through 59-15-9, shall be vested in, and may be exercised from time to time by, the governing body of any municipality described in said sections. Such bonds or other obligations shall be authorized by resolution of the governing body of any such municipality and shall bear such date or dates, mature at such time or times, not exceeding twenty-five years from their respective dates, bear interest at such rate or rates, not exceeding four per centum per annum, be in such denomination, be in such form, either coupon or registered, carry such registration privileges, be executed in such manner, be payable in such medium of payment, at such place or places, and be subject to such terms of prior redemption, with or without premium as such resolution or resolutions may provide. Such bonds or other obligations may be sold at public or private sale for such price or prices as the governing body of such municipality shall determine, provided that the interest cost to maturity of the money received from any issue of said bonds or other obligations shall not exceed four per centum per annum. Such bonds or other obligations may be issued by any municipality described in Sections 59-15-1 through 59-15-9 in a principal amount not exceeding in the aggregate one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00), for any purpose or purposes authorized by said sections. Such municipality shall have power out of any funds available to purchase any bonds or other obligations issued by it pursuant to this chapter, and all bonds or other obligations so purchased shall be canceled and no bonds or other obligations shall be issued in lieu thereof. In anticipation of the issuance of the definitive bonds authorized by this chapter, any such municipality may issue interim certificates. Such interim certificates shall be in such form, contain such terms, conditions or provisions, bear such date or dates, and evidence such agreement or agreements relating to their discharge by payment or by the delivery of the definitive bonds, as such municipality by resolution of its governing body may determine. Any bonds, interim certificates or other obligations issued pursuant to this chapter shall be fully negotiable within the meaning and for all the purposes of the Mississippi Uniform Commercial Code.

     <p>
      The board or the State Inland Port Authority, in the performance of its duties, may employ such personnel and make all contracts and purchases incidental to or necessary for the advancement, promotion, development, establishment, insurance, maintenance, repair, improvement and operation of any ports, harbors, rivers, channels and waterways, including, if required for its protection, retirement benefits, workers’ compensation insurance and other employee benefits for the benefit of any employees of the board or State Inland Port Authority. The board or State Inland Port Authority shall make such contracts or purchases in accordance with state purchasing laws. Contracts let for any port, harbor, river, channel or waterway improvements shall be advertised as required by law for the letting of public contracts, and such contracts shall be awarded to the lowest and best bidder, who shall make such bond as shall be required by the board or State Inland Port Authority, conditioned for the faithful prosecution and completion of the work according to such contract, such bond to be furnished by a corporate surety company qualified to do business in this state. However, the board may negotiate and enter into contracts with responsible lessees for the construction of facilities by lessees, such as those referred to in Section 59-17-13, Mississippi Code of 1972, and the acquisition thereof by the board upon such terms and conditions and for such amounts as may be approved by the board. Where the rentals provided in the lease will be sufficient to fully repay the cost of the particular facility or where the monetary consideration for a deed is sufficient to fully repay the cost of land acquired for industrial operations described in the deed, contracts for construction, repairs, maintenance and operation of the facility or for the sale of the land may be negotiated and consummated without the necessity of advertising and obtaining competitive bids therefor.

    Acquisition of rights of way, land and property by board generally; restriction on power of eminent domain.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      For the acquiring of rights-of-way, land and property, including existing easements, restrictive covenants and reversionary estates necessary for the purpose herein authorized, the board shall have the right and power to acquire the same by purchase, negotiation or condemnation, and, should it elect to exercise the right of eminent domain, it may proceed in the manner provided by the general laws of the State of Mississippi for procedure by any county, municipality or corporation organized under the laws of this state, or in any other manner provided by law. The power of eminent domain shall apply not only as to all property of private persons or corporations, but also as to property already devoted to public use, including leaseholds, excepting interests in property owned by levee boards, drainage districts, or other flood control agencies. However, the board shall have no authority to acquire without the consent of the owner thereof any property operated and used for port, harbor or industrial purposes or such purposes as the board is authorized to acquire and use property for, unless an actual necessity therefor be alleged and proven. The board is authorized to accept donations of lands, rights therein, moneys and materials required for the maintenance or development of any port or harbor. The board may exchange any property or properties acquired under the authority of this chapter for other property or properties usable in carrying out the powers hereby conferred, and also remove from lands needed for its purposes and reconstruct on other locations, buildings, utilities, terminals, railroads or other structures upon the payment of just compensation, if it is necessary so to do, in order to carry out any of its plans for port development. The title to all land or property acquired under the authority of this chapter shall vest in the State of Mississippi. Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to authorize the taking by eminent domain of any private property except for necessary public use, said right of eminent domain to be limited to the acquisition of railroad rights-of-way, road rights-of-way and land for industrial use only.

     <p>
      The board shall have power and is hereby authorized, at one (1) time, or from time to time, to provide by resolution for the issuance of negotiable bonds of the State of Mississippi by the state bond commission to provide funds for the purpose of paying all or any part of the cost of the acquisition of any state port, harbor, waterway or part thereof, and the planned development of any port, harbor, waterway or part thereof, but in no event shall the amount of such bonds issued exceed the actual cost of an approved plan for the development of any port, harbor, waterway or part thereof. The principal of and the interest on such bonds shall be payable from a special fund to be provided for that purpose in the manner hereinafter set forth. Such bonds shall bear the date or dates, be in such denomination or denominations, bear interest at such rate or rates, be payable at such place or places within or without the State of Mississippi, shall mature absolutely at such time or times, be redeemable prior to maturity at such time or times and upon such terms, with or without premium, shall bear such registration privileges, and shall be substantially in such form, all as shall be determined by resolution of the board. Such bonds shall mature in annual installments beginning not more than four (4) years from date thereof and extending not more than thirty (30) years from date thereof. In no event shall any bonds be issued for a period of time which shall be longer than ninety percent (90%) of the expected useful life of the project or projects to be financed by the proceeds of said bonds. Such bonds shall be signed by the governor or by his facsimile signature, and the official seal of the state shall be affixed thereto, attested by the secretary of state. The interest coupons to be attached to such bonds may be executed by the facsimile signatures of said officers. Whenever any such bonds shall have been signed by the officials herein designated to sign the bonds who were in office at the time of such signing but who may have ceased to be such officers prior to the sale and delivery of such bonds, or who may not have been in office on the date such bonds may bear, the signatures of such officers upon such bonds and coupons shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes and have the same effect as if the person so officially signing such bonds had remained in office until the delivery of the same to the purchaser or had been in office on the date such bonds may bear.

        1. Relation to Mississippi Torts Claim Act.

      <p>
       Court of appeals erred in reversing the trial court’s judgment because it ignored substantial, credible, and reasonable evidence that supported the trial court’s finding that Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks officers acted with reckless disregard for the safety of others; the trial court’s finding that the officers’ testimony was not credible because substantial, credible, and reasonable evidence in the record contradicted the testimony could not be discarded. Miss. Dep't of Wildlife v. Webb, 248 So.3d 772, 2018 Miss. LEXIS 127 (Miss. 2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       Circuit court improperly ruled for a family in their action claiming that Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks (MDWFP) conservation officers acted with reckless disregard for the safety of boaters because it erroneously applied the legal standard for reckless disregard; the violation of a MDWFP standard operation procedure failed to establish reckless disregard because no provision prohibited officers from requesting a boater pull to a safe area to conduct a traffic stop.

       Circuit court improperly ruled for a family in their action against the Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks (MDWFP) because it erroneously applied the legal standard for reckless disregard under the Mississippi Torts Claim Act; MDWFP officers possessed the discretion to request that boaters pull out of the hazardous and high-traffic area of a river, and the MDWFP possessed the authority to regulate the boating traffic on the river and the discretion to do so in a safe manner.

       Section 59-21-89 was added by Laws, 1994, ch. 353 and by Laws, 1994, ch. 640, § 1. The only difference in the version of the section as added by the two different chapters is that chapter 640 added a subsection (3), which repeals the section from and after July 1, 1995, and which does not appear in chapter 353. At the direction of the Attorney General’s office, this section reads as added by chapter 640.

      The acceptance by a nonresident of the right and privileges of operating a vessel or motorboat on any of the waters of this state, as evidenced by his operating, either in person or by agent or employee, a vessel or motorboat upon any of the navigable waters of this state, shall be deemed equivalent to an appointment by such nonresident of the secretary of state of the State of Mississippi to be his true and lawful attorney, upon whom may be served all lawful processes or summonses in any action or proceeding against him, growing out of a violation of the provisions of this chapter, or of any accident in which said nonresident may be involved while operating a vessel or motorboat on the navigable waters of the state. Such service of process may be had in the same manner as is provided by Section 13-3-63, for the service of process on nonresidents operating motor vehicles upon the highways of this state, and shall have the same effect.

       Defendant’s conviction for boating under the influence was not against the overwhelming weight of the evidence because defendant’s breath-alcohol test showed that his blood-alcohol level was 0.110 – above the 0.08 limit; witness testimony reflected that defendant was drinking beer and taking shots consisting of gelatin mixed with vodka and chilled in small cups prior to the accident; and law-enforcement officers at the scene following the accident observed defendant slurring his speech and noted a strong smell of an intoxicating beverage on defendant’s breath.

Upon request of the owner and upon receipt of a copy of the security release, if required, and the certificate of title, the department shall correct its records and issue a new certificate of title to the owner.
