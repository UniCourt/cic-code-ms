       Code sections associated with section containing provision, stricken by Amendatory Act, that no convict shall be credited with wages while in jail and not at work held to entitle convict to credit of $1 on his fine and costs for each day spent in jail when ready, able, and willing to work, regardless of title of amendatory act, “An Act to amend [such section] so as to credit convicts with time served in jail.” Ex parte Jackson, 177 Miss. 509, 171 So. 545, 1937 Miss.

   Under the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, an indigent, convicted in a state court and sentenced to the maximum term of imprisonment specified by statute and payment of a fine and court costs, the judgment also directing, pursuant to statute, that if the defendant was in default of the monetary payment at the expiration of his prison term, he should remain in jail to “work off” the fine at the statutory rate, may not be continued in confinement beyond the maximum term specified by statute because of his failure to satisfy the monetary provisions of the sentence, either with regard to the fine or with regard to the costs. Williams v. Illinois, <cite class="us_code">399 U.S. 235</cite>, <cite class="s_court">90 S. Ct. 2018</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">26 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 586, 1970 U.S. LEXIS 8 (U.S. 1970).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although incarceration of indigent for involuntary failure to pay fine and court costs beyond the maximum imprisonment prescribed by state law for the offense was held to be violative of the Federal Constitution, the state can institute methods, other than incarceration, to enforce the collection of unpaid fines.

       § 47-1-3.
    County convicts; duty of board of supervisors.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      It is the imperative duty of the board of supervisors in each county in this state to require each convict sentenced to imprisonment in the county jail and the payment of a fine and costs, or to imprisonment and payment of costs, or to payment of fine and costs, to work out the sentence on the county convict farm or on the public roads or other public works of the county, or in a contiguous county, as herein provided. But any convict who is sentenced to the payment of a fine and costs and who pays such fine and costs shall thereby be relieved from working out such fine and costs, but the payment in full of such fine and costs shall not relieve such convict from working out the full time of his imprisonment as adjudged in his sentence. The board of supervisors of any county, however, may by an order spread upon its minutes, giving the reason therefor, and with the approval of the circuit judge of the district, discharge any aged or infirm convict upon his making an affidavit of his insolvency and inability to pay the fine and costs, and filing same with the clerk of the board of supervisors at any time after the expiration of his imprisonment.

They are also authorized to make any necessary improvements thereon, such as erecting necessary and convenient buildings, clearing, terracing and ditching and leveeing, or otherwise repairing and improving such farm, so that it may be suitable to be used as a farm upon which to work the convicts committed to the county jail, and they shall employ a competent and suitable person to be known as foreman of county farm to superintend such convict farm and manage it and to work the convicts sentenced to the county jail thereon. The board of supervisors in each county shall also have full and complete authority to buy, or rent necessary mules or horses, tractors, farming tools and implements and all other necessary things incidental to the successful operation of such convict farm in such numbers and amounts as they may reasonably contemplate will be necessary to successfully operate such farm, having in view, first, the continuous employment of all the convicts able to work thereon at remunerative labor, and second, the operation of said farm in the most economical manner consistent with the continuous working of such convicts.

      Any person being held in the county jail in default of bail to await trial, except those held for treason, murder, arson, or rape, and except such as the sheriff may deem it improper to let out, may on application to the sheriff of the county, be allowed to work on the county farm or on the public roads or other county public works as other convicts are worked and at the same wage. The board of supervisors shall settle with prisoners so working at their regular meetings monthly. But if it appears that it is not to the best interest of the county to work such prisoners, the board may decline at any time to employ them.

       If it is determined that an organization that provides shelter for battered women and children has indeed obtained 501(c)(3) status as a nonprofit charitable organization, the sheriff can utilize county inmates for requested construction purposes, provided those inmates are under the exclusive control and management of the sheriff. 2005 Miss.

       Section 47-1-19 does not establish work programs, but merely recognizes that inmates will be worked when sentenced to jail. Once sentenced to jail, it is up to the custodian of the jail to determine whether and when to work the inmate in a public service work program. 2006 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 268.

      Each county officer or officers, for any district of a county shall at all times have free access to convicts in the custody of any official for the purpose of investigating their condition and treatment. The sheriff or his deputies shall visit the convict camp or county farms where the convicts of his county are kept or worked at least once in every month and more often if necessary. He shall make a thorough inspection and investigation of the treatment of convicts and report the same in writing to the board of supervisors. For failure to perform duty in this respect the board of supervisors may fine the sheriff Twenty-five Dollars ($25.00).

       When a convict has been placed on the county farm or road camp to work out a sentence, such convict comes under the immediate jurisdiction of the foreman or guard appointed by the board for that purpose and subject to the rules and regulations laid down by the board of supervisors. The sheriff loses direct control of the convict, but it is his duty, under the law, to keep up with the prisoners on such farms and in such camps in a supervisory way and see that they are being worked and treated in accordance with the regulations promulgated by the board. This appears to be the only duty imposed upon the sheriff by this section. Ops Atty Gen, 1933-35, p. 48.

   In order to establish a violation of the cruel and unusual punishment clause based on a claim of excessive use of force by prison officers, a prisoner who shows unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain is not required to show serious injury, given that (a) the absence of serious injury, although relevant to the inquiry as to whether the use of force violated the Eighth Amendment, does not end that inquiry, and (b) contemporary standards of decency are always violated when prison officials maliciously and sadistically use force to cause harm, regardless of whether significant injury is evident. Hudson v. McMillian, <cite class="us_code">503 U.S. 1</cite>, <cite class="s_court">112 S. Ct. 995</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">117 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 156, 1992 U.S. LEXIS 1372 (U.S. 1992).

   Blows allegedly directed at the inmate by the security officers were not de minimis for Eighth Amendment purposes, and the extent of the inmate’s alleged injuries provided no basis for dismissal of the inmate’s claim against the officers under 42 USCS § 1983. Hudson v. McMillian, <cite class="us_code">503 U.S. 1</cite>, <cite class="s_court">112 S. Ct. 995</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">117 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 156, 1992 U.S. LEXIS 1372 (U.S. 1992).

       <p>
   For purposes of establishing whether prison officials have inflicted unnecessary and wanton pain and suffering on a prisoner so as to violate the prisoner’s rights under the cruel and unusual punishment clause, where the officials are accused of using excessive physical force, the core judicial inquiry is whether force was applied (a) in a good-faith effort to maintain or restore discipline, or (b) maliciously and sadistically to cause harm. Hudson v. McMillian, <cite class="us_code">503 U.S. 1</cite>, <cite class="s_court">112 S. Ct. 995</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">117 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 156, 1992 U.S. LEXIS 1372 (U.S. 1992).

       Miss. Code Section 47-1-47 provides that, for each day’s work convict is required to do, convict shall receive credit of $10 per day, until convict’s fine and costs are fully paid. 1993 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 988.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where inmate is physically willing and able to work, inmate is entitled to credit against fine and cost in amount of $10 per day, until such fine and cost are fully paid. 1993 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 255.
      </p>
      <p>
       Prisoners’ privileges of mail, telephone, visitation, access to law library and recreation are not addressed by state statute. 1998 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 159.
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Where a defendant owes a $250.00 fine but refuses to pay it, he can be sent to jail under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.99.html#t99c19s99-19-20ol12" target="_blank">99-19-20(2)</a></cite>; however, that statute limits the jail time to 10 days (one day for each $25.00 of the fine).
   If the defendant chooses to work during those 10 days, his fine will be reduced by $10.00 a day under this section.
   At the end of the 10 days, the defendant must be released.
   However, he will still owe $150.00 in fines. 1998 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 306.
      </p>
      <p>
       A defendant who is jailed for not paying criminal fines is entitled to receive a credit against such fine of ten dollars per day under this section for each day that he works or is willing and able to work; this credit would be applied to both fines and assessments. Note that under Section 99-19-20 jail time may not exceed one day for each twenty-five dollars of the fines owed by the defendant. 2003 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 321.

       A complaint that a physician has been negligent in diagnosing or treating a prisoner’s medical condition does not state a valid claim of medical mistreatment under the Eighth Amendment. Medical malpractice does not become a constitutional violation merely because the victim is a prisoner. In order to state a cognizable claim, a prisoner must allege acts or omissions sufficiently harmful to evidence deliberate indifference to serious medical needs. It is only such indifference that can offend “evolving standards of decency” in violation of the Eighth Amendment. McFadden v. State, 542 So. 2d 871, 1989 Miss. LEXIS 65 (Miss. 1989).

       When the sheriff, marshal or any other peace officer of this state has in his lawful custody a prisoner who, through accident, injury or illness, is in need of hospitalization, such officer may take such prisoner to the nearest hospital in the county or if there be no hospital in that county, to the nearest hospital in an adjacent county and if upon arrival at such hospital any physician licensed to practice medicine in this state certifies that in his opinion such prisoner is in need of hospitalization, such prisoner shall be hospitalized in such hospital for as long as in the opinion of such physician it is necessary to so hospitalize such prisoner. If, in the opinion of the sheriff or other peace officer having custody of such prisoner at the time he is delivered to the aforesaid hospital, or in the opinion of the director of the university hospital if the prisoner be brought to that institution, it is necessary that he be placed under guard while a patient at such hospital, the sheriff of the county in which the crime he was placed in custody for committing was alleged to have taken place, shall furnish the aforesaid guard. When the aforesaid physician or other reputable physician shall certify that hospitalization no longer is needed, the prisoner shall be returned to the original place of detention.

       The actual expense of guarding the prisoner in the hospital shall be paid out of the general funds of the county where the prisoner was originally confined or arrested. The expense contracted incident to the hospitalization aforesaid shall be paid by the prisoner; otherwise he may be hospitalized as a state aid patient. However, if the prisoner is ineligible for state aid or the amount available for hospitalization as a state aid patient is inadequate to pay all such hospital expense of a prisoner who is financially unable to pay his own expenses, the board of supervisors of the county where the prisoner was originally confined or arrested shall, upon presentation of the certificate of the physician certifying that said prisoner was in need of hospitalization, pay from the general funds of the county the reasonable and customary charges for such services or as much thereof as is not paid by state aid. Any such payment to a hospital shall be discretionary with the board of supervisors if its county supports the hospital involved by a special tax levy for its operation and maintenance.

       Defendant’s conviction for simple assault of an employee of a private correctional facility was appropriate because the nature and cause of the charge against defendant were clear and the indictment properly informed him of the possible defenses to the charged offense. The trial court was within its discretion in finding that the jury properly weighed the evidence and determined that the State showed that the victim suffered an injury as a result of defendant’s striking her with his fist.

       Before a private correctional facility may be located in the county, the board of supervisors shall by resolution duly adopted and entered on its minutes specify the location of the facility, the nature and size of the facility, the type of inmates to be incarcerated and the identity of the private entity which will operate the facility. The board shall publish a notice as hereinafter set forth in a newspaper having general circulation in such county. Such notice shall include location of the facility, the nature and size of the facility, the type of inmates to be incarcerated and the identity of the entity which will operate the facility. Such notice shall include a brief summary of the provisions of this section pertaining to the petition for an election on the question of the location of the private correctional facility in such county. Such notice shall be published not less than one (1) time each week for at least three (3) consecutive weeks in at least one (1) newspaper having general circulation in the county.

Such election shall be held, as far as practicable, in the same manner as other elections are held in counties. At such election, all qualified electors of the county may vote, and the ballots used at such election shall have printed thereon a brief statement of the facility to be constructed and the words “For the construction of the private correctional facility in (here insert county name) County” and “Against the construction of the private correctional facility in (here insert county name) County.” The voter shall vote by placing a cross (x) or check mark (Π) opposite his choice on the proposition. When the results of the election on the question of the construction of the facility shall have been canvassed by the election commissioners of the county and certified by them to the board of supervisors, it shall be the duty of the board of supervisors to determine and adjudicate whether or not a majority of the qualified electors who voted thereon in such election voted in favor of the construction of the facility in such county. If a majority of the qualified electors who voted in such election vote against the construction of the facility, then the facility shall not be constructed in the county.

     <p>
      It shall be the policy of this state, in the operation and management of the correctional system, to so manage and conduct the same in that manner as will be consistent with the operation of a modern correctional system and with the view of making the system self-sustaining. Those convicted of violating the law and sentenced to a term in the state correctional system shall have humane treatment, and be given opportunity, encouragement and training in the manner of reformation.
     </p>
     <p>
      It shall be the policy of this state that the correctional system shall be operated and managed in the most efficient and economical manner possible. The Mississippi Department of Corrections shall so manage and operate the correctional system in that manner in order to make the system self-sustaining and to conserve state general fund revenues. The Mississippi Department of Corrections shall provide leadership to bring about the earliest possible construction of satisfactory prison inmate facilities, and shall utilize existing state resources, including inmates for prison construction labor, when and wherever practicable, in order to minimize the need for state general funds for prison construction.
     </p>
     <p>
      It shall be the policy of this state that periodic independent internal investigations of the department shall be conducted to ensure the implementation of state correctional policies.

       Laws of 1976, ch. 440, § 1, provides as follows:
      </p>

       “SECTION 1. This act shall be known and may be cited as the ‘Mississippi Corrections Act of 1976.’ ”
      </p>
      <p>
       Laws of 1981, ch. 465, § 118, which provided for the automatic repeal of provisions reenacting the Department of Corrections and the State Parole Board on June 30, 1984, was repealed by Laws of 1984, ch. 471, § 126. In turn, Laws of 1984, ch. 471, § 128, provided for the automatic repeal of these provisions from and after July 1, 1986. Subsequently, Laws of 1986, ch. 413, § 126, effective from and after passage (approved March 28, 1986), repealed Laws of 1984, ch. 471, § 128, thereby removing the repeal date.

       Laws of 1988, ch. 503, § 1, provides as follows:

       “SECTION 1. The Mississippi Board of Corrections is hereby abolished and all power, authority, duties and functions of such board shall hereafter vest in and be performed by the Mississippi Department of Corrections.

   Mississippi Department of Corrections (MDOC) was considered an arm of the state for purposes of Eleventh Amendment immunity because state statute, Miss.

     <p>
      It is the intent of the Mississippi Legislature that the commissioner shall fully utilize existing knowledge, architectural plans and expertise currently available with the Federal Bureau of Prisons and the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration to the end that the State of Mississippi shall have an efficient, modern, and properly secure state correctional system.

       There is a constitutional requirement for state defendants, in a suit by prison inmates for certain prison reforms, to establish certain timetables for and proceed to implement (a) adequate medical facilities and services, and (b) the reduction of overcrowding of prison inmates at residential camps as well as the elimination of those residential camps unfit for human habitation. Gates v. Collier, 390 F. Supp. 482, 1975 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14056 (N.D. Miss. 1975), aff'd, 525 F.2d 965, 1976 U.S. App. LEXIS 13465 (5th Cir. 1976).

       An opinion in a class action brought by inmates of the state penitentiary against the superintendent of the penitentiary, members of the Mississippi Penitentiary Board, and the governor (joined in by the United States as plaintiff intervenor) describes in some detail the undesirable and unconstitutional conditions existing at the penitentiary. The trial court granted both prohibitory and affirmative relief to ensure compliance with the court’s orders. Gates v. Collier, 349 F. Supp. 881, 1972 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12007 (N.D.

   Mississippi Department of Corrections (MDOC) was considered an arm of the state for purposes of Eleventh Amendment immunity because state statute, Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c05s47-5-1" target="_self">47-5-1</a></cite> et. seq., considered the MDOC an arm of the state; additionally, the MDOC was funded by the state. The department was responsible for the confinement of prisoners throughout the state; it apparently had the authority to sue and be sued in its own name, and, finally, it was authorized by Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c05s47-5-5" target="_self">47-5-5</a></cite> to hold and use property. Morgan v. Mississippi, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 74001 (S.D. Miss.

   In damages action brought by former inmate alleging, inter alia, breach of duty imposed by this section and by §§<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c05s47-5-1" target="_self">47-5-1</a></cite> and<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c05s47-5-45" target="_self">47-5-45</a></cite> [repealed], the court’s recognition of an immunity defense for the superintendents and the assistant superintendent, raised with regard to a cause of action brought under 42 USCS § 1983, was dispositive of this claim as well; simple negligence in the performance of the superintendents’ duties was not sufficient to support their liability for money damages for injuries suffered in prison by the plaintiff. Bogard v. Cook, 405 F. Supp. 1202, 1975 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15354 (N.D. Miss. 1975), aff'd, 586 F.2d 399, 1978 U.S. App. LEXIS 6984 (5th Cir. Miss. 1978).

       The district court’s findings that conditions at the Mississippi State Penitentiary denied inmates proper care, treatment, and feeding as required by statute, and the relief therein ordered, were affirmed. Gates v. Collier, 501 F.2d 1291, 1974 U.S. App. LEXIS 6790 (5th Cir. Miss. 1974).

       There is a constitutional requirement for state defendants, in a suit by prison inmates for certain prison reforms, to establish certain time-tables for and proceed to implement (a) adequate medical facilities and services, and (b) the reduction of overcrowding of prison inmates at residential camps as well as the elimination of those residential camps unfit for human habitation. Gates v. Collier, 390 F. Supp. 482, 1975 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14056 (N.D. Miss. 1975), aff'd, 525 F.2d 965, 1976 U.S. App. LEXIS 13465 (5th Cir. 1976).
      </p>
      <p>
       Mississippi recognizes that its prisoners must be afforded civilized treatment, imposing on the penitentiary superintendent the general common law duty of the custodian of a prisoner to take proper care of him, and civil rights protestors, who were detained in the Mississippi penitentiary merely for the purpose of holding them for trial, with male prisoners required to strip naked and remain in such state for up to 32 hours and detained in cells with inadequate hygienic facilities and no bedding, and with female prisoners required to strip to their undergarments and permitted to have no personal belongings including medicine or sanitary napkins and given quantities of laxatives, and who brought an action against state and municipal authorities, were subjected to inhuman treatment in violation of this statute. Anderson v. Nosser, 438 F.2d 183, 1971 U.S. App. LEXIS 11905 (5th Cir. Miss. 1971), modified, 456 F.2d 835, 1972 U.S. App. LEXIS 10947 (5th Cir. Miss. 1972).

       The superintendent of a state prison farm, vested with exclusive management and control thereof by virtue of Code 1942, § 7930, who inflicted cruel and unusual punishment upon civil rights demonstrators charged with parading without a permit who had not been arraigned or tried for the offense charged, violated 42 USCS § 1983. Anderson v. Nosser, 438 F.2d 183, 1971 U.S. App. LEXIS 11905 (5th Cir. Miss. 1971), modified, 456 F.2d 835, 1972 U.S. App. LEXIS 10947 (5th Cir. Miss. 1972).

The first publication shall be made not less than ten (10) days before the date of the public contract, and the last publication shall be made not more than seven (7) days before that date. The Department of Finance and Administration may reject any and all bids. If all bids on a tract or parcel of land are rejected, the Department of Finance and Administration may then advertise for new bids on that tract or parcel of land. Successful bidders shall take possession of their leaseholds at the time authorized by the Department of Finance and Administration. However, rent shall be due no later than the day upon which the lessee shall assume possession of the leasehold, and shall be due on the anniversary date for each following year of the lease. The Department of Finance and Administration may provide in any lease that rent shall be paid in full in advance or paid in installments, as may be necessary or appropriate. In addition, the Department of Finance and Administration may accept, and the lease may provide for, assignments of federal, state or other agricultural support payments, growing crops or the proceeds from the sale thereof, promissory notes, or any other good and valuable consideration offered by any lessee to meet the rent requirements of the lease. If a promissory note is offered by a lessee, it shall be secured by a first lien on the crop of the lessee, or the proceeds from the sale thereof. The lien shall be filed pursuant to Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code and Section 1324 of the Food Security Act of 1985, as enacted or amended. If the note is not paid at maturity, it shall bear interest at the rate provided for judgments and decrees in Section 75-17-7 from its maturity date until the note is paid. The note shall provide for the payment of all costs of collection and reasonable attorney’s fees if default is made in the payment of the note. The payment of rent by promissory note or any means other than cash in advance shall be subject to the approval of the Public Procurement Review Board, which shall place the approval of record in the minutes of the board.

       The classification hearing officer shall be responsible for assigning a classification to each offender within forty (40) days after the offender’s commitment to the custody of the department. The classification shall determine the offender’s work duties, living quarters, educational, vocational or other rehabilitation programs, and privileges to be accorded the offender while in custody of the department. The classification hearing officer, in assigning classifications, shall consider the offender’s age, offense and surrounding circumstances, the complete record of the offender’s criminal history including records of law enforcement agencies or of a youth court regarding that offender’s juvenile criminal history, family background, education, practical or employment experience, interests and abilities as evidenced by mental and psychological examination and knowledge obtained by the classification hearing officer in personal interview with the offender. The classification hearing officer shall use the above criteria to assign each offender a classification which will serve and enhance the best interests and general welfare of the offender. The designee or designees of the commissioner shall approve or disapprove each classification. The classification hearing officer shall provide the State Parole Board with a copy of the classification assigned to each offender in the custody of the department who is eligible for parole.

The commissioner, in emergency situations, may suspend the classification of an offender or offenders for a period of not exceeding fifteen (15) days to relieve the emergency situation. The classification of each offender may be reviewed by a classification hearing officer at least once each year. In no case shall an offender serve as a servant in the home of any employee other than authorized by the commissioner.

       Inmate’s conviction for carrying a concealed weapon was enough to have him removed from the Community Work Center and placed at a state prison; inmates had no property or liberty interest as to their housing assignment. Hamilton v. Ruffin, 875 So. 2d 1125, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 587 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Under Mississippi law, classification of inmates is the responsibility of Department of Corrections, and inmate has no right to particular classification; thus, prison inmate whose custody status was reduced to “close custody” classification has no liberty interest in classification under Due Process Clause, and where prison officials did not abuse discretion in changing custody status, prisoner is not entitled to preliminary injunctions against physical restraints to which he was subjected as result of change in status. Tubwell v. Griffith, 742 F.2d 250, 1984 U.S. App. LEXIS 18287 (5th Cir. Miss. 1984).

The commissioner shall, by correspondence or otherwise, verify or disprove such statements, if practicable, and shall preserve the record and information so obtained for future reference.

      </h4>
      <p>
       The 2005 amendment added “however, beginning July 1, 2006, no person under the age of twenty-one (21) who has committed a nonviolent offense, and who is under the jurisdiction of the Department of Corrections, shall be subject to the fifteen percent (15%) limitation for earned time allowances as described in this subsection (5)” at the end of (5).
      </p>
      <p>
       The 2012 amendment substituted “served on earned-release supervision before revocation, shall be applied to reduce his sentence” for “was on earned-release supervision, shall not be applied to and shall not reduce his sentence” at the end of (7).
      </p>
      <p>
       The 2014 amendment brought the section forward and amended it with a minor stylistic change in (2).

   As the allegations in an inmate’s motion for postconviction relief were contradicted by his prior sworn statements, and his claims had no arguable basis in law or in fact and had no realistic chance for success, the postconviction court did not abuse its discretion in finding the motion frivolous and ordering the forfeiture of 60 days of his earned time under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c05s47-5-138" target="_self">47-5-138</a></cite>. Bell v. State, 102 So.3d 297, 2012 Miss. App. LEXIS 489 (Miss. Ct. App. 2012), cert. denied, 119 So.3d 328, 2013 Miss. LEXIS 446 (Miss. 2013).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Circuit court did not abuse its discretion in deeming appellant’s second post-conviction (PCR) motion frivolous and ordering the forfeiture of sixty days of his earned-time credit under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c05s47-5-138ol13bi" target="_self">47-5-138(3)(b)(i)</a></cite> because appellant entered a voluntary guilty plea, which waived his right to challenge the search warrant; the PCR motion offered nothing more than conclusory allegations framed as newly discovered evidence, and it had no realistic chance of success, was not premised upon an arguably sound basis in fact and law, and set forth no facts that would warrant relief. Russell v. State, 73 So.3d 542, 2011 Miss. App. LEXIS 327 (Miss. Ct. App. 2011).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c05s47-5-138" target="_self">47-5-138</a></cite> limits the maximum amount of earned time and meritorious earned time an offender could receive to one-half of his total sentence, but there is nothing in the statute that automatically entitles an offender to serve only fifty percent of his sentence. Hearron v. Miss. Dep't of Corr., 22 So.3d 1238, 2009 Miss. App. LEXIS 827 (Miss. Ct. App. 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where defendant pled guilty to statutory rape, the trial court did not err by sentencing defendant to participate in the Mississippi Regimented Inmate Discipline Program program under its own discretion, and not under the earned-time allowance program administered by the Mississippi DOC. Gatlin v. State, 18 So.3d 290, 2009 Miss. App. LEXIS 199 (Miss. Ct. App. 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Despite the fact that an inmate was entitled to an earned-time allowance of one-half of his total sentence, including mandatory time because he was convicted before the effective date of Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c05s47-5-139ol11e" target="_self">47-5-139(1)(e)</a></cite>, the earned-time allowance did not reduce the mandatory portions of his sentences or accelerate his parole eligibility date under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c07s47-7-3ol11" target="_self">47-7-3(1)</a></cite> or his tentative discharge date. Adams v. Gibbs, 988 So. 2d 395, 2008 Miss. App. LEXIS 409 (Miss. Ct. App. 2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial judge unquestionably could consider both the civil file in defendant’s post-conviction-relief proceedings and the entire record in the criminal proceedings, including the transcript of the guilty-plea hearing, in determining not only the issue of the merits of defendant’s post-conviction-relief petition, but also the issue of whether the petition was frivolous for the purpose of considering sanctions; the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in sanctioning defendant via a forfeiture of sixty days of accrued earned time. Moore v. State, 986 So. 2d 928, 2008 Miss. LEXIS 326 (Miss. 2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Trial court did not err in ordering the Department of Corrections to forfeit 60 days of defendant’s accrued earned time pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c05s47-5-138ol13a" target="_self">47-5-138(3)(a)</a></cite> for filing a frivolous motion because defendant presented no argument that would enable him to prevail upon appeal. Waddell v. State, 999 So. 2d 375, 2008 Miss. App. LEXIS 93 (Miss. Ct. App. 2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Inmate’s appeal was frivolous where the complaint never had a realistic chance of success, it failed to present an arguably sound basis in fact or law, and the inmate could not prove any set of facts that would warrant relief; the Mississippi department of corrections had to apply the provisions of Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c05s47-5-138ol13bi" target="_self">47-5-138(3)(b)(i)</a></cite> regarding forfeiture of 60 days of the inmate’s earned time release, if the inmate had any. Bessent v. Clark, 974 So. 2d 928, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 633 (Miss. Ct. App. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a case involving a motion for post-conviction relief, there was no error in finding that the motion was frivolous since there was no newly discovered evidence in a case arising from a guilty plea in 2004, as defendant had claimed; therefore, the loss of earned time was appropriate. Coleman v. State, 971 So. 2d 637, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 420 (Miss. Ct. App. 2007), cert. denied, 2007 Miss. LEXIS 681 (Miss. Dec. 6, 2007), cert. denied, 2007 Miss. LEXIS 684 (Miss. Dec. 6, 2007), cert. denied, 973 So. 2d 244, 2007 Miss. LEXIS 686 (Miss. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Notwithstanding a time bar, a post-conviction claim failed on the merits because earned time and trusty time were not allowed for an escape conviction under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c05s47-5-139ol13" target="_self">47-5-139(3)</a></cite> since certain conditions were not met, and defendant was erroneously allowed to keep the time that was credited to his non-mandatory sentences; because defendant was convicted of violating a state statutory provision instead of a prison rule, he was not entitled to receive an administrative hearing and have the forfeiture of earned time approved. Golden v. Epps, 958 So. 2d 271, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 392 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. dismissed, 968 So. 2d 948, 2007 Miss. LEXIS 610 (Miss. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant was not prejudiced by the imposition of a forfeiture of good time based on a meritless motion for post-conviction relief because he was not eligible for such as a habitual offender. Adams v. State, 962 So. 2d 640, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 38 (Miss. Ct. App. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Defendant’s discontentment concerning the loss of good time credits was without merit; under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c05s47-5-138" target="_self">47-5-138</a></cite>, the court may order forfeiture of good time credits upon a finding that the lawsuit was frivolous; the trial court ruled that the present suit was frivolous, and the appellate court would not disturb that finding as defendant’s motion was procedurally barred. Smith v. State, 922 So. 2d 43, 2006 Miss. App. LEXIS 126 (Miss. Ct. App. 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Order summarily dismissing petitioner’s motion for post-conviction relief was upheld where, contrary to his allegations, there was no requirement in Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c05s47-5-138" target="_self">47-5-138</a></cite> that there be an evidentiary hearing before a classification board prior to the loss of earned time; in his brief, petitioner did not address any of the specific instances in which his earned time was forfeited or show that any evidentiary hearing would have been beneficial. Stewart v. State, 938 So. 2d 344, 2006 Miss. App. LEXIS 694 (Miss. Ct. App. 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   As an inmate was sentenced after June 30, 1995, and was subject to the earned release supervision (ERS) that was present in Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c05s47-5-138ol15" target="_self">47-5-138(5)</a></cite>, the inmate’s arguments that inmate’s fifteen percent earned time allowance should not be spent on ERS was without merit and his complaint was properly dismissed. Peters v. State, 935 So. 2d 1064, 2006 Miss. App. LEXIS 11 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 936 So. 2d 367, 2006 Miss. LEXIS 400 (Miss. 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court did not err in applying the earned time forfeiture statute after the inmate’s petition for post-conviction relief was denied as the present petition addressed issues that had previously been raised and resolved on appeal. Moore v. Miss. Dep't of Corr., 936 So. 2d 941, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 973 (Miss. Ct. App. 2005), cert. denied, 2006 Miss. LEXIS 560 (Miss. Aug. 24, 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Appellate court affirmed the denial of an inmate’s motion for post-conviction relief and his claim that he should have been released after serving seven and one-half years of his 15-year sentence, as it was clear that the Mississippi Department of Corrections (MDOC) had authority to revoke the inmate’s earned time under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c05s47-5-138" target="_self">47-5-138</a></cite> for violating the internal rules of the MDOC. Sanders v. Miss. Dep't of Corr., 912 So. 2d 189, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 713 (Miss. Ct. App. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Trial court properly denied defendant’s “motion to correct sentence” because applying Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c05s47-5-138" target="_self">47-5-138</a></cite> to him was clearly impermissible under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c07s47-7-3" target="_self">47-7-3</a></cite>, as he was an offender over 19 years of age and clearly ineligible for parole. Smith v. State, 914 So. 2d 330, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 793 (Miss. Ct. App. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because the record did not support any finding of ineffectiveness of counsel, the claim upon which defendant’s petition for post-conviction relief was based, but rather indicated that defendant understood all matters to which he pled and was satisfied with the performance of his attorney, it was within the trial court’s discretion to order that defendant forfeit 60 days of earned time. Stanley v. State, 904 So. 2d 1127, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 973 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       There was no merit to petitioner’s contention that, since he was not eligible to accrue earned time at the time of his attempted escape, during the mandatory portion of his sentence, he had no earned time to be forfeited; the escape attempt resulted in a forfeiture of all of petitioner’s earned time credit. Boler v. Bailey, 840 So. 2d 734, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 182 (Miss. Ct. App. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       In determining whether a case brought in forma pauperis should be dismissed as frivolous, the courts had a three-part test; did the complaint have a realistic chance of success, did it present an arguably sound basis in fact and law, and could the complainant prove any set of facts that would warrant relief. Dock v. State, 802 So. 2d 1051, 2001 Miss. LEXIS 272 (Miss. 2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       An inmate could not accrue earned-time allowance in excess of 15 percent of his sentence, all prisoners were required to serve, at a minimum, 85 percent of their term of confinement. Hall v. State, 800 So. 2d 1202, 2001 Miss. App. LEXIS 347 (Miss. Ct. App. 2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing in the earned time forfeiture provision prevents pro se inmates from seeking relief; the purpose of the statute is to reduce frivolous filings on the part of all incarcerated individuals, whether literate or illiterate, pro se or represented by counsel. Holt v. State, 757 So. 2d 1088, 2000 Miss. App. LEXIS 211 (Miss. Ct. App. 2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       The trial court acted within appropriate boundaries when ordering that a certified copy of the final order dismissing a petition for post-conviction relief as frivolous be forwarded to the Mississippi Department of Corrections for action under subsection (3)(b), where the petitioner had previously petitioned the trial court for relief from sentence and other relief, and the same was deemed frivolous in a prior order, and he then filed his second petition with knowledge that his first petition had been deemed frivolous. Holt v. State, 757 So. 2d 1088, 2000 Miss. App. LEXIS 211 (Miss. Ct. App. 2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       While forfeiture of time has become an additional option that a trial judge may exercise in imposing sanctions for frivolous motions, the trial judge may also impose monetary sanctions. Retherford v. State, 749 So. 2d 269, 1999 Miss. App. LEXIS 550 (Miss. Ct. App. 1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       Statutory amendment that required that 85% of sentence be served and that eliminated opportunities for parole that had previously existed was an ex post facto law as applied to defendants who had been charged with crimes before effective date of statute and whose charges were not to be disposed of until after effective date. Puckett v. Abels, 684 So. 2d 671, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 636 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       A prisoner serving a 20-year sentence was not entitled to a deduction of earned time from his parole eligibility date since he did not become eligible for earned time until after the Attorney General issued an opinion discontinuing the practice of allowing earned time to shorten parole eligibility. McFadden v. State, 523 So. 2d 77, 1988 Miss. LEXIS 87 (Miss. 1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       The actions of corrections officials in designating a prisoner eligible for earned time, due to an administrative or clerical error, and then in withdrawing that designation, did not amount to a forfeiture of earned time without due process since no earned time was accumulated by the prisoner. Doctor v. State, 522 So. 2d 229, 1988 Miss. LEXIS 81 (Miss. 1988).
      </p>

       The defendant was not deprived of due process in connection with his forfeiture of good time credits as it was apparent that this section provides much greater procedural protections than those which are typically found in extra-judicial prison revocation proceedings in that it only provides for a revocation of good time credits in the event that a “final order” is issued dismissing the prisoner’s lawsuit.

       This section is not rendered unconstitutional by the fact that it does not contain a provision granting inmates a right to counsel in appealing a revocation of good time credits under the statute as there is no right of counsel for appeals from inmate lawsuits which have been dismissed as frivolous.

       The statute is not rendered unconstitutional by the fact that it does not contain a provision for an inmate to file an in forma pauperis appeal from a ruling ordering the forfeiture of a prisoner’s earned good time credits since there is no constitutional right to appeal in forma pauperis from inmate lawsuits which have been dismissed as frivolous.

      <p>
       The 2004 amendment in (1), substituted “thirty (30)” for “ten (10)” and inserted “during any calendar month” following “thirty (30) days of participation”; and added (2).

       The 2010 amendment rewrote (2)(e), which formerly read: “The offender was convicted of violating Section 41-29-139(a) and sentenced under Section 41-29-139(b) or 41-29-139(f).”

       The 2014 amendment deleted former (2)(e) which read: “The offender was convicted of possession with the intent to deliver or sell a controlled substance under Section 41-29-139; or”; and redesigned the remaining subsection accordingly; and made minor stylistic changes throughout.

   Because appellant’s argument that his sentence should be reduced or his probation modified under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c05s47-5-138.1" target="_self">47-5-138.1</a></cite> was raised for the first time on appeal, it was procedurally barred, and appellant failed to implicate a fundamental constitutional right to except his argument from the procedural bar, therefore the trial court properly dismissed appellant’s motion for postconviction relief. Monroe v. State, 203 So.3d 1140, 2016 Miss. App. LEXIS 675 (Miss. Ct. App. 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       Inmate’s trusty-time credit was properly revoked because (1) anyone convicted of a sex offense was not eligible for such time, and (2) the inmate had been convicted of sexual battery, conspiracy to commit sexual battery, and contributing to the delinquency of a minor who was sexually abused. King v. McCarty, 196 So.3d 175, 2016 Miss. App. LEXIS 405 (Miss. Ct. App. 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Notwithstanding a time bar, a post-conviction claim failed on the merits because earned time and trusty time were not allowed for an escape conviction under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c05s47-5-139ol13" target="_self">47-5-139(3)</a></cite> since certain conditions were not met, and defendant was erroneously allowed to keep the time that was credited to his non-mandatory sentences; because defendant was convicted of violating a state statutory provision instead of a prison rule, he was not entitled to receive an administrative hearing and have the forfeiture of earned time approved. Golden v. Epps, 958 So. 2d 271, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 392 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. dismissed, 968 So. 2d 948, 2007 Miss. LEXIS 610 (Miss. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant, who was convicted of armed robbery, was not allowed to accrue earned-time credits because the sentence for armed robbery was a mandatory day for day sentence, and defendant was not eligible for parole. Wells v. State, 936 So. 2d 479, 2006 Miss. App. LEXIS 596 (Miss. Ct. App. 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because the inmate began serving his mandatory sentences as an habitual offender, totaling six years, on September 29, 2000, he would be serving them until September 29, 2006; and therefore, he remained ineligible for trusty status. Snow v. Johnson, 913 So. 2d 334, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 257 (Miss. Ct. App. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Both defendant and the Mississippi Attorney General’s Office agreed that defendant’s parole and release dates were incorrectly calculated as to the date his sentence began and credits and trusty time. Thus, the appellate court reversed the determination that defendant was not entitled to a hearing and remanded the matter to the Mississippi Parole Board to allow the Board to make the exact calculations of defendant’s parole and release dates; however, on remand, the Board was free to grant or deny defendant’s petition for parole and the circuit court had no authority to determine defendant’s parole eligibility. Lizana v. Scott, 910 So. 2d 31, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 30 (Miss. Ct. App. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       There was no merit to petitioner’s contention that, since he was not eligible to accrue earned time at the time of his attempted escape during the mandatory portion of his sentence, he had no earned time to be forfeited; the escape attempt resulted in a forfeiture of all of petitioner’s earned time credit. Boler v. Bailey, 840 So. 2d 734, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 182 (Miss. Ct. App. 2003).

Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c05s47-5-138.1" target="_self">47-5-138.1</a></cite> to the inmate constituted an ex post facto violation, resolution of this issue required an evidentiary hearing.

   Notwithstanding a time bar, a post-conviction claim failed on the merits because earned time and trusty time were not allowed for an escape conviction under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c05s47-5-139ol13" target="_self">47-5-139(3)</a></cite> since certain conditions were not met, and defendant was erroneously allowed to keep the time that was credited to his non-mandatory sentences; because defendant was convicted of violating a state statutory provision instead of a prison rule, he was not entitled to receive an administrative hearing and have the forfeiture of earned time approved. Golden v. Epps, 958 So. 2d 271, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 392 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. dismissed, 968 So. 2d 948, 2007 Miss. LEXIS 610 (Miss. 2007).

   Defendant was not entitled to parole consideration on a rape conviction based on the fact that defendant was 19 when the offense was committed because the former Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c07s47-7-3" target="_self">47-7-3</a></cite> allowed parole consideration only in cases where the defendant was convicted of statutory rape; former Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c05s47-5-139" target="_self">47-5-139</a></cite> precluded good time credit for any sex offense. Braziel v. Bailey, 835 So. 2d 962, 2003 Miss.

       There was no merit to petitioner’s contention that, since he was not eligible to accrue earned time at the time of his attempted escape during the mandatory portion of his sentence, he had no earned time to be forfeited; the escape attempt resulted in a forfeiture of all of petitioner’s earned time credit.

       Where a juvenile convicted of murder receives a life sentence, conditional release does not satisfy the mandate of Miller v. Alabama, 2012 U.S. LEXIS 4873, because conditional release is more akin to clemency, which is different from parole despite some surface similarities, and conditional release would not be determined by the sentencing authority at the time of sentencing based on age and other characteristics, as Miller mandates. Parker v. State, 119 So.3d 987, 2013 Miss. LEXIS 321 (Miss. 2013).

       <p>
   Defendant, convicted of murder, argued that because of his age, under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c05s47-5-139ol11a" target="_self">47-5-139(1)(a)</a></cite> he was subjected to greater punishment for his crime than others sentenced to life imprisonment at age 50 or older; the appellate court rejected his argument that the age distinction in the statute subjected a younger individual to a longer punishment that was cruel and unusual, since his life sentence fell within the statutory limits designated by the Mississippi Legislature. Knox v. State, 912 So. 2d 1004, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 207 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 921 So. 2d 344, 2005 Miss. LEXIS 686 (Miss. 2005).

   Inmate’s petition arguing that the Mississippi Department of Corrections illegally took his earned time allowance away from him was properly dismissed for failure to state a claim. The inmate claims of due process/ex post facto violations were fatally flawed as had not legally acquired any earned time allowances because he was not eligible for earn time allowances on the mandatory portion of his sentences for armed robbery, pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c05s47-5-139ol11e" target="_self">47-5-139(1)(e)</a></cite>. Adams v. Epps, 900 So. 2d 1210, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 145 (Miss. Ct.

   Defendant’s sentence of life imprisonment for murder conviction was upheld because Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c05s47-5-139ol11a" target="_self">47-5-139(1)(a)</a></cite> was not violative of defendant’s due process and equal protection rights by specifying criteria to consider in determining which inmates could or could not be considered for earned time allowance.

   A defendant who was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment for armed robbery and 15 years imprisonment for manslaughter to run consecutively, would be eligible for parole on March 30, 1993, where he began the service of his 10-year armed robbery sentence on the date of his initial arrest pursuant to §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.99.html#t99c19s99-19-23" target="_blank">99-19-23</a></cite>, he was legally released from that sentence 10 years later on February 5, 1990 but remained held under the 15-year manslaughter sentence, and he earned substantial meritorious earned time; although he would ordinarily have been required to serve at least 1/4 of the manslaughter sentence-3 years and 9 months-before he became eligible for parole, his earned time advanced his earliest parole eligibility date by approximately 7 months.

   Pursuant to Miss.

   Although the inmate argued that Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c05s47-5-139" target="_self">47-5-139</a></cite> should be interpreted to allow his non-mandatory sentences to run concurrently with his mandatory sentences, thus entitling him to be released from prison; the appellate court was unable to grant such relief where the Mississippi Department of Corrections (MDOC) had to be allowed to interpret its statutes in a manner that allowed the Mississippi Parole Board to impose an enhanced penalty for habitual offenders, and MDOC’s interpretation of Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.99.html#t99c19s99-19-21" target="_blank">99-19-21</a></cite> as it applied to subsequent mandatory sentences was correct. Snow v.

   The meritorious earned time provision in Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c05s47-5-142" target="_self">47-5-142</a></cite> clearly referred to a “reduction of sentence,” and was not subject to the earned release supervision in Miss.

      </p>
      <p>
       Both defendant and the Mississippi Attorney General’s Office agreed that defendant’s parole and release dates were incorrectly calculated in regard to the date his sentence began, and as to credits and trusty time. Thus, the appellate court reversed the determination that defendant was not entitled to a hearing and remanded the matter to the Mississippi Parole Board to allow the Board to make the exact calculations of defendant’s parole and release dates; however, on remand, the Board was free to grant or deny defendant’s petition for parole and the circuit court had no authority to determine defendant’s parole eligibility. Lizana v. Scott, 910 So. 2d 31, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 30 (Miss. Ct. App. 2005).

   Inmate’s suit against prison officials seeking 180 days of meritorious earned time was properly dismissed where awarding the credit was within the discretion of the officials pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c05s47-5-142" target="_self">47-5-142</a></cite>, the inmate failed to resolve the matter by contacting his work supervisor, and he received no injury resulting from the denial of his meritorious earned time award. Green v. Sparkman, 829 So. 2d 1290, 2002 Miss. App. LEXIS 588 (Miss. Ct. App. 2002), cert. denied, 840 So. 2d 716, 2003 Miss. LEXIS 173 (Miss. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   The unexplained failure to award an inmate meritorious earned time did not amount to a violation of his federal and state constitutional rights to due process and equal protection, since an inmate’s earning of “time” is a matter of grace or privilege under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c05s47-5-142" target="_self">47-5-142</a></cite>, which provides that “meritorious earned time may be awarded.” Since correctional officials are vested with discretionary power to award time under certain conditions, inmates are not entitled to it.

      <p>
       <p>
   A defendant who was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment for armed robbery and 15 years imprisonment for manslaughter to run consecutively, would be eligible for parole on March 30, 1993, where he began the service of his 10-year armed robbery sentence on the date of his initial arrest pursuant to §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.99.html#t99c19s99-19-23" target="_blank">99-19-23</a></cite>, he was legally released from that sentence 10 years later on February 5, 1990 but remained held under the 15-year manslaughter sentence, and he earned substantial meritorious earned time; although he would ordinarily have been required to serve at least 1/4 of the manslaughter sentence-3 years and 9 months-before he became eligible for parole, his earned time advanced his earliest parole eligibility date by approximately 7 months.

      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The superintendent (warden) or other person in charge of prisoners, upon the death of any prisoner under his care and control, shall at once notify the county medical examiner or county medical examiner investigator (hereinafter “medical examiner”) of the county in which said prisoner died, of the death of the prisoner, and it shall be the duty of such medical examiner, when so notified of the death of such person, to obtain a court order and notify the State Medical Examiner of the death of such prisoner. It shall be mandatory that the State Medical Examiner cause an autopsy to be performed upon the body of the deceased prisoner. Furthermore, the State Medical Examiner shall investigate any case where a person is found dead on the premises of the correctional system, in accordance with Sections 41-61-51 through 41-61-79. The State Medical Examiner shall make a written report of his investigation, and shall furnish a copy of the same, including the autopsy report, to the superintendent (warden) and a copy of the same to the district attorney of the county in which said prisoner died. The copy so furnished to the district attorney shall be turned over by the district attorney to the grand jury, and it shall be the duty of the grand jury, if there be any suspicion of wrongdoing shown by the inquest papers, to thoroughly investigate the cause of such death.
     </p>
     <p>
      It shall be the duty of the medical examiner of the county in which said prisoner died to arrange for the remains to be transported to the State Medical Examiner for said autopsy, and accompanying the remains shall be the court order for autopsy and any documents or records pertaining to the deceased prisoner, institutional health records or other information relating to the circumstances surrounding the prisoner’s death. The State Medical Examiner shall arrange for the remains to be transported to the county in which said prisoner died following completion of the autopsy. If the remains are not claimed for burial within forty-eight (48) hours after autopsy, then said remains may be delivered to the University of Mississippi Medical Center for use in medical research or anatomical study.
     </p>
     <p>
      The provisions herein set forth in the first paragraph shall likewise apply to any case in which any person is found dead on the premises of the Mississippi State Penitentiary except that the autopsy to be performed on the body of such a person shall not be mandatory upon a person who is not a prisoner unless the medical examiner determines that the death resulted from circumstances raising questions as to the cause of death, in which case the medical examiner may cause an autopsy to be performed upon the body of such deceased person in the same manner as authorized to be performed upon the body of a deceased prisoner.
     </p>
     <p>
      Provided further, that the provisions herein shall apply with respect to any deceased prisoner who at the time of death is being detained by duly constituted state authority such as the Oakley Youth Development Center, Mississippi State Hospital at Whitfield, East Mississippi State Hospital, or any other state institution.
     </p>
     <p>
      The provisions of this section shall not apply to a prisoner who was lawfully executed as provided in Sections 99-19-49 through 99-19-55.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any officer or employee of the prison system or any other officer, employee or person having charge of any prisoner who shall fail to immediately notify the medical examiner of the death of such prisoner, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be punished by a fine of not less than One Hundred Dollars ($100.00) nor more than Five Hundred Dollars ($500.00) and by confinement in the county jail for not more than one (1) year.

Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c05s47-5-193" target="_self">47-5-193</a></cite>, was proper because there was ample evidence for the jury to find that defendant knowingly possessed the contraband phones, which were hidden in the crotch area of his thermal long underwear under four pairs of boxer shorts.

       Defendant’s argument that his conviction for bringing contraband into a jail facility must be reversed and rendered because the record lacked proof that the jacket in which the marijuana was found belonged to him lacked merit because (1) defendant’s testimony was the complete opposite of the testimony of three witnesses; (2) defendant’s testimony on cross-examination contradicted his direct testimony because it was not until cross-examination that defendant mentioned taking a jacket from a locker that he once shared with another inmate, and, on direct, defendant had stated that the jacket had come from another locker; (3) a witness testified that the marijuana was found in the sleeve of the jacket that defendant was wearing when he returned to the jail; and (4) a jury considered all of the testimony presented at trial and concluded that defendant was guilty as charged. Weeks v. State, 971 So. 2d 645, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 843 (Miss. Ct. App. 2007).

   In a case in which defendant was convicted of violating Miss. Code Ann, §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c05s47-5-193" target="_self">47-5-193</a></cite>, he unsuccessfully argued on appeal that the trial judge failed to instruct the jury to disregard evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts where there was no foundation for their admissibility and no showing that the probative value outweighed the prejudicial effect. Defense counsel failed to request a limiting instruction, and the trial judge was not required to issue the limiting instruction sua sponte after defense counsel objected; Rule 105 clearly placed the burden of requesting a Miss. R. Evid. Rule 404(b) limiting instruction upon counsel. Lindsey v. State, 29 So.3d 121, 2010 Miss. App. LEXIS 89 (Miss. Ct. App. 2010).

       Trial court erred in convicting defendant of possessing a cell phone in a correctional facility because the jury was wrongly instructed that they could convict defendant if the state proved defendant took the cell phone into the correctional facility; transporting contraband and possessing contraband are distinctly different. Instructing the jury as to persons taking cell phones into correctional facilities did not track the language of the applicable statute and improperly shifted the burden of proving the defendant was not in constructive possession of the cell phone to the defendant.

       Trial court did not err by denying defendant’s motions for a directed verdict, JNOV, or a new trial, as the evidence showed that defendant told the warden that the pills hidden inside the waistband of her pants were controlled substances. Warren v. State, 187 So.3d 616, 2016 Miss. LEXIS 137 (Miss. 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence supported defendant’s conviction of conspiracy to possess a controlled substance inside a correctional facility because (1) an officer observed defendant and another inmate stand by the exterior door to a jail’s yard, bend down, and retrieve items from underneath the door; [2] an officer found a small opening that could allow someone to slip an item through the door; and (3) officers found marijuana in envelopes in a blanket that defendant tried to pass to the other inmate when the inmates were searched as they reentered the jail.

      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant was convicted of possession of a controlled substance within a correctional facility after jailers found marijuana, aluminum foil, and a blunt cigar inside of a deodorant container she left for her incarcerated husband; defendant claimed it would have been impossible for her to hide the drugs in the deodorant container during the three to five minutes it took to get from the store where she purchased the deodorant to the jail. However, defendant’s appeal was based on a factual dispute that the jury resolved in the state’s favor, and the jury obviously rejected defendant’s impossibility defense. Woods v. State, 19 So.3d 817, 2009 Miss. App. LEXIS 721 (Miss. Ct. App. 2009).

      </h4>
      <p>
       Indictment, which tracked the language of this section, was sufficient, and, because neither the crime nor the penalty depended upon the identity of the controlled substance, the indictment for possession of a controlled substance in a correctional facility did not need to identify the substance allegedly possessed. Warren v. State, 187 So.3d 616, 2016 Miss. LEXIS 137 (Miss. 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although defendant asserted that the indictment was fatally defective for failure to specify the contraband that defendant conspired to possess in a correctional facility, the two count indictment included the essential statutory elements of the charges against defendant and provided sufficient notice so that defendant suffered no prejudice in preparing a defense. Furthermore, defendant was procedurally barred from arguing an objection to a multi-count indictment on appeal because defendant failed to raise the objection at trial. Graham v. State, 204 So.3d 329, 2016 Miss. App. LEXIS 113 (Miss. Ct. App. 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Trial court erred in denying defendant’s motion to dismiss due to a defective indictment where the indictment failed to specify the nature of the controlled substance that defendant was alleged to have possessed in violation of Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c05s47-5-198" target="_self">47-5-198</a></cite>, and the State’s failure to include the identity of the controlled substance prevented defendant from preparing a defense that her possession of the controlled substance was lawful. Warren v. State, 187 So.3d 631, 2015 Miss. App. LEXIS 40 (Miss. Ct. App. 2015), rev'd, 187 So.3d 616, 2016 Miss. LEXIS 137 (Miss. 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Although Mississippi caselaw on the issue of whether an indictment sufficiently specifies the nature of the controlled substance primarily addresses possession and trafficking of controlled substances pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.41.html#t41c29s41-29-139" target="_blank">41-29-139</a></cite> (Supp. 2014), the Court of Appeals of Mississippi sees no reason why this same reasoning should not extend to possession of a controlled substance in a correctional facility pursuant to Miss.

     </p>
     <p>
      Determine that the reports establish the existence of the conditions for a declaration of a prison system overcrowding state of emergency as described in Section 47-5-705 and declare a state of emergency, specifying an amount of advancement of parole eligibility dates from thirty (30) to ninety (90) days.

       Inmate’s statutory due-process rights were not violated because the inmate did not present any evidence to refute the finding of the Mississippi Department of Corrections that he made a threatening statement to another inmate, and the inmate was present at the hearing, acknowledged the allegations, and admitted the rule violation; the inmate did not request the presence of witnesses or ask to present evidence prior to his disciplinary hearing.

      </p>
      <p>
       Remanding to the circuit court for further review would serve no purpose and would be judicially inefficient since an inmate’s claim that he was denied statutory due process had no realistic chance of success; the inmate did not request or retain counsel, nor did he request that witnesses or evidence be presented at his disciplinary hearing, and the inmate admitted that he made a threatening statement to another inmate.

   Inmate’s appeal of a judgment denying his motion to mandate parole eligibility on his life sentence pursuant to the Mississippi Uniform Post-Conviction Collateral Relief Act was dismissed under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c05s47-5-803ol12" target="_self">47-5-803(2)</a></cite> because the inmate did not exhaust his administrative remedies; the Mississippi Department of Corrections (MDOC) had determined that the inmate was ineligible for parole consideration by the parole board, but the record was completely bare as to any proof that the inmate ever exhausted his administrative remedies or even voiced his grievance through the MDOC’s administrative-review procedure.

      <p>
       Circuit court erred in dismissing an inmate’s complaint for judicial review of a loss of privileges due to a rule violation report because the inmate exhausted his administrative remedies and sought judicial review within thirty days of receipt of the final decision of the Mississippi Department of Corrections; although the circuit court was presented with an incomplete record due to the inmate’s failure to file certain documentation, such failure did not preclude reversal. Willis v. Westley, 243 So.3d 805, 2018 Miss. App. LEXIS 171 (Miss. Ct. App. 2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       Parole eligibility did not clearly fall under the purview of administrative-review procedure. Therefore, the appellate court, in determining whether the Mississippi Department of Corrections correctly computed the date of an inmate’s parole eligibility, followed the rule that inmates could, but were not required to, use the administrative-review procedure as a way of challenging parole eligibility. Brown v. State, 230 So.3d 1069, 2017 Miss. App. LEXIS 156 (Miss. Ct. App. 2017).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Inmate’s disciplinary complaint should not have been dismissed for lack of jurisdiction because he made a timely filing after exhausting his administrative remedies, as required by Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c05s47-5-803" target="_self">47-5-803</a></cite> and Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c05s47-5-807" target="_self">47-5-807</a></cite>; the circuit court did not perform its full review function when it determined the inmate’s constitutional rights were not violated. Siggers v. Epps, 962 So. 2d 78, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 464 (Miss. Ct. App. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       Inmate’s argument that other prisoners were transferred from his custody status back to a less restrictive custody status, while he was not reclassified, was an issue which arose after reclassification, with no indication that it was properly presented for administrative relief; it was therefore not properly presented before the appellate court. Hurns v. Miss. Dep't of Corr., 878 So. 2d 223, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 162 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 878 So. 2d 67, 2004 Miss. LEXIS 918 (Miss. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   A defendant who wishes to challenge the revocation of his probation need not pursue the administrative remedies set out in Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c05s47-5-803" target="_self">47-5-803</a></cite>, as only a court can continue or revoke a defendant’s probation. Rodriguez v. State, 839 So. 2d 561, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 131 (Miss. Ct. App. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       The statute prohibits the state courts from hearing inmate complaints unless and until the prisoner exhausts the administrative review procedure. If a prisoner prematurely petitions the circuit court, the statute requires the court to stay the complaint for 90 days to allow completion of the administrative review procedure. Clary v. Lee, 763 So. 2d 921, 2000 Miss. App. LEXIS 335 (Miss. Ct. App. 2000).

Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c05s47-5-803ol12" target="_self">47-5-803(2)</a></cite>.

      </p>
      <p>
       Court of appeals was without jurisdiction to consider an inmate’s claims that a trial court erred in dismissing his petitions to show cause and clarify his sentence because there was no indication in the record that the inmate exhausted his administrative remedies on those claims; pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. ’ 47-5-803, the petitions had to be handled initially under administrative-review procedures, rather than in the courts. Walker v. State, 35 So.3d 555, 2010 Miss. App. LEXIS 167 (Miss. Ct. App. 2010).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Because there was clearly no evidence in the record showing that an inmate exhausted his administrative remedies through the Administrative Remedy Program of the Mississippi Department of Corrections (MDOC), in accordance with Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c05s47-5-803ol12" target="_self">47-5-803(2)</a></cite>, the trial court should have stayed the proceedings for ninety days to allow time for the inmate to exhaust his administrative remedies; however, a reversal of the case would be futile because the trial court record was thorough, and the MDOC clearly provided the trial court with sufficient information to determine whether the inmate’s sentence had been properly computed. Lee v. Kelly, 34 So.3d 1203, 2010 Miss. App. LEXIS 75 (Miss. Ct. App. 2010).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although an inmate was incarcerated outside of the state, the inmate was subject to imprisonment in Mississippi by virtue of a detainer, and therefore the trial court had jurisdiction to hear the inmate’s request for habeas corpus relief to compute the amount of time inmate had to serve on his Mississippi sentence; nevertheless, the inmate was procedurally barred from proceeding with his post-conviction relief claim until he exhausted available administrative remedies. Putnam v. Epps, 963 So. 2d 1232, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 421 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 964 So. 2d 508, 2007 Miss. LEXIS 503 (Miss. 2007).

   Trial court erred in denying and dismissing a habeas corpus petition on the ground that petitioner failed to exhaust administrative remedies because under Miss.

       When an inmate contested the Mississippi Department of Corrections’ (MDOC) revocation of most of inmate’s accrued trusty-time credit, the inmate’s complaint was properly dismissed because (1) the complaint had to be filed within 30 days of MDOC’s decision, and, (2) while MDOC did not prove it was filed more than 30 days after receiving MDOC’s decision dismissing the inmate’s administrative complaint contesting revocation of trusty-time credit, the record showed the inmate did not contest the original decision revoking trusty-time credit within 30 days.

Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c05s47-5-807" target="_self">47-5-807</a></cite>, the inmate only had 30 days to appeal the denial of his grievance with the Mississippi Department of Corrections, and the inmate did not seek review until more than two months later.

   Appellate court affirmed the denial of an inmate’s petition for post-conviction relief and his claim that he should have been released after serving seven and one-half years of his 15 year sentence; neither the appellate court nor the trial court had jurisdiction to review his sentence because the inmate had not exhausted all of his administrative remedies as required by Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c05s47-5-803ol12" target="_self">47-5-803(2)</a></cite> as the violations that caused him to lose earned time occurred between 1994 and 2000 and his motion for relief was not filed until 2003. Thus, the inmate did not comply with the 30-day time requirement in Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c05s47-5-807" target="_self">47-5-807</a></cite>. Sanders v. Miss.

       Trial court determined that defendant, having failed to seek judicial review within 30 days after receipt of the appropriate final decision, did not complete the final step required for judicial review; therefore, it properly determined that the trial court lacked authority to hear defendant’s grievances on the merits. Taylor v. State, 919 So. 2d 209, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 420 (Miss. Ct. App. 2005).
      </p>

       Trial court’s denial of defendant’s petition for postconviction relief was properly denied because he had until January 31, 1999 to appeal an administrative judgment, but did not do so until September 19, 2000.

      <p>
       Circuit court erred in dismissing an inmate’s complaint for judicial review of a loss of privileges due to a rule violation report because the inmate exhausted his administrative remedies and sought judicial review within thirty days of receipt of the final decision of the Mississippi Department of Corrections; although the circuit court was presented with an incomplete record due to the inmate’s failure to file certain documentation, such failure did not preclude reversal. Willis v. Westley, 243 So.3d 805, 2018 Miss. App. LEXIS 171 (Miss. Ct. App. 2018).

      <p>
       <p>
   Inmate’s appeal of a judgment denying his motion to mandate parole eligibility on his life sentence pursuant to the Mississippi Uniform Post-Conviction Collateral Relief Act was dismissed under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c05s47-5-803ol12" target="_self">47-5-803(2)</a></cite> because the inmate did not exhaust his administrative remedies; the Mississippi Department of Corrections (MDOC) had determined that the inmate was ineligible for parole consideration by the parole board, but the record was completely bare as to any proof that the inmate ever exhausted his administrative remedies or even voiced his grievance through the MDOC’s administrative-review procedure. Keys v. State, 67 So.3d 783, 2010 Miss. App. LEXIS 565 (Miss. Ct. App. 2010), rev'd, 67 So.3d 758, 2011 Miss. LEXIS 389 (Miss. 2011).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Because there was clearly no evidence in the record showing that an inmate exhausted his administrative remedies through the Administrative Remedy Program of the Mississippi Department of Corrections (MDOC), in accordance with Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c05s47-5-803ol12" target="_self">47-5-803(2)</a></cite>, the trial court should have stayed the proceedings for ninety days to allow time for the inmate to exhaust his administrative remedies; however, a reversal of the case would be futile because the trial court record was thorough, and the MDOC clearly provided the trial court with sufficient information to determine whether the inmate’s sentence had been properly computed. Lee v. Kelly, 34 So.3d 1203, 2010 Miss. App. LEXIS 75 (Miss. Ct. App. 2010).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Inmate’s disciplinary complaint should not have been dismissed for lack of jurisdiction because he made a timely filing after exhausting his administrative remedies, as required by Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c05s47-5-803" target="_self">47-5-803</a></cite> and Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c05s47-5-807" target="_self">47-5-807</a></cite>; the circuit court did not perform its full review function when it determined the inmate’s constitutional rights were not violated. Siggers v. Epps, 962 So. 2d 78, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 464 (Miss. Ct. App. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the inmate argued that he was placed in administrative segregation without review by a Mississippi Department of Corrections classification committee and administrative review in excess of 180 days, his assertion was not raised in an administrative review, nor brought before the circuit court, and as such was not reviewable by the appellate court. Hurns v. Miss. Dep't of Corr., 878 So. 2d 223, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 162 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 878 So. 2d 67, 2004 Miss. LEXIS 918 (Miss. 2004).

Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c05s47-5-807" target="_self">47-5-807</a></cite> is limited by a preceding section, Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c05s47-5-803" target="_self">47-5-803</a></cite>, which provides that no state court shall entertain an offender’s grievance unless and until such offender shall have exhausted the remedies as provided in such procedure.

      </p>
      <p>
       While an inmate had no liberty interest in his prison classification, the right to review of final decisions of the classification committee was conferred by statute; thus, the circuit court had jurisdiction to review the decision of the Mississippi Department of Corrections which removed the inmate from a house arrest program and placed him in the general prison population for a rule violation.

      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court erred in dismissing inmate’s complaint as untimely as under the “prison mailbox rule,” the date on which a pro se document was deemed filed was the date the prisoner placed it in the mail, not the date it was received by a court clerk; as the prisoner’s proof of service had the document mailed as timely, but it was not received by the county clerk in a timely manner, and the prison mail log had no record of the mailing, the dismissal of the inmate’s complaint was reversed. Easley v. Roach, 879 So. 2d 1041, 2004 Miss. LEXIS 1014 (Miss. 2004).

The commissioner shall respond in writing to the petition no later than thirty (30) days after the receipt of such petition. If the petition to remove such inmate is denied by the commissioner, such sheriff and his agents shall have from the date of denial absolute immunity from liability for any injury resulting from subsequent behavior or from medical consequences regarding such inmate, provided that such injury resulted from conditions which were set forth in such petition.

      <p>
       The Department of Corrections has authority to place an inmate, without the knowledge or permission of the court, in the Intensive Supervision Program when the court has sentenced the inmate to incarceration and the inmate is serving his court-imposed sentence.
   Bailey & 1999 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 335.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although this section is silent as to the length of time an offender may remain on house arrest, he may not be kept on house arrest past the date of the completion of his sentence. Bailey & 1999 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 335.
      </p>
      <p>
       An offender can be placed on house arrest if he is determined to be “low risk and nonviolent; ” an offender may not be placed on house arrest if he has been convicted of a sex crime, a felony for the sale or manufacture of a controlled substance or a felony involving the use of a deadly weapon, or if he has received a death sentence or been convicted of a crime for which life imprisonment is the maximum penalty, or if he has previously been confined for the conviction of a felony in any court or courts of the United States or of any state or territories thereof.
   Bailey & 1999 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 335.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once an offender is picked up and returned to the actual custody of the Department of Corrections for violating the conditions of house arrest, the decision whether to remove him from the program is left to the classification committee; there is nothing in this section forbidding the classification committee from setting conditions that would allow the offender to return to house arrest.
   Bailey & 1999 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 335.
      </p>
      <p>
       An offender in the intensive supervision program is to be considered an inmate and not a probationer or parolee and, therefore, the assumption is that the time served on house arrest is applied as time served on the offender’s sentence, even if he violates house arrest before serving the complete sentence; thus, an offender whose house arrest is revoked after successfully serving 11 months of a 12 month sentence would only have one month left to serve in the actual custody of the department.
   Bailey & 1999 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 335.
      </p>
      <p>
       Among offenders convicted under the Uniform Controlled Substances Law, only those persons convicted specifically of the sale or manufacture of a controlled substance are excluded from being placed in an intensive supervision program. 2000 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 629.
      </p>
      <p>
       The amendment to subsection (1), denying certain offenders eligibility for the Intensive Supervision Program has no effect on the length of incarceration and consequently does not violate the ex post facto clause when applied to those convicted prior to its passage. 2001 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 673.
      </p>
      <p>
       A circuit judge does not have the jurisdiction to modify a sentence of a defendant placed on house arrest after the expiration of the sentencing term. 2004 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 692.

Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c05s47-5-1003ol11" target="_self">47-5-1003(1)</a></cite> in exchange for the district attorney’s recommendation of house arrest but where house arrest was not a permissible punishment for that offense, the district attorney’s promise was illusory. Because no valid contract was formed, the agreement was an improper inducement to plead guilty in violation of Miss. Unif. Cir. &amp; County Ct. Prac. R. 8.04(A)(3), and defendant should have been allowed to withdraw his guilty plea. Littleton v. State, 3 So.3d 760, 2008 Miss. App. LEXIS 431 (Miss. Ct.

   Defendant’s sentence after being convicted of the sale of marijuana within a correctional facility was appropriate because the maximum fine and the minimum sentence that he received were both within the statutory limits of Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c05s47-5-198ol13" target="_self">47-5-198(3)</a></cite>; it was clear that the circuit court was more than lenient in imposing house arrest against defendant because he benefited through what appeared to have been legislative oversight as well as significant judicial restraint because, if he had been convicted of merely selling controlled substances, he could not have been sentenced to house arrest. Jackson v. State, 962 So. 2d 649, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 104 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 962 So. 2d 38, 2007 Miss. LEXIS 434 (Miss. 2007).

       Making the suspension of part of a defendant’s sentence contingent upon successful completion of an intensive supervision program is not prohibited by statute. Jenkins v. State, 910 So. 2d 23, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 4 (Miss. Ct. App. 2005), overruled in part, Graham v. State, 85 So.3d 860, 2011 Miss. App. LEXIS 33 (Miss. Ct. App. 2011).
      </p>
      <p>
       Had the inmate successfully completed the Intensive Supervision Program (ISP), and then been given a suspended sentence, the inmate would have had a right to a hearing prior to the revocation of ISP status, but the inmate did not make it to that point because the inmate failed the urine test four months short of completing the one year in ISP, and there was no denial of due process or equal protection. McBride v. Sparkman, 860 So. 2d 1237, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 1070 (Miss. Ct. App. 2003).
      </p>

       <p>
   Circuit court conditioned future suspension of fifteen years of the inmate’s sentence on her successful completion of the Intensive Supervision Program (ISP); the circuit court’s sentence was not prohibited by Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c05s47-5-1003ol14" target="_self">47-5-1003(4)</a></cite> where suspension of fifteen years of the inmate’s sentence was contingent upon her completion of the ISP, and successful completion of post-release supervision was conditioned upon obedience to the terms and conditions of post-release supervision spelled out in her court order, none of which required completion of the ISP; the inmate was not subject to removal from the ISP by the circuit court, but only by the Mississippi Department of Corrections. Ivory v. State, 999 So. 2d 420, 2008 Miss. App. LEXIS 735 (Miss. Ct. App. 2008), cert. denied, 999 So. 2d 852, 2009 Miss. LEXIS 51 (Miss. 2009).

   Although appellant’s sentence was a violation of Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c05s47-5-1003ol11" target="_self">47-5-1003(1)</a></cite>, this did not constitute reversible error; appellant did not suffer any prejudice by the imposition of house arrest and where a defendant is given an illegal sentence that is more favorable than what the legal sentence would have been then he/she is not later entitled to relief through a post-conviction action. Graham v. State, 2010 Miss. App. LEXIS 116 (Miss. Ct. App. Mar. 9, 2010), op. withdrawn, sub. op., 85 So.3d 860, 2011 Miss. App. LEXIS 33 (Miss. Ct. App. 2011).
      </p>
      <p>
       Inmate’s due process rights were not violated in a revocation hearing of his post-release supervision; he signed a waiver to a revocation hearing, admitted to the charges, and consented to immediate revocation of his post-release supervision. The inmate was given notice and an opportunity to be heard and was, therefore, not denied his due process rights. Williams v. State, 4 So.3d 388, 2009 Miss. App. LEXIS 128 (Miss. Ct. App. 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       Circuit court was correct in stating that incarceration in a Mississippi Department of Corrections facility was the only legal sentence available for an inmate after he violated his post-release supervision. His sentence to house arrest was clearly more lenient and favorable than incarceration and was a benefit to the inmate; therefore, such was harmless error, and the inmate was not prejudiced by the sentence and could not now attack its legality or complain of prejudice. Williams v. State, 4 So.3d 388, 2009 Miss. App. LEXIS 128 (Miss. Ct. App. 2009).

   Where appellant entered a guilty plea to possession of cocaine with intent and possession of cocaine, the offenses were not included on the list of offenses not eligible for the intensive supervision and house arrest program under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c05s47-5-1003" target="_self">47-5-1003</a></cite>; the trial court’s imposition of a 25-year sentence in intensive supervision was not an illegal sentence.

       <p>
   Motion for post-conviction relief was properly dismissed based on an allegation that an illegal sentence of house arrest was imposed under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c05s47-5-1003" target="_self">47-5-1003</a></cite> due to defendant’s prior convictions because defendant had benefitted from any error. Jefferson v.

   Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c05s47-5-1003" target="_self">47-5-1003</a></cite> prevented successful completion of house arrest from being made a condition of post-release supervision; if the 2005 sentence did state such a condition, the condition was ineffective, but since the trial judge said on post-conviction relief that there was no such condition, there was also no continuing issue. Burns v. State, 933 So. 2d 329, 2006 Miss. App. LEXIS 495 (Miss. Ct. App. 2006).

   Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c05s47-5-1003" target="_self">47-5-1003</a></cite> because the officer who found the drugs did not arrest him. The appellate court affirmed the denial of the inmate’s petition because the fact that the officer did not immediately arrest the inmate, but waited for an agent from the Mississippi Bureau of Narcotics to arrive, did not violate §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c05s47-5-1003" target="_self">47-5-1003</a></cite> because the officer who found the drugs was with the inmate the entire time, and the inmate was arrested the same day.

      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Defendant’s motion for postconviction relief was properly denied because his sentence was not illegal at the time it was entered and did not become illegal upon the passage of the 2000 amendment to
   Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c05s47-5-1003" target="_self">47-5-1003</a></cite>. The revision to §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c05s47-5-1003" target="_self">47-5-1003</a></cite> relied upon by defendant did not become effective until over a year and a half after his sentencing; while the legislature could have required resentencing under the new provision, it did not do so.
   McBride v. State, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 314 (Miss. Ct. App. May 10, 2005), op. withdrawn, sub. op., 914 So. 2d 260, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 524 (Miss. Ct. App. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Denial of the inmate’s petition for post-conviction relief was proper where the revision to Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c05s47-5-1003" target="_self">47-5-1003</a></cite> relied upon by him did not become effective until over a year and a half after his sentencing. Thus, his sentence was not illegal at the time it was entered and did not become illegal upon the passage of the revision. McBride v. State, 914 So. 2d 260, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 524 (Miss. Ct.

      <p>
       House arrest is not a form of probationary release and a prisoner under house arrest is confined as a prisoner under the jurisdiction of the Department of Corrections in the normally-understood sense of that term; thus, post-conviction relief is an inappropriate remedy for a prisoner to pursue after he is removed from house arrest and returned to the general prison population.

       Where the prisoner was removed from house arrest, the circuit court properly denied the prisoner’s motion for postconviction relief, because the prisoner had not received a suspended sentence and therefore a hearing prior to revocation was not necessary, and he was entitled to no further procedure as there was a rescission of the possibility of probation caused by his failure in the house arrest program. Moore v. State, 830 So. 2d 1274, 2002 Miss. App. LEXIS 640 (Miss. Ct. App. 2002).

       <p>
   Circuit court properly dismissed defendant’s motion for post-conviction relief because the Mississippi Department of Corrections revoked defendant’s participation in an in-house arrest program under the provisions of Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c05s47-5-1003ol13" target="_self">47-5-1003(3)</a></cite>, and the circuit court did not amend its original sentencing order. Reeder v. State, 822 So. 2d 1043, 2002 Miss. App. LEXIS 161 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 830 So. 2d 1251, 2002 Miss. App. LEXIS 719 (Miss. Ct. App. 2002).
      </p>
      <p>
       Department of Corrections had the authority to remove a defendant from an Intensive Supervision Program and place him directly in their custody without a hearing. Perry v. State, 798 So. 2d 643, 2001 Miss. App. LEXIS 443 (Miss. Ct. App. 2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       There was no violation of the statute where the appellant was removed from the house arrest program and placed into the general prison population to complete his original sentence by the Department of Corrections disciplinary committee since the disciplinary committee is not a separate entity, but is instead a part of the Department of Corrections classification committee. Smith v. State, 766 So. 2d 50, 2000 Miss. App. LEXIS 334 (Miss. Ct. App. 2000).

    Prerequisites for contracting for correctional services.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      A contract for correctional services shall not be entered into unless the following requirements are met:
     </p>
     <p>
      The contractor provides an adequate plan of insurance, specifically including insurance for civil rights claims, as determined by an independent risk management/actuarial firm with demonstrated experience in public liability for state governments. In determining the adequacy of the plan, such firm shall determine whether:
     </p>
     <p>
      The insurance is adequate to protect the state from any and all actions by a third party against the contractor or the state as a result of the contract;
     </p>
     <p>
      The insurance is adequate to protect the state against any and all claims arising as a result of any occurrence during the term of the contract; that is, the insurance is adequate on an occurrence basis, not on a claims-made basis;
     </p>
     <p>
      The insurance is adequate to assure the contractor’s ability to fulfill its contract with the state in all respects, and to assure that the contractor is not limited in this ability because of financial liability which results from judgments; and
     </p>
     <p>
      The insurance is adequate to satisfy such other requirements specified by the independent risk management/actuarial firm.
     </p>
     <p>
      The sovereign immunity of the state shall not apply to the contractor. Neither the contractor nor the insurer of the contractor may plead the defense of sovereign immunity in any action arising out of the performance of the contract.

     <p>
      The insurance is adequate to satisfy such other requirements specified by the independent risk management/actuarial firm.
     </p>
     <p>
      The sovereign immunity of the state shall not apply to the contractor. Neither the contractor nor the insurer of the contractor may plead the defense of sovereign immunity in any action arising out of the performance of the contract.
     </p>
     <p>
      The contractor shall post a performance bond to assure the contractor’s faithful performance of the specifications and conditions of the contract. The bond is required throughout the term of the contract. The terms and conditions must be approved by the Department of Corrections and the Department of Finance and Administration and such approval is a condition precedent to the contract taking effect.
     </p>
     <p>
      The contractor shall defend any suit or claim brought against the State of Mississippi arising out of any act or omission in the operation of a private facility, and shall hold the State of Mississippi harmless from such claim or suit. The contractor shall be solely responsible for the payment of any legal or other costs relative to any such claim or suit. The contractor shall reimburse the State of Mississippi for any costs that it may incur as a result of such claim or suit immediately upon being submitted a statement therefor by the Attorney General.
     </p>
     <p>
      The duties and obligations of the contractor pursuant to this subsection shall include, but not be limited to, any claim or suit brought under any federal or state civil rights or prisoners rights statutes or pursuant to any such rights recognized by common law or case law, or federal or state constitutions.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any suit brought or claim made arising out of any act or omission in the operation of a private facility shall be made or brought against the contractor and not the State of Mississippi.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Attorney General retains all rights and emoluments of his office which include direction and control over any litigation or claim involving the State of Mississippi.

In the event such hearing or hearings are had before officials of the receiving state, the governing law shall be that of the sending state and a record of the hearing or hearings as prescribed by the sending state shall be made. Said record together with any recommendations of the hearing officials shall be transmitted forthwith to the official or officials before whom the hearing would have been had if it had taken place in the sending state. In any and all proceedings had pursuant to the provisions of this subdivision, the officials of the receiving state shall act solely as agents of the sending state and no final determination shall be made in any matter except by the appropriate officials of the sending state.

An actual withdrawal shall not take effect until one (1) year after the notices provided in said statute have been sent. Such withdrawal shall not relieve the withdrawing state from its obligations assumed hereunder prior to the effective date of withdrawal. Before the effective date of withdrawal, a withdrawing state shall remove to its territory, at its own expense, such inmates as it may have confined pursuant to the provisions of this compact.

        Article X Construction and Severability
       </p>
       <p>
        The provisions of this compact shall be liberally construed and shall be severable. If any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this compact is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any participating state or of the United States or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If this compact shall be held contrary to the constitution of any state participating therein, the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining states and in full force and effect as to the state affected as to all severable matters.
       </p>
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      Whenever the duly constituted authorities in a state party to this compact, and which has entered into a contract pursuant to Article III, shall decide that confinement in, or transfer of an inmate to, an institution within the territory of another party state is necessary or desirable in order to provide adequate quarters and care or an appropriate program of rehabilitation or treatment, said officials may direct that the confinement be within an institution within the territory of said other party state, the receiving state to act in that regard solely as agent for the sending state.
     </p>
     <p>
      The appropriate officials of any state party to this compact shall have access, at all reasonable times, to any institution in which it has a contractual right to confine inmates for the purpose of inspecting the facilities thereof and visiting such of its inmates as may be confined in the institution.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any decisions of the sending state in respect of any matter over which it retains jurisdiction pursuant to this compact shall be conclusive upon and not reviewable within the receiving state, but if at the time the sending state seeks to remove an inmate from an institution in the receiving state there is pending against the inmate within such state any criminal charge or if the inmate is formally accused of having committed within such state a criminal offense, the inmate shall not be returned without the consent of the receiving state until discharged from prosecution or other form of proceeding, imprisonment or detention for such offense. The duly accredited officers of the sending state shall be permitted to transport inmates pursuant to this compact through any and all states’ party to this compact without interference.
     </p>
     <p>
      An inmate who escapes from an institution in which he is confined pursuant to this compact shall be deemed a fugitive from the sending state and from the state in which the institution is situated. In the case of an escape to a jurisdiction other than the sending or receiving state, the responsibility for institution of extradition or rendition proceedings shall be that of the sending state, but nothing contained herein shall be construed to prevent or affect the activities of officers and agencies of any jurisdiction directed toward the apprehension and return of an escapee.

      </h4>
      <p>
       In a post-conviction relief case, it was error to determine that this statute, which provided for graduated penalties for technical violations for probation and supervised release, was unconstitutional as violative of the separation of powers doctrine because there was nothing in the amendments to this statute that impinged upon a trial court’s ability to enforce its orders. The trial court retained its authority to determine whether there was a violation of a condition of supervised release, as well as the power to revoke the term of supervision and to impose a period of imprisonment; the Mississippi Legislature merely altered the term and place of imprisonment for certain violations. Atwood v. State, 183 So.3d 843, 2016 Miss. LEXIS 18 (Miss. 2016).

       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       Circuit court did not err in summarily dismissing appellant’s post-conviction-relief motion because its decision to impose a period of imprisonment greater than ninety days was not clearly erroneous since appellant committed at least three technical violations of his post-release supervision. Edmonson v. State, 238 So.3d 1218, 2018 Miss. App. LEXIS 101 (Miss. Ct. App. 2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because it was appellant’s first technical violation of his probation, he should have been sentenced to not more than ninety days in a technical-violation center or restitution center, not to the full term of his suspended sentence of five years’ incarceration. Walker v. State, 230 So.3d 709, 2016 Miss. App. LEXIS 666 (Miss. Ct. App. 2016), aff'd in part and rev'd in part, 230 So.3d 703, 2017 Miss. LEXIS 387 (Miss. 2017).

   Defendant was not entitled to relief when a trial court declined to recommend to the Parole Board that defendant be deemed parole eligible because (1) Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c07s47-7-3" target="_self">47-7-3</a></cite> gave the trial court discretion to issue such a recommendation, and (2) the denial did not implicate an appealable judgment. Barnett-Phillips v. State, 195 So.3d 226, 2016 Miss. App. LEXIS 377 (Miss. Ct. App. 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant was not eligible for parole on the sentences for two counts because they carried an enhanced penalty. Ferrell v. State, 158 So.3d 1204, 2015 Miss. App. LEXIS 65 (Miss. Ct. App. 2015).
      </p>
      <p>
       Circuit court did not err in denying a petition for post-conviction relief because although petitioner was given incorrect information regarding his parole eligibility, the error was harmless; the motivating factor for petitioner’s guilty pleas was not his parole eligibility the dismissal of five felony indictments, and any misinformation petitioner received concerning parole eligibility was harmless and did not invalidate his voluntary guilty pleas. Mosley v. State, 150 So.3d 127, 2014 Miss. App. LEXIS 613 (Miss. Ct. App. 2014), cert. dismissed, 158 So.3d 1153, 2015 Miss. LEXIS 155 (Miss. 2015).

Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.97.html#t97c03s97-3-21" target="_blank">97-3-21</a></cite> was not unconstitutionally vague and did not apply to the inmate where the inmate confused parole with conditional release as: (1) Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c07s47-7-3ol11f" target="_self">47-7-3(1)(f)</a></cite> prohibited parole for an inmate sentenced to life under Miss.

Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.01.html#t01c03s1-3-4" target="_blank">1-3-4</a></cite>; and (3) the inmate was eligible to petition for conditional release at age 65 under Miss.

   Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c07s47-7-3ol11g" target="_self">47-7-3(1)(g)</a></cite> does not abolish parole.

      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Defendant’s postconviction review motion was correctly denied because remarks made by the circuit judge during defendant’s sentencing hearing were merely surplusage, in that they were comments concerning defendant’s eligibility for parole; the parole board, not the circuit court, had exclusive authority for granting parole within the parameters set forth in Miss. Code. Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c07s47-7-3" target="_self">47-7-3</a></cite>. Chandler v. State, 27 So.3d 1199, 2010 Miss. App. LEXIS 9 (Miss. Ct. App. 2010).

   Dismissal of defendant's motion for post-conviction relief was proper because

Defendant had pleaded guilty on March 20, 2002, to one count of armed robbery and five counts of kidnapping.

      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Dismissal of an inmate’s petition to show cause was proper as the Mississippi State Parole Board had absolute discretion to confer or deny parole under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c07s47-7-3" target="_self">47-7-3</a></cite>, and the inmate failed to show that his due process rights were violated as there was no constitutionally recognized liberty interest with regard to parole.

      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Trial court did not err in denying the inmate's petition for a writ of mandamus;
   Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c07s47-7-3" target="_self">47-7-3</a></cite> did not require the parole board to give the inmate a psychiatric evaluation prior to the inmate's parole hearings; rather §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c07s47-7-3" target="_self">47-7-3</a></cite> clearly stated that an inmate must be eligible for parole before he was entitled to a psychiatric evaluation. Also, the inmate did not have a liberty interest in a psychiatric examination because
   Miss. Code Ann. § 47-7-3 and
   Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c07s47-7-17" target="_self">47-7-17</a></cite> used the permissive “may” and not the mandatory “shall.”
   Edmond v. Miller, 942 So. 2d 203, 2006 Miss. App. LEXIS 182 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 942 So. 2d 164, 2006 Miss. LEXIS 718 (Miss. 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Defendant’s capital murder conviction was proper because he did not need to receive a sentencing hearing since, even absent a procedural bar, if the State was not seeking the death penalty, the only possible sentence for conviction of capital murder was life without parole, Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.99.html#t99c19s99-19-101ol11" target="_blank">99-19-101(1)</a></cite> and<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c07s47-7-3ol11f" target="_self">47-7-3(1)(f)</a></cite>. Thus, a sentencing hearing was not necessary. Davis v. State, 914 So. 2d 200, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 269 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 921 So. 2d 344, 2005 Miss.

      </p>
      <p>
       Trusty time reduces the length of the sentences a defendant is required to serve, which in turn results in an earlier parole eligibility date. Lizana v. Scott, 910 So. 2d 31, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 30 (Miss. Ct. App. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Mississippi Parole Board is not required to place a prisoner on parole after a prisoner completes his sentences described in Miss.

      <p>

   Where the circuit court sentenced appellant who pled guilty to armed robbery to a fourteen-year sentence, but suspended seven years from that sentence, leaving a seven-year sentence, appellant was not subject to the ten-year minimum service requirement of
   Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c07s47-7-3ol1di" target="_self">47-7-3(d)(i)</a></cite> (now §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c07s47-7-3ol11ci" target="_self">47-7-3(1)(c)(i)</a></cite>).

Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c07s47-7-3ol11g" target="_self">47-7-3(1)(g)</a></cite>, describes those incarcerated for their first and sole offense; later convictions end “first offender” status even if the offenses occurred before the first conviction. McClurg v. State, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 592 (Miss. Ct. App. June 24, 2003), sub. op., 870 So. 2d 681, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 572 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).

      </p>
      <p>

   Defendant was not entitled to parole consideration on a rape conviction based on the fact that defendant was 19 when the offense was committed because the former Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c07s47-7-3" target="_self">47-7-3</a></cite> allowed parole consideration only in cases where the defendant was convicted of statutory rape; former Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c05s47-5-139" target="_self">47-5-139</a></cite> precluded good time credit for any sex offense. Braziel v. Bailey, 835 So. 2d 962, 2003 Miss.

   According to Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c07s47-7-3ol11f" target="_self">47-7-3(1)(f)</a></cite>, there is no longer the possibility of life imprisonment; by giving only the sentencing options of death or life imprisonment without parole, the trial judge properly gave the jury all the instructions that were needed. Flowers v. State, 2003 Miss. LEXIS 67 (Miss. Feb. 20, 2003), op. withdrawn, sub. op., 842 So. 2d 531, 2003 Miss. LEXIS 149 (Miss. 2003).

      <p>

   When read in pari materia, §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.97.html#t97c03s97-3-21" target="_blank">97-3-21</a></cite> and this section provide juries with the option of sentencing capital defendants to life without parole as long as any proceeding, from pretrial through resentencing, that follows the actual charge occurs after July 1, 1994; simultaneously, the two statutes preclude the parole board from granting parole to any capital defendant who was charged after July 1, 1994. West v. State, 725 So. 2d 872 (Miss. 1998), overruled by Wilson v. State, 194 So.3d 855 (Miss. 2016), to the extent that West improperly changed Section<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.99.html#t99c19s99-19-33" target="_blank">99-19-33</a></cite> to substitute the word ‘shall‘ for the word ‘may‘ in the first sentence, thereby issuing a holding that would hold trial courts in error for sentencing a defendant under the older of two sentencing statutes.

       Parole statutes contain no mandatory language, but instead employ permissive “may” rather than “shall,” and thus prisoners have no constitutionally recognized liberty interest in parole. Vice v. State, 679 So. 2d 205, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 419 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   The Mississippi parole statutes do not create a constitutionally protected liberty interest in the form of an expectation of parole because of the use of the permissive “may” in §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c07s47-7-3" target="_self">47-7-3</a></cite>, which provides that a prisoner “may be released on parole as hereinafter provided,” read in the context of the other provisions of that section and, as well, those of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c07s47-7-17" target="_self">47-7-17</a></cite>. Thus, Mississippi law did not vest a convicted and incarcerated felon with a liberty interest in parole entitling him to due process of law incident to his application for parole. Harden v.

       Circuit judge’s decision to sentence a juvenile offender to life imprisonment without eligibility for parole was neither arbitrary, nor an abuse of discretion because, at the hearing required by the case law, the judge, although the judge did not specifically discuss on the record each and every factor mentioned in the case law for the sentencing of a juvenile offender, expressly stated that the judge had considered each of the factors mentioned in the case law for the sentencing.

       Where petitioner’s plea counsel was unaware that the law had changed and required convicted armed robbers to serve every day of their sentence, the post-conviction court set aside petitioner’s fifteen-year sentence for armed robbery entered in accordance with the plea agreement. Prior to entering his guilty plea, counsel erred by telling petitioner that he would be eligible for parole after serving ten years of his fifteen year sentence. Hudson v.

       An administrative correction of a prior misinterpretation of parole laws is not a change in the law so as to violate the ex post facto clause of the United States or Mississippi Constitutions; even if the correction of a former mistaken interpretation of parole law did reach the level of a change in law, administrative decisions with regard to parole law eligibility are not “laws annexed to the crime when committed.” Taylor v.

       Trial court did not err by sentencing defendant to life without eligibility for parole because he was only 70 days short of his 18th birthday when he shot the victim, prior to the shooting he had already compiled an extensive youth court record, the threats defendant made to the victim prior to the shooting displayed premeditation, the victim was unarmed and attempting to run away when defendant shot him, and his youth court record failed to provide any positive factors or substantial hope of retaliation.

   Circuit judge erred in classifying defendant’s offense as a “crime of violence” because the judge’s finding that defendant used, attempted to use, or threatened to use physical force increased the minimum sentence that he had to serve and indisputably altered the prescribed range of sentences to which he was exposed, it eliminated defendant’s eligibility for parole and made him ineligible for any type of early release until he had served at least half of his sentence, aggravated the punishment based on judicial fact-finding and

Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.97.html#t97c03s97-3-2ol12" target="_blank">97-3-2(2)</a></cite> violated defendant’s rights under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the extent that it permitted the circuit judge to find that an unlisted felony was a “crime of violence.” Fogleman v.

       Relinquishment of the right to seek a conditional release from imprisonment that would emanate from the sentence for conviction of a charge that the defendant could have been convicted of, but was not, is not one of those constitutional rights that he is giving up, as a defendant has no constitutional right to seek a conditional release from any imprisonment, even when the imprisonment stems from a sentence received as a result of a conviction by a jury or by a plea of guilty.

       While an inmate was eligible for parole, no constitutionally protected liberty interest was conferred by statute upon the inmate.

       Defendant’s argument that it was error for the trial court to sentence him to life in prison without possibility of parole was improper; after the trial court set aside the jury’s sentence of death, it had only one choice, which was the lesser sentence of life without the possibility of parole. Sentences that did not exceed the maximum term allowed by statute are not considered grossly disproportionate and are not disturbed on appeal. Maye v. State, 49 So.3d 1140, 2009 Miss.

      <p>
       Denial of appellant inmate’s motion for post-conviction relief was appropriate because his indictment was not faulty for its failure to contain a provision for his eligibility for parole since it was not an essential element of the crime or had no effect on jurisdiction.

   Where appellant pled guilty to two counts of capital murder and two counts of armed robbery in 1979, he filed several motions for post-conviction relief; the circuit court did not err by dismissing his 2007 motion for post-conviction relief as a time-barred by the three-year statute of limitations set forth in Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.99.html#t99c39s99-39-5" target="_blank">99-39-5</a></cite>. Appellant’s claim that double jeopardy barred prosecution of his armed robbery convictions was not good cause for an exception to the time-bar, because appellant delayed thirty years in attacking his armed robbery convictions until he became eligible for parole on his murder convictions in accordance with Miss.

   Court denied petitioner’s request for post-conviction relief from her conviction for capital murder based on her claim that she was improperly informed of the trial judge’s sentencing options when she was deciding to waive a jury determination of her sentence and to place the decision in the hands of the trial judge because petitioner did not raise the issue on direct appeal and was procedurally barred under Miss.

Thus, the inmate was entitled to an evidentiary hearing on the matter. Garner v. State, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 695 (Miss. Ct. App. Sept. 27, 2005).

   Trial court properly denied defendant’s “motion to correct sentence” because applying Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c05s47-5-138" target="_self">47-5-138</a></cite> to him was clearly impermissible under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c07s47-7-3" target="_self">47-7-3</a></cite>, as he was an offender over 19 years of age and clearly ineligible for parole. Smith v.

   Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c07s47-7-3ol1g" target="_self">47-7-3(g)</a></cite> provided that no person shall be eligible for parole who was convicted or whose suspended sentence was revoked after June 30, 1995; defendant was convicted of two sales of cocaine on December 3, 1996, such that he was plainly ineligible for parole release from the cocaine sales sentences pursuant to subsection (g), and any advice by counsel that defendant would have been eligible for parole if he pled guilty to the cocaine sales was erroneous.

      <p>
       Inmate’s sentence after pleading guilty to a charge of armed robbery was proper where the record constituted sufficient evidence to show that the inmate was properly advised as to the minimum and maximum sentence prior to entering his plea; further, three years was the minimum sentence for armed robbery and a person convicted of armed robbery could not receive a wholly suspended sentence as the inmate alleged that his attorney told him.

   Amendment to the parole eligibility statute, Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c07s47-7-3ol11" target="_self">47-7-3(1)</a></cite>, created an ambiguity because the usual rule that an inmate must serve one fourth of the sentence before parole eligibility can be modified if the prisoner was sentenced to a term of 30 years or more, or life, but the 10-year minimum appeared to only apply to life sentences; it was clear the Legislature intended the 10-year minimum sentence to apply to sentences of 30 years or more and that defendant was not entitled to a correction to his parole eligibility date. Lattimore v. Sparkman, 858 So. 2d 936, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 1032 (Miss. Ct. App. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant argued that his attorney had erroneously told him he would only have to serve 25 percent of his sentence and that the plea agreement was a good one; however, defendant could not decide which percentage of his sentence he believed he had to serve and defendant’s claim was time barred; once a prisoners’ effective assistance of counsel claims were time barred, they had to fall within one of the enumerated exceptions to remain viable. Austin v. State, 863 So. 2d 59, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 995 (Miss. Ct. App. 2003).

       <p>
   Trial court erred by stating (in its sentencing order that defendant was to serve his sentence “without the benefit of parole or probation” pursuant to
   Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c07s47-7-3" target="_self">47-7-3</a></cite>, which prohibited granting parole to persons convicted of a crime after June 30, 1995, since §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c07s47-7-3ol11g" target="_self">47-7-3(1)(g)</a></cite> was a mandate to the parole board and not to the courts; inclusion of this language was surplusage, but defendant was not entitled to any relief, since the sentence was not illegal.

      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant’s supported allegations that his guilty plea to murdering his girlfriend was involuntary and the result of coercion because his attorney refused to investigate an allegedly incorrect criminal record that would have shown defendant to be a habitual criminal could properly be rejected by the trial court considering defendant’s motion for post-conviction relief without holding an evidentiary hearing; trial court could properly impose a life sentence without referring the matter to a jury. Riley v. State, 848 So. 2d 888, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 196 (Miss. Ct. App. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       Other than first-time offenders convicted of nonviolent crimes, defendants were ineligible for parole; defendant was an habitual offender and had committed violent crimes, and whether or not he was an habitual offender was of no importance to the validity of the sentence because habitual offender status was but one route to a prison term without possibility of parole.

       Because defendant was a juvenile and the death penalty was unavailable, the circuit court sentenced him to the only sentence currently available for capital murder, life imprisonment without parole. Horne v. State, 825 So. 2d 627, 2002 Miss. LEXIS 260 (Miss. 2002).
      </p>
      <p>
       Language in sentencing order that defendant was to serve his sentence without hope of parole or probation was stricken as surplusage on appeal since the administration of parole for the defendant was governed by statute. Norwood v. State, 2001 Miss. App. LEXIS 489 (Miss. Ct. App. Nov. 27, 2001), op. withdrawn, sub. op., 846 So. 2d 1048, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 472 (Miss. Ct. App. 2003).

      <p>
       Whether defendant was classified as an accessory before the fact or an aider and abettor to the gunman was irrelevant where his role was tantamount to that of the principal; therefore, there was no error in the sentence that was given based on his guilty plea for murder.

   A post-conviction relief petitioner was entitled to an evidentiary hearing on the voluntariness of his guilty plea where the transcripts of the petitioner’s change of plea hearing and sentencing hearing indicated that the assistant district attorney, the defendant’s attorney, and the trial judge were confused or misinformed as to §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c07s47-7-3" target="_self">47-7-3</a></cite>, under which the defendant was pleading guilty, and consequently the defendant was not properly advised of the mandatory minimum sentence he would have to serve before becoming eligible for parole.

   Where it appeared that the trial court, in sentencing a 16-year-old defendant convicted of armed robbery to a term of 14 years in state prison, had been under the misapprehension that §§<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.97.html#t97c03s97-3-79" target="_blank">97-3-79</a></cite> and<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c07s47-7-3" target="_self">47-7-3</a></cite>, read together, mandated a sentence of at least 10 years in the state penitentiary, absent a jury verdict of life imprisonment, the case would be remanded to the court for a clarification of the sentencing since there was no way to ascertain whether the trial court had considered the statutory alternative for sentencing minor offenders under the provisions of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.43.html#t43c21s43-21-159ol13" target="_blank">43-21-159(3)</a></cite>.

       <p>
   In a prosecution for armed robbery, a sentence of 12 years in prison, without eligibility of parole for 10 years, imposed upon a 14-year-old mentally retarded defendant did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment; however, the case would be remanded to the trial court for consideration of alternative sentencing under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.43.html#t43c21s43-21-159" target="_blank">43-21-159</a></cite> where the trial judge should have placed in the record the sources and facts of his sentence study and should have permitted the defendant’s attorney to introduce evidence of the presence or absence of facilities at the Mississippi State Penitentiary for the care of the defendant, and the availability of other institutions or facilities which could be utilized by the defendant.

        9. Ineffective assistance of counsel.
       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       Circuit court properly denied appellant’s motion for post-conviction relief because cited no authority to support his argument that it constituted ineffective assistance of counsel for defense counsel to give appellant erroneous advice regarding, or not to inform him of, any potential conditional release he could or could not receive if he were convicted of the greater offense with which he was charged. Ware v. State, 258 So.3d 315, 2018 Miss. App. LEXIS 420 (Miss. Ct. App. 2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       Circuit court properly denied appellant’s motion for post-conviction relief because he was not affirmatively misinformed regarding his parole eligibility, and thus, his guilty plea was not entered into voluntarily, intelligently, and knowingly. Ware v. State, 258 So.3d 315, 2018 Miss. App. LEXIS 420 (Miss. Ct. App. 2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       Since a defendant’s attorney would not be required to advise the defendant of any potential conditional release from imprisonment if the defendant went to trial and was convicted of the charged offense, it seems quite logical that the defense counsel would not be required to give such advice when the defendant pleads guilty not to the offense charged, but to a lesser offense that happens to be included in the charged offense. Ware v. State, 258 So.3d 315, 2018 Miss. App. LEXIS 420 (Miss. Ct. App. 2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       Only information provided in appellant’s mother’s affidavit regarding what appellant’s attorney said to appellant about his parole eligibility came from appellant himself; thus, the circuit court, which dismissed appellant’s motion for post-conviction relief, did not err in its determination that appellant’s mother had no firsthand knowledge of any statements made by appellant’s attorney concerning the length of time appellant would have to serve. Moore v. State, 248 So.3d 845, 2017 Miss. App. LEXIS 671 (Miss. Ct. App. 2017), cert. denied, 247 So.3d 1264, 2018 Miss. LEXIS 311 (Miss. 2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       Inmate’s claim of ineffective assistance lacked merit, as the inmate’s claims that he would not have entered his guilty plea for fondling if his attorney had not misrepresented his eligibility for parole was contradicted by the fact that, at the plea hearing, he indicated he had not been promised anything in order to make him enter his guilty plea and was aware of the maximum sentence that could have been imposed. Brown v. State, 187 So.3d 667, 2016 Miss. App. LEXIS 132 (Miss. Ct. App. 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Inmate did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel as: (1) the plea petition, the guilty-plea colloquy, and the post-conviction relief evidentiary hearing, taken together, reflected that defense counsel correctly advised the inmate of the life sentence for murder, his potential for release at age 65, and the correct sentencing statutory provision, Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c07s47-7-3ol11f" target="_self">47-7-3(1)(f)</a></cite>, which prohibited parole eligibility because the inmate pled guilty to murder and was sentenced to life imprisonment; (2) the inmate had the potential for release Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c05s47-5-139ol11a" target="_self">47-5-139(1)(a)</a></cite> at age 65 after serving 15 years by petitioning for early release at or after age 65; (3) the inmate was 36 years old at the time of his guilty plea and sentence; (4) upon reaching age 65, the inmate would have served substantially more than 15 years; and (5) the inmate admitted being advised of his eligibility to be released at age 65. Higginbotham v. State, 114 So.3d 9, 2012 Miss. App. LEXIS 595 (Miss. Ct. App. 2012), cert. denied, 116 So.3d 1072, 2013 Miss. LEXIS 317 (Miss. 2013).

       Mississippi Department of Corrections requiring defendant to serve his full, fifteen-year sentence, consistent with the statute, imposed by the circuit court, was not an extension or increase in defendant’s sentence because the denial of any reduction to his sentence was not equivalent the Department “resentencing” him.

      </p>
      <p>
       Circuit court did not err in affirming the denial of defendant’s claim that he he was being improperly classified as a sex offender and was entitled to trusty time or meritorious earned time because defendant’s conviction for kidnapping a minor under the age of sixteen made him ineligible for parole and ineligible for any reduction in his sentence.

       Inmate was ineligible for parole because, although the inmate claimed that a constitutionally protected interest in parole was created by statute, compliance with a parole case plan was a statutory prerequisite to parole, but the statutory parole case plan requirements were inapplicable as the inmate’s conviction and sentence predated the effective date of the statutes.

       Both defendant and the Mississippi Attorney General’s Office agreed that defendant’s parole and release dates were incorrectly calculated in regard to the date his sentence began, and as to credits and trusty time. Thus, the appellate court reversed the determination that defendant was not entitled to a hearing and remanded the matter to the Mississippi Parole Board to allow the Board to make the exact calculations of defendant’s parole and release dates; however, on remand, the Board was free to grant or deny defendant’s petition for parole and the circuit court had no authority to determine defendant’s parole eligibility.

   An agreement between a capital murder defendant and the State for the imposition of a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole was void and unenforceable on public policy grounds where the defendant was not an habitual offender, since a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole is not an option unless the defendant is adjudged an habitual offender; the agreement was an attempt to circumvent §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.99.html#t99c19s99-19-101" target="_blank">99-19-101</a></cite>, which only authorizes a sentence of life imprisonment or death for capital murder, and its enforcement by the court would bind the parole board, which would effect judicial encroachment on an executive function. Lanier v. State, 635 So. 2d 813, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 165 (Miss. 1994), overruled in part, Twillie v. State, 892 So. 2d 187, 2004 Miss. LEXIS 1322 (Miss. 2004).

   Parole board members who voted to parole a prisoner to Friends of Alcoholics (FOA) were not liable to a person who was injured by the parolee after he left FOA without leave; the parole board members did not lose their qualified immunity, either by failure to perform their ministerial functions or by acting with reckless disregard in voting to parole the parolee to FOA, where pertinent information regarding the parolee was contained in his parole file and the master file which were reviewed by the parole board when the case was considered. The board members substantially complied with the duties and requirements set forth in the statute for members of the parole board, particularly §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c07s47-7-17" target="_self">47-7-17</a></cite> and there was no violation of their ministerial duties. Additionally, although the board members were lay persons, untrained, unschooled, and inexperienced in the complex and sensitive problems of probation and parole, and even though judgment and decision was deficient and lacking, they were exercising discretionary authority; their decision was the result of personal deliberation and judgment, and they did not commit willful wrongs or malicious acts. Furthermore, they did not act with reckless disregard and did not exceed and pervert their discretionary authority-theirs was an exercise of poor judgment. As a result of this case, the legislature enacted a law providing for a full time parole board with members who are salaried employees of the State, and providing that the parole board members shall be immune from civil liability for any official acts taken in good faith and in exercise of the board’s legitimate governmental authority. Sykes v. Grantham, 567 So. 2d 200, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 463 (Miss. 1990).

       The Department of Corrections has no duty to provide the Parole Board with information and has no control over parole decisions. Thus, the department had no duty to a victim assaulted by a paroled prisoner. Grantham v. Mississippi Dep't of Corrections, 522 So. 2d 219, 1988 Miss. LEXIS 117 (Miss. 1988).

       Petition for postconviction relief was denied because there was no error in the mention of the conspiracy charges during sentencing when the state requested their retirement to the file; there was no indication that the conspiracy charges, which were not included in a pre-sentence report, were considered as aggravating factors.

       <p>
   Defendant’s convictions for armed robbery and arson were proper where the failure to grant a sentencing hearing was not in error because the trial judge was already privy to the facts of the case and the aggravating and mitigating circumstances prior to sentencing, Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c07s47-7-9ol13a" target="_self">47-7-9(3)(a)</a></cite>. Payton v. State, 897 So. 2d 921, 2003 Miss. LEXIS 602 (Miss. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a prosecution for possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, the trial court did not err in failing to order a presentence report, thus prohibiting the defendant from offering mitigating circumstances for the court’s consideration prior to imposition of sentence, since presentence investigations and reports are discretionary with the trial judge and not mandatory.

   The use of presentence investigations and reports, as provided in §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c07s47-7-9ol13a" target="_self">47-7-9(3)(a)</a></cite>, are discretionary with the trial judge and are not mandatory; a defendant does not have a right to a presentence investigation.

      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Failure to request pre-sentence report is not ineffective assistance of counsel because defendant is not automatically entitled to pre-sentence reports under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c07s47-7-9ol13a" target="_self">47-7-9(3)(a)</a></cite>, which clearly states that pre-sentence reports are given only at discretion of circuit judge.

   A presentence report under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c07s47-7-9ol13a" target="_self">47-7-9(3)(a)</a></cite> is required only when the circuit judge requests it, and there is no reason to order such a report in a capital case in which the jury imposes the sentence and both the state and the defendant are entitled to present evidence.

      <p>
       In a prosecution for murder while engaged in the offense of kidnapping, the trial court did not commit reversible error by sentencing the defendant to death without a pre-sentence report where the sentencing jury had decided the issue of sentence after a full hearing on the issues of mitigating and aggravating circumstances.

      Within one (1)year after his admission and at such intervals thereafter as it maydetermine, the board shall secure and consider all pertinent informationregarding each offender, except any under sentence of death or otherwiseineligible for parole, including the circumstances of his offense,his previous social history, his previous criminal record, includingany records of law enforcement agencies or of a youth court regardingthat offender’s juvenile criminal history, his conduct, employmentand attitude while in the custody of the department, the case plancreated to prepare the offender for parole, and the reports of suchphysical and mental examinations as have been made. The board shallfurnish at least three (3) months’ written notice to each suchoffender of the date on which he is eligible for parole.
     </p>
     <p>
      Before rulingon the application for parole of any offender, the board may requirea parole-eligible offender to have a hearing as required in this chapterbefore the board and to be interviewed. The hearing shall be heldno later than thirty (30) days prior to the month of eligibility.No application for parole of a person convicted of a capital offenseshall be considered by the board unless and until notice of the filingof such application shall have been published at least once a weekfor two (2) weeks in a newspaper published in or having general circulationin the county in which the crime was committed.The board shall,within thirty (30) days prior to the scheduled hearing, also givenotice of the filing of the application for parole to the victim ofthe offense for which the prisoner is incarcerated and being consideredfor parole or, in case the offense be homicide, a designee of theimmediate family of the victim, provided the victim or designatedfamily member has furnished in writing a current address to the boardfor such purpose. Parole release shall, at the hearing, be orderedonly for the best interest of society, not as an award of clemency;it shall not be considered to be a reduction of sentence or pardon. An offender shall be placed on parole only when arrangements havebeen made for his proper employment or for his maintenance and care,and when the board believes that he is able and willing to fulfillthe obligations of a law-abiding citizen.When the board determinesthat the offender will need transitional housing upon release in orderto improve the likelihood of him or her becoming a law-abiding citizen,the board may parole the offender with the condition that the inmatespends no more than six (6) months in a transitional reentry center.At least fifteen (15) days prior to the release of an offender onparole, the director of records of the department shall give the writtennotice which is required pursuant to Section 47-5-177.Everyoffender while on parole shall remain in the legal custody of thedepartment from which he was released and shall be amenable to theorders of the board. Upon determination by the board that an offenderis eligible for release by parole, notice shall also be given withinat least fifteen (15) days before release, by the board to the victimof the offense or the victim’s family member, as indicatedabove, regarding the date when the offender’s release shalloccur, provided a current address of the victim or the victim’sfamily member has been furnished in writing to the board for suchpurpose.
     </p>
     <p>
      Failure to providenotice to the victim or the victim’s family member of the filingof the application for parole or of any decision made by the boardregarding parole shall not constitute grounds for vacating an otherwiselawful parole determination nor shall it create any right or liability,civilly or criminally, against the board or any member thereof.
     </p>
     <p>
      A letter of protestagainst granting an offender parole shall not be treated as the conclusiveand only reason for not granting parole.
     </p>
     <p>
      The board mayadopt such other rules not inconsistent with law as it may deem properor necessary with respect to the eligibility of offenders for parole,the conduct of parole hearings, or conditions to be imposed upon parolees,including a condition that the parolee submit, as provided in Section 47-5-601 to any typeof breath, saliva or urine chemical analysis test, the purpose ofwhich is to detect the possible presence of alcohol or a substanceprohibited or controlled by any law of the State of Mississippi orthe United States. The board shall have the authority to adopt rulesrelated to the placement of certain offenders on unsupervised paroleand for the operation of transitional reentry centers. However, inno case shall an offender be placed on unsupervised parole beforehe has served a minimum of fifty percent (50%) of the period of supervisedparole.

   Denial of the inmate’s petition for writ of habeas corpus was affirmed as (1) Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c07s47-7-17" target="_self">47-7-17</a></cite> did not create a constitutionally protected liberty interest in parole, (2) the inmate waived his right to argue that he was prejudiced by the Parole Board’s failure to publish notice of his parole hearing as it was not raised below, and (3) the inmate did not argue in his petition that he had ever been denied the opportunity to call witnesses or that the Parole Board refused to listen to their testimony. Way v. Miller, 919 So. 2d 1036, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 471 (Miss. Ct. App. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Inmate’s complaint filed with the circuit court for a review of the parole board’s determinations was properly dismissed because the circuit court did not have the jurisdiction to grant or deny parole. Further, while the inmate had entitled his petition a habeas corpus action, because the parole board had complete discretion to grant or deny parole, the inmate failed to state a claim that would have required an evidentiary hearing. Johnson v. Miller, 919 So. 2d 273, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 430 (Miss. Ct. App. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Parole statutes contain no mandatory language, but instead employ permissive “may” rather than “shall,” and thus prisoners have no constitutionally recognized liberty interest in parole. Vice v. State, 679 So. 2d 205, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 419 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   The Mississippi parole statutes do not create a constitutionally protected liberty interest in the form of an expectation of parole because of the use of the permissive “may” in §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c07s47-7-3" target="_self">47-7-3</a></cite>, which provides that a prisoner “may be released on parole as hereinafter provided,” read in the context of the other provisions of that section and, as well, those of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c07s47-7-17" target="_self">47-7-17</a></cite>. Thus, Mississippi law did not vest a convicted and incarcerated felon with a liberty interest in parole entitling him to due process of law incident to his application for parole. Harden v. State, 547 So. 2d 1150, 1989 Miss. LEXIS 370 (Miss. 1989).

       An administrative correction of a prior misinterpretation of parole laws is not a change in the law so as to violate the ex post facto clause of the United States or Mississippi Constitutions; even if the correction of a former mistaken interpretation of parole law did reach the level of a change in law, administrative decisions with regard to parole law eligibility are not “laws annexed to the crime when committed.” Taylor v.

   Parole board members who voted to parole prisoner to Friends of Alcoholics (FOA) were not liable to a person injured by the parolee after he left FOA without leave; parole board members did not lose qualified immunity, either by failure to perform ministerial functions or by acting with reckless disregard in voting to parole the parolee to FOA, where pertinent information regarding parolee was contained in his parole file and the master file which were reviewed by board when case was considered. Board members substantially complied with duties and requirements set forth in the statute for members of parole board, particularly §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c07s47-7-17" target="_self">47-7-17</a></cite>, and there was no violation of ministerial duties. Additionally, although board members were lay, untrained, unschooled, and inexperienced in complex and sensitive problems of probation and parole, and even though judgment and decision was deficient and lacking, they were exercising discretionary authority; their decision was the result of personal deliberation and judgment, and they did not commit willful wrongs or malicious acts, or act with reckless disregard or exceed and pervert their discretionary authority. (As a result of case, legislature enacted law providing for full time parole board with members salaried employees of State, immune from civil liability for any official acts taken in good faith and in exercise of board’s legitimate governmental authority.)

   Trial court did not err by denying an inmate’s motion for a preliminary injunction because nothing in the record supported the inmate’s claim that the Mississippi State Parole Board arbitrarily denied him parole in violation of any Fourteenth Amendment right; the Parole Board denied the inmate’s parole based upon the serious nature of the offense, the number of offenses committed, the inmate’s police record, community opposition, and insufficient time served, and because the reasons stated by the Parole Board for denying the inmate’s parole were areas that the Parole Board had authority to consider under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c07s47-7-17" target="_self">47-7-17</a></cite>, those categories could not be viewed as arbitrary and capricious. Rochell v. State, 36 So.3d 479, 2010 Miss.

       Inmate’s due process rights were not violated when a district attorney sent a letter to a parole board objecting to parole because there was no breach of a plea agreement; the district attorney kept the promise of making a sentencing recommendation, and eligibility for parole did not affect a voluntariness analysis since there was no right to parole. Garlotte v. State, 915 So. 2d 460, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 280 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 921 So. 2d 1279, 2005 Miss. LEXIS 769 (Miss. 2005).

       A trial court erred in concluding that the State of Florida lost jurisdiction over a petitioner when it released her to the custody of a Mississippi bail bondsman because the effect of Florida’s release of the petitioner to the State of Mississippi was a question to be answered in the first instance by a proper court of the State of Florida. Furthermore, the parole board was without statutory or other authority to condition the petitioner’s parole on her voluntarily submitting herself to the custody of the State of Florida, which the petitioner had refused to do on several occasions, and the trial court compounded this error by removing this condition and ordering the parole board to release the petitioner immediately, which was beyond the court’s authority since determining the eligibility for parole is peculiarly and solely a discretionary function of the parole board.

       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       While an inmate was eligible for parole, no constitutionally protected liberty interest was conferred by statute upon the inmate. In addition, the grant or denial of parole was entirely within the Mississippi State Parole Board’s discretion, and the denial of parole was not subject to a statutory right of appeal. Willard v. Miss. State Parole Bd., 212 So.3d 80, 2016 Miss. App. LEXIS 664 (Miss. Ct. App. 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       Clearly, the inmate’s prison conduct record was not identical to the prison conduct records of the other two co-defendants. He committed a violent felony after having been convicted of homicide, the parole board had discretion to grant or deny parole for each individual, and its decision to deny parole to the inmate while granting parole to the co-defendants satisfied the rational basis standard of review.

       Inmate was ineligible for parole because, although the inmate claimed that a constitutionally protected interest in parole was created by statute, compliance with a parole case plan was a statutory prerequisite to parole, but the statutory parole case plan requirements were inapplicable as the inmate’s conviction and sentence predated the effective date of the statutes.

      </h4>
      <p>
       The 2010 amendment,
   in the fourth paragraph, inserted “committed” in the
   second sentence, and added the last sentence.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 2012 amendment
   rewrote (1), (5), and (6); deleted “law now in effect concerning
   the” preceding “right of the State of Mississippi”
   at the beginning of the first sentence in (4); and made minor stylistic
   changes.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 2014 amendment
   deleted the last sentence from (1) regarding the offender remaining
   incarcerated pending hearing; added (4), (6), (7), and (9) and redesignated
   the remaining subsections accordingly.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 2018 amendment,
   in (6), substituted “one or more technical violations”
   for “a technical violation” near the beginning of the
   third sentences of (a) and (b) and in the first and third sentences
   of (c), and substituted “revocation” for “technical
   violation” everywhere it appears in (a) and (b) and in the
   third, fourth and fifth sentences of (c).

   Court rejected the inmate’s claim that
   Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c07s47-7-27" target="_self">47-7-27</a></cite> was unconstitutionally vague and ambiguous and that it discriminated against him as an inmate sentenced to life in prison, because the language of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c07s47-7-27" target="_self">47-7-27</a></cite> was quite clear and an ordinary person of common intelligence upon reading it could understand what was allowed and what was not. Section 47-7-27 applied to offenders who previously had parole revoked, and provided that the inmate’s eligibility for a second parole was subject to the parole board’s discretion, and that the inmate was only entitled to a psychological evaluation if the parole board exercised its discretion to grant him a second parole.
   Edmond v. Miller, 942 So. 2d 203, 2006 Miss. App. LEXIS 182 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 942 So. 2d 164, 2006 Miss. LEXIS 718 (Miss. 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       Circuit court properly dismissed the prisoner’s civil suit alleging that the failure of the parole board to revoke his parole upon entry of later burglary pleas violated his civil rights. He failed to prove that the parole board had abused its discretion. Marshall v. Ruth, 882 So. 2d 252, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 846 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).

   On revocation of parole, it must be shown that parolee has violated terms and conditions of parole. Alexander v. State, 667 So. 2d 1, 1995 Miss.

       <p>
   Evidence that parolee violated terms and conditions of his parole supported revocation of his parole by state Parole Board, even though parolee successfully appealed conviction which initially led to revocation of his parole; Parole Board did not rely solely on parolee’s conviction for simple assault as violation of condition of his parole agreement requiring him to live and remain at liberty without violating law, but also upon parolee’s statements at parole revocation hearing that he was guilty of simple assault and had ceased taking his prescribed medication. Alexander v. State, 667 So. 2d 1, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 602 (Miss. 1995), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">517 U.S. 1145</cite>, <cite class="s_court">116 S. Ct. 1441</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">134 L.

   Before parole of parolee acquitted of a criminal charge may be revoked, state must offer actual proof that he committed an act violating terms and conditions of his parole. Alexander v. State, 667 So. 2d 1, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 602 (Miss. 1995), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">517 U.S. 1145</cite>, <cite class="s_court">116 S. Ct. 1441</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">134 L.

      </p>
      <p>
       A trial court properly denied a parolee’s petition for writ of habeas corpus, in which the parolee claimed that he was not afforded a timely parole revocation hearing, where the admitted evidence showed that the parolee had violated the conditions of his parole by 2 Tennessee felony convictions and failure to waive extradition back to Mississippi; these were reasonable grounds for revoking his parole, and therefore all procedural due process guarantees were met. Godsey v. Houston, 584 So. 2d 389, 1991 Miss. LEXIS 438 (Miss. 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       Acquittal in a criminal proceeding does not per se preclude parole revocation predicated upon the same charge. The terms and conditions of parole are broader than a mere directive that the parolee commit no felony. Where a prisoner was acquitted of the crime of rape, with which he had been charged while on parole, the acquittal might have meant that the prisoner was not guilty of any act which constituted a violation of the terms and conditions of his parole and, therefore, the acquittal on the criminal charge meant at the very least that, before his parole could be revoked, the State was required to offer actual proof that he committed an act violating the terms and conditions of his parole, and the mere fact that he was arrested and charged with rape would not suffice. Moore v. Ruth, 556 So. 2d 1059, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 36 (Miss. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       Conviction of a felony by a parolee is a reasonable ground under Mississippi standards for revocation of parole. Bobkoskie v. State, 495 So. 2d 497, 1986 Miss. LEXIS 2680 (Miss. 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence in parole revocation proceeding showed that parolee not only violated the conditions of his parole which required that he “live and remain at liberty without violating the law”, but it showed that the 2 violations, convictions for the crime of burglary in State of Colorado, were reasonable grounds for revocation of his parole under state standards. Bobkoskie v. State, 495 So. 2d 497, 1986 Miss. LEXIS 2680 (Miss. 1986).

       Inmate’s due-process rights were not violated when his parole was revoked because upon receiving a certified copy of the order of the court of appeals, the parole board had authority pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. 47-7-27 to immediately revoke the inmate’s parole on his earlier conviction; a preliminary revocation hearing and a parole-revocation hearing were held, and the parole board then sent the inmate a letter, which provided notice of its decision to revoke his parole and afforded an opportunity to present evidence on his behalf. Walker v. State, 35 So.3d 555, 2010 Miss. App. LEXIS 167 (Miss. Ct. App. 2010).

       Denying an inmate credit for time served while on parole did not deprive her of rights secured under the double jeopardy clause, deny her due process of law, or subject her to an ex post facto law. Segarra v. State, 430 So. 2d 408, 1983 Miss. LEXIS 2578 (Miss. 1983).

       Where petitioner knew why deputy administrative assistant to the state probation and parole board had come to the jail in which petitioner was lodged for public drunkenness and he knew the parole violation he was charged with, when petitioner freely admitted that he had become intoxicated there was adequate reason for his detention and return to the state penitentiary without the necessity of a preliminary hearing.

        5. Burden of proof.
       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       There are differing burdens of proof in a criminal prosecution and in a parole revocation proceeding; at a criminal trial, the prosecution must prove the accused guilty beyond a reasonable doubt while in parole revocation proceedings, the accused is generally protected by lesser standards of proof. Thus, the failure of a jury to find one guilty beyond a reasonable doubt does not mean that, by some lesser standard, the facts and circumstances may not be found to be a violation of the terms and conditions of parole. However, where a prisoner was acquitted of the crime of rape, with which he had been charged while on parole, the acquittal might have meant that the prisoner was not guilty of any act which constituted a violation of the terms and conditions of his parole and, therefore, the acquittal on the criminal charge meant at the very least that, before his parole could be revoked, the State was required to offer actual proof that he committed an act violating the terms and conditions of his parole, and the mere fact that he was arrested and charged with rape would not suffice.

       An inmate was properly denied credit for time served upon her original sentence for time spent out of prison on parole prior to its revocation, even though credit is allowed for time spent on work release, which is functionally similar to parole.

       Inmate’s claim that his parole was unlawfully revoked was not procedurally barred because his post-conviction relief motion fit within an exception to both the general prohibition against successive writs under the Mississippi Uniform Post-Conviction Collateral Relief Act, Miss. Code Ann. ‘ 99-39-23(6), and the three-year statute of limitations under the Act, Miss. Code Ann. ’ 99-39-5(2)(b). Walker v. State, 35 So.3d 555, 2010 Miss. App. LEXIS 167 (Miss. Ct. App. 2010).

   Field supervisor, within the meaning of Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c07s47-7-27" target="_self">47-7-27</a></cite>, is someone who supervises parolees, rather than someone who supervises other field officers. In other words, a field supervisor is someone who supervises in the field. Furthermore, the Mississippi Code uses the terms field officer and field supervisor interchangeably. Barlow v. State, 8 So.3d 196, 2008 Miss. App. LEXIS 471 (Miss. Ct. App. 2008), cert. denied, 11 So.3d 1250, 2009 Miss. LEXIS 204 (Miss. 2009).

   Pursuant to Miss.

   Defendant cited no authority for his interpretation of Miss.

       A trial court properly denied a parolee’s petition for writ of habeas corpus, in which the parolee claimed that he was not afforded a timely parole revocation hearing, where the admitted evidence showed that the parolee had violated the conditions of his parole by 2 Tennessee felony convictions and failure to waive extradition back to Mississippi; these were reasonable grounds for revoking his parole, and therefore all procedural due process guarantees were met.

       Evidence in parole revocation proceeding showed that parolee not only violated the conditions of his parole which required that he “live and remain at liberty without violating the law”, but it showed that the 2 violations, convictions for the crime of burglary in State of Colorado, were reasonable grounds for revocation of his parole under state standards.

       Because appellant suffered no prejudice from an illegally lenient sentence, he could not reap the benefits of that sentence and claim in his motion for post-conviction relief to have been prejudiced as a result. Gray v. State, — So.3d —, 2018 Miss. App. LEXIS 185 (Miss. Ct. App. Apr. 17, 2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court exceeded its authority by suspending all but twenty years of defendant’s life sentence for first-degree murder because life imprisonment was the applicable sentence for first-degree murder; therefore, the trial court had no authority to suspend any part of defendant’s life sentence.Shaheed v. State, 205 So.3d 1105, 2016 Miss. App. LEXIS 806 (Miss. Ct. App. 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court did not err in suspending three years of simple robbery sentences and all 10 years of an armed robbery sentence because the trial court had statutory authority to suspend the sentences in such a manner. Caviness v. State, 1 So.3d 917, 2008 Miss. App. LEXIS 575 (Miss. Ct. App. 2008), cert. denied, 11 So.3d 1250, 2009 Miss. LEXIS 151 (Miss. 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant did not receive an illegal sentence where defendant failed to report and when defendant then appeared before the court the court imposed a sentence of 20 years for robbery; the 20-year sentence was one that could have been imposed at the time defendant pled guilty. Adams v. State, 954 So. 2d 1051, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 244 (Miss. Ct. App. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Where defendant had a prior conviction, the trial judge recognized he had made an error in suspending a portion of defendant’s sentence per Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c07s47-7-33" target="_self">47-7-33</a></cite>, and the judge attempted to correct the error with the amended sentencing order. Based on the transcript of the hearing on the motion to vacate judgment and sentence, it was apparent the trial judge imposed a sentence not of fifteen years with eight years suspended but a sentence of seven years to be served in the custody of the Mississippi Department of Corrections and eight years of post-release supervision; therefore, defendant did not receive an illegal sentence and any scrivener’s error as to the sentencing transcript was subject to correction on remand. Willcutt v. State, 910 So. 2d 1189, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 608 (Miss. Ct. App. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Defendant maintained the circuit court’s sentencing order was illegal because, according to Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c07s47-7-33ol11" target="_self">47-7-33(1)</a></cite>, he could not be given a suspended sentence since he was a prior convicted felon. While that was true, he stood mute when he was handed an illegal sentence which was more favorable than what the legal sentence would have been; thus, he was not entitled to relief in his postconviction action. Hughery v. State, 915 So. 2d 457, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 265 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 921 So. 2d 1279, 2005 Miss. LEXIS 779 (Miss. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Defendant misinterpreted the law in trying to set aside his modified sentence of probation. If that sentence had been determined to be illegal under former Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c07s47-7-33ol11" target="_self">47-7-33(1)</a></cite>, which prohibited a sentencing judge from suspending a sentence or placing a convicted felon on probation, the trial court’s earlier sentencing order in which he was given jail time would have taken effect; defendant was not entitled to postconviction relief where he had pled guilty and later received a more lenient modified sentence, and in any event, his action was time barred pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.99.html#t99c39s99-39-5" target="_blank">99-39-5</a></cite>. Wallace v. State, 906 So. 2d 841, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 1156 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant argued that the circuit court gave him an illegal sentence by including a period of suspended time and a period of postrelease probation in his sentence; however, a defendant could not stand mute when he was handed an illegal sentence that was more favorable than what the legal sentence would have been, reap the favorable benefits of that illegal sentence, and later claim to have been prejudiced as a result thereof. Jones v. State, 881 So. 2d 351, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 855 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant benefitted from the leniency of the trial court’s ordering him to serve a 10-year suspended sentence, and because he was not subjected to an undue burden or prejudice but to a significantly lesser sentence, the error by the trial court was harmless, and his 10-year sentence did not constitute an illegal sentence. Alexander v. State, 879 So. 2d 512, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 725 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Under
   Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.99.html#t99c15s99-15-26" target="_blank">99-15-26</a></cite>, if defendant successfully completes certain court-imposed conditions, the cause against defendant is dismissed and the case closed. As a result, a conditional dismissal pursuant to §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.99.html#t99c15s99-15-26" target="_blank">99-15-26</a></cite> is different than a suspended sentence pursuant to

       When the court exercises its authority to suspend the execution of a portion of a defendant’s sentence, the normal course of procedure is to (1) impose a sentence, (2) determine what portion is to be suspended, (3) impose a period of probation, and (4) specify the terms and conditions upon which the probation/suspended sentence is contingent; if at any time during the period of probation it is determined that the probationer violated any of the specified conditions of his or her probation, the court has the authority to revoke any part or all of the probation or any part or all of the suspended sentence, as if the decision to suspend the sentence and place the defendant on probation had never been made.

   Where defendant, a prior convicted felon, was sentenced to 30 years and was ordered to serve 26 months in incarceration with the remainder of the sentence suspended and four years of post-release supervision, defendant was not placed on probation, and the trial court lawfully placed conditions on the suspended sentence. Because the combined periods of incarceration and post-release supervision did not exceed the maximum penalty statutorily proscribed for the felony offense committed and the trial court imposed a sentence within the statutory guidelines, the sentence was not illegal under Miss.

   Probation under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c07s47-7-33" target="_self">47-7-33</a></cite> was a conditional term that was not part of the prison sentence and was therefore not subject to the totality of sentence concept found in Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c07s47-7-34" target="_self">47-7-34</a></cite>; defendant’s five-year probation period would not be added to her original twenty-year sentence for aggravated assault when calculating time to be served, and reinstating the full original sentence therefore would not violate the statutory maximum for her crime as set forth in Miss.

   A defendant who wishes to challenge the revocation of his probation need not pursue the administrative remedies set out in Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c05s47-5-803" target="_self">47-5-803</a></cite>, as only a court can continue or revoke a defendant’s probation. Rodriguez v.

      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence that defendant failed to make restitution payments and engaged in continuing misconduct while on probation for aggravated assault supported trial court’s decision to revoke probation and impose the remaining 11 years of defendant’s 12-year sentence; defendant was not denied due process and the sentence was not excessive. Rodriguez v. State, 839 So. 2d 561, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 131 (Miss. Ct. App. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       A court must base its revocation of a suspended sentence on a violation of the clear terms and conditions of the suspended sentence; due process requires that the trial judge at least orally inform the defendant of the terms and conditions upon which his or her suspended sentence is contingent before it may be properly revoked for the violation of those terms and conditions.

       Defendant’s petition for habeas corpus was properly denied following his conviction of forgery upon a guilty plea, the suspension of his sentence and his placement on probation, and the subsequent revocation of the suspension and probation upon the prosecution’s discovery of his prior out of state conviction of a felony, where, though defendant contended the prosecutor was aware of the felony conviction at the time he recommended probation, evidence on the issue was conflicting, where the court had jurisdiction over defendant at the time probation was granted and when it was revoked, and where defendant had misled the court by replying to a question, put to him before acceptance of his guilty plea, that his only prior offense had been a traffic ticket.

   Defendant’s sentence was valid and non-modifiable where he was ordered to serve 15 years in the custody of the Mississippi Department of Corrections (MDOC), with seven years to be served by actual incarceration, and the remaining eight years to be suspended and served by way of post-release supervision under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c07s47-7-34" target="_self">47-7-34</a></cite>, with five of the eight years to be served in accordance with “probation-like” terms under the supervision of the MDOC, under Miss.

   Defendant asserted that under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c07s47-7-33" target="_self">47-7-33</a></cite>, a prior convicted felon could not be given a suspended sentence. However, that information did not appear in the indictment or the record, and in fact, he received a very favorable sentence considering the sentencing options available for his offense of the sale of cocaine; thus, where he stood mute at sentencing, he could not later claim prejudice or that plea counsel was ineffective and his petition for post-conviction relief was properly denied.

   Defendant’s petition for post-conviction relief from his conviction of sexual battery was properly denied because although defendant had two prior convictions and was not entitled to a suspended sentence as provided in Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c07s47-7-33" target="_self">47-7-33</a></cite>, defendant did not plead guilty as a result of an offer of a suspended sentence and he benefited from the illegal sentence since it was more lenient than the one he should have received, therefore he did not suffer any fundamental unfairness from the illegal sentence.

   Inmate argued that the sentence imposed by the trial court was improper; it was the inmate’s contention that the trial court was without authority under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c07s47-7-33" target="_self">47-7-33</a></cite> to suspend any portion of his sentence, as he was a priorly convicted felon. However, to hold that the inmate’s sentence was improper would allow him and other criminal defendants the ability to conceal prior convictions, accept the sentence imposed by the trial court, and then have a free pass to overturn that sentence if it did not meet his expectations.

      </p>
      <p>
       Imposition of partially suspended sentence upon defendant being convicted of robbery pursuant to a guilty plea was illegal because defendant had a prior felony conviction which rendered defendant ineligible for such a sentence; defendant was not, however, entitled to out-of time relief from the conviction based upon the illegal sentence because defendant had received the benefit of the illegal sentence and did not challenge the illegal sentence until the conviction was used to enhance defendant’s sentence in a subsequent robbery case.

   Defendant benefitted from the illegal sentence since it was a more lenient one than he was entitled to receive; therefore defendant suffered no fundamental unfairness from the illegal sentence, and his fundamental rights were not violated.

       Where the defendant had a prior felony conviction, the trial court did not have authority to impose a suspended sentence following the defendant’s guilty plea. Weaver v. State, 785 So. 2d 1085, 2001 Miss. App. LEXIS 190 (Miss. Ct. App. 2001).

       The defendant’s initial sentence, pursuant to the plea agreement, was illegal because the circuit court ordered a partially suspended sentence even though the defendant had a prior felony conviction. Cooper v. State, 737 So. 2d 1042, 1999 Miss. App. LEXIS 444 (Miss. Ct. App. 1999).

      <p>
       <p>
   A trial court did not have the authority to follow the State’s recommendation and impose a suspended sentence where the defendant had previously been convicted of a felony, and therefore the sentence was invalid, since §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c07s47-7-33" target="_self">47-7-33</a></cite> does not permit the suspension of a sentence and probation where the defendant has a prior felony conviction.

       <p>
   A trial judge was in error when he sentenced a defendant to 14 years in the state penitentiary with 7 years suspended if the appellant paid a $125,000 fine, since such a sentence is “indefinite” and thus violates §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c07s47-7-33" target="_self">47-7-33</a></cite>.

       <p>
   Appellate court affirmed the denial of an inmate’s petition for post-conviction relief; the inmate was not illegally sentenced, because as a prior felon, he was not entitled to a suspended sentence under Miss.

       Circuit court did not err in denying appellant’s motion for post-conviction relief because at the plea/sentencing hearing, the circuit court clearly informed appellant that he faced five additional years in Mississippi Department of Corrections custody if he violated the conditions of his post-release supervision. Stacks v. State, 240 So.3d 516, 2018 Miss. App. LEXIS 132 (Miss. Ct. App. 2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       Circuit court did not err in denying appellant’s motion for post-conviction relief because it had the authority to sentence appellant to serve five years in Mississippi Department of Corrections custody after he violated multiple conditions of his post-release supervision (PSR); the statute does not require the circuit court to expressly suspend part of the defendant’s sentence when the court imposes a term of PRS. Stacks v. State, 240 So.3d 516, 2018 Miss. App. LEXIS 132 (Miss. Ct. App. 2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       Circuit courts are encouraged to follow the customary practice to suspend a portion of the offender’s sentence when imposing a term of post-release supervision (PRS); however, a technical deviation from this customary practice does not limit the circuit court’s authority to terminate an offender’s PRS and order him to be recommitted to Mississippi Department of Corrections custody if the offender violates the conditions of his or her PRS. Stacks v. State, 240 So.3d 516, 2018 Miss. App. LEXIS 132 (Miss. Ct. App. 2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Although circuit judge apparently believed, based on Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c07s47-7-33ol11" target="_self">47-7-33(1)</a></cite> that he could not suspend any portion of defendant’s sentence, due to a prior felony, Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c07s47-7-34" target="_self">47-7-34</a></cite> does not prohibit the imposition of post-release supervision upon a previously convicted felon. Wade v. State, 33 So.3d 498, 2009 Miss. App. LEXIS 645 (Miss. Ct. App. 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Because it was within the trial court’s discretion under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c07s47-7-34" target="_self">47-7-34</a></cite> whether to impose a term of post-release supervision, no error could be found in the court’s failure to impose such supervision in sentencing a defendant for armed robbery. Waddell v. State, 999 So. 2d 375, 2008 Miss. App. LEXIS 93 (Miss. Ct. App. 2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Motion for post-conviction relief was denied in a case where defendant’s suspended sentence for statutory rape was revoked because he waived issues relating to a speedy trial and defects in an evidence sample due to a guilty plea, there was no evidence that an indictment was manufactured, and the revocation of the suspended sentence was permitted under Miss. Code Ann. §§<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c07s47-7-34" target="_self">47-7-34</a></cite> and<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c07s47-7-37" target="_self">47-7-37</a></cite> where defendant had already served a portion of a five-year sentence after the guilty plea was entered. Davis v. State, 954 So. 2d 530, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 259 (Miss. Ct. App. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Appellate court affirmed the denial of the inmate’s motion for post-conviction relief as the inmate acknowledged that recommended post-release supervision would be five years, and Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c07s47-7-34" target="_self">47-7-34</a></cite> authorized post-release supervision of up to five years. Elliott v. State, 924 So. 2d 609, 2006 Miss. App. LEXIS 174 (Miss. Ct. App. 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant’s sentence for armed robbery was proper; 20 years in prison, with 12 years suspended, followed by five years of post-release supervision, was within the sentencing range. The trial court had the authority to impose post-release supervision. Williams v. State, 922 So. 2d 853, 2006 Miss. App. LEXIS 157 (Miss. Ct. App. 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   In a manslaughter case, the trial court correctly dismissed defendant’s motion for post-conviction relief as time-barred as she was not serving an illegal sentence; the combination of her 4 years of post-release supervision and 16 years incarceration resulted in a 20-year sentence, the permissible maximum sentence as per Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c07s47-7-34" target="_self">47-7-34</a></cite>. Brown v. State, 923 So. 2d 258, 2006 Miss. App. LEXIS 147 (Miss. Ct. App. 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       Inmate’s sentence was not illegal where the sum of his term of imprisonment and term of supervised release did not exceed the maximum sentence allowed by statute for the felony committed. Epps v. State, 926 So. 2d 242, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 991 (Miss. Ct. App. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Where there was a conflict between the sentencing order and the commitment order, the sentencing order that stated that the inmate was to serve three years in prison and two years on supervised release controlled; thus, the five year sentence was valid under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.97.html#t97c01s97-1-5" target="_blank">97-1-5</a></cite> for his conviction of accessory after the fact to murder as it did not exceed the maximum sentence authorized to be imposed by the law for the felony committed. Fuller v. State, 914 So. 2d 1230, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 858 (Miss. Ct. App. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where an inmate was sentenced for two counts of grand larceny and could have received a maximum sentence of ten years in the custody of Mississippi Department of Corrections, but instead, the trial court suspended five years of the ten year sentence, leaving five years of incarceration to serve, with two years of post-release supervision, the inmate’s sentence was not illegal. Thus, the trial court properly denied the inmate’s motion for post-conviction relief. Hill v. State, 912 So. 2d 494, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 726 (Miss. Ct. App. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Sentence was rendered on certiorari where the original sentencing order was incorrect and the inmate was convicted of manufacturing methamphetamine, pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c07s47-7-34" target="_self">47-7-34</a></cite>. The inmate was a prior convicted felon and the appellate court could resentence him without remanding to the trial court because the sentencing error was caused by a misapplication of a sentencing statute; Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c07s47-7-33" target="_self">47-7-33</a></cite> was inapplicable; the supreme court modified the trial court’s sentence so that following his 8 years of incarceration, the inmate would be released to 12 years of post-release supervision but he was required to report to prison officials for only 5 years and the remaining 7 years would be unsupervised post-release supervision. Sweat v. State, 912 So. 2d 458, 2005 Miss. LEXIS 661 (Miss. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where defendant had already served 18 months of his ten- year sentence, the trial court’s order sentencing defendant to serve ten years upon his second violation of the terms of his postrelease supervision did exceed the authority of the court, which was only authorized to reinstate the remainder of defendant’s original sentence. The maximum term remaining on defendant’s sentence that could have been reinstated by the court was eight years and six months. Harvey v. State, 919 So. 2d 282, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 377 (Miss. Ct. App. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Court did not err in sentencing defendant to eight years in prison and 12 years post-release supervision after he was convicted of selling cocaine because the period of incarceration and post-release supervision did not exceed the maximum period of time allowed for the offense. Avant v. State, 896 So. 2d 379, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 3 (Miss. Ct. App. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Defendant argued that his sentence was contrary to Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c07s47-7-34" target="_self">47-7-34</a></cite> because by failing to comply with the terms and conditions of postrelease supervision he could be required to serve a term exceeding the maximum term allowed under the statute; defendant’s sentence totaling 15 years, specifically 10 years to serve with 5 years of postrelease supervision, was unquestionably in accord with Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.97.html#t97c21s97-21-33" target="_blank">97-21-33</a></cite> as it was at the time of his sentencing, and, therefore, his sentence did not conflict with Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c07s47-7-34" target="_self">47-7-34</a></cite>. Kemp v. State, 904 So. 2d 1162, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 1009 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Defendant claimed that his sentence for an attempted armed robbery charge (10 years, with 5 suspended and 5 years of postrelease supervision), was in violation of Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c07s47-7-33ol11" target="_self">47-7-33(1)</a></cite>, which precluded probation for a convicted felon. From the record it was apparent that what the trial court intended, pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c07s47-7-34" target="_self">47-7-34</a></cite>, was to sentence defendant to five years of actual confinement, and five years of postrelease supervision, and therefore, a remand for clarification of defendant’s sentence was required. Thomas v. State, 883 So. 2d 1197, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 963 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Incarceration and postrelease supervision up to five years is a permissible sentence for a felony, as long as the entire sentence is within the maximum prison term for the offense. The postrelease supervision period merges with the incarceration to form the total sentence. Johnson v. State, 924 So. 2d 527, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 667 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004), aff'd in part and rev'd in part, 925 So. 2d 86, 2006 Miss. LEXIS 116 (Miss. 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Defendant’s status was one of post-release supervision, a status much like probation; the procedures for terminating such supervision were the same as the procedures for the revocation of probation under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c07s47-7-34ol12" target="_self">47-7-34(2)</a></cite>, and because the revocation of post-release supervision followed the same procedure as for revocation of probation, it may not be directly appealed, and since the original revocation order may not be appealed, neither may the denial of a motion to reconsider that revocation. Massingille v. State, 878 So. 2d 252, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 665 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Probation under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c07s47-7-33" target="_self">47-7-33</a></cite> was a conditional term that was not part of the prison sentence and was therefore not subject to the totality of sentence concept found in Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c07s47-7-34" target="_self">47-7-34</a></cite>; defendant’s five-year probation period would not be added to her original twenty-year sentence for aggravated assault when calculating time to be served, and reinstating the full original sentence therefore would not violate the statutory maximum for her crime as set forth in Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.97.html#t97c03s97-3-7" target="_blank">97-3-7</a></cite>. Miller v. State, 879 So. 2d 1050, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 546 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 887 So. 2d 183, 2004 Miss. LEXIS 1347 (Miss. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Defendant’s period of supervised release was not counted toward his time served; therefore, defendant’s sentence of three years to serve, seven years suspended, and five years of post release supervision was within the ten years allowable pursuant to the embezzlement statute, Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.97.html#t97c23s97-23-19" target="_blank">97-23-19</a></cite>. Brown v. State, 872 So. 2d 96, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 380 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Trial court committed plain error under Miss. R. Evid. 103(d) where it sentenced defendant, in part, to 10 years of post-release supervision, as under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c07s47-7-34" target="_self">47-7-34</a></cite>, five years of post-release supervision was the maximum. Stigall v. State, 869 So. 2d 410, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 1206 (Miss. Ct. App. 2003), cert. denied, 878 So. 2d 67, 2004 Miss. LEXIS 864 (Miss. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Defendant’s sentence of 30 years of supervised probation was clearly in violation of Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c07s47-7-34" target="_self">47-7-34</a></cite> because the maximum amount of time that the Mississippi Department of Corrections could supervise an offender on postrelease supervision was 5 years. Brooks v. State, 858 So. 2d 930, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 1038 (Miss. Ct. App. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section applies only to felonies, not misdemeanors. Conner v. State, 750 So. 2d 1258, 2000 Miss. LEXIS 3 (Miss. 2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   This section creates a post-release supervision program that provides for a term of post-release supervision in addition to any term of incarceration imposed upon those already convicted of a felony; it is a legislative creation separate and distinct from probation as set out in §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c07s47-7-33" target="_self">47-7-33</a></cite>.

      <p>
       Appellant’s motion for post-conviction relief was properly denied because the trial court was not request to appoint counsel during the revocation hearing; the revocation hearing was straightforward, and the trial court instructed appellant that he could cross-examine witnesses, testify on his own behalf, and call any witnesses that he wanted. Gray v. State, — So.3d —, 2018 Miss. App. LEXIS 185 (Miss. Ct. App. Apr. 17, 2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       Probationer failed to show that the trial court acted outside its authority in revoking the probationer’s post-release supervision because the evidence showed that the probationer was on post-release supervision, instead of parole, which was under the exclusive authority of the trial court. Boone v. State, 148 So.3d 377, 2014 Miss. App. LEXIS 100 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 151 So.3d 1017, 2014 Miss. LEXIS 493 (Miss. 2014).

Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c07s47-7-47" target="_self">47-7-47</a></cite>, its implied attempt to impermissibly delegate its authority to suspend part of the prisoner’s 16-year sentence, and the fact that he did not have a revocation hearing, the circuit court’s sentence was impermissibly indeterminate. Graham v. State, 85 So.3d 860, 2011 Miss. App. LEXIS 33 (Miss. Ct. App. 2011), vacated, 85 So.3d 847, 2012 Miss. LEXIS 190 (Miss. 2012).

   Because petitioner admitted in his waiver that he did, in fact, violate the terms of his post-release supervision by committing the offense of domestic violence on two occasions, the court had the authority under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c07s47-7-34ol12" target="_self">47-7-34(2)</a></cite> to revoke his post-release supervision. Williams v. State, 4 So.3d 388, 2009 Miss.

Importantly, the statutory limitation of five years applies only to that maximum period of post-release supervision that may be served under the supervision of the Mississippi Department of Corrections.

   The Supreme Court of Mississippi returns the legislatively intended sentencing discretion to Mississippi’s trial courts by clarifying that (1)
   Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c07s47-7-33" target="_self">47-7-33</a></cite> prohibits the imposition of a suspended sentence and supervised probation on a prior convicted felon; however, this statute does not prohibit the imposition of a suspended sentence, in whole or in part, upon a prior convicted felon, so long as the sentence does not involve a period of supervised probation and does not exceed the maximum penalty statutorily prescribed for the felony offense committed; (2) when a suspended sentence and supervised probation are properly imposed upon a first-offender under the provisions of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c07s47-7-33" target="_self">47-7-33</a></cite>, the period of supervision by the Mississippi Department of Corrections is limited to a maximum period of five years; (3)

      <p>
       Petitioner was properly denied postconviction relief after he pled guilty to manslaughter by culpable negligence because he wrongfully read the post-release supervision statute. The statute applied to him because he was convicted of a felony committed after June 30, 1995; further, the statute did not distinguish between first time and repeat offenders. Oaks v. State, 912 So. 2d 1075, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 675 (Miss. Ct. App. 2005).

   Post-release supervision, a legislative creation under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c07s47-7-34" target="_self">47-7-34</a></cite>, was separate and distinct from probation, and a defendant’s period of supervised release was not counted toward his time served.

   Where defendant was sentenced to five years of incarceration, a 10-year suspended sentence, and five years post-release supervision, defendant’s sentence was well within the statutory maximum of Miss.

Mississippi Supreme Court has made it clear that a trial judge may sentence a prior-convicted felon to more than five years of post-release supervision, provided the period of incarceration and the period of post-release supervision do not exceed the maximum period of time allowed for the offense.

   Defendant was properly denied his motion for postconviction relief based on an allegedly illegal sentence where defendant was not convicted and given probation, but was convicted and given five years of postrelease supervision. Since the sentencing court complied with Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c07s47-7-34ol12003" target="_self">47-7-34 (2003)</a></cite> in ordering his sentence, denial of his motion for postconviction relief based on an illegal sentence was proper.

   Where a trial court sentenced defendant to a term of one year in the Mississippi Department of Corrections (MDOC), followed by supervised probation under the supervision of the MDOC for a period of 10 years, a court of appeals erred in reversing the sentence because it was clear that the trial court was placing defendant on probation, only five years of which would be served under the supervision of the MDOC, the remaining five years being in essence “unsupervised probation.” Thus, the sentence did not violate Miss. Code Ann. §§<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c07s47-7-33" target="_self">47-7-33</a></cite>,<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c07s47-7-34" target="_self">47-7-34</a></cite>, or<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c07s47-7-37" target="_self">47-7-37</a></cite>.

   Defendant was sentenced to five years of actual incarceration followed by five years of post-release supervision, with no portion of defendant’s sentence suspended. In defendant’s action for post-conviction relief, contesting the requirement for post release supervision, defendant confused
   Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c07s47-7-33" target="_self">47-7-33</a></cite> (convicted felons ineligible for a suspended sentence), with

      <p>
       Trial court properly sentenced defendant to a term of incarceration plus a term of post-release supervision where the term of incarceration and post-release supervision did not exceed the statutory maximum sentence for the felony committed, and the sentence did not offend the double jeopardy clause of the United States or Mississippi Constitutions.

   There is nothing in Miss.

       Decision to revoke appellant’s, an inmate’s, probation was appropriate, but a remand to the trial court was necessary because the handwritten addendum to the revocation order caused the inmate’s new sentence to exceed the five-year maximum sentence and the State conceded that the handwritten addendum imposing three years’ post-release supervision, instead of two years, was a clerical error.

      <p>
       Under the Fifth Amendment and Miss. Const. Art. 3, § 21, a trial court’s imposition of defendant’s original ten-year term after his second parole violation was not an unlawful extension or increase of his sentence in violation of his right against double jeopardy because, although the written sentencing order did not reflect the court’s imposition of the ten-year sentence but merely that all but 18 months of that sentence were suspended, on two occasions defendant was clearly informed in open court that his sentence was for ten years.

   Appellant inmate’s sentence did not fail to comply with Miss.

   Where defendant, a prior convicted felon, was sentenced to 30 years and was ordered to serve 26 months in incarceration with the remainder of the sentence suspended and four years of post-release supervision, defendant was not placed on probation, and the trial court lawfully placed conditions on the suspended sentence. Because the combined periods of incarceration and post-release supervision did not exceed the maximum penalty statutorily proscribed for the felony offense committed and the trial court imposed a sentence within the statutory guidelines, the sentence was not illegal under Miss.

   In a case where defendant was sentenced to eight years in prison with five years of post-release supervision after a guilty plea was entered to the crime of attempted burglary of a dwelling, a post-conviction relief motion was properly dismissed without an evidentiary hearing under Miss.

Moreover, a sentence was not illegal since a suspended sentence was not required in addition to post-release supervision, the sentence imposed was within the range permitted, and the inmate was not misinformed regarding his appellate rights.

      <p>
       Post-conviction relief was denied in a case where appellant inmate’s post-release supervision (PRS) and suspended sentences were revoked because the inmate was on state PRS the moment that he was released from federal custody. Therefore, there was no error in revoking his PRS based on an arrest for drugs shortly after his release from federal custody. Lenoir v. State, 4 So.3d 1056, 2008 Miss. App. LEXIS 585 (Miss. Ct.

   Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c07s47-7-34" target="_self">47-7-34</a></cite>; circuit and county courts had the power to suspend sentences for prior convicted felons that would have been considered illegal under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c07s47-7-33ol11" target="_self">47-7-33(1)</a></cite>.

Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c07s47-7-34" target="_self">47-7-34</a></cite>, with five of the eight years to be served in accordance with “probation-like” terms under the supervision of the MDOC, under Miss.

       When the court exercises its authority to suspend the execution of a portion of a defendant’s sentence, the normal course of procedure is to (1) impose a sentence, (2) determine what portion is to be suspended, (3) impose a period of probation, and (4) specify the terms and conditions upon which the probation/suspended sentence is contingent; if at any time during the period of probation it is determined that the probationer violated any of the specified conditions of his or her probation, the court has the authority to revoke any part or all of the probation or any part or all of the suspended sentence, as if the decision to suspend the sentence and place the defendant on probation had never been made. Artis v. State, 643 So. 2d 533, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 468 (Miss. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       A court must base its revocation of a suspended sentence on a violation of the clear terms and conditions of the suspended sentence; due process requires that the trial judge at least orally inform the defendant of the terms and conditions upon which his or her suspended sentence is contingent before it may be properly revoked for the violation of those terms and conditions. Artis v. State, 643 So. 2d 533, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 468 (Miss. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       Policy of denying public benefits to probationers as condition of probation unless and until probationer requests hearing for modification of probation and receives approval from court to apply for public assistance does not violate due process clause of Fourteenth Amendment, does not violate equal protection right of probationer or her dependent children nor are such conditions of probation unduly intrusive or constitutionally impermissible restrictions. Clark v. Prichard, 812 F.2d 991, 1987 U.S. App. LEXIS 3680 (5th Cir. Miss. 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Sentence was neither excessive nor beyond the court’s authority which required the defendant, who was convicted of a violation of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.97.html#t97c03s97-3-19" target="_blank">97-3-19</a></cite>, to serve 30 days in the county jail, perform 60 days of community work, pay costs of special election, and pay costs of trial, as conditions for the suspension of a one year sentence and 2 years of probation. Fanning v. State, 497 So. 2d 70, 1986 Miss. LEXIS 2645 (Miss. 1986).

        2. Banishment.
       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       <p>
   In a challenge to the banishment provision of defendant’s sentence pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.99.html#t99c39s99-39-5ol11a" target="_blank">99-39-5(1)(a)</a></cite>, the substitution of some period of formal probationary supervision in place of a like term of banishment did not constitute an increase in the degree or character of defendant’s punishment that would invoke constitutional concerns of double jeopardy, U.S. Const. Amend. V, and the requirement of supervised probation was essentially rehabilitative in its objectives and not punitive; thus, the change in probation terms was within the circuit court’s authority as contained in Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c07s47-7-35" target="_self">47-7-35</a></cite>. Weaver v. State, 856 So. 2d 407, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 234 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 859 So. 2d 1017, 2003 Miss. LEXIS 515 (Miss. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       A banishment provision must bear a reasonable relationship to the purpose of probation, the ends of justice and the best interests of the defendant and the public must be served, the public policy must not be violated, the rehabilitative purpose of the probation must not be defeated, and the defendant’s rights under the First, Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution must not be violated. Hamm v. State, 758 So. 2d 1042, 2000 Miss. App. LEXIS 101 (Miss. Ct. App. 2000).

      <p>
       Denial of the inmate’s petition for post-conviction relief was proper where his probation was rightfully revoked because there was sufficient evidence supporting the conclusion that he more likely than not failed to avoid persons of harmful character and disreputable places.

   Defendant’s sentence was valid and non-modifiable where he was ordered to serve 15 years in the custody of the Mississippi Department of Corrections (MDOC), with seven years to be served by actual incarceration, and the remaining eight years to be suspended and served by way of post-release supervision under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c07s47-7-34" target="_self">47-7-34</a></cite>, with five of the eight years to be served in accordance with “probation-like” terms under the supervision of the MDOC, under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c07s47-7-34" target="_self">47-7-34</a></cite> and Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c07s47-7-35" target="_self">47-7-35</a></cite>. The appellate court ignored the clear intention of the circuit court to order a 15-year sentence, and this intention was appropriately accomplished under Miss. Code Ann. § 47-7-34. Johnson v.

       Statute addressing suspended sentences and conditional pardons could not have been used as authority to revoke post-release supervision; the procedures for the revocation of post-release supervision were prescribed exclusively in another statute. Atwood v. State, 183 So.3d 843, 2016 Miss. LEXIS 18 (Miss. 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c07s47-7-37" target="_self">47-7-37</a></cite>, only the court had the authority to revoke probation; accordingly, the trial court properly exercised jurisdiction over defendant in revoking his post-release supervision. Edwards v. State, 946 So. 2d 822, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 8 (Miss. Ct. App. 2007), overruled in part, Sobrado v. State, 168 So.3d 1114, 2014 Miss. App. LEXIS 98 (Miss. Ct. App. 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Per Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c07s47-7-37" target="_self">47-7-37</a></cite>, the circuit court had the statutory authority to revoke defendant’s post-release supervision when he sold cocaine to an agent while on release. There was no error where the circuit court reinstated his five year suspended sentence; further, per the bench warrant upon which defendant was arrested, and the summons setting the revocation hearing, hand delivered to defendant, he had notice of the revocation hearing and he was not denied due process or entitled to post-conviction relief. Rucker v. State, 909 So. 2d 137, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 551 (Miss. Ct. App. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Defendant’s violation of the condition of his suspended sentence occurred within the five-year implied period of probation, Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c07s47-7-37" target="_self">47-7-37</a></cite>; defendant understood the simple and clear condition that he was not to violate any laws of any city or state or of the United States. McCaine v. State, 879 So. 2d 1114, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 777 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Defendant was shown to have violated his probation, and pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c07s47-7-37" target="_self">47-7-37</a></cite> the trial judge had the right to reimpose the previously suspended seven year sentence; defendant’s three years incarceration and seven years suspended plus five years of post-release supervision did not equate to fifteen years of time-served, and the sentence was not in violation of the statute. Brown v. State, 872 So. 2d 96, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 380 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   In a capital murder case, defendant’s contention that his identification was the result of an illegal arrest was without merit as his probation officer had the legal authority to sign the warrant under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c07s47-7-37" target="_self">47-7-37</a></cite>, even though he allegedly had no personal knowledge of the circumstances in the warrant. Howell v. State, 860 So. 2d 704, 2003 Miss. LEXIS 556 (Miss. 2003), cert. dismissed, <cite class="us_code">543 U.S. 440</cite>, <cite class="s_court">125 S. Ct. 856</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">160 L.

      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Petitioner’s sentence for five years probation was proper where the trial court could impose up to five years’ post-release supervision following time in the custody of the Department of Corrections, and the petitioner failed to establish that he was being held unlawfully in custody. Payton v. State, 845 So. 2d 713, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 398 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 859 So. 2d 392, 2003 Miss. LEXIS 436 (Miss. 2003), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">540 U.S. 1078</cite>, <cite class="s_court">124 S. Ct. 931</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">157 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 751, 2003 U.S. LEXIS 9076 (U.S. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   A defendant who wishes to challenge the revocation of his probation need not pursue the administrative remedies set out in Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c05s47-5-803" target="_self">47-5-803</a></cite>, as only a court can continue or revoke a defendant’s probation. Rodriguez v. State, 839 So. 2d 561, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 131 (Miss. Ct. App. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       The trial court could not properly revoke the defendant’s suspended sentence where (1) a 10-year period of probation was improperly imposed on the defendant as the statute allowed a maximum period of probation of five years, (2) shortly before the end of the fifth year of probation, the defendant’s probation officer filed a violation report and an arrest warrant was issued, but no arrest occurred at that time, and (3) about two years later, the defendant was arrested on an unrelated charge, and a petition to revoke his suspended sentence was then filed. Simpson v. State, 785 So. 2d 1121, 2001 Miss. App. LEXIS 221 (Miss. Ct. App. 2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where defendant would maintain his status as a probationer for a total of five years after his release, the maximum permitted, he would only be subjected to supervised probation, with its requirements of periodic reporting and other more restrictive provisions, for the first two years of the five-year probationary period. Hall v. State, 800 So. 2d 1202, 2001 Miss. App. LEXIS 347 (Miss. Ct. App. 2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the period of probation has already expired, it cannot thereafter be revoked, regardless of whether the probationary status terminated prior to the expiration of the term originally set by the sentencing court or by the passage of time. Davis v. State, 844 So. 2d 1142, 2000 Miss. LEXIS 245 (Miss. 2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       When the county circuit court revoked the defendant’s probation, it lacked the jurisdiction since, at the time of the defendant’s arrest, the five year term of her probation had already expired by several months and, therefore, could not be revoked; a form warrant signed and mailed by an officer of the Department of Corrections did not serve to toll the running of term of probation because it was not issued by the court or a judge in vacation. Ellis v. State, 748 So. 2d 130, 1999 Miss. LEXIS 311 (Miss. 1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       The combined terms of a sentence of imprisonment and a period of probation may exceed the maximum sentence permitted for a crime. Carter v. State, 726 So. 2d 195, 1998 Miss. App. LEXIS 1071 (Miss. Ct. App. 1998), op. withdrawn, sub. op., 1999 Miss. App. LEXIS 235 (Miss. Ct. App. Apr. 20, 1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       When the court exercises its authority to suspend the execution of a portion of a defendant’s sentence, the normal course of procedure is to (1) impose a sentence, (2) determine what portion is to be suspended, (3) impose a period of probation, and (4) specify the terms and conditions upon which the probation/suspended sentence is contingent; if at any time during the period of probation it is determined that the probationer violated any of the specified conditions of his or her probation, the court has the authority to revoke any part or all of the probation or any part or all of the suspended sentence, as if the decision to suspend the sentence and place the defendant on probation had never been made. Artis v. State, 643 So. 2d 533, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 468 (Miss. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       Once a circuit or county court exercises its option to impose a definite sentence it cannot subsequently set that sentence aside and impose a greater sentence. Leonard v. State, 271 So. 2d 445, 1973 Miss. LEXIS 1512 (Miss. 1973).
      </p>
      <p>
       This provision does not apply to misdemeanors. Jackson v. Waller, 248 Miss. 166, 156 So. 2d 594, 1963 Miss. LEXIS 388, 1964 Miss. LEXIS 265 (Miss. 1963), modified, 248 Miss. 172, 160 So. 2d 184 (Miss. 1964).

      <p>
       In a post-conviction relief case, it was error to determine that this statute, which provided for graduated penalties for technical violations for probation and supervised release, was unconstitutional as violative of the separation of powers doctrine because there was nothing in the amendments to this statute that impinged upon a trial court’s ability to enforce its orders. The trial court retained its authority to determine whether there was a violation of a condition of supervised release, as well as the power to revoke the term of supervision and to impose a period of imprisonment; the Mississippi Legislature merely altered the term and place of imprisonment for certain violations. Atwood v. State, 183 So.3d 843, 2016 Miss. LEXIS 18 (Miss. 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a post-conviction appeal, a state inmate argued unsuccessfully that he was denied due process by the circuit court’s failure to require that he be found guilty of a crime before revoking his probation. The Mississippi Supreme Court had stated that a conviction was not necessary to revoke probation; probation could be revoked upon a showing that the inmate more likely than not violated the terms of probation. Loisel v. State, 995 So. 2d 850, 2008 Miss. App. LEXIS 693 (Miss. Ct. App. 2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a post-conviction appeal, a state inmate argued unsuccessfully the circuit court erred in refusing his motion for post-conviction relief and that as a result, he was denied due process. Contrary to the inmate’s assertion, the record showed that the circuit court judge provided a written order in which he found that the inmate admitted at the revocation hearing to violating his probation, and it was that admission that served as the basis for the revocation. Loisel v. State, 995 So. 2d 850, 2008 Miss. App. LEXIS 693 (Miss. Ct. App. 2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a post-conviction appeal in which a state inmate argued that during his probation revocation hearing, he was on medication for depression and anxiety, and, as a result, he claimed that he felt extremely uncomfortable at the hearing and was denied due process, that argument failed. Nothing in the record indicated that the subject of his medications or mental state was ever brought up during the initial revocation hearing in relation to that proceeding, and he was represented by counsel and given an opportunity to be heard, to present evidence, and to examine witnesses. Loisel v. State, 995 So. 2d 850, 2008 Miss. App. LEXIS 693 (Miss. Ct. App. 2008).

   Order dismissing defendant’s motion for post-conviction relief pursuant to Miss.

Morgan v. State, 995 So. 2d 787, 2008 Miss. App. LEXIS 248 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 999 So. 2d 374, 2008 Miss. LEXIS 633 (Miss. 2008).

   Petitioner was accorded the minimum due process requirements to which he was entitled at his revocation hearing; he signed the waiver of preliminary hearing, which contained the charges against him, and his revocation hearing was not held until two months later; there the evidence against him was presented and he was given the opportunity to be heard on the matter. Payton v. State, 845 So. 2d 713, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 398 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 859 So. 2d 392, 2003 Miss.

       A defendant who allegedly violated the terms of his probation by committing the crime of sale of cocaine was denied due process of law by having his probation revoked immediately after a mistrial was declared in his trial on the charge of sale of cocaine where the revocation was based upon the trial which had just resulted in a mistrial, the defendant never agreed that the court could summarily revoke his probation in the event the trial resulted in anything other than a conviction, and he was not given advance notice of a revocation hearing. Grayson v. State, 648 So. 2d 1129, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 630 (Miss. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       A defendant was deprived of due process by a trial court’s failure to conduct an inquiry as to the reason she was delinquent in paying her probation fines before revoking her probation because of her failure to pay those fines. Berdin v. State, 648 So. 2d 73, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 637 (Miss. 1994), overruled,
   Smith v. State, 742 So. 2d 1146, 1999 Miss. LEXIS 260 (Miss. 1999). But see Smith v. State, 742 So. 2d 1146, 1999 Miss. LEXIS 260 (Miss. 1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       A defendant’s probation revocation violated her due process rights where there was no record of the defendant receiving notice of a probation violation, and the disparity between the court’s statements when probation was revoked, the written and signed order of revocation, and the court’s after-the-fact explanation at the defendant’s post-conviction relief hearing demonstrated a lack of actual notice. Berdin v. State, 648 So. 2d 73, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 637 (Miss. 1994), overruled,
   Smith v. State, 742 So. 2d 1146, 1999 Miss. LEXIS 260 (Miss. 1999). But see Smith v. State, 742 So. 2d 1146, 1999 Miss. LEXIS 260 (Miss. 1999).

       A probationer was not denied due process due to the lack of a preliminary hearing in his probation revocation proceedings, even though a hearing expressly designated as “preliminary” was not held, where 3 hearings were held in the circuit courts and the first and second hearings were, for all practical purposes, equivalent to a preliminary hearing. Additionally, the probationer was not wrongfully denied the opportunity to call his own witnesses where he made a last-minute request during the third hearing to call witnesses who allegedly would have testified in his behalf, the court concluded that the witnesses would have offered no new evidence, the probationer had already admitted that he committed probation violations, and at most the witnesses would have testified in regard to the probationer’s character and would have had no effect on the outcome of the case.

       Appellant’s claim for excessive detention while awaiting a revocation hearing was procedurally barred because appellant should have either filed a habeas petition or a motion for relief pursuant to subsection (3), and his failure to do so resulted in the issue never being presented to the circuit court and, therefore, it was procedurally barred on appeal.

   Regardless of whether defendant was under earned- or post-release supervision at the time he initially violated probation, he admitted to violating his probation and when he appeared at his probation revocation hearing, he had not been released from the trial court’s jurisdiction; accordingly, the trial court properly exercised jurisdiction over him under Miss.

       Post-conviction relief was properly denied, because petitioner’s probation was properly revoked based on his indictment for burglary, as petitioner was provided with written notice of the charges against him, the evidence against him was presented to the court in the form of an indictment for burglary and failure to pay supervision and court costs fees, and petitioner was given the opportunity to be heard in court and to present evidence that could refute the allegations levied against him.

       Postconviction relief was properly denied, because petitioner was not improperly denied a right to counsel at his probation revocation hearing, as the record did not reflect that petitioner obtained or requested counsel during the revocation hearing, and the trial court was under no duty to appoint counsel for petitioner during the revocation proceeding.

       Probationers and parolees do not “have, per se, a right to counsel at revocation hearings.” Whether probationers have a right to counsel must be answered “on a case-by-case basis in the exercise of a sound discretion by the state authority charged with responsibility for administering the probation and parole system.” Riely v.

       Denial of the inmate’s motion for post-conviction relief was proper where, had the information of his HIV diagnosis been available to the judge, it would not have changed the fact that the inmate violated the terms of his probation; however, the court remanded for proper sentencing, stating that his failure to successfully complete the Regimented Inmate Discipline (RID) Program did not occur because of any misconduct or similar failure on his part.

       Evidence that defendant failed to make restitution payments and engaged in continuing misconduct while on probation for aggravated assault supported trial court’s decision to revoke probation and impose the remaining 11 years of defendant’s 12-year sentence; defendant was not denied due process and the sentence was not excessive.

       Circuit court did not err in summarily dismissing appellant’s post-conviction-relief motion because its decision to impose a period of imprisonment greater than ninety days was not clearly erroneous since appellant committed at least three technical violations of his post-release supervision.

       Circuit court did not err in dismissing defendant’s postconviction-relief motion as he was not subjected to double jeopardy when the circuit court revoked his probation for a second time and reinstated the remaining balance of his originally suspended 10-year sentence because the circuit court was authorized to incarcerate defendant for the remaining balance of his suspended sentence; and the circuit court did not resentence defendant, nor did it lengthen his original sentence upon the second revocation.

       Where the defendant was sentenced to serve a term of 10 years, suspended for two years in the custody of the Mississippi Department of Corrections, with such suspension made contingent upon his successful completion of a two year period of house arrest, and where the defendant failed to abide by the terms and conditions of his probation and house arrest, the trial court was authorized to revoke the defendant’s probation and impose any part or all of the 10 year sentence originally imposed. Reaves v. State, 749 So. 2d 295, 1999 Miss. App. LEXIS 552 (Miss. Ct. App. 1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       The defendant was entitled to reversal and remand for resentencing where he was given the statutory maximum sentence of 20 years, but with six months suspended and probation for five years; such sentence exceeded the statutory maximum sentence. Carter v. State, 1999 Miss. App. LEXIS 235 (Miss. Ct. App. Apr. 20, 1999), rev'd, 754 So. 2d 1207, 2000 Miss. LEXIS 7 (Miss. 2000).

       The revocation of a defendant’s suspended sentence 10 years after the date of the original sentence was not improper, where the defendant was sentenced to 30 years’ imprisonment, the execution of 15 years of the 30-year sentence was suspended, the defendant was also ordered to serve a 5-year period of supervised probation, the defendant was released on parole after serving 5 years in the state penitentiary on the 15-year “to serve” portion of his sentence, the defendant was arrested for receiving stolen property approximately 2 years after his release on parole and was reincarcerated, he was released on probation 19 months later, and his 15-year suspended sentence was partially revoked for a period of 6 years for violation of the suspended sentence as a result of a house burglary which occurred approximately one year after he was released on probation. The 5-year probationary period for the 15-year suspended portion of the defendant’s 30-year sentence did not begin to run until the day he was released on probation, and the house burglary which triggered the revocation of the suspended sentence took place well within the 5-year period of probation. Moore v. State, 585 So. 2d 738, 1991 Miss. LEXIS 587 (Miss. 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where on remand for resentencing, the trial court sentenced defendant, this being his first offense, to 3 1/2 years in the state penitentiary, but included in the resentencing order a proviso that when defendant shall have served one year of the sentence, he should be placed on probation and parole as to the remaining 2 1/2-year-period for a term of 5 years, inasmuch as the period of probation did not exceed the limit set in Code 1942 § 4004-25, the judgment would be affirmed.

       Appellant’s claim for excessive detention while awaiting a revocation hearing lacked support because the record on appeal was sparse on the details of appellant’s arrest and subsequent pre-hearing detention; the record also was void of any transcript from appellant’s revocation hearing.Edmonson v. State, 238 So.3d 1218, 2018 Miss. App. LEXIS 101 (Miss. Ct. App. 2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because appellant violated three other conditions of his post-release supervision in addition to the condition requiring that he not commit any state or federal offense, appellant committed three “technical violations,” and thus, the circuit court was within its authority to impose the remainder of the suspended portion of his sentence.
   Claverie v. State, — So.3d —, 2018 Miss. App. LEXIS 122 (Miss. Ct. App. Mar. 13, 2018), cert. denied, — So.3d —, 2019 Miss. LEXIS 36 (Miss. Jan. 17, 2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       Appellant was afforded a neutral and detached probation revocation hearing because the circuit court judge did not prosecute for the State when he recited the allegations, asked appellant if he disputed or admitted them, and asked the probation officer if he had anything to add

      </p>
      <p>
       Revocation of appellant’s probation was proper because appellant did not report to his probation officer and did not pay the requisite fees and restitution; by appellant’s own admission, he did, in fact, violate the conditions of his probation.

   Decision to revoke appellant’s, an inmate’s, probation was appropriate pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c07s47-7-37" target="_self">47-7-37</a></cite> because he had testified that he had used marijuana one time since being placed on probation, and, in revoking his probation, the trial judge found that the inmate had used drugs while on probation, had failed to pay supervision fees and court costs, and had resided with his brother, who had an outstanding felony warrant. Whitaker v. State, 22 So.3d 326, 2009 Miss. App. LEXIS 760 (Miss. Ct. App. 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       State acted on a probation revocation petition within a reasonable amount of time; defendant had fled the jurisdiction to Pennsylvania upon release from prison, and remained there until returning to Mississippi, shortly before being served with the revocation petition and arrested.

      </p>
      <p>
       Revocation of defendant’s probation and reinstatement of an initially suspended sentence was well within a trial judge’s discretion and within the confines of statutory authority where defendant committed another armed robbery while on probation for armed robbery, thereby violating the terms of probation. Deere v. State, 976 So. 2d 977, 2008 Miss. App. LEXIS 135 (Miss. Ct. App. 2008).

   Denial of the inmate’s petition for post-conviction relief was proper pursuant to Miss.

In addition, it was without merit because the judge was exercising his authority under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c07s47-7-37" target="_self">47-7-37</a></cite> to issue a warrant for the inmate’s arrest for a probation violation; thus, he was acting within his statutory authority and there was no indication that he was unqualified or biased. Hubbard v. State, 919 So. 2d 1022, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 462 (Miss. Ct. App. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where petitioner had waived his right to a probation revocation hearing, the court had the right to re-impose petitioner’s suspended sentence for uttering forgery because he had tested positive for marijuana and was terminated from a work program. While petitioner claimed that he did not understand that he would have to serve the remaining balance of his sentence, he was not entitled to postconviction relief. Gates v. State, 919 So. 2d 170, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 375 (Miss. Ct. App. 2005).
      </p>

       <p>
   Under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c07s47-7-37" target="_self">47-7-37</a></cite>, probation did not equal time served and could not be credited toward a suspended sentence; therefore, the trial court did not err in denying defendant’s motion for credit for the time he had served on probation. Simmons v. State, 913 So. 2d 1011, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 299 (Miss. Ct. App. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Record indicated an order signed by the trial judge extending defendant’s probation for one year; since there was a record of an order extending probation for the trial judge to consider in reviewing defendant’s motion for postconviction relief, the trial judge acted within proper judicial discretion in denying defendant’s requested relief. McDonald v. State, 904 So. 2d 1167, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 1034 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       A two-day delay between probationer’s arrest and presentation of petition to the court was insufficient to run afoul of the statute’s requirement that judicial oversight be brought to this notice and that the probationer be given an opportunity to be heard. Thorn v. State, 815 So. 2d 455, 2002 Miss. App. LEXIS 194 (Miss. Ct. App. 2002).
      </p>
      <p>
       When the trial court imposes conditions upon a suspended sentence without stating a probationary period, Mississippi law implies imposition of the maximum probationary period of five years and, therefore, if the defendant violates the conditions of his probation within such period, the court has the authority to revoke the suspended sentence. Shumpert v. State, 764 So. 2d 1250, 2000 Miss. App. LEXIS 345 (Miss. Ct. App. 2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       Before a trial court may revoke a defendant’s probation or suspended sentence, it must afford the defendant the minimum due process requirements, including a preliminary hearing and the opportunity to cross-examine witnesses. Shumpert v. State, 764 So. 2d 1250, 2000 Miss. App. LEXIS 345 (Miss. Ct. App. 2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although a probationary period was not described by the court, a probationary period of up to five years was in fact established based on the terms of the defendant’s release where he was ordered to serve ten years in the Mississippi Department of Corrections with the last eight years suspended, pending future good behavior. Wilson v. State, 735 So. 2d 290, 1999 Miss. LEXIS 135 (Miss. 1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       The trial court did not violate the defendant’s right to due process when it revoked his suspended sentence based upon an offense that occurred prior to the imposition of his probation and when the court’s express condition of probation stated that the defendant “shall hereafter commit no offense against the laws of this . . . state,” where (1) the defendant was served with a copy of the state’s petition to revoke his suspended sentence at least five days before the hearing in open court and was given notice thereof, (2) during the hearing, the defendant, through his attorney, confessed to the petition filed by the state and acknowledged that he violated the terms of his probation, and (3) the trial court judge advised the defendant that he was entitled to a hearing during which the state would be required to sufficiently establish that he violated the terms of his probation, but he informed the court that he did not desire such a hearing. Smith v. State, 1998 Miss. App. LEXIS 1053 (Miss. Ct. App. Dec. 18, 1998), rev'd, 742 So. 2d 1146, 1999 Miss. LEXIS 260 (Miss. 1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   When failure to pay court-imposed fines becomes a possible basis for a probation revocation, the trial court must follow the procedural mandates of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.99.html#t99c19s99-19-20ol12" target="_blank">99-19-20(2)</a></cite>.

      </p>
      <p>
       A court must base its revocation of a suspended sentence on a violation of the clear terms and conditions of the suspended sentence; due process requires that the trial judge at least orally inform the defendant of the terms and conditions upon which his or her suspended sentence is contingent before it may be properly revoked for the violation of those terms and conditions. Artis v. State, 643 So. 2d 533, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 468 (Miss. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       A prisoner will not be permitted to serve his or her period of probation simultaneously with his or her incarceration; “probation” denotes a release of the defendant, under suspension of sentence, into the community under the supervision of a probation officer. Moore v. State, 585 So. 2d 738, 1991 Miss. LEXIS 587 (Miss. 1991).

       The trial court did not abuse its discretion or violate any statutory or constitutional rights of the defendant by removing him from the earned probation program without an evidentiary hearing. Bourrage v. State, 785 So. 2d 1096, 2001 Miss. App. LEXIS 176 (Miss. Ct. App. 2001).

       Judge lacked authority to suspend remainder of defendant’s sentence where defendant was clearly ineligible for release under statute governing earned probation, defendant was taken into custody for parole violation involving weapons and alcohol, and judge acted solely on his own after numerous ex parte communications with others.

      </p>
      <p>
       Judge’s use of nunc pro tunc order to suspend defendant’s sentence following ex parte communications with defendant’s daughter, regarding defendant’s age and health, exceeded judge’s authority where judge did not reserve right to judicial review at time of original sentencing.

      <p>
       Judge’s use of nunc pro tunc order to correct sentencing order to show that judge had reserved judicial review of sentence for 180 days, thus permitting subsequent suspension of defendant’s sentence, exceeded judge’s authority, in that reservation language was not included in original order, defendant was not eligible for earned probation under statute, judge could not suspend sentence imposed by another judge, which defendant was serving at time judge suspended sentence, and judge acted ex parte, without motion by defendant’s attorney. Mississippi Comm'n on Judicial Performance v. Russell, 691 So. 2d 929, 1997 Miss. LEXIS 35 (Miss. 1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       State Supreme Court’s Wigginton decision, providing that trial judge who initially committed prisoner to regimented inmate discipline (RID) program could review prisoner’s expulsion from that program in order to ascertain whether there was any basis for removal, did not authorize circuit court judge to use nunc pro tunc orders to suspend sentences and place prisoners on probation after time of original sentencing. Mississippi Comm'n on Judicial Performance v. Russell, 691 So. 2d 929, 1997 Miss. LEXIS 35 (Miss. 1997).

       Circuit judge who sentenced prisoner under statute governing earned probation programs had authority to later make a determination whether to suspend execution of sentence due to removal of prisoner from Regimented Inmate Discipline (RID), or shock probation, program.

   Neither the due process clause nor Mississippi law gives rise to a protected liberty interest in the form of an expectation of release on probation. There is no liberty interest in release pursuant to the provisions of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c07s47-7-47" target="_self">47-7-47</a></cite>, which creates a procedure whereby the courts may place a prisoner on probation, since the language of the statute is permissive rather than mandatory in nature; the statute vests absolute discretion in both the Department of Corrections and the court in determining whether probation should be recommended and granted, and this discretion affords a prisoner no constitutionally recognized liberty interest.

       Where defendant pled guilty to statutory rape, the trial court did not err by sentencing defendant to participate in the Mississippi Regimented Inmate Discipline Program program under its own discretion, and not under the earned-time allowance program administered by the Mississippi DOC. Gatlin v. State, 18 So.3d 290, 2009 Miss. App. LEXIS 199 (Miss. Ct. App. 2009).

   Defendant was not considered a habitual offender for sentencing purposes, and his sentence could not be considered “mandatory” under
   Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c07s47-7-47ol12c" target="_self">47-7-47(2)(c)</a></cite>; therefore, defendant was eligible for earned probation, and suspension of a convicted felon’s sentence was proper and under the sound discretion of the trial court due to the passage of
   Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c07s47-7-34" target="_self">47-7-34</a></cite>; circuit and county courts had the power to suspend sentences for prior convicted felons that would have been considered illegal under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c07s47-7-33ol11" target="_self">47-7-33(1)</a></cite>.

   To the extent defendant may be correct that Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c07s47-7-47" target="_self">47-7-47</a></cite> gave the trial judge between thirty days and one year to modify or suspend sentences, the authority to do so was within the sound discretion of the court, and the judge determined not to do so, which was not error.

Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c07s47-7-47ol12a" target="_self">47-7-47(2)(a)</a></cite> as pertaining to resentencing was erroneous because the statute did not pertain to resentencing, it pertained only to a suspension of the further execution of a sentence and to the placement of the convicted felon on earned probation.

      <p>

   Based on the circuit court’s failure to retain sentencing jurisdiction pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c07s47-7-47" target="_self">47-7-47</a></cite>, its implied attempt to impermissibly delegate its authority to suspend part of the prisoner’s 16-year sentence, and the fact that he did not have a revocation hearing, the circuit court’s sentence was impermissibly indeterminate. Graham v. State, 85 So.3d 860, 2011 Miss. App. LEXIS 33 (Miss. Ct. App. 2011), vacated, 85 So.3d 847, 2012 Miss. LEXIS 190 (Miss. 2012).

       <p>
   Dismissal of the inmate’s petition for postconviction relief was proper because the appeal was untimely; further, even assuming that his appeal was an appeal from the circuit court’s dismissal of the inmate’s motion for reconsideration, the circuit court did not commit clear error not did it abuse its discretion in dismissing that motion because the inmate had been sentenced during a previous term of court that had since ended, and thus the circuit court had lost jurisdiction as to any aspect of the inmate’s sentencing under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c07s47-7-47ol12" target="_self">47-7-47(2)</a></cite>. Doss v. State, 956 So. 2d 1100, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 344 (Miss. Ct. App. 2007).

       While the statute provides for jurisdiction in matters of probation and earned probation, it does not provide for jurisdiction with regard to house arrest. Smith v. State, 766 So. 2d 50, 2000 Miss. App. LEXIS 334 (Miss. Ct. App. 2000).

      I. The governor of this state is hereby authorized and directed to execute a compact on behalf of the state of Mississippi with any of the United States legally joining therein in the form substantially as follows:
     </p>
     <p>
      A Compact
     </p>
     <p>
      Entered into by and among the contracting states, signatories hereto, with the consent of the congress of the United States of America, granted by an act entitled “An act granting the consent of Congress to any two (2) or more states to enter into agreements or compacts for cooperative effort and mutual assistance in the prevention of crime and for other purposes.”
     </p>
     <p>
      The contracting states solemnly agree:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t47c07s47-7-71ol11">
       That it shall be competent for the duly constituted judicial and administrative authorities of a state party to this compact (herein called “sending state”), to permit any person convicted of an offense within such state and placed on probation or released on parole to reside in any other state party to this compact (herein called “receiving state”), while on probation or parole, if
       <ol type="a">
        <li id="t47c07s47-7-71ol11a">
         Such person is in fact a resident of or has his family residing within the receiving state and can obtain employment there;
        </li>
        <li id="t47c07s47-7-71ol11b">
         Though not a resident of the receiving state and not having his family residing there, the receiving state consents to such person being sent there.
         <p>
          Before granting such permission, opportunity shall be granted to the receiving state to investigate the home and prospective employment of such person.
         </p>
         <p>
          A resident of the receiving state, within the meaning of this section, is one who has been an actual inhabitant of such state continuously for more than one (1) year prior to his coming to the sending state and has not resided within the sending state more than six (6) continuous months immediately preceding the commission of the offense for which he has been convicted.
         </p>
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t47c07s47-7-71ol11b2">
       That each receiving state will assume the duties of visitation of and supervision over probationers or parolees of any sending state and in the exercise of those duties will be governed by the same standards that prevail for its own probationers and parolees.
      </li>
      <li id="t47c07s47-7-71ol11b3">
       That duly accredited officers of a sending state may at all times enter a receiving state and there apprehend and retake any person on probation or parole. For that purpose no formalities will be required other than establishing the authority of the officer and the identity of the person to be retaken. All legal requirements to obtain extradition of fugitives from justice are hereby expressly waived on the part of states party hereto, as to such persons. The decision of the sending state to retake a person on probation or parole shall be conclusive upon and not reviewable within the receiving state: Provided, however, that if at the time when a state seeks to retake a probationer or parolee there should be pending against him within the receiving state any criminal charge, or he should be suspected of having committed within such state a criminal offense, he shall not be retaken without the consent of the receiving state until discharged from prosecution or from imprisonment for such offense.
      </li>
      <li id="t47c07s47-7-71ol11b4">
       That the duly accredited officers of the sending state will be permitted to transport prisoners being retaken through any and all states parties to this compact, without interference.
      </li>
      <li id="t47c07s47-7-71ol11b5">
       That the governor of each state may designate an officer who, acting jointly with like officers of other contracting states, if and when appointed, shall promulgate such rules and regulations as may be deemed necessary to more effectively carry out the terms of this compact.
      </li>
      <li id="t47c07s47-7-71ol11b6">
       That this compact shall become operative immediately upon its execution by any state as between it and any other state or states so executing. When executed it shall have the full force and effect of law within such state, the form of execution to be in accordance with the laws of the executing state.
      </li>
      <li id="t47c07s47-7-71ol11b7">
       That this compact shall continue in force and remain binding upon each executing state until renounced by it. The duties and obligations hereunder of a renouncing state shall continue as to parolees or probationers residing therein at the time of withdrawal until retaken or finally discharged by the sending state. Renunciation of this compact shall be by the same authority which executed it, by sending six (6) months’ notice in writing of its intention to withdraw from the compact to the other state party hereto.
       <p>
        II. This section may be cited as the uniform act for out-of-state parolee supervision.

       Laws of 1981, ch. 465, § 118, which provided for the automatic repeal of provisions reenacting the Department of Corrections and the State Parole Board on June 30, 1984, was repealed by Laws of 1984, ch. 471, § 126. In turn, Laws, 1984, ch. 471, § 128, provided for the automatic repeal of these provisions from and after July 1, 1986. Subsequently, Laws of 1986, ch. 413, § 126, effective from and after passage (approved March 28, 1986), repealed Laws of 1984, ch. 471, § 128, thereby removing the repeal date.

   When a victim was raped by a parolee accepted from another state for supervision, summary judgment was correctly granted to the State in the victim’s action against it for negligently accepting supervision of the parolee and negligently supervising him because acceptance of the parolee’s supervision was mandatory under the Uniform Act for Out-of-State Parolee Supervision, Miss.

       Where a parolee was arrested in Mississippi by agreement between Mississippi and sending state, pending his being retaken by authorities of the sending state under the statute which provides that a parolee who is in receiving state by agreement between receiving and sending state may be retaken, this did not violate the parolee’s constitutional right.

   When deciding whether to accept supervision of a parolee or probationer from another state, under the Uniform Act for Out-of-State Parolee Supervision,
   Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c07s47-7-71" target="_self">47-7-71</a></cite>, it mattered not whether the probationer or parolee was actually a resident of the receiving state because the use of the conjunction “or” in §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t47c07s47-7-71ol11a" target="_self">47-7-71(1)(a)</a></cite> allowed a parolee to be sent to the receiving state if such person was a resident or had family in the receiving state.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The Governor, on behalf of this state, may execute a compact, in substantially the following form, and the Governor, on behalf of this state, may execute a compact, in substantially the following form, and the Legislature signifies in advance its approval and ratification of such compact:
     </p>
     <p>
      THE INTERSTATE COMPACT FOR ADULT OFFENDER SUPERVISION
     </p>
     <p>
      ARTICLE I PURPOSE
     </p>
     <p>
      The compacting states to this interstate compact recognize that each state is responsible for the supervision of adult offenders in the community who are authorized, pursuant to the bylaws and rules of this compact, to travel across state lines both to and from each compacting state in such a manner as to: track the location of offenders; transfer supervision authority in an orderly and efficient manner; and when necessary, return offenders to the originating jurisdictions.
     </p>
     <p>
      The compacting states also recognize that Congress, by enacting the Crime Control Act, 4 USCS Section 112 (1965), has authorized and encouraged compacts for cooperative efforts and mutual assistance in the prevention of crime.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is the purpose of this compact and the interstate commission created under this compact, through means of joint and cooperative action among the compacting states: to provide the framework for the promotion of public safety and to protect the rights of victims through the control and regulation of the interstate movement of offenders in the community; to provide for the effective tracking, supervision and rehabilitation of these offenders by the sending and receiving states; and to equitably distribute the costs, benefits and obligations of the compact among the compacting states.
     </p>
     <p>
      In addition, this compact will: create an interstate commission that will establish uniform procedures to manage the movement between states of adults placed under community supervision and released to the community under the jurisdiction of courts, paroling authorities, corrections or other criminal justice agencies that will promulgate rules to achieve the purpose of this compact; ensure an opportunity for input and timely notice to victims and to jurisdictions where defined offenders are authorized to travel or to relocate across state lines; establish a system of uniform data collection, access to information on active cases by authorized criminal justice officials, and regular reporting of compact activities to heads of state councils, state executive, judicial and legislative branches and criminal justice administrators; monitor compliance with rules governing interstate movement of offenders and initiate interventions to address and correct noncompliance; and coordinate training and education regarding regulations of interstate movement of offenders for officials involved in such activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      The compacting states recognize that there is no “right” of any offender to live in another state and that duly accredited officers of a sending state may enter a receiving state and apprehend and retake any offender under supervision subject to the provisions of this compact and bylaws and rules promulgated under the compact.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is the policy of the compacting states that the activities conducted by the interstate commission created in this compact are the formation of public policies and are therefore public business.
     </p>

     </p>
     <p>
      The compacting states create the “Interstate Commission for Adult Offender Supervision.” The interstate commission shall be a body corporate and joint agency of the compacting states. The interstate commission shall have all the responsibilities, powers and duties set forth in this compact, including the power to sue and be sued, and such additional powers as may be conferred upon it by subsequent action of the respective legislatures of the compacting states in accordance with the terms of this compact.
     </p>
     <p>
      The interstate commission shall consist of commissioners selected and appointed by resident members of a state council for interstate adult offender supervision or the Governor for each state. While each member state may determine the membership of its own state council, its membership must include at least one (1) representative from the legislative, judicial and executive branches of government, victims groups and compact administrators. The Mississippi state council will be appointed by the compact administrator. The compact administrator also may appoint additional representatives to the state council when he deems such appointments necessary. The commissioner of corrections or his designee shall serve as the compact administrator and as the state’s commissioner on the interstate commission in such capacity pursuant to applicable law of the member state. Each compacting state retains the right to determine the qualifications of the compact administrator who shall be appointed by the Governor.
     </p>
     <p>
      The commissioner of corrections shall serve as compact administrator and chairperson of the state council for interstate adult offender supervision. If the commissioner of corrections appoints a designee, the designee must be a deputy commissioner of corrections or the division director in the office of community corrections that has operational authority over the interstate compact division.
     </p>
     <p>
      The term of office for state council members shall be four (4) years. The state council shall meet at least twice a year. The state council may advise the compact administrator on participation in the interstate commission activities and administration of the compact. Members of the council are entitled to reimbursement for travel and expenses related to the interstate commission as provided by state law.
     </p>
     <p>
      In addition to appointment of its commissioner to the National Interstate Commission, each state council shall exercise oversight and advocacy concerning its participation in interstate commission activities and other duties as may be determined by each member state, including, but not limited to, development of policy concerning operations and procedures of the compact within that state.
     </p>
     <p>
      In addition to the commissioners who are the voting representatives of each state, the interstate commission shall include individuals who are not commissioners, but who are members of interested organizations; the noncommissioner members must include a member of the national organizations of governors, legislators, state chief justices, attorneys general and crime victims. All noncommissioner members of the interstate commission shall be ex officio (nonvoting) members. The interstate commission may provide in its bylaws for such additional, ex officio (nonvoting) members as it deems necessary.
     </p>
     <p>
      Each compacting state represented at any meeting of the interstate commission is entitled to one (1) vote. A majority of the compacting states constitutes a quorum for the transaction of business, unless a larger quorum is required by the bylaws of the interstate commission.
     </p>
     <p>
      The interstate commission shall meet at least once each calendar year. The chairperson may call additional meetings and, upon the request of twenty-seven (27) or more compacting states, shall call additional meetings. Public notice shall be given of all meetings and meetings shall be open to the public.
     </p>
     <p>
      The interstate commission shall establish an executive committee that shall include commission officers, members and others as determined by the bylaws. The executive committee has the power to act on behalf of the interstate commission during periods when the interstate commission is not in session, with the exception of rule-making or amendment to the compact, or both. The executive committee: oversees the day-to-day activities managed by the executive director and interstate commission staff; administers enforcement and compliance with the provisions of the compact, its bylaws and as directed by the interstate commission; and performs other duties as directed by the commission or set forth in the bylaws.

         </p>
         <p>

          Section C. Corporate Records of the Interstate Commission
         </p>
         <p>
          If the interstate commission determines that any compacting state has at any time defaulted (“defaulting state”) in the performance of any of its obligations or responsibilities under this compact, the bylaws or any duly promulgated rules, the interstate commission may impose any or all of the following penalties:
         </p>
         <p>
          Reinstatement following withdrawal of any compacting state shall occur upon the withdrawing state reenacting the compact or upon such later date as determined by the interstate commission.
         </p>
         <p>
          The withdrawing state is responsible for all assessments, obligations and liabilities incurred through the effective date of withdrawal, including any obligations, the performance of which extend beyond the effective date of withdrawal.
         </p>
         <p>
          The interstate commission shall notify the other compacting states of the withdrawing state’s intent to withdraw within sixty (60) days of its receipt of the notification.
         </p>
         <p>
          The withdrawing state shall notify immediately the chairperson of the interstate commission in writing upon the introduction of legislation repealing this compact in the withdrawing state.
         </p>
         <p>
          The effective date of withdrawal is the effective date of the repeal.
         </p>
         <p>
          Once effective, the compact shall continue in force and remain binding upon every compacting state; however, a compacting state may withdraw from the compact (“withdrawing state”) by enacting a statute specifically repealing the statute that enacted the compact into law.
         </p>
         <p>
          Amendments to the compact may be proposed by the interstate commission for enactment by the compacting states. No amendment shall become effective and binding upon the interstate commission and the compacting states unless it is enacted into law by unanimous consent of the compacting states.
         </p>
         <p>
          The compact shall become effective and binding upon legislative enactment of the compact into law by no less than thirty-five (35) of the states. The initial effective date shall be the later of July 1, 2004, or upon enactment into law by the thirty-fifth jurisdiction. Thereafter, it shall become effective and binding, as to any other compacting state, upon enactment of the compact into law by that state. The governors of nonmember states or their designees will be invited to participate in interstate commission activities on a nonvoting basis before adoption of the compact by all states and territories of the United States.
         </p>
         <p>
          Any state, as defined in Article II of this compact, is eligible to become a compacting state.
         </p>
         <p>
          The interstate commission shall keep accurate accounts of all receipts and disbursements. The receipts and disbursements of the interstate commission shall be subject to the audit and accounting procedures established under its bylaws. However, all receipts and disbursements of funds handled by the interstate commission shall be audited yearly by a certified or licensed public accountant, and the report of the audit shall be included in and become part of the annual report of the interstate commission.
         </p>
         <p>
          The interstate commission shall not incur any obligations of any kind before securing the funds adequate to meet the obligations. The interstate commission may not pledge the credit of any of the compacting states, except by and with the authority of the compacting state.
         </p>
         <p>
          The interstate commission shall levy on and collect an annual assessment from each compacting state to cover the cost of the internal operations and activities of the interstate commission and its staff, which levy must be in a total amount sufficient to cover the interstate commission’s annual budget as approved each year. The aggregate annual assessment amount shall be allocated based upon a formula to be determined by the interstate commission, taking into consideration the population of the state and the volume of interstate movement of offenders in each compacting state. The interstate commission shall promulgate a rule binding upon all compacting states which governs the assessment.
         </p>

         <p>
          The interstate commission shall enact a bylaw or promulgate a rule providing for both mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes among the compacting states.
         </p>
         <p>
          The interstate commission shall attempt to resolve any disputes or other issues that are subject to the compact and which may arise among compacting states and noncompacting states.
         </p>
         <p>
          The compacting states shall report to the interstate commission on issues or activities of concern to them and shall cooperate with and support the interstate commission in the discharge of its duties and responsibilities.
         </p>
         <p>
          The courts and executive agencies in each compacting state shall enforce this compact and shall take all actions necessary and appropriate to effectuate the compact’s purposes and intent. In any judicial or administrative proceeding in a compacting state pertaining to the subject matter of this compact which may affect the powers, responsibilities or actions of the interstate commission, the interstate commission shall be entitled to receive all service of process in any such proceeding and shall have standing to intervene in the proceeding for all purposes.
         </p>
         <p>
          The interstate commission shall oversee the interstate movement of adult offenders in the compacting states and shall monitor such activities being administered in noncompacting states which significantly may affect compacting states.
         </p>
         <p>
          Upon determination by the interstate commission that an emergency exists, the interstate commission may promulgate an emergency rule that shall become effective immediately upon adoption; however, the usual rule-making procedures provided under this compact shall be applied retroactively to that rule as soon as reasonably possible, and in no event, later than ninety (90) days after the effective date of the rule.
         </p>
         <p>
          Subjects to be addressed within twelve (12) months after the first meeting must include, at a minimum: (a) notice to victims and opportunity to be heard; (b) offender registration and compliance; (c) violations and returns; (d) transfer procedures and forms; (e) eligibility for transfer; (f) collection of restitution and fees from offenders; (g) data collection and reporting; (h) the level of supervision to be provided by the receiving state; (i) transition rules governing the operation of the compact and the interstate commission during all or part of the period between the effective date of the compact and the date on which the last eligible state adopts the compact; and (j) mediation, arbitration and dispute resolution.
         </p>
         <p>
          Not later than sixty (60) days after a rule is promulgated, any interested person may file a petition in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or in the federal district court where the interstate commission’s principal office is located for judicial review of the rule. If the court finds that the interstate commission’s action is not supported by substantial evidence (as defined in the APA) in the rule-making record, the court shall hold the rule unlawful and set it aside.
         </p>
         <p>
          When promulgating a rule, the interstate commission shall: (a) publish the proposed rule stating with particularity the text of the rule that is proposed and the reason for the proposed rule; (b) allow persons to submit written data, facts, opinions and arguments, which information shall be publicly available; (c) provide an opportunity for an informal hearing; and (d) promulgate a final rule and its effective date, if appropriate, based on the rule-making record.
         </p>
         <p>
          If a majority of the legislatures of the compacting states rejects a rule, by enactment of a statute or resolution in the same manner used to adopt the compact, then that rule shall have no further force and effect in any compacting state.
         </p>
         <p>
          All rules and amendments shall become binding as of the date specified in each rule or amendment.
         </p>
         <p>
          Rule-making shall occur pursuant to the criteria set forth in this article and the bylaws and rules adopted pursuant thereto. Such rule-making shall substantially conform to the principles of the federal Administrative Procedure Act, 5 USCS Section 551 et seq., and the Federal Advisory Committee Act, 5 USCS App. 2, Section 1 et seq., as may be amended (hereinafter “APA”).
         </p>
         <p>
          The interstate commission shall promulgate rules in order to effectively and efficiently achieve the purposes of the compact, including transition rules governing administration of the compact during the period in which it is being considered and enacted by the states.
         </p>
         <p>
          The interstate commission shall collect standardized data concerning the interstate movement of offenders as directed through its bylaws and rules, which shall specify the data to be collected, the means of collection and data exchange and reporting requirements.
         </p>
         <p>
          For every meeting closed pursuant to this provision, the interstate commission’s chief legal officer shall certify publicly that, in the legal officer’s opinion, the meeting may be closed to the public and shall reference each relevant exemptive provision. The interstate commission shall keep minutes that shall describe fully and clearly, all matters discussed in any meeting and shall provide a full and accurate summary of any actions taken and the reasons therefor, including, a description of each of the views expressed on any item and the record of any roll call vote (reflected in the vote of each member on the question). All documents considered in connection with any action shall be identified in such minutes.
         </p>
         <p>
          Public notice shall be given of all meetings and all meetings shall be open to the public, except as set forth in the rules or as otherwise provided in the compact. The interstate commission shall promulgate rules consistent with the principles contained in the “Government in Sunshine Act,” 5 USCS Section 552(b), as may be amended. The interstate commission and any of its committees may close a meeting to the public where it determines, by two-thirds (2/3) vote, that an open meeting would be likely to: (a) relate solely to the interstate commission’s internal personnel practices and procedures; (b) disclose matters specifically exempted from disclosure by statute; (c) disclosure trade secrets or commercial or financial information which is privileged or confidential; (d) involve accusing any person of a crime or formally censuring any person; (e) disclose information of a personal nature where disclosure would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy; (f) disclose investigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes; (g) disclose information contained in or related to examination, operating or condition reports prepared by, or on behalf of or for the use of, the interstate commission with respect to a regulated entity for the purpose of regulation or supervision of such entity; (h) disclose information, the premature disclosure of which would significantly endanger the life of a person or the stability of a regulated entity; (i) specifically relate to the interstate commission’s issuance of a subpoena, or its participation in a civil action or proceeding.
         </p>
         <p>
          The interstate commission’s bylaws shall establish conditions and procedures under which the interstate commission shall make its information and official records available to the public for inspection or copying. The interstate commission may exempt from disclosure any information or official records to the extent that they would adversely affect personal privacy rights or proprietary interests. In promulgating such rules, the interstate commission may make available to law enforcement agencies records and information otherwise exempt from disclosure, and may enter into agreements with law enforcement agencies to receive or exchange information or records subject to nondisclosure and confidentiality provisions.
         </p>
         <p>
          The interstate commission shall meet at least once during each calendar year. The chairperson of the interstate commission may call additional meetings at any time and, upon the request of a majority of the members, shall call additional meetings.
         </p>
         <p>
          Each member of the interstate commission has the right and power to cast a vote to which that compacting state is entitled and to participate in the business and affairs of the interstate commission. Amember shall vote in person on behalf of the state and may not delegate a vote to another member state. However, the compact administrator shall appoint another authorized representative, in the absence of the commissioner from that state, to cast a vote on behalf of the member state at a specified meeting. The bylaws may provide for members’ participation in meetings by telephone or other means of telecommunication or electronic communication. Any voting conducted by telephone or other means of telecommunication or electronic communication shall be subject to the same quorum requirements of meetings where members are present in person.
         </p>
         <p>
          Except as otherwise provided in this compact and unless a greater percentage is required by the bylaws, in order to constitute an act of the interstate commission, the act must be taken at a meeting of the interstate commission and must receive an affirmative vote of a majority of the members present.
         </p>
         <p>
          The interstate commission shall meet and take such actions as are consistent with this compact.
         </p>
         <p>
          The interstate commission shall indemnify and hold the commissioner of a compacting state, the appointed designee or employees, or the interstate commission’s representatives or employees, harmless in the amount of any settlement or judgment obtained against such persons arising out of any actual or alleged act, error or omission that occurred within the scope of interstate commission employment, duties or responsibilities, or which such persons had a reasonable basis for believing occurred within the scope of interstate commission employment, duties or responsibilities if the actual or alleged act, error or omission did not result from gross negligence or intentional wrongdoing on the part of such person.
         </p>
         <p>
          The interstate commission shall defend the commissioner of a compacting state, or the commissioner’s representatives or employees, or the interstate commission’s representatives or employees, in any civil action seeking to impose liability, arising out of any actual or alleged act, error or omission that occurred within the scope of interstate commission employment, duties or responsibilities, or which the defendant had a reasonable basis for believing occurred within the scope of interstate commission employment, duties or responsibilities if the actual or alleged act, error or omission did not result from intentional wrongdoing on the part of such person.
         </p>
         <p>
          The members, officers, executive director and employees of the interstate commission shall be immune from suit and liability, either personally or in their official capacity, for any claim for damage to or loss of property or personal injury or other civil liability caused or arising out of any actual or alleged act, error or omission that occurred within the scope of interstate commission employment, duties or responsibilities; however, nothing in this paragraph may be construed to protect any such person from suit or liability, or both, for any damage, loss, injury or liability caused by the intentional or willful and wanton misconduct of any such person.
         </p>
         <p>
          The interstate commission shall maintain its corporate books and records in accordance with the bylaws.

         </p>
         <p>
          Section D. Retaking Cases From Another Jurisdiction
         </p>
         <p>
          The duly accredited officers of a sending state may enter a receiving state and apprehend and retake any person on probation or parole according to the laws of the United States. For that purpose, the sending state must establish the authority of the officer and the identity of the person or persons to be retaken. The person or persons must be afforded a preliminary hearing consistent with due process requirements under the United States Constitution as interpreted by the Supreme Court of the United States. All legal requirements to extradition of fugitives from justice are waived expressly on the part of states that are parties to this compact as to such persons. The decision of the sending state to retake a person on probation or parole is conclusive and not reviewable within the receiving state; however, if, at the time a state seeks to retake a probationer or parolee, there is pending against him within the receiving state a criminal charge or if he is suspected of having committed within that state a criminal offense, the probationer or parolee may not be retaken without the consent of the receiving state until the probationer or parolee is discharged from prosecution or from imprisonment for such offense. The duly accredited officers of the sending state may transport prisoners being retaken through any state that is a party to this compact without interference.

           Suspension and termination of membership in the compact.

Immediate notice of suspension shall be given by the interstate commission: to the Governor, the Chief Justice or chief judicial officer of the state; the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state’s Legislature; and the state council. The grounds for default include, but are not limited to, failure of a compacting state to perform such obligations or responsibilities imposed upon it by this compact, interstate commission bylaws or duly promulgated rules. The interstate commission shall immediately notify the defaulting state in writing of the penalty imposed by the interstate commission on the defaulting state pending a cure of the default. The interstate commission shall stipulate the conditions and the time period within which the defaulting state must cure its default. If the defaulting state fails to cure the default within the time period specified by the interstate commission, in addition to any other penalties imposed, the defaulting state may be terminated from the compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the compacting states and all rights, privileges and benefits conferred by this compact shall be terminated from the effective date of suspension.

If judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of the litigation, including reasonable attorney’s fees.

     <p>
      Within sixty (60) days of the effective date of termination of a defaulting state, the interstate commission shall notify the governor, the chief justice or chief judicial officer and the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state’s legislature and the state council of such termination.
     </p>
     <p>
      The defaulting state is responsible for all assessments, obligations and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination including any obligations, the performance of which extends beyond the effective date of termination.
     </p>
     <p>
      The interstate commission shall not bear any costs relating to the defaulting state unless otherwise mutually agreed upon between the interstate commission and the defaulting state.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reinstatement following termination of any compacting state requires both a reenactment of the compact by the defaulting state and the approval of the interstate commission pursuant to the rules.
     </p>
     <p>
      The compact dissolves effective upon the date of the withdrawal or default of the compacting state which reduces membership in the compact to one (1) compacting state.
     </p>
     <p>
      Upon the dissolution of this compact, the compact becomes null and void and shall be of no further force or effect, and the business and affairs of the interstate commission shall be concluded and any surplus funds shall be distributed in accordance with the bylaws.
     </p>
     <p>
      The provisions of this compact shall be severable, and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision is deemed unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the compact shall be enforceable.
     </p>
     <p>
      The provisions of this compact shall be liberally construed to effectuate its purposes.
     </p>
     <p>
      Nothing in this compact prevents the enforcement of any other law of a compacting state which is not inconsistent with this compact.
     </p>
     <p>
      All compacting states’ laws conflicting with this compact are superseded to the extent of the conflict.
     </p>
     <p>
      All lawful actions of the interstate commission, including all rules and bylaws promulgated by the interstate commission, are binding upon the compacting states.
     </p>
     <p>
      All agreements between the interstate commission and the compacting states are binding in accordance with their terms.
     </p>
     <p>
      Upon the request of a party to a conflict over the meaning or interpretation of interstate commission actions, and upon a majority vote of the compacting states, the interstate commission may issue advisory opinions regarding such meaning or interpretation.
     </p>
     <p>
      If any provision of this compact exceeds the constitutional limits imposed on the legislature of any compacting state, the obligations, duties, powers or jurisdiction sought to be conferred by such provision upon the interstate commission shall be ineffective, and such obligations, duties, powers or jurisdiction shall remain in the compacting state and shall be exercised by the agency of that state to which the obligations, duties, powers or jurisdiction are delegated by law in effect at the time this compact becomes effective.
