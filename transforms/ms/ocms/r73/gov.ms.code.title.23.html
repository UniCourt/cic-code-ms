      <p>
       The effective date of the bill that amended this section, Chapter 526, Laws of 2012 (House Bill No. 921), is “from and after the date it is effectuated under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, as amended and extended.” However, after the bill was submitted to the United States Attorney General under Section 5, the United States Supreme Court, in the case of
       <i>
        Shelby County v. Holder
       </i>
       (June 25, 2013), struck down the coverage formula that determined what jurisdictions are subject to Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, so the coverage formula can no longer be used as a basis for subjecting jurisdictions to preclearance under Section 5.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because of the
       <i>
        Shelby County
       </i>
       decision, the United States Attorney General is not making any determinations under Section 5 on voting or election changes made by states.
   The Supreme Court did not strike down Section 5, so it is still in effect.
   Chapter 526 was submitted to the United States Attorney General before the
       <i>
        Shelby County
       </i>
       decision was rendered.
   In a letter dated August 5, 2013, the United States Attorney General responded that he is not making determinations on the merits of any bill that is submitted under Section 5.
   The submission of Chapter 526 and the response from the United States Attorney General technically met the requirements of Section 5 and fulfilled the condition in the effective date of Chapter 526, so Chapter 526 became effective on the date of the response letter from the United States Attorney General, August 5, 2013.

      </h4>
      <p>
       Pursuant to
   Section 1-1-109, the Joint Legislative Committee on Compilation, Revision and Publication of Legislation corrected a typographical error in the second sentence. The words “not less then thirty (30)” were changed to “not less than thirty (30)”. The Joint Committee ratified the correction at its April, 28, 1999 meeting.
      </p>
      <p>
       This section was amended by Section 1 of Chapter 517, Laws of 2012, approved May 2, 2012, and effective from and after the date it is effectuated under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, as amended and extended (November 26, 2012). The section was also amended by Section 4 of Chapter 526, Laws of 2012, approved May 17, 2012, and effective from and after the date it is effectuated under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, as amended and extended (August 5, 2013).
   Section 1-1-109 gives the Joint Legislative Committee on Compilation, Revision and Publication of Legislation authority to integrate amendments so that all versions of the same code section enacted within the same legislative session may become effective. The Joint Committee on Compilation, Revision and Publication of Legislation ratified the integration of these amendments, contingent upon preclearance, as consistent with the legislative intent at the August 16, 2012, meeting of the Committee.

        Editor’s Notes —

      </h4>
      <p>
       The United States Attorney General, by letter dated June 11, 1997, interposed no objection under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, to the amendment of this section by
   Laws of 1997, ch. 315, § 1.
      </p>
      <p>
       On August 11, 2000, the United States Attorney General interposed no objection under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to the amendment of this section by
   Laws of 2000, ch. 430.
      </p>
      <p>
       The effective date of the bill that amended this section, Chapter 526, Laws of 2012 (House Bill No. 921), is “from and after the date it is effectuated under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, as amended and extended.”
   However, after the bill was submitted to the United States Attorney General under Section 5, the United States Supreme Court, in the case of
       <i>
        Shelby County v. Holder
       </i>
       (June 25, 2013), struck down the coverage formula that determined what jurisdictions are subject to Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, so the coverage formula can no longer be used as a basis for subjecting jurisdictions to preclearance under Section 5.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because of the
       <i>
        Shelby County
       </i>
       decision, the United States Attorney General is not making any determinations under Section 5 on voting or election changes made by states.
   The Supreme Court did not strike down Section 5, so it is still in effect.
   Chapter 526 was submitted to the United States Attorney General before the
       <i>
        Shelby County
       </i>
       decision was rendered.
   In a letter dated August 5, 2013, the United States Attorney General responded that he is not making determinations on the merits of any bill that is submitted under Section 5.
   The submission of Chapter 526 and the response from the United States Attorney General technically met the requirements of Section 5 and fulfilled the condition in the effective date of Chapter 526, so Chapter 526 became effective on the date of the response letter from the United States Attorney General, August 5, 2013.
      </p>
      <p>
       By letter dated November 26, 2012, the United States Attorney General interposed no objection under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, as amended and extended, to the amendment of this section by
   Laws of 2012, ch. 517.

        Amendment Notes —

      </h4>
      <p>
       The 2000 amendment deleted “in the supervisor’s district or” following the third occurrence of “(30) days” and substituted “pursuant to Section 23-15-33” for “by an officer of this state under the laws thereof.”
      </p>
      <p>
       The 2008 amendment, in the first sentence, substituted “except persons adjudicated to be non compos mentis” for “except idiots and insane persons” and “incorporated municipality” for “incorporated city or town”; in the last sentence, substituted “those specified in this section” for “those above included”; substituted “seeks to vote” for “offers to vote” throughout; and made minor stylistic changes.
      </p>
      <p>
       The first 2012 amendment (ch. 517), inserted “of vote fraud or” following “never been convicted” near the end of the first sentence.
      </p>
      <p>
       The second 2012 amendment (ch. 526), added “upon compliance with Section 23-15-563” at the end of the first sentence.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 2017 amendment added the second sentence; and made gender neutral changes.

   Public interest exception to mootness did not apply to an unsuccessful candidate’s election challenge where although Miss.

Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t23c15s23-15-249" target="_self">23-15-249</a></cite>. Perkins v. McAdams, 234 So.3d 413, 2017 Miss. LEXIS 419 (Miss. 2017).

       Absentee ballot could not be counted in a primary election because the voter failed to register more than 30 days prior to the election. Smith v. Hollins, 905 So. 2d 1267, 2005 Miss. LEXIS 388 (Miss. 2005).
      </p>

       Provisions in Mississippi Election Code pertaining to registration of voters do not violate § 2 of the Voting Rights Act (42 USCS § 1973(a)) simply because there might be better registration procedures which could be enacted into law. Mississippi State Chapter, Operation Push v. Mabus, 717 F. Supp. 1189, 1989 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9930 (N.D. Miss. 1989), aff'd, 932 F.2d 400, 1991 U.S. App. LEXIS 10878 (5th Cir. Miss. 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       Mississippi’s voter registration laws are clearly a voting qualification or prerequisites to voting, under language of § 2, as amended, 42 USCS § 1973(a), because no voter is qualified as elector until he is first registered. Mississippi State Chapter, Operation Push v. Allain, 674 F. Supp. 1245, 1987 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10925 (N.D. Miss. 1987).

       Whereas instances of racially polarized voting are pertinent in challenges to electoral processes, voting behavior or practices are not germaine to challenged voter registration procedures or to determination of discriminatory impact of registration practices. Racial appeals in campaigns for elections bear little relevance to state’s registration procedures. Mississippi State Chapter, Operation Push v. Allain, 674 F. Supp. 1245, 1987 U.S. Dist.

       The corresponding section of the Code 1892, in so far as it requires voters at municipal elections to vote in the wards of their residence, is constitutional and warranted by § 245 of the Constitution, empowering the legislature to impose qualifications additional to those provided by §§ 241, 242 of the Constitution.

       The mistaken belief that one has in due time paid “all taxes legally required of him,” however honestly obtained, will not relieve a delinquent of the effect of his failure to secure the privilege of an elector by complying with the requirements of § 241 of the Constitution; Nor will the subsequent payment of the same relieve him of the delinquency.

   For purposes of § 4(a) of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (42 USCS § 1973b(a) [now 52 USCS § 10303]), pertaining to reinstatement of state voting registration tests, the fact that a county has administered voting registration laws in a fair and impartial manner and has recently made significant strides toward equalizing and integrating its school system will not warrant reinstatement of the literacy test for the county’s voters, where (1) the county throughout the years, systematically deprived its black citizens of the educational opportunities that it granted its white citizens, and (2) impartial administration of the literacy test would serve only to perpetuate these inequities in a different form. Gaston County v. United States, <cite class="us_code">395 U.S. 285</cite>, <cite class="s_court">89 S. Ct. 1720</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">23 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 309, 1969 U.S. LEXIS 1437 (U.S. 1969).

       <p>
   On direct appeal to the United States Supreme Court from a decision of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, in an action by a county seeking reinstatement of a literacy test for voters, the District Court’s finding that the county has not met its burden of proving, as required by § 4(a) of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (42 USCS § 1973b(a) [now 52 USCS § 10303]), that the use of the literacy test did not discriminatorily deprive Negroes of the right to vote, will not be held clearly erroneous where (1) evidence was presented that the county’s segregated Negro schools and their teachers were inferior and that Negro citizens of the county had completed far less schooling than whites, and (2) it could be inferred that among Negro children compelled to endure a segregated and inferior education, fewer would achieve any given degree of literacy than would be so with their better educated white contemporaries, and that the county’s inferior Negro schools provided many of its Negro residents with an inferior education and gave many others no incentive to enter or remain in school. Gaston County v. United States, <cite class="us_code">395 U.S. 285</cite>, <cite class="s_court">89 S. Ct. 1720</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">23 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 309, 1969 U.S. LEXIS 1437 (U.S. 1969).

   A Negro citizen, originally denied the right to register because of discrimination, subsequently registered pursuant to a federal court order, who would be denied the right to vote in municipal elections for failure to pay poll taxes as required by law and because her registration took place after the legal deadline, has standing to bring a class action on behalf of all the Negro voters similarly situated to enjoin the election, and where the Federal District Court refused to grant the injunction the cause was remanded with directions to set aside the election which was held, to devise a plan for a new election, set a new cut-off date for registration, and to provide that persons otherwise entitled to vote should not be denied that right for failure to pay poll taxes if required taxes were tendered to tax collector within 45 days prior to election. Hamer v. Campbell, 358 F.2d 215, 1966 U.S. App. LEXIS 6896 (5th Cir. Miss.), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">385 U.S. 851</cite>, <cite class="s_court">87 S.

       The 2017 amendment deleted (1), which read: “Any person who shall knowingly procure his or any other person’s registration as a qualified elector when the person whose registration is being procured is not entitled to be registered, or when the person whose registration is being procured is being registered under a false name, or when the person whose registration is being procured is being registered as a qualified elector in any other voting precinct than that in which he resides, shall be guilty of a felony and, upon conviction, be fined not more than Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000.00) or imprisoned not more than five (5) years, or both. The same penalty shall apply to anyone who is disqualified for any cause and shall reregister before removal of such disqualification to avoid the same, and to all who shall in any way aid in such false registration”; deleted the subsection (2) designation; inserted “as provided in Section 97-13-25”; and made minor stylistic changes.

       The 2017 amendment rewrote the section, which read: “Any person who has been convicted of vote fraud or of any crime listed in Section 241, Mississippi Constitution of 1890, shall not be registered, or if registered the name of the person shall be erased from the registration book on which it may be found by the registrar or by the election commissioners. Whenever any person shall be convicted in the circuit court of his county of any of those crimes, the registrar shall thereupon erase his name from the registration book; and whenever any person shall be convicted of any of those crimes in any other court of any county, the presiding judge of the court shall, on demand, certify the fact in writing to the registrar, who shall thereupon erase the name of the person from the registration book and file the certificate as a record of his office.”

   A felon’s due process claim to a pre-disenfranchisement hearing was without merit as a matter of law and summary judgment was properly granted on such issue, where to mandate a hearing as a prerequisite to any action by the election board would cost the state substantial time and money, and it would not guarantee, any more than the current mechanism, that only felons within §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t23c05s23-5-35" target="_self">23-5-35</a></cite> are disenfranchised.

       Allegations that because of the interrelationship between the racial restrictions of the Mississippi voter qualification laws and requirements with respect to the selection of grand and petit jurors a defendant would be denied his equal civil rights to trial by a jury free from exclusion were insufficient to justify the removal to the federal courts of the trial of a Negro charged with the crime of rape.

   State election commissioners have power, authority, and responsibility to help administer voter registration laws by formulating rules for the various tests applied to applicants for registration, and for the reason that these rules and tests are vitally important elements of Mississippi laws challenged in an action brought by the United States to end discrimination in voter registration, the commissioners should not have been stricken as parties defendants to the action on the ground that they lacked sufficient interest in administering or enforcing the challenged laws.

       Plaintiffs who showed that challenged statutes either impinged upon their protected rights to register to vote or burdened organizational efforts to assist prospective voters in registering had standing to sue to challenge Mississippi’s dual registration requirement and prohibition on satellite registration as violative of their rights and all persons similarly situated. Mississippi State Chapter, Operation Push v. Allain, 674 F. Supp. 1245, 1987 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10925 (N.D. Miss. 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       Based on totality of circumstances, proof showed by preponderance of evidence that Mississippi’s dual registration requirement and statutory prohibition on removing voter registration books from circuit clerk’s office resulted in denial or abridgement of right of black citizens in Mississippi to vote and participate in electorial process. Mississippi State Chapter, Operation Push v. Allain, 674 F. Supp. 1245, 1987 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10925 (N.D. Miss. 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       No legitimate or compelling state interest is served by failure of state to mandate uniform, state-wide method of satellite registration; all circuit clerks should make arrangements to conduct satellite registration at no less than three voting precincts in each of five supervisory districts within their respective counties for at least one full day within 12 months of each election of state wide officials. Mississippi State Chapter, Operation Push v. Allain, 674 F. Supp. 1245, 1987 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10925 (N.D. Miss. 1987).

       Whereas instances of racially polarized voting are pertinent in challenges to electoral processes, voting behavior or practices are not germaine to challenged voter registration procedures or to determination of discriminatory impact of registration practices. Racial appeals in campaigns for elections bear little relevance to state’s registration procedures. Mississippi State Chapter, Operation Push v. Allain, 674 F. Supp. 1245, 1987 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10925 (N.D. Miss. 1987).

       Provisions in Mississippi Election Code pertaining to registration of voters do not violate § 2 of the Voting Rights Act (42 USCS § 1973(a)) simply because there might be better registration procedures which could be enacted into law. Mississippi State Chapter, Operation Push v. Mabus, 717 F. Supp. 1189, 1989 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9930 (N.D. Miss. 1989), aff'd, 932 F.2d 400, 1991 U.S. App. LEXIS 10878 (5th Cir. Miss. 1991).

   State election commissioners have power, authority, and responsibility to help administer voter registration laws by formulating rules for the various tests applied to applicants for registration, and for the reason that these rules and tests are vitally important elements of Mississippi laws challenged in an action brought by the United States to end discrimination in voter registration, the commissioners should not have been stricken as parties defendants to the action on the ground that they lacked sufficient interest in administering or enforcing the challenged laws.

       Where the court found that substantially all of the eligible white voters in Walthall County had been registered without being required to submit to any of the onerous tests or requirements imposed by the state statute, the county registrar, in registering Negro applicants, was enjoined not to use as a prerequisite to registration any requirements for qualification which had not theretofore been used with respect to the registration of white applicants.

      The pollbook of each voting precinct shall designate the voting precinct for which it is to be used, and shall be ruled in appropriate columns, with printed or written headings, as follows: date of registration; voter registration number; name of electors; date of birth; and a number of blank columns for the dates of elections. All qualified applicants who register with the registrar shall be entered in the Statewide Elections Management System. Only the names of those qualified applicants who register within thirty (30) days before an election shall appear on the pollbooks of the election; however, if the thirtieth day to register before an election falls on a Sunday or legal holiday, the registration applications submitted on the business day immediately following the legal holiday shall be accepted and entered in the Statewide Elections Management System for the purpose of enabling voters to vote in the next election. When county election commissioners determine that any elector is disqualified from voting, by reason of death, conviction of a disenfranchising crime, removal from the jurisdiction, or other legal cause, that fact shall be noted in the Statewide Elections Management System and the voter’s name shall be removed from the Statewide Elections Management System, the state’s voter roll and the county’s pollbooks. Nothing in this section shall preclude the use of electronic pollbooks.

       The 2006 amendment, in the first sentence, deleted “have printed or written at the top of each page words to” preceding “designate the voting precinct for,” and inserted “voter registration number” following “date of registration”; and added the last sentence.

       The 2010 amendment added “Except as otherwise provided in Section 23-15-692” at the beginning of the second sentence.

       The 2017 amendment, effective April 18, 2017, rewrote the section, which read: “The pollbook of each voting precinct shall designate the voting precinct for which it is to be used, and shall be ruled in appropriate columns, with printed or written headings, as follows: date of registration; voter registration number; name of electors; date of birth; and a number of blank columns for the dates of elections. Except as otherwise provided in Section 23-15-692, all who register within thirty (30) days before any regular election shall be entered on the pollbooks immediately after such election, and not before, so that the pollbooks will show only the names of those qualified to vote at such election. When election commissioners determine that any elector is disqualified from voting, by reason of removal from the supervisors district, or other cause, that fact shall be noted on the registration book and his name shall be erased from the pollbook.

       The effective date of the bill that amended this section, Chapter 526, Laws of 2012 (House Bill No. 921), is “from and after the date it is effectuated under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, as amended and extended.”
   However, after the bill was submitted to the United States Attorney General under Section 5, the United States Supreme Court, in the case of
       <i>
        Shelby County v. Holder
       </i>
       (June 25, 2013), struck down the coverage formula that determined what jurisdictions are subject to Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, so the coverage formula can no longer be used as a basis for subjecting jurisdictions to preclearance under Section 5.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because of the
       <i>
        Shelby County
       </i>
       decision, the United States Attorney General is not making any determinations under Section 5 on voting or election changes made by states.
   The Supreme Court did not strike down Section 5, so it is still in effect.
   Chapter 526 was submitted to the United States Attorney General before the
       <i>
        Shelby County
       </i>
       decision was rendered.
   In a letter dated August 5, 2013, the United States Attorney General responded that he is not making determinations on the merits of any bill that is submitted under Section 5.
   The submission of Chapter 526 and the response from the United States Attorney General technically met the requirements of Section 5 and fulfilled the condition in the effective date of Chapter 526, so Chapter 526 became effective on the date of the response letter from the United States Attorney General, August 5, 2013.

       The Registrar would be the appropriate official to transfer the names of registered voters to a newly established automated voter registration system. 1992 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 957.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no apparent legal authority that would allow registration books and pollbooks to be kept and maintained in place other than office of circuit clerk/registrar except when pollbooks are being used in conduct of election. 1992 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 931.
      </p>
      <p>
       County registrar is “certifying official” for purpose of certifying number of signatures of qualified electors on petitions calling for election pursuant to particular statute as well as on nominating petitions for candidates for public offices. 1993 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 644.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any and all requests for access to or copies of county voter registration records must be made to the county registrar, and it is the duty and responsibility of the county registrar to insure that voters’ social security numbers, telephone numbers, and dates of birth and age information are excluded prior to granting access or providing copies of such records. 2000 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 112.
      </p>
      <p>
       The practice of boards of supervisors to seek certification from their respective county circuit clerks as to the number of signatures of qualified electors appearing on such petitions prior to the adjudication of the sufficiency of those petitions is, in most if not all cases, necessary to protect the integrity of the process, since circuit clerks are the custodians of the registration records.
   2000 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 216.
      </p>
      <p>
       Each circuit clerk is responsible for making available public records of his office when properly requested. Information such as social security numbers, telephone numbers, dates of birth and age information must be erased or removed from such records before they are made available to the public. There is no specific statutory direction on the manner in which such information is to be removed. 2003 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 555.
      </p>
      <p>
       Each county registrar must use sound discretion in determining whether the chairman of the election commission should be the only one other than the registrar to have a key to the room where voter registration records are stored. Reasonable hours of access to the room would be established by the circuit clerk, in his or her discretion. 2005 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 378.

       This section was amended by Section 12 of Chapter 574, Laws of 2006, and Section 1 of Chapter 585, Laws of 2006. Both chapters required submission to the United States Attorney General for preclearance under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Chapter 574 received preclearance on June 5, 2006. There are no records indicating that Chapter 585 was submitted to or precleared by the U.S. Attorney General, so Chapter 585 was never given effect. The version of the section that appeared in the Code, and that was repealed by Section 189 of Chapter 441, Laws of 2017, reflected the language of Section 12 of Chapter 574, Laws of 2006, effective June 5, 2006.

     <p>
      The circuit clerk of each county is authorized and directed to prepare and keep in his or her office a full and complete list, in alphabetical order, of persons convicted of voter fraud or of any crime listed in Section 241, Mississippi Constitution of 1890. A certified copy of any enrollment by one clerk to another will be sufficient authority for the enrollment of the name, or names, in another county. A list of persons convicted of voter fraud, any crime listed in Section 241, Mississippi Constitution of 1890, or any crime interpreted as disenfranchising in later Attorney General opinions, shall also be entered into the Statewide Elections Management System on a quarterly basis. Voters who have been convicted in a Mississippi state court of any disenfranchising crime are not qualified electors as defined by Section 23-15-11 and shall be purged or otherwise removed by the county registrar or county election commissioners from the Statewide Elections Management System.

       “SECTION 20.

      </h4>
      <p>
       The 2012 amendment inserted “vote fraud or of” following “convicted” in the first and second sentences and made minor stylistic changes throughout.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 2017 amendment, in the fist sentence, substituted “voter fraud” for “vote fraud”; deleted the former second through fourth sentences, which read: “The clerk shall enter the names of all persons who have been or shall be hereafter convicted of vote fraud or of any crime listed in Section 241, Mississippi Constitution of 1890, in a book prepared and kept for that purpose. The board of supervisors of each county shall, as early as practicable, furnish the circuit clerk of their county with a suitable book for the enrollment of those names showing the name, date of birth, address, court, crime and date of conviction. The roll, when so prepared, shall be compared with the registration book before each election commissioner of the county”; added the last two sentences; and made a gender neutral change.

      </p>
      <p>
       This section was amended by two bills in 2013. The effective date of each of the two bills that amended this section, Chapter 413, Laws of 2013 (Senate Bill No. 2238) and Chapter 456, Laws of 2013 (Senate Bill No. 2311), is “from and after the date it is effectuated under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, as amended and extended.”
   However, after the bills were approved, the United States Supreme Court, in the case of
       <i>
        Shelby County v. Holder
       </i>
       (June 25, 2013), struck down the coverage formula that determined what jurisdictions are subject to Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, so the coverage formula can no longer be used as a basis for subjecting jurisdictions to preclearance under Section 5.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because of the
       <i>
        Shelby County
       </i>
       decision, the United States Attorney General is not making any determinations under Section 5 on voting or election changes made by states.
   The Supreme Court did not strike down Section 5, so it is still in effect.
   Chapter 413 was submitted to the United States Attorney General before the
       <i>
        Shelby County
       </i>
       decision was rendered.
   In a letter dated July 9, 2013, the United States Attorney General responded that he is not making determinations on the merits of any bill that is submitted under Section 5.
   The submission of Chapter 413 and the response from the United States Attorney General technically met the requirements of Section 5 and fulfilled the condition in the effective date of Chapter 413, so Chapter 413 became effective on the date of the response letter from the United States Attorney General, July 9, 2013.
      </p>
      <p>
       Chapter 456 was not submitted before the
       <i>
        Shelby County
       </i>
       decision, but the Mississippi Attorney General’s Office submitted Chapter 456 to the United States Attorney General in order to technically meet the requirements of Section 5 and fulfill the condition in the effective date of the bill, which will allow the bill to take effect.
      </p>
      <p>
       By letter dated July 18, 2013, the United States Attorney General responded that he is not making determinations on the merits of any bill that is submitted under Section 5. The submission of Chapter 456 and the response from the United States Attorney General technically met the requirements of Section 5 and fulfilled the condition in the effective date of Chapter 456, so Chapter 456 became effective from and after July 18, 2013, the date of the United States Attorney General’s response letter. The Joint Committee on Compilation, Revision and Publication of Legislation, in its meeting on August 1, 2013, voted to integrate the amendments to this section by Chapter 413 and Chapter 456.

       Individual commissioners may perform preliminary work of identifying those individuals who have died, moved away or otherwise have become disqualified as voters without quorum of commissioners present; however, official act of removing names of those individuals who have, as matter of fact, become disqualified, must be taken by commission as whole or quorum thereof. 1990 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 89.
      </p>
      <p>
       Statute which provides per diem for commissioners contemplates that commission as whole be in session; however, if commission determines that in order to fulfill its’ statutory responsibilities it is necessary for individual commissioners to work when quorum is not present and county board of supervisors authorizes compensation for such work, individual commissioners would be entitled to compensation for such work. 1990 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 89.
      </p>
      <p>
       Municipal election commissioners are required to meet on schedule set forth in statute as there are no specific statutory provisions setting forth dates that municipal election commissioners must meet. 1990 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 572.
      </p>
      <p>
       Commissioners are to be paid per diem for any day in which they are engaged in statutory duties (revising registration books and pollbooks or conducting election), regardless of amount of time they actually work. 1991 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 48.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once county election commission has made factual determination that voter has “removed” himself from his county of registration, commission has statutory duty and obligation to remove that voter’s name from registration books and pollbooks, regardless of whether voter has signed cancellation form or registered in another county or state. 1991 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 455.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no apparent authority for county board of supervisors to compensate individual members of party executive committee for the work they perform for their party, including holding primary elections in place of county election commissioners. 1992 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 549.
      </p>

      <p>
       Commissioner who works five or more hours in one day is paid $70.00 for that day with no carry over of any hours worked in excess of five hours, but commissioner may carry over hours if he works less than five hours on any particular day so that hours carried over would be added to hours of less than five worked on other days until a total of five hours is accumulated. 1993 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 496.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no requirement that election commission or executive committees actually be in session and present with Registrar in order for Registrar to perform ministerial tasks and be entitled to appropriate compensation. 1993 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 575.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 23-15-153 applies to Municipal Voting Rolls in that same procedures may be employed to purge Municipal Voting Rolls. 1993 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 593.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no United States Department of Justice requirement that must be made regarding purging of municipal voter rolls; proper guidelines to follow are found in Section 23-15-153. 1993 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 593.
      </p>
      <p>
       Municipalities can purge the voter rolls based on returned mass mailings unless federal election law applies. Exum-1998 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 149.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any and all requests for access to or copies of county voter registration records must be made to the county registrar, and it is the duty and responsibility of the county registrar to insure that voters’ social security numbers, telephone numbers, and dates of birth and age information are excluded prior to granting access or providing copies of such records. 2000 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 112.
      </p>
      <p>
       The purging duties of county election commissioners are subject to an annual limitation regardless of the number of regularly scheduled primary or general elections; they would be entitled to additional days for purging only for special elections except those conducted on the regular special election day in November; therefore, for purposes of compensation of county election commissioners for their purging duties, primary and general elections are not separate events in the sense that would entitle commissioners to compensation in excess of the stated annual limitation on days.
   2000 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 594.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (4) does not encompass primary elections because county election commissioners have no duties in the conduct of primaries.
   2000 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 594.
      </p>
      <p>
       The revision of the poll books for a primary election would entitle a county election commissioner to be compensated pursuant to subsection (2) subject to the annual limitation specified therein.
   2000 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 594.
      </p>
      <p>
       A per diem may be earned in one of two ways: first, a period of not less than five hours during a particular day would entitle a commissioner to a per diem; second, a period of less than five hours worked during a particular day may be carried forward and added to other periods of less than five hours. Once a total of five hours is accumulated over a period of two or more days, the commissioner would also be entitled to a per diem. 2000 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 594.

       Any per diem earned for work in connection with revising primary election poll books will count against the annual limitation set forth in subsection (2); and, no per diem pursuant to subsection (4) can be earned with regard to a primary election because county election commissioners have no duties in the conduct of primaries.
   2000 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 594.
      </p>
      <p>
       A registrar must be actually employed in assisting election commissioners or party executive committees, either personally or through a deputy, for a minimum of five hours during a day or for a minimum of five hours accumulated over two or more days in order to claim a per diem; if a registrar, either personally or through a deputy, is actually employed in assisting both the democratic and republican executive committees for the requisite period during the same day, he or she would be entitled to claim two per diems. 2000 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 667.
      </p>
      <p>
       The number of per diem days county election commissioners may lawfully claim is that prescribed by House Bill 685 based on the population figures of the 2000 federal decennial census, provided that all hours worked are actually required, performed, and documented as required by law; there is no requirement to pro-rate the number of days for calendar year 2001 between the “old law” and the “new law.” 2001 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 598.
      </p>
      <p>
       The statute as it read on April 17, 2001 controlled as to the number of per diem days county election commissioners could lawfully claim, and House Bill 685 did not grant any additional days for the April 17 flag referendum or any other election conducted prior to June 13, 2001. 2001 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 598.
      </p>
      <p>
       County election commissioners were entitled to claim per diem days for revising the registration books and pollbooks during calendar year 2001 up to the maximum number authorized by House Bill 685 even though the new law only became effective on June 13, 2001, provided that such purging was necessary and the work was performed and documented as required by law. 2001 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 598.
      </p>
      <p>
       Performing one or more of various duties, such as training poll workers, appointing poll workers, distributing ballot boxes, having ballots printed, distributing ballots, and/or receiving and canvassing election returns, in connection with primary elections does not constitute performing official duties of a county election commission for which per diem is authorized pursuant to the statute. 2001 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 638.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Election Commissioners Association of Mississippi can lawfully sponsor one or more training events for its members, and election commissioners attending a training event sponsored by the association are entitled to receive a per diem provided a training certificate from the association is received and provided the six day limit is not exceeded. 2002 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 26.
      </p>
      <p>
       Individual election commissioners may be employed on a part-time basis by the board of supervisors to perform redistricting tasks provided the board determines, consistent with the facts that (1) the work involved is not required to be performed by the registrar or deputy registrar; and (2) the work is over and above the regular statutory duties of the election commissioners. Martin, Jr., 2002 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 326.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no authority for a county board of supervisors to election commission members for redistricting work over and above their regular “purging” duties. 2003 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 96.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even in the absence of a book listing persons who have been convicted of disqualifying crimes, the election commission is still responsible under subsection (1) of this section for removing disenfranchised felons from the voter rolls from other sources, such as the docket book in the Attorney General’s office. Also, under
   23-15-19, the circuit clerk as county registrar is required to erase from the registration records the name of any person convicted of any disenfranchising crime. 2003 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 555.
      </p>
      <p>
       With the exception of removing names of persons convicted of disqualifying crimes from the registration records by the circuit clerk, the election commission has sole authority for maintaining and purging the voter roll. 2003 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 555.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is nothing that allows a county board of supervisors to authorize per diem for election commissioners for days in excess of that provided for by this section. The mandate of the court for a hand recount of ballots must be met even if it means working beyond normal hours each of the remaining days. 2004 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 594.
      </p>
      <p>
       Failure of a municipal election commission to properly purge registration books and poll books in accordance with Section 23-15-153 could result in the fraudulent use of the names of deceased voters or voters who have been otherwise disqualified to cast illegal votes which could affect the validity of the election. 2005 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 129.
      </p>
      <p>
       Each county registrar must use sound discretion in determining whether the chairman of the election commission should be the only one other than the registrar to have a key to the room where voter registration records are stored. Reasonable hours of access to the room would be established by the circuit clerk, in his or her discretion. 2005 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 378.
      </p>
      <p>
       The work necessitated by municipal redistricting is not a part of the regular duties of municipal election commissioners. Therefore,
   the municipal governing authorities may employ and compensate individual county election commissioners or they may employ and compensate individual municipal election commissioners to perform such work. 2005 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 414.
      </p>
      <p>
       Individual county election commissioners are entitled to per diem compensation pursuant to Section 23-15-153 for conducting demonstrations of Diebold voting machines. 2006 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 65.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no statutory mandate as to where the election commission must meet to conduct other than official business; however, notice of any meeting that is not at a place and time specified by statute to conduct official business or discuss matters that may lead to the formulation of public policy must be given and the meeting must held in accordance with the State Open Meetings law. 2006 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 196.
      </p>
      <p>
       Governing authorities may lawfully set the compensation of municipal election commissioners at the same rate and within the guidelines established by Section 23-15-153 for county election commissioners. 2006 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 455.
      </p>
      <p>
       A county election commission may continue to purge names from the registration books and poll books within 90 days of a regularly scheduled primary or general election with the exception that any program the purpose of which is to systematically remove the names of ineligible voters based on residency must be completed prior to 90 days prior to a regularly scheduled primary or general election. 2006 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 620.
      </p>
      <p>
       The minutes of a county election commission should be available as a public record in the office of the circuit clerk. 2006 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 620.

      <p>
       The commissioners of election of each county have the duty under this section [Code 1942, § 3239] to erase the names of all persons erroneously registered. United States v. Ramsey, 331 F.2d 824, 1964 U.S. App. LEXIS 6291 (5th Cir. Miss. 1964).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section [Code 1942, § 3239] is directory and not mandatory and in the absence of prejudice or fraud, a meeting three days before a bond issue election will be sufficiently effective. Tedder v. Board of Sup'rs, 214 Miss. 717, 59 So. 2d 329, 1952 Miss. LEXIS 512 (Miss. 1952).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the election commissioners certified to the Board of Supervisors the essential matters necessary for the issuance of bonds of a school district, and had determined all the jurisdictional facts essential to the validity of the election, and the Board of Supervisors had found all the jurisdictional facts essential to the issuance of the bonds and had directed their issuance and validation, dependency of the mandamus suit in circuit court based on the claim that the election commissioners had unlawfully changed the registration books after they had met and revised the election rolls, was no bar to a validation proceeding in chancery court, where no appeal was taken from the order of the Board of Supervisors to the circuit court, a mandamus suit being no substitute for the appeal provided by law. In re Validation of Bonds, 185 Miss. 864, 188 So. 318, 1939 Miss. LEXIS 168 (Miss. 1939).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where election commissioners met for purpose of revising registration and poll books, notation “transferred to [another election district]” made on poll book opposite names of voters held ineffective as an adjudication that they were disqualified as electors. Carver v. State, 177 Miss. 54, 170 So. 643, 1936 Miss. LEXIS 244 (Miss. 1936). But see Wade v. Williams, 517 So. 2d 573, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2971 (Miss. 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       Mandamus did not lie to require county election commissioners to restore name erased from registration books on ground petitioner had become disqualified as elector. Calvert v. Crosby, 163 Miss. 177, 139 So. 608, 1932 Miss. LEXIS 25 (Miss. 1932).
      </p>
      <p>
       Remedy of elector whose name is erased from registration books is to apply for reregistration and, on denial thereof, appeal to board of election commissioners, and, if necessary, to circuit court. Calvert v. Crosby, 163 Miss. 177, 139 So. 608, 1932 Miss. LEXIS 25 (Miss. 1932).

     </h3>
     <p>
      The purposes of this subarticle are:
     </p>
     <p>
      To establish a centralized statewide qualified voter file that consists of all qualified electors who are registered to vote;
     </p>
     <p>
      To enhance the uniformity of the administration of elections by creating and maintaining a centralized statewide file of qualified voters;
     </p>
     <p>
      To increase the efficiency and decrease the cost of maintaining voter registration records and implementing the National Voter Registration Act of 1993;
     </p>
     <p>
      To increase the integrity of the voting process by compiling a single centralized qualified voter file from county voter roll data that will permit the name of each citizen of this state to appear only once;
     </p>

       On July 28, 2000, the United States Attorney General interposed no objection under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to the amendment of this section by
   Laws of 2000, ch. 592.

       By letter dated August 4, 2009, the United States Attorney General interposed no objection under Section 5 of the Voting Rights
   Act of 1965 to the amendment of this section by
   Laws, 2009, ch. 437, § 1.

       There is an error in this section as it was amended by § 38 of Chapter 441. The act set the section out in two tiers, one effective until January 1, 2028, and the other effective from and after January 1, 2032, leaving a gap between January 1, 2028, and January 1, 2032.

       The United States Attorney General interposed no objection to the amendment by Laws of 1989, ch. 483, § 1.
      </p>
      <p>
       The United States Attorney General interposed no objection under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, to the amendment of this section by Laws of 1991, ch. 613, § 1, on August 14, 1991.
      </p>
      <p>
       The United States Attorney General, by letter dated June 9, 2003, interposed no objection under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to the amendment of this section by Laws of 2003, ch. 447, § 1.
      </p>
      <p>
       The effective date of Chapter 474, Laws of 2013, which amended this section, is “from and after the date it is effectuated under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, as amended and extended.” However, after the bill was approved, the United States Supreme Court, in the case of
       <i>
        Shelby County v. Holder
       </i>
       (June 25, 2013), struck down the coverage formula that determined what jurisdictions are subject to Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, so the coverage formula can no longer be used as a basis for subjecting jurisdictions to preclearance under Section 5.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because of the
       <i>
        Shelby County
       </i>
       decision, the United States Attorney General is not making any determinations under Section 5 on voting or election changes made by states.
   The Supreme Court did not strike down Section 5, so it is still in effect.
   For that reason, the Mississippi Attorney General’s Office submitted Chapter 474, Laws of 2013, to the United States Attorney General, in order to technically meet the requirements of Section 5 and fulfill the condition in the effective date of the bill, which will allow the bill to take effect.
      </p>
      <p>
       By letter dated July 18, 2013, the United States Attorney General responded that he is not making determinations on the merits of any bill that is submitted under Section 5. The submission of Chapter 474 and the response from the United States Attorney General technically met the requirements of Section 5 and fulfilled the condition in the effective date of Chapter 474, so Chapter 474 became effective from and after July 18, 2013, the date of the United States Attorney General’s response letter.

       The 2003 amendment added the last sentence in (1).
      </p>
      <p>
       The 2013 amendment in (1), substituted “he or she” for “he” three times and substituted “he or she qualifies for the office which he or she desires to seek” for “January 1 of the year in which he desires to seek the office. However, a commissioner of election of any county may be a candidate in a special election to fill a vacancy in any other office, provided he resigns as election commissioner within ten (10) days after the issuance of the notice of a special election by the appropriate authorities.”
      </p>
      <p>
       The 2017 amendment, in (1), in the first sentence, substituted “election commissioners” for “commissioners of election” twice, deleted “or with reference to which he or she has acted as such” preceding “provided that he or she,” and substituted “files to qualify” for “qualifies,” and added the last sentence; substituted “election commissioners” for “commissioners of election” in (2); and made minor stylistic changes.

       Section 23-15-217 is not unconstitutionally void for vagueness because ordinary person of common intelligence upon reading it could understand what was allowed and what was not; statute provides two disqualifications upon county election commissioner offering himself as candidate for office: the first, no person holding office of elections commissioner may be candidate for election to any other office at any election held or to be held during 4 year term for which that person has been elected to serve as elections commissioner; second, commissioner may not be candidate for any other office in any election with respect to which he has taken any action in his official capacity; exception to both disqualifications is that incumbent election commissioner may be candidate for re-election.

       Election commissioner was disqualified by statute as candidate for Justice Court Judge in 1987 election, or for any other office, except election commissioner, in any other election to be held during 4 year term which began January, 1985, notwithstanding that as election commissioner he may have in fact done nothing toward preparation for and conduct of 1987 elections; previous opinions of Attorney General to effect that elections commissioner could be candidate for other offices during term for which he was either appointed or elected, so long as he resigned as elections commissioner prior to taking any action with reference to election in which he sought to be candidate, was erroneous; however, construction of statute prohibiting such action would have no effect upon any election held prior to January 1, 1988, with exception of candidate in instant case.

       The 2017 amendment, in (1), divided the former first sentence into the present first and second sentences by deleting “one (1) of whom, in each municipality, shall be designated to have printed and distributed the ‘official ballots,’ and all of whom” from the end of the first sentence and adding “The municipal election commissioners, in conjunction with the municipal clerk” to the beginning of the second sentence, substituted “poll managers” for “election managers” in the last sentence, and made minor stylistic changes; and added (2) through (4).

      <p>
       There is no specific prohibition against a county executive committee member from serving as a municipal election commissioner, but it would give the appearance of impropriety for a municipal election commissioner to be identified with a particulars group of nominees. 1998 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 803.
      </p>
      <p>
       The statute contains no provision expressly stating that it is applicable to special or private charter municipalities and, therefore, a city charter provision specifying the number of election commissioners controlled over the statute. Artman, Jr., 2001 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 177.
      </p>
      <p>
       A county or municipal election commission may enter a written agreement with a county or municipal party executive committee to perform various duties in connection with a primary election such as training poll workers, appointing poll workers, distributing ballot boxes, having ballots printed, distributing ballots, and receiving and canvassing election returns; however, there is no authority that would allow a county election commission to conduct a municipal election. 2002 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 535.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the increased revenue in a school district’s budget was derived solely from the expansion of its ad valorem tax base, there was no violation of subsection (1) of this section; however, an amount is referenced in the ad valorem tax request worksheet as a “new program” was not derived solely from the expansion of the district’s ad valorem tax base and, therefore, this increase in dollars must be advertised and the failure to do so requires exclusion of this amount when setting the millage rate to fund the school board’s budget. 2002 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 536.

       Marking of ballots by writing in name of ineligible candidate held not “distinguishing mark” which avoided entire ballot, where voters made honest effort to vote for such candidate, and not to indicate who voted ballots; hence ballots were improperly rejected as to candidates properly on ballots.

       Based on totality of circumstances, proof showed by preponderance of evidence that Mississippi’s dual registration requirement and statutory prohibition on removing voter registration books from circuit clerk’s office resulted in denial or abridgement of right of black citizens in Mississippi to vote and participate in electorial process. Mississippi State Chapter, Operation Push v. Allain, 674 F. Supp. 1245, 1987 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10925 (N.D. Miss. 1987).
      </p>

       Circuit clerks are qualified to and capable of determining, where necessity dictates and persons present themselves for deputization, which volunteers should be deputized. Mississippi State Chapter, Operation Push v. Allain, 674 F. Supp. 1245, 1987 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10925 (N.D. Miss. 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       Deputizing all municipal clerks would significantly increase available registration sites to those individuals living in small municipalities which are often distant from most populous areas of county, and there is no legitimate or compelling state interest served by failure to deputize all municipal clerks as deputy registrars. Mississippi State Chapter, Operation Push v. Allain, 674 F. Supp. 1245, 1987 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10925 (N.D. Miss. 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       Plaintiffs who showed that challenged statutes either impinged upon their protected rights to register to vote or burdened organizational efforts to assist prospective voters in registering had standing to sue to challenge Mississippi’s dual registration requirement and prohibition on satellite registration as violative of their rights and all persons similarly situated.

      <p>
       Even though county registrars are not entitled to compensation over and above what has been set by their respective boards of supervisors for maintaining extended office hours for registration and absentee balloting purposes, the compensation of a regular county employee who is also a deputy registrar and who is given the additional responsibility of registering voters during extended hours can be increased at the discretion of the board of supervisors. 1992 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 957.
      </p>
      <p>
       County registrars may lawfully receive more than one per diem for the same day for their assistance of certain entities in election activities, provided that the registrar, either personally or through a deputy, actually performs required and necessary duties in assisting each entity. 1992 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 957.
      </p>
      <p>
       Time and work required to transfer the names of registered voters to a newly established automated voter registration system is a single, unique occurrence, and county boards of supervisors are authorized to approve a one time additional payment for the Registrar or some qualified individual designated by the Registrar for performing this task. 1992 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 957.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no requirement that election commission or executive committees actually be in session and present with registrar in order for registrar to perform ministerial tasks and be entitled to appropriate compensation. 1992 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 932.
      </p>
      <p>
       Miss. Code Section 23-15-225 provides that city clerk of every municipality shall be appointed as deputy registrar. 1993 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 263.
      </p>
      <p>
       In setting election clerk’s compensation, governing authorities should take into consideration fact that clerk is required by statute to perform various duties relating to municipal registrar; Miss. Code Section 23-15-225 (6) specifically provides for additional compensation for performance of duties relating to mail-in voter registration. 1993 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 263.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is implicit in this section that circuit clerks may, upon request from the executive committee of the party, assist the executive committee with its duties in the conduct of the election (circuit clerk may receive compensation for services in assisting the election commissioners, executive committees or boards of supervisors in connection with any election); thus, although the circuit clerk may assist the executive committee in the conduct of an election, the duty and responsibility of the election remains with the executive committee and is nondelegable.
   1999 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 323.
      </p>
      <p>
       Individual election commissioners may be employed on a part-time basis by the board of supervisors to perform redistricting tasks provided the board determines, consistent with the facts that (1) the work involved is not required to be performed by the registrar or deputy registrar; and (2) the work is over and above the regular statutory duties of the election commissioners. Martin, Jr., 2002 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 326.
      </p>
      <p>
       Circuit clerks may claim the same number of statutory days for assisting county executive committees as they claim for assisting county election commissions. 2006 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 191.

       The United States Attorney General, by letter dated August 4, 1995, interposed no objection, under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, to the amendment to this section by Laws of 1995, ch. 446, § 1.

       On June 15, 2007, the United States Attorney General interposed no objection, under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, to the amendment to this section by Laws of 2007, ch. 434.
      </p>
      <p>
       The effective date of Chapter 366, Laws of 2013, which amended this section, is “from and after the date it is effectuated under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, as amended and extended.” However, after the bill was approved, the United States Supreme Court, in the case of
       <i>
        Shelby County v. Holder
       </i>
       (June 25, 2013), struck down the coverage formula that determined what jurisdictions are subject to Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, so the coverage formula can no longer be used as a basis for subjecting jurisdictions to preclearance under Section 5.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because of the
       <i>
        Shelby County
       </i>
       decision, the United States Attorney General is not making any determinations under Section 5 on voting or election changes made by states.
   The Supreme Court did not strike down Section 5, so it is still in effect.
   For that reason, the Mississippi Attorney General’s Office submitted Chapter 366, Laws of 2013, to the United States Attorney General, in order to technically meet the requirements of Section 5 and fulfill the condition in the effective date of the bill, which will allow the bill to take effect.
      </p>
      <p>
       By letter dated July 17, 2013, the United States Attorney General responded that he is not making determinations on the merits of any bill that is submitted under Section 5. The submission of Chapter 366 and the response from the United States Attorney General technically met the requirements of Section 5 and fulfilled the condition in the effective date of Chapter 366, so Chapter 366 became effective from and after July 17, 2013, the date of the United States Attorney General’s response letter.

       Miss. Code Section 23-15-229 provides for compensation of municipal clerks, managers and other workers, and states that compensation for clerks, managers and other workers in polling place shall be same as compensation paid by county for such services. 1993 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 263.

       Even though heading or title of Miss. Code Section 23-15-229 uses terms “municipal clerks, managers and other workers”, compensation provided for this statutory section is for “clerks, managers and other workers in the polling places”; this section is clearly referring to poll workers who have historically been designated election clerks and managers, and would not be applicable to municipal clerk. 1993 Miss.

    Appointment of poll managers; designation of bailiff.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Before every election, the election commissioners shall appoint three (3) persons for each voting precinct to be poll managers, one (1) of whom shall be designated by the election commissioners as election bailiff. For general and special elections, the poll managers shall not all be of the same political party if suitable persons of different political parties can be found in the district. If any person appointed shall fail to attend and serve, the poll managers present, if any, may designate someone to fill his or her place; and if the election commissioners fail to make the appointments or in case of the failure of all those appointed to attend and serve, any three (3) qualified electors present when the polls should be opened may act as poll managers. Provided, however, any person appointed to be poll manager or act as poll manager shall be a qualified elector of the county in which the polling place is located.

       As the only statutory qualification to serve as a pollworker is that one be a qualified elector of the county in which the polling place is located, if an individual is independently appointed to act as a pollworker in more than one primary election being conducted in the same polling place, there is no statutory prohibition against an individual serving in such dual capacity. 1992 Miss.

       A county election commission may choose to appoint qualified previously trained individuals who have served in a primary to also serve in the following general election; however, if individuals who were paid for attending one or more training sessions conducted by a party executive committee are appointed by a commission, they would not be eligible for any further compensation for attending another training session. 2000 Miss.

       The 2017 amendment substituted “election commissioners” for “commissioners of election” twice; rewrote the second and third sentences, which read: “The boxes shall be secured by good and substantial locks, and, if an adjournment shall take place after the opening of the polls and before all the votes shall be counted, the box shall be securely locked, so as to prevent the admission of anything into it, or the taking of anything from it, during the time of adjournment; and the box shall be kept by one of the managers and the key by another of the managers, and the manager having the box shall carefully keep it, and neither unlock or open it himself nor permit it to be done, nor permit any person to have any access to it during the time of adjournment. The box shall not be removed from the polling building or place after the polls are opened until the count is complete, if as many as three (3) qualified electors object”; deleted “with the keys thereof” following “shall be delivered” in the last sentence; and made a gender neutral
   change.

       The 2017 amendment in the first paragraph, substituted “voter rolls as electronically maintained by the Statewide Elections Management System” for “registration and pollbooks” and rewrote the last sentence, which read: “Said boards are also authorized, by order spread upon the minutes of the board setting forth the cost and source of funds therefor, to purchase improved or unimproved property and to construct, reconstruct, repair, renovate and maintain polling places or to pay to private property owners reasonable rental fees when the property is used as a polling place for a period not to exceed the day immediately preceding the election, the day of the election, and the day immediately following the election and to allow such reasonable sum as may be expended in supplying voting compartments, tables or shelves for use at elections”; and deleted the last paragraph, which read: “All facilities owned or leased by the state, county, municipality or school district may be made available at no cost to the board of supervisors for use as polling places to such extent as may be agreed to by the authority having control or custody of such facilities.”

       A board of supervisors does not have the responsibility to provide or make available the various county polling places within the county precincts for use by a political party for a caucus. However, in the event the board makes space available in public facilities to other organizations, it can make space available on the same basis for conducting caucuses. 2004 Miss. Op.

       The 2017 amendment substituted “election commissioners” for “commissioners of election” in (1); rewrote (2), which read: “If an adjournment shall take place after the polls are open and before all votes are counted, the ballot box shall be securely locked so as to prevent the admission into it or the taking of anything from it during the time of adjournment; and the box shall be kept by one of the managers, and the key by another of the managers, and the manager having the box shall carefully keep it, and neither undertake to open it himself or permit it to be done, or to permit any person to have access to it during the time of adjournment. The box shall not be removed from the polling building or place after the polls are open until the count is completed if as many as three (3) electors qualified to vote at the election object”; rewrote (3), which read: “After each election, the ballot boxes of those provided by the regular commissioner of election shall be delivered, with the keys thereof immediately and as soon thereafter as possible, and without delay to the clerk of the circuit court of the county”; and made gender neutral and minor stylitic changes.

       Pressing shop located across street and about 100 feet from a store designated by the county board of supervisors as the voting place in the district, was the proper voting place and the votes cast thereat were valid, where the owner and operator of the store informed one of the election commissioners a day or two before the election that the store could not be used as a voting place, whereupon, it being too late for a special meeting of the board for designating another voting place, the commissioner directed the election managers to hold the election at the pressing shop.

   Changes by the City of Canton, Mississippi in the locations of polling places and in the municipal boundaries through annexations of adjacent areas were within the requirement of § 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (42 USC § 1973c [now 52 USCS § 10304]) that states or political subdivisions covered by the Act must obtain approval of voting procedures different from those in effect on November 1, 1964, by obtaining a declaratory judgment as to the nondiscriminatory purpose and effect of the changes from the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia, or by submitting the proposed changes to the United States Attorney General.

       Pressing shop located across street and about 100 feet from a store designated by the county board of supervisors as the voting place in the district, was the proper voting place and the votes cast thereat were valid, where the owner and operator of the store informed one of the election commissioners a day or two before the election that the store could not be used as a voting place, whereupon, it being too late for a special meeting of the board for designating another voting place, the commissioner directed the election managers to hold the election at the pressing shop.

No change in any supervisors district or voting precinct shall take effect less than thirty (30) days before the qualifying deadline for the office of county supervisor. Any change in any boundary of a supervisors district or voting precinct that is approved under the Voting Rights Act of 1965 less than thirty (30) days before such qualifying deadline shall be effective only for an election for county supervisor held in a year following the year in which such change is approved under the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

   Mississippi law regarding the power to change election procedures supported the position of plaintiffs, the Mississippi Democratic Party and its Executive Committee, that regardless of what actions a political party’s executive committee had taken, they could only act when expressly authorized by Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t23c15s23-15-291" target="_self">23-15-291</a></cite>, and the Executive Committee did not have the authority to implement a closed primary with mandatory party registration; thus, although the Executive Committee had not voted to change their qualifications to include membership cards and had not voted to change the primary system to fully closed, the argument by defendants, the Mississippi Governor, Secretary of State, and Attorney General, that the Executive Committee’s failure to pass such measures or obtain preclearance from the Department of Justice pursuant to 42 U.S.C.S. § 1973b(b) [now 52 USCS § 10303], was rejected because the Executive Committee did in fact vote to approve the lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of Mississippi’s primary system.

      <p>
       In order to qualify for a multi-district legislative office, candidates must qualify with the secretary of the state executive committee of their chosen party by 5:00 p.m. on March 1, and, if candidates intend to run in a single county legislative district, they must qualify with the circuit clerk of their home county by 5:00 p.m. on March 1; there are no statutory provisions that allow any exceptions or extensions to these deadlines.
   1999 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 161.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is the duty of the executive committee of the political party to determine whether an individual is in fact qualified for the office sought and whether the individual should be placed on the ballot for the party primary.
   1999 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 346.
      </p>
      <p>
       When March 1, falls on a Saturday, rather than designating a date other than that required by the statute, all those officials authorized to accept candidate qualification papers must open their offices and be available for that purpose on that date until 5:00 p.m., regardless of whether that office is normally open on that day of the week. 2003 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 12.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once it is determined by the proper executive committee, that a particular candidate meets the eligibility requirements of the above quoted statute, his or her name must be placed on the primary ballot; any finding by said committee that a candidate is not loyal to the political party conducting the primary would not authorize the committee to refuse to place that candidate’s name on the primary ballot. 2003 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 15.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a party executive committee refuses to place a candidate’s name on the primary ballot, the candidate may file a complaint in circuit court asking that the committee be enjoined to place his or her name on the ballot; the time frame for obtaining such an injunction would be prior to the printing of the official ballots. 2003 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 15.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a party executive committee makes the factual determination that a particular candidate is disloyal to the party and refuses to place said candidate’s name on the ballot, a circuit judge when properly presented with the issue may rule on the legality of basing the decision to disqualify the candidate on the ground of party loyalty. 2003 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 15.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the local party refuses to qualify a candidate, the challenge would be heard by the circuit court of the county wherein the executive committee sits. 2003 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 15.

       Candidate and his wife claimed that they were residents of the judicial district for which the candidate sought office, however the candidate and his wife owned two homes and the record revealed that the candidate and his wife spent five days a week at their second home, which was located outside of the judicial district; the candidate was therefore unqualified to run for office in the judicial district.

      <p>
       Because a candidate for the Mississippi Senate was unable to establish “without contingencies” and with “absolute proof” that residency in a certain district would have been established by the time of an election, a political party and its executive committee properly declined to place the candidate’s name on the ballot; evidence of a purchase contract for a home in the district was insufficient because the sale could have fallen through.

       Since programming DRE units is the equivalent of printing ballots and is an expense to be borne by the county under Section 23-15-301, a circuit clerk or election commissioner who enters an agreement to perform that task with an executive committee would be entitled to compensation in an amount agreed upon by the two parties and approved by the county board of supervisors. 2006 Miss.

No candidate may attempt to qualify with any political party that does not have a duly organized municipal executive committee, and the municipal clerk shall not accept any assessments made pursuant to subsection (1) if the municipal clerk does not have contact information for the secretary of the municipal executive committee for that political party.

       There is no specific prohibition against a county executive committee member from serving as a municipal election commissioner, but it would give the appearance of impropriety for a municipal election commissioner to be identified with a particulars group of nominees. 1998 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 803.
      </p>
      <p>
       A party executive committee must be in place on the qualifying deadline so that the municipal clerk can “promptly” turn the fees and statements of intent over to said committee.
   2001 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 123.
      </p>
      <p>
       The statute clearly contemplates that a municipal party executive committee be in place at the time a potential candidate files his statement of intent and pays the filing fee; however, if a clerk has accepted one or more potential candidate’s statement of intent and filing fee at a time when no committee is in place and a legitimate temporary committee is subsequently formed prior to the qualifying deadline, such temporary committee could proceed to review the potential candidates’ qualifications and conduct a party primary and/or certify unopposed candidates as the party’s nominees. 2001 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 155.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since municipal party executive committees are statutorily charged with the responsibility of conducting municipal primaries in accordance with state law, membership on said committees constitutes serving in a position of public trust. 2002 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 597.
      </p>
      <p>
       Potential candidates for membership on a municipal party executive committee are subject to the provisions of Section 44 of the Constitution and this section as they pertain to criminal convictions. 2002 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 597.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a municipal party executive committee finds that a potential candidate for membership on said committee who has filed his or her statement of intent has been convicted of any felony covered by Section 44 of the Constitution and this section, said committee could not lawfully qualify that individual as a candidate. 2002 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 597.
      </p>
      <p>
       A party executive committee has no authority to disqualify or refuse to certify a candidate upon its finding that the candidate misused or abused his office or money coming into his hands by virtue of his office unless there is a felony conviction relating to such alleged misconduct. 2005 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 176.

       The effective date of Chapter 391, Laws of 2013, which amended this section, is “from and after the date it is effectuated under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, as amended and extended.” However, after the bill was approved, the United States Supreme Court, in the case of
       <i>
        Shelby County v. Holder
       </i>
       (June 25, 2013), struck down the coverage formula that determined what jurisdictions are subject to Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, so the coverage formula can no longer be used as a basis for subjecting jurisdictions to preclearance under Section 5.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because of the
       <i>
        Shelby County
       </i>
       decision, the United States Attorney General is not making any determinations under Section 5 on voting or election changes made by states.
   The Supreme Court did not strike down Section 5, so it is still in effect.
   For that reason, the Mississippi Attorney General’s Office submitted Chapter 391, Laws of 2013, to the United States Attorney General, in order to technically meet the requirements of Section 5 and fulfill the condition in the effective date of the bill, which will allow the bill to take effect.

      <p>
       By letter dated August 1, 2013, the United States Attorney General responded that he is not making determinations on the merits of any bill that is submitted under Section 5. The submission of Chapter 391 and the response from the United States Attorney General technically met the requirements of Section 5 and fulfilled the condition in the effective date of Chapter 391, so Chapter 391 became effective from and after August 1, 2013, the date of the United States Attorney General’s response letter.

      Family crises, which shall include circumstances which would substantially alter the duties and responsibilities of the candidate to the family or to a family business.
     </p>
     <p>
      Substantial business conflict, which shall include the policy of an employer prohibiting employees being candidates for public offices and an employment change which would result in the ineligibility of the candidate or which would impair his or her capability to properly carry out the functions of the office being sought.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any candidate who withdraws based upon a “legitimate nonpolitical reason” which is not covered by the above definition shall have the strict burden of proof for his or her reason.
     </p>
     <p>
      A candidate who wishes to withdraw for a legitimate nonpolitical reason shall submit his or her reason by sworn affidavit. Such affidavit shall be filed with the state party chair of the nominee’s party and the State Board of Election Commissioners. No substitution of candidates shall be authorized, except for death or disqualification, unless the State Board of Election Commissioners approves the affidavit as constituting a “legitimate nonpolitical reason” for the candidate’s resignation within five (5) days of the date the affidavit is submitted to the board.

       The Democratic party was entitled to nominate a candidate in a deceased candidate’s place, even though the candidate’s death occurred prior to the primary election and not between the primary and general elections as stated in this section, where the deceased candidate was unopposed for the Democratic nomination which necessarily meant that there would be no Democratic primary election conducted for the office in question and, therefore, the deceased candidate was the Democratic nominee.

       If a nominee withdraws for a legitimate nonpolitical reason as defined in Section 23-15-317 and his sworn affidavit is approved by the State Board of Election Commissioners, the municipal party executive committee would then be required to name a substitute nominee. If a nominee withdraws and no affidavit is submitted and approved, said executive committee would have no authority to name a substitute nominee. In either case, the nominee has the right to withdraw his candidacy pursuant to Section 23-15-363. 2005 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 237.

       The statute applies only where a candidate dies after the primary but prior to the general election. Upton v. McKenzie, 761 So. 2d 167, 2000 Miss. LEXIS 136 (Miss. 2000).

       State political party acted in good faith in nominating candidate for state House of Representatives prior to primary election when one candidate died and the other withdrew for legitimate reason; statute permitting political party to fill vacancy in nomination technically applied only to candidates who withdraw after primary, but there was no provision that gave direction to party on how to proceed under facts presented, and there was no fact or circumstance in case that indicated any wrongful or fraudulent purpose in conduct of election.

       In the absence of any charge of fraud, irregularity of any kind, and in the absence of any proof that the purity and integrity of the party primary election was violated, the fact that the ballots at one precinct were delivered to a party who was the wife and sister-in-law of those who were designated to be receiving managers but could not be located at the time of delivery, did not warrant or require the voiding of the election at that precinct.

       Where there is a total departure from the mandatory provisions of the statute and it is not possible to ascertain the will of the electors because a substantial portion of the votes were void, a new election should be ordered for the purpose of ascertaining the voter’s choice.

       Petitions filed by candidates containing only a legally sufficient number of signatures of qualified electors to qualify under proposed (not currently effective) ward lines were not valid at the time they were submitted, and could not be supplemented by additional signatures so that they would contain a legally sufficient number of signatures of qualified electors from the old, and currently still effective, ward lines. 2005 Miss.

       Circuit court did not err in ordering a candidate’s name be placed on a ballot because a statutory “petition filed by qualified electors” was wholly separate and distinct from the statutory requirements where the candidate was merely seeking to have his name printed on the mayoral ballot and where there was no contradictory evidence presented to contest the elector affidavits before the election commission.

       If a nominee withdraws for a legitimate nonpolitical reason as defined in Section 23-15-317 and his sworn affidavit is approved by the State Board of Election Commissioners, the municipal party executive committee would then be required to name a substitute nominee. If a nominee withdraws and no affidavit is submitted and approved, said executive committee would have no authority to name a substitute nominee. In either case, the nominee has the right to withdraw his candidacy pursuant to Section 23-15-363. 2005 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 237.

Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t23c15s23-15-365" target="_self">23-15-365</a></cite> because the circuit judge passed away after qualifying for the November 2, 2010 election, and Miss.

Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.09.html#t09c01s9-1-103" target="_blank">9-1-103</a></cite> means that an election under Miss.

       The statute does not allow for a write-in candidate only where there is one person qualified for a particular office and that one qualified person dies, resigns, withdraws or removes his or her name after the printing of the primary ballot; write-in candidates are also allowed if the death of a candidate occurs prior to the printing of the ballot.

       The 2017 amendment rewrote the section, which read: “The board of supervisors of each county in the State of Mississippi shall utilize voting machines, electronic voting systems, optical mark reading equipment or direct recording electronic voting equipment which shall comply with the specifications provided by law. The election commissioners may designate elections to be administered by paper ballot where the election commissioners determine that administration of an election by paper ballot will be less expensive than administration of the same election by voting machines, electronic voting systems, optical mark reading equipment or direct recording electronic voting equipment.”

       § 23-15-511.
    Form of ballots; posting of sample ballots; ballot security envelopes.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The ballots shall, as far as practicable, be in the same order of arrangement as provided for paper ballots that are to be counted manually, except that the information may be printed in vertical or horizontal rows. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as prohibiting the information being presented to the voters from being printed on both sides of a single ballot. In those years when a special election shall occur on the same day as the general election, the names of candidates in any special election and the general election shall be placed on the same ballot by the election commissioners or officials in charge of the election, but the general election candidates shall be clearly distinguished from the special election candidates. At any time a special election is held on the same day as a party primary election, the names of the candidates in the special election may be placed on the same ballot by the officials in charge of the election, but shall be clearly distinguished as special election candidates or primary election candidates.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ballots shall be printed in plain clear type in black ink and upon clear white materials of such size and arrangement as to be compatible with the OMR equipment. Absentee ballots shall be prepared and printed in the same form and shall be on the same size and texture as the regular official ballots, except that they shall be printed on tinted paper; or the ink used to print the ballots shall be of a color different from that of the ink used to print the regular official ballots. Arrows may be printed on the ballot to indicate the place to mark the ballot, which may be to the right or left of the names of candidates and propositions. The titles of offices may be arranged in vertical columns on the ballot and shall be printed above or at the side of the names of candidates so as to indicate clearly the candidates for each office and the number to be elected. In case there are more candidates for an office than can be printed in one (1) column, the ballot shall be clearly marked that the list of candidates is continued on the following column. The names of candidates for each office shall be printed in vertical columns, grouped by the offices that they seek. In partisan elections, the party designation of each candidate, which may be abbreviated, shall be printed following his or her name.
     </p>
     <p>
      One (1) sample ballot, which shall be a facsimile of the official ballot and instructions to the voters, shall be provided for each precinct and shall be posted in each polling place on election day.
     </p>
     <p>
      A separate ballot security envelope or suitable equivalent in which the voter can place his or her ballot after voting, shall be provided to conceal the choices the voter has made. Absentee voters will receive a similar ballot security envelope provided by the county in which the absentee voter will insert their voted ballot, which then can be inserted into a return envelope to be mailed back to the election official. Absentee ballots will not be required to be folded when a ballot security envelope is provided.

The poll managers, while they have possession of the election materials, and the officials in charge of the election, once the poll managers have delivered the ballot box to the counting center or other designated place, shall be required to keep a seal log to document each time a tamper-evident seal for a ballot box is opened or changed. The seal log shall require the name of the person who opened the seal, the old seal number, the new seal number, the date the seal was opened and the purpose for opening the seal.

The test shall be conducted by processing a preaudited group of ballots so marked as to record a predetermined number of valid votes for each candidate and on each measure, and shall include for each office one or more ballots that have votes in excess of the number allowed by law in order to test the ability of the OMR equipment to reject such votes. If any error is detected, the cause of the error shall be ascertained and corrected and an errorless count shall be made and certified to by the officials in charge before the count is started.

        Editor’s Notes —
       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       The United States Attorney General, by letter dated August 16, 1993, interposed no objection, under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, to certain changes occasioned by
   Laws, 1993, ch. 528. However, with respect to a requirement for verification of a voter’s identity at the polling place as a prerequisite to voting, the Attorney General concluded that the information submitted was insufficient to support a determination that the proposed change did not have the purpose and would not have the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race or color, as required by Section 5, and requested additional information.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 23-15-541 was amended by
   Laws of 1993, ch. 528, but that law has not been effectuated under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 as of September 1, 2004. Consequently, the version of
   Section 23-15-541 contained in
   Laws, 1993, ch. 528, is being omitted from the Code at the direction of Co-Counsel of The Joint Legislative Committee on Compilation, Revision and Publication of Legislation.
      </p>
      <p>
       On August 7, 2008, the United States Attorney General interposed no objection under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, as amended and extended, to the amendment of this section by
   Laws of 2008, ch. 528.
      </p>
      <p>
       The effective date of the bill that amended this section, Chapter 526, Laws of 2012 (House Bill No. 921), is “from and after the date it is effectuated under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, as amended and extended.”
   However, after the bill was submitted to the United States Attorney General under Section 5, the United States Supreme Court, in the case of
       <i>
        Shelby County v. Holder
       </i>
       (June 25, 2013), struck down the coverage formula that determined what jurisdictions are subject to Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, so the coverage formula can no longer be used as a basis for subjecting jurisdictions to preclearance under Section 5.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because of the
       <i>
        Shelby County
       </i>
       decision, the United States Attorney General is not making any determinations under Section 5 on voting or election changes made by states.
   The Supreme Court did not strike down Section 5, so it is still in effect.
   Chapter 526 was submitted to the United States Attorney General before the
       <i>
        Shelby County
       </i>
       decision was rendered.
   In a letter dated August 5, 2013, the United States Attorney General responded that he is not making determinations on the merits of any bill that is submitted under Section 5.
   The submission of Chapter 526 and the response from the United States Attorney General technically met the requirements of Section 5 and fulfilled the condition in the effective date of Chapter 526, so Chapter 526 became effective on the date of the response letter from the United States Attorney General, August 5, 2013.
      </p>
      <p>
       Laws of 2017, ch. 441, § 205 provides:
      </p>
      <p>
       “SECTION 205. This act shall take effect and be in force from and after July 1, 2017, except for Sections 3, 9, 13, 14, 15, 18, 19, 21, 24, 31, 70, 108, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 184 and 188, which shall take effect and be in force from and after passage [approved April 18, 2017].”

       The 2008 amendment added (2).

      <p>
       The 2012 amendment rewrote the third sentence of (1).
      </p>
      <p>
       The 2017 amendment, effective April 18, 2017, inserted “poll” preceding “manager” or “managers” throughout; in (1), rewrote the first two sentences, which read: “At all elections, the polls shall be opened at seven o’clock in the morning and be kept open until seven o’clock in the evening and no longer. Upon the opening of the polls, and not before, the managers of the election shall designate two (2) of their number, other than the manager theretofore designated to receive the blank ballots, who shall thereupon be known respectively as the initialing manager and the alternate initialing manager,” rewrote the fourth sentence, which read: “When any person entitled to vote shall appear to vote, the managers shall identify the voter by requiring the voter to submit identification as required by Section 23-15-563, and then the voter shall sign his name in a receipt book or booklet provided for that purpose and to be used at that election only and said receipt book or booklet shall be used in lieu of the list of voters who have voted formerly made by the managers or clerks; whereupon and not before, the initialing manager or, in his absence, the alternate initialing manager shall endorse his initials on the back of an official blank ballot, prepared in accordance with law, and at such place on the back of the ballot that the initials may be seen after the ballot has been marked and folded, and when so endorsed he shall deliver it to the voter, which ballot the voter shall mark in the manner provided by law, which when done the voter shall deliver the ballot to the initialing manager or, in his absence, to the alternate initialing manager, in the presence of the others, and the manager shall see that the ballot so delivered bears on the back thereof the genuine initials of the initialing manager, or alternate initialing manager, and if so, but not otherwise, the ballot shall be put into the ballot box; and when so done one (1) of the managers or a duly appointed clerk shall make the proper entry on the pollbook” and divided it into the present fourth and fifth sentences, and rewrote the last sentence, which read: “If the voter is unable to write his name on the receipt book, a manager or clerk shall note on the back of the ballot that it was receipted for by his assistance”; in (2), deleted the (a) designation from the first paragraph, rewrote the second paragraph, which read: “Where the managers of an election, exercising their sound discretion, determine that a physically disabled person has arrived at the polls in a motor vehicle to vote, two (2) or more managers shall carry the pollbook, the receipt book, and a ballot or voting device to the motor vehicle, and after determining whether the disabled person is a qualified elector as provided by law, shall allow the disabled elector to cast his or her ballot in secret. After the disabled elector casts his or her ballot, the managers shall mark the pollbook ‘voted‘ by the elector’s name in the pollbook,” and designated it (a), in (b), added “and in the appropriate column in the pollbook” at the end of the next-to-last sentence, and in (c), deleted “or a political party primary” following “conducting and election,” substituted “voting return to the polls so that” for “voting procedure return so that,” and deleted “or party primary at all times” preceding “and until a minimum”; added (3); and made gender neutral and minor stylistic changes.

   Votes cast by voters who were permitted by election managers to request assistance from poll watchers were improper where all persons who desired assistance in voting were permitted to have assistance without declaring that they were blind, physically disabled, or unable to read; the attempted repeal of Code 1942 § 3273, governing aid to illiterate voters, was ineffective where the proposed repeal was neither approved by the Attorney General of the United States nor approved in a declaratory judgment suit as otherwise required by the Voting Rights Act,

The envelope containing all spoiled ballots shall be sealed in the ballot box once the poll managers have completed the closing procedures and returned the materials to the officials in charge of the election.

The authority conducting an election shall not be required, however, to establish a polling place in each of said precincts, but such election authorities, whether in a primary or in a general election, may locate and establish such polling places, without regard to precinct lines, in such manner as in the discretion of such authority will better accommodate the electorate and better facilitate the holding of the election.

      </h4>
      <p>
       The effective date of the bill that amended this section, Chapter 526, Laws of 2012 (House Bill No. 921), is “from and after the date it is effectuated under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, as amended and extended.”
   However, after the bill was submitted to the United States Attorney General under Section 5, the United States Supreme Court, in the case of
       <i>
        Shelby County v. Holder
       </i>
       (June 25, 2013), struck down the coverage formula that determined what jurisdictions are subject to Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, so the coverage formula can no longer be used as a basis for subjecting jurisdictions to preclearance under Section 5.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because of the
       <i>
        Shelby County
       </i>
       decision, the United States Attorney General is not making any determinations under Section 5 on voting or election changes made by states.
   The Supreme Court did not strike down Section 5, so it is still in effect. Chapter 526 was submitted to the United States Attorney General before the
       <i>
        Shelby County
       </i>
       decision was rendered. In a letter dated August 5, 2013, the United States Attorney General responded that he is not making determinations on the merits of any bill that is submitted under Section 5.
   The submission of Chapter 526 and the response from the United States Attorney General technically met the requirements of Section 5 and fulfilled the condition in the effective date of Chapter 526, so Chapter 526 became effective on the date of the response letter from the United States Attorney General, August 5, 2013.

       The 2017 amendment, substituted “poll manager or poll worker” for “manager, clerk or poll worker” in (1)(e); inserted “poll” in (2); and in (3), substituted “the voter” for “he” throughout, and inserted “or her” in (f).

      </h4>
      <p>
       Regarding the question whether it is legal for a vote cast in the Democratic primary to be challenged simply because the poll worker or someone from the local Democratic Party alleges that the voter is really a Republican or Republican supporter, the stated intent of the voter would be controlling. 2003 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 15.
      </p>
      <p>
       The vote of a person who is forced to cast a “challenged” or “rejected” ballot pursuant to Section 23-15-579 will not be counted in determining the initial outcome of the election; however, in an election contest the circuit court may order that such be counted if it determines that the challenges had no basis in fact or in law. 2003 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 15.
      </p>
      <p>
       A registered voter may not cast a lawful ballot in a voting precinct other than the precinct where he or she resides. 2003 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 345.

      </h4>
      <p>
       Regarding the question whether it is legal for a vote cast in the Democratic primary to be challenged simply because the poll worker or someone from the local Democratic Party alleges that the voter is really a Republican or Republican supporter, the stated intent of the voter would be controlling. 2003 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 15.
      </p>
      <p>
       The vote of a person who is forced to cast a “challenged” or “rejected” ballot pursuant to Section 23-15-579 will not be counted in determining the initial outcome of the election; however, in an election contest the circuit court may order that such be counted if it determines that the challenges had no basis in fact or in law. 2003 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 15.
      </p>
      <p>
       A poll worker, poll watcher or another voter is not allowed to ask a voter if he or she intends to support the nominees of the party once the voter presents himself or herself to vote. Challenges may be made pursuant to Section 23-15-579 only for the reasons listed in Section 23-15-571, and for the reason that the voter does not intend to support the nominees of the party per this section. 2003 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 316.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a challenge of a voter is properly initiated in strict accordance with Section 23-15-579 and the voter then openly declares that he or she does not intend to support the nominees of the party, the poll workers could find the challenge to be well taken and mark the ballot “challenged” or “rejected” consistent with the provisions of said statute; on the other hand, if the voter openly declares his or her intent to support the nominees, then a challenge is not proper under this section. 2003 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 316.
      </p>
      <p>
       Absent an obvious factual situation such as an independent candidate attempting to vote in a party’s primary, the stated intent of the voter is controlling. 2003 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 316.

   Although plaintiff political party unquestionably pleaded a constitutional injury by alleging that Mississippi’s semi-closed primary statute required it to associate with members of the other party during its candidate-selection process, it took no internal steps to limit participation in its primaries to party members and thus could not claim that Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t23c15s23-15-575" target="_self">23-15-575</a></cite> actually had an unconstitutional effect; this lack of “actual controversy” made the case too remote and abstract an inquiry for the proper exercise of the judicial function under U.S. Const. Art. III. Miss. State Democratic Party v. Barbour, 529 F.3d 538, 2008 U.S. App. LEXIS 11395 (5th Cir. Miss. 2008).

       The 2017 amendment, effective April 18, 2017, rewrote the section, which read: “All votes which shall be challenged at the polls, whether the question be raised by a manager or by another authorized challenger, shall be received when voted, but each of such challenged votes shall, by one (1) of the managers or clerks, be marked on the back ‘CHALLENGED’ and all such challenged votes shall be placed in one or more strong envelopes; and when all the unchallenged votes have been counted, tallied and totaled the challenged votes shall then be counted, tallied and totaled and a separate return shall be made of the unchallenged votes and of those that are challenged. The envelope or envelopes containing the challenged votes, when counted and tallied, shall be securely sealed with all said challenged votes inclosed therein and placed in the box with the unchallenged votes. Provided, that when a vote is challenged at the polls it shall so clearly appear in the unanimous opinion of the managers, either by the admissions or statements of the person challenged or from official documentary evidence, or indubitable oral evidence then presented to the managers, that the challenge is well taken, the vote shall be rejected entirely and shall not be counted; but in such case the rejected ballot, after it has been marked by the challenged voter, shall be marked on the back ‘REJECTED’ and the name of the voter shall also be written on the back, and said vote and all other rejected votes shall be placed in a separate strong envelope and sealed and returned in the box as in the case of challenged votes. The failure of a candidate to challenge a vote or votes at a box shall not preclude him from later showing, in the manner provided by law, that one or more votes have been improperly received or counted or returned as regards said box. If the managers of an election believe a challenge of a voter is frivolous or not made in good faith they may disregard such challenge and accept the offered vote as though not challenged.”

       The vote of a person who is forced to cast a “challenged” or “rejected” ballot pursuant to Section 23-15-579 will not be counted in determining the initial outcome of the election; however, in an election contest the circuit court may order that such be counted if it determines that the challenges had no basis in fact or in law. 2003 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 15.

       Statutory requirements applicable to the acquisition of computer equipment and services are also applicable to the acquisition of computer equipment and services necessary to implement a computerized statewide voter registration system under the Help America Vote Act (HAVA). However, acquisitions of computer equipment and services approved by ITS in order to implement a computerized voter registration system under HAVA will also have to be approved by the Secretary of State. 2004 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 340.
      </p>
      <p>
       Challenged ballots should be counted, tallied and totaled and a separate return made at the courthouse or other central location after all unchallenged ballots have been counted, tallied and totaled. 2004 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 348.
      </p>
      <p>
       The separate envelope containing the rejected ballots and the separate envelope containing the challenged ballots must be sealed and returned in the appropriate ballot box to be preserved in the registrar’s office. Should an election contest be filed, the court before whom the contest is heard will decide what impact, if any, such ballots had on the election and will rule accordingly. 2004 Miss. Op.

   On a challenge against defendants, the Mississippi Governor, Secretary of State, and Attorney General, while Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t23c15s23-15-575" target="_self">23-15-575</a></cite> provides for closed primary elections, there was no party registration and the challenge procedure in Miss.

Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t23c15s23-15-579" target="_self">23-15-579</a></cite> afforded no practical protection; it unconstitutionally infringed on plaintiff Mississippi Democratic Party’s First Amendment disassociation right and the Mississippi Legislature had to pass a new primary system by April 1, 2008. Miss. State Democratic Party v. Barbour, 491 F. Supp. 2d 641, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 41908 (N.D. Miss. 2007), rev'd, vacated, 529 F.3d 538, 2008 U.S. App. LEXIS 11395 (5th Cir. Miss. 2008).

       Election commission does not have the authority to open ballots certified by election managers as rejected or challenged, and commission cannot override or review decision of election manager who marked ballot as rejected or challenged; duty of commission is merely to canvass sealed ballots to determine if requirements have been met.

      <p>
       Only power conferred, and only duty required of election commission, in relation to the canvass of votes, should be to count the votes, based upon returns as made by election managers, and to give certificates to those receiving majority of the votes; election commission should not go beyond or behind the returns, and reject votes, or accept votes previously rejected, or otherwise inquire into validity of conduct of election; election commission has no judicial discretion as to validity of rejected or contested votes.

       Opening the ballot box and removing the ballots or a part of them to a separate room for the purpose of counting while the election was still in progress was such a radical departure from the terms of this section and from the fundamental principles of the Corrupt Practices Law as to render the election void as to the precincts involved. Clark v. Rankin County Democratic Executive Committee, 322 So. 2d 753, 1975 Miss. LEXIS 1548 (Miss. 1975).
      </p>
      <p>
       The requirements of this section [Code 1942, § 3164] are mandatory. Hathorn v. State, 147 So. 2d 286 (Miss. 1962).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where there were only eighty illegal votes in a total vote of 1229, the illegal votes being only 6.5 per cent of the total votes cast, there was no such substantial failure to comply in material particulars with the statutes so as to invalidate the election. Walker v. Smith, 213 Miss. 255, 57 So. 2d 166, 1952 Miss. LEXIS 360 (Miss. 1952).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where there is a total departure from the mandatory provisions of the statute and it is not possible to ascertain the will of the electors because a substantial portion of the votes were void, a new election should be ordered for the purpose of ascertaining the voter’s choice. May v. Layton, 213 Miss. 129, 55 So. 2d 460, 56 So. 2d 89, 1951 Miss. LEXIS 519, 1952 Miss. LEXIS 340 (Miss. 1951).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the special tribunal held that votes of more than one-third of the voters in primary election for office of supervisor, were held void for failure to comply with mandatory provisions of the statute, it was impossible for one to reasonably say that result arrived at by the special tribunal represented the will of the voters. May v. Layton, 213 Miss. 129, 55 So. 2d 460, 56 So. 2d 89, 1951 Miss. LEXIS 519, 1952 Miss. LEXIS 340 (Miss. 1951).
      </p>
      <p>
       This provision of the statute was enacted for the purpose of precluding any possibility of any qualified electors being counted as having voted who were not present at the voting precinct on election day, and not to prevent qualified electors from being deprived of the right to vote. Briggs v. Gautier, 195 Miss. 472, 15 So. 2d 209, 1943 Miss. LEXIS 139 (Miss.), limited, Allen v. Funchess, 195 Miss. 486, 15 So. 2d 343, 1943 Miss. LEXIS 143 (Miss. 1943).

       The Corrupt Practices Act was designed to prevent election frauds and to prevent the election managers and others from “stuffing the ballot box”. Hayes v. Abney, 186 Miss. 208, 188 So. 533, 1939 Miss. LEXIS 209 (Miss. 1939).

       The fact that contestant received majority of votes in precinct did not preclude him from urging illegality of election at such precinct. Briggs v.

      </p>
      <p>
       Failure of election officers to require voters to sign their names in the receipt book or other record kept for the purpose before receiving a ballot to cast in the election renders the election void, since such requirement is mandatory. Briggs v. Gautier, 195 Miss. 472, 15 So. 2d 209, 1943 Miss. LEXIS 139 (Miss.), limited, Allen v. Funchess, 195 Miss. 486, 15 So. 2d 343, 1943 Miss. LEXIS 143 (Miss. 1943).
      </p>
      <p>
       The provision as to having the voter sign a receipt for his ballot is a prerequisite to his right to have a ballot and consequently to vote it, and in this respect the statute is mandatory. Hayes v. Abney, 186 Miss. 208, 188 So. 533, 1939 Miss. LEXIS 209 (Miss. 1939).
      </p>
      <p>
       The total departure from the provisions of this Act, by the election officers in making a list of the voters and without requiring a single voter to receipt for his ballot, was such a departure as rendered a municipal primary election void. Hayes v. Abney, 186 Miss. 208, 188 So. 533, 1939 Miss. LEXIS 209 (Miss. 1939).

       Counting and calling of the ballots for a voting precinct by two of the managers and their assistants in one room of courthouse while the remaining ballots were being counted and called by the other manager and his assistants in another room was a violation of this section [Code 1942, § 3164]. Briggs v. Gautier, 195 Miss. 472, 15 So. 2d 209, 1943 Miss. LEXIS 139 (Miss.), limited, Allen v. Funchess, 195 Miss. 486, 15 So. 2d 343, 1943 Miss. LEXIS 143 (Miss. 1943).
      </p>

       The voting public at a particular precinct is entitled to have a fair and full view of the counting and calling of the ballots as well as the holding of the election, which would be impossible if the ballots are divided for counting and some of them are being counted and called aloud at one place by one of the managers while the others are being counted and called aloud elsewhere by the other two managers. Briggs v. Gautier, 195 Miss. 472, 15 So. 2d 209, 1943 Miss. LEXIS 139 (Miss.), limited, Allen v. Funchess, 195 Miss. 486, 15 So. 2d 343, 1943 Miss. LEXIS 143 (Miss. 1943).
      </p>
      <p>
       Under this section [Code 1942, § 3164] all the managers, and not just one manager, are required to count the ballots, and whatever is done by the clerks is to be done in the presence of the managers and not in the presence of only one manager. Briggs v. Gautier, 195 Miss. 472, 15 So. 2d 209, 1943 Miss. LEXIS 139 (Miss.), limited, Allen v. Funchess, 195 Miss. 486, 15 So. 2d 343, 1943 Miss. LEXIS 143 (Miss. 1943).
      </p>
      <p>
       The right of the candidate to view and inspect the ballots as they are counted is denied if the managers are permitted to divide the ballots and count them at different places at one and the same time, unless the candidate is expected to anticipate such procedure and have a sufficient number of authorized representatives present. Briggs v. Gautier, 195 Miss. 472, 15 So. 2d 209, 1943 Miss. LEXIS 139 (Miss.), limited, Allen v. Funchess, 195 Miss. 486, 15 So. 2d 343, 1943 Miss. LEXIS 143 (Miss. 1943).

       Allegations and proof by a contestant on a petition for judicial review of a primary election that a number of illegal votes were cast and counted to change the result of the election was sufficient, and he was not required to prove that enough of the illegal votes were actually cast for the contestee to give him the apparent, although not real, majority.

       The rule that a contestant has the burden of proving the existence of illegal votes and that there were enough of such illegal votes cast for the contestee as to change the result of the election, applies as well to a party primary election for a nomination. Walker v. Smith, 213 Miss. 255, 57 So. 2d 166, 1952 Miss. LEXIS 360 (Miss. 1952).

      <p>
       Contestant is not bound to allege and prove as a condition precedent to a successful challenge of any particular ballot box that a decision in his favor as to that box alone would change the result of the election complained of, but he may show that the result of the election would be changed by having his challenge sustained. Briggs v. Gautier, 195 Miss. 472, 15 So. 2d 209, 1943 Miss. LEXIS 139 (Miss.), limited, Allen v. Funchess, 195 Miss. 486, 15 So. 2d 343, 1943 Miss. LEXIS 143 (Miss. 1943).

       The provisions of this section [Code 1942, § 3164] with respect to the initialing of ballots applies only to a primary election and does not require ballots in a general or special election to be initialed. Hubbard v. McKey, 193 So. 2d 129, 1966 Miss. LEXIS 1277 (Miss. 1966).
      </p>

       A new election should be offered either in the entire district or in the precincts involved, where a third of the ballots cast were invalidated by the failure of the installing manager to initial them. Wallace v. Leggett, 248 Miss. 121, 158 So. 2d 746, 1963 Miss. LEXIS 382 (Miss. 1963).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where primary election ballots were intitialed on the back and the initials were those of the receiving manager and not of the initialing manager, the ballots should not be counted. Starnes v. Middleton, 226 Miss. 81, 83 So. 2d 752, 1955 Miss. LEXIS 610 (Miss. 1955).
      </p>
      <p>
       The special tribunal committed no error in refusing to count ballots which were not initialed by the initialing manager of the election and which were improperly identified. Starnes v. Middleton, 226 Miss. 81, 83 So. 2d 752, 1955 Miss. LEXIS 610 (Miss. 1955).

       Failure of the initialing manager to initial a ballot renders such ballot illegal. Chinn v. Cousins, 201 Miss. 1, 27 So. 2d 882, 1946 Miss. LEXIS 351 (Miss. 1946).
      </p>
      <p>
       A special election with new managers, to be called by the governor pursuant to section 3187, Code 1942, was ordered in a precinct where none of the ballots cast were initialed by the initialing manager, the number of ballots there counted exceeding the difference in the vote counted for the two nominees, and the results in other precincts were allowed to stand after deduction of the few uninitialed ballots cast in those precincts.

       In a school district bond election contest, where there were marks on both places on ballot but it was manifest that the voter intended to strike out his original vote against the bonds, and by his clear mark to vote for the bonds, the ballot should have been counted. Tedder v. Board of Sup'rs, 214 Miss. 717, 59 So. 2d 329, 1952 Miss. LEXIS 512 (Miss. 1952).
      </p>
      <p>
       Fact that, pursuant to custom because of size of election district, two sets of election managers conducted the election at the voting place, did not render the votes cast thereat invalid, where one set of managers sat at one end of a table and received the ballots of persons whose names began with the letters “A” through “L,” and the other set of managers sat at the other end of the table and received the ballots of persons whose names began with “M” through “Z,” each set of managers using a separate ballot box and being assisted by separate clerks, and the ballots were counted and certified to by the respective managers who received them.

   Trial court was correct in overruling the decision of the Jefferson Davis County Democratic Executive Committee, to conduct a new election for the Democratic nominee for Jefferson Davis County Chancery Clerk. The requirements to hold a new election under
   Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t23c15s23-15-593" target="_self">23-15-593</a></cite> were not met, as §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t23c15s23-15-593" target="_self">23-15-593</a></cite> authorized new elections for individual precincts if the requirements were met, not a new election county or district wide. To have held a new election county wide, the Committee would had to have determined that all precincts failed in material particulars to comply with the requirements of
   Miss. Code Ann. §§<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t23c15s23-15-591" target="_self">23-15-591</a></cite> and

       What constitutes a substantial failure to comply in material particulars with the requirements of the statutes as to primary elections, so as to require the throwing out of a box or calling a new election, depends upon the facts and circumstances in each particular case including the nature of the procedural requirements violated, the scope of the violations, and the ratio of legal votes to the total votes cast. Walker v. Smith, 213 Miss. 255, 57 So. 2d 166, 1952 Miss. LEXIS 360 (Miss. 1952).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where there is a total departure from the mandatory provisions of the statute and it is not possible to ascertain the will of the electors because a substantial portion of the votes were void, a new election should be ordered for the purpose of ascertaining the voter’s choice. May v. Layton, 213 Miss. 129, 55 So. 2d 460, 56 So. 2d 89, 1951 Miss. LEXIS 519, 1952 Miss. LEXIS 340 (Miss. 1951).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the special tribunal held that votes of more than one-third of the voters in primary election for office of supervisor, were held void for failure to comply with mandatory provisions of the statute, it was impossible for one to reasonably say that result arrived at by the special tribunal represented the will of the voters. May v. Layton, 213 Miss. 129, 55 So. 2d 460, 56 So. 2d 89, 1951 Miss. LEXIS 519, 1952 Miss. LEXIS 340 (Miss. 1951).
      </p>

       § 23-15-593.
    Irregularities in ballot box.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      When the ballot box is opened and examined by the county executive committee in the case of a primary election, or county election commissioners in the case of other elections, and it is found that there have been failures in material particulars to comply with the requirements of Section 23-15-591 and Section 23-15-895 to such an extent that it is impossible to arrive at the will of the voters at such precinct, the entire box may be thrown out unless it be made to appear with reasonable certainty that the irregularities were not deliberately permitted or engaged in by the poll managers at that box, or by one (1) of them responsible for the wrong or wrongs, for the purpose of electing or defeating a certain candidate or candidates by manipulating the election or the returns thereof at that box in such manner as to have it thrown out; in which latter case the county executive committee, or the county election commission, as appropriate, shall conduct such hearing and make such determination in respect to the box as may appear lawfully just, subject to a judicial review of the matter as elsewhere provided by this chapter. Or the executive committee, or the election commission, or the court upon review, may order another election to be held at that box appointing new poll managers to hold the same.

   In a contested election for state representative, the trial court improperly issued a writ of mandamus requiring the election commission to certify the results and issued a writ of prohibition cancelling a re-vote as the commission’s decision to schedule a re-vote based on voting irregularities was discretionary and not a ministerial act; and scheduling a re-vote was within its authority under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t23c15s23-15-593" target="_self">23-15-593</a></cite> where voters were not allowed to vote because they were given the wrong ballots and incorrect poll books were used, thereby precluding an interpretation of the will of the voters.

   Trial court was correct in overruling the decision of the Jefferson Davis County Democratic Executive Committee, to conduct a new election for the Democratic nominee for Jefferson Davis County Chancery Clerk. The requirements to hold a new election under
   Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t23c15s23-15-593" target="_self">23-15-593</a></cite> were not met, as §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t23c15s23-15-593" target="_self">23-15-593</a></cite> authorized new elections for individual precincts if the requirements were met, not a new election county or district wide. To have held a new election county wide, the Committee would had to have determined that all precincts failed in material particulars to comply with the requirements of
   Miss. Code Ann. §§<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t23c15s23-15-591" target="_self">23-15-591</a></cite> and
  <cite class="ocms"><a href="#t23c15s23-15-895" target="_self">23-15-895</a></cite> to such an extent that it was impossible to arrive at the will of the voters; there was no evidence that there were violations of

     <p>
      The box containing the ballots and other records required by this chapter shall, immediately after the ballots have been counted, be delivered by one (1) of the poll managers to the clerk of the circuit court of the county and the clerk shall, in the presence of the poll manager making delivery of the box, place upon the lock of such box a tamper-evident seal. The seals shall be numbered consecutively to the number of ballot boxes used in the election in the county, and the clerk shall keep in a place separate from such boxes a record of the number of the seal of each separate box in the county. The board of supervisors of the county shall pay the cost of providing the seals. Upon demand of the chair of the county executive committee in the case of primary elections, or the county election commissioner in the case of other elections, the boxes and their contents shall be delivered to the county executive committee, or the county election commission, as appropriate, and after such committee or commission, as appropriate, has finished the work of tabulating returns and counting ballots as required by law, the committee or commission, as appropriate, shall return all papers and ballots to the box of the precinct where the election was held, and it shall make redelivery of the boxes and their contents to the circuit clerk who shall reseal the boxes. Upon every occasion the boxes shall be reopened and each resealing shall be done as provided in this chapter.

   In a contested election for state representative, the trial court improperly issued a writ of mandamus requiring the election commission to certify the results and issued a writ of prohibition cancelling a re-vote as the commission’s decision to schedule a re-vote based on voting irregularities was discretionary and not a ministerial act; and scheduling a re-vote was within its authority under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t23c15s23-15-593" target="_self">23-15-593</a></cite> where voters were not allowed to vote because they were given the wrong ballots and incorrect poll books were used, thereby precluding an interpretation of the will of the voters. In re Election for House of Representatives Dist. 71, 987 So. 2d 917, 2008 Miss. LEXIS 68 (Miss. 2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence supported determination of county democratic executive committee and election commission that voter’s signature on absentee ballot did not match signature on ballot envelope, and therefore, court’s order to committee to reconvene, open, and count such absentee ballot constituted reversible error; several persons involved in vote counting process determined that signatures did not match, voter’s testimony was unclear, and members of committee testified that candidate stated that voter’s daughter, rather than voter, signed ballot and envelope.
   Pegram v. Bailey, 708 So. 2d 1307, 1997 Miss. LEXIS 170 (Miss. 1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       Election commission does not have the authority to open ballots certified by election managers as rejected or challenged, and commission cannot override or review decision of election manager who marked ballot as rejected or challenged; duty of commission is merely to canvass sealed ballots to determine if requirements have been met. Misso v. Oliver, 666 So. 2d 1366, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 4 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Only power conferred, and only duty required of election commission, in relation to the canvass of votes, should be to count the votes, based upon returns as made by election managers, and to give certificates to those receiving majority of the votes; election commission should not go beyond or behind the returns, and reject votes, or accept votes previously rejected, or otherwise inquire into validity of conduct of election; election commission has no judicial discretion as to validity of rejected or contested votes. Misso v. Oliver, 666 So. 2d 1366, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 4 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>

       <p>
   Although a court could, if necessary, compel by mandamus an election commission to perform its statutory duty upon its failure to do so, or prohibit it by way of injunction or writ of prohibition from exceeding its statutory authority in some respect, use of an extraordinary writ cannot be extended to actually telling an election commission what action to take. Thus, a TRO should not have been entered to stop an election commission from performing its statutory duties under §§<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t23c15s23-15-601" target="_self">23-15-601</a></cite> and<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t23c15s23-15-603" target="_self">23-15-603</a></cite>.

      </p>
      <p>
       A candidate for municipal office, who withdrew from the party nomination after a second primary resulted in a tie between him and another and a third primary was called in violation of law, and who thereafter presented a petition signed by eighty-eight qualified electors of the town to have his name printed on the official ballot, was entitled to have his name printed on the official ballot as a candidate for the office in the general election, his participation in the first and second primaries being no bar to that course.

   In a contested election for state representative, the trial court improperly issued a writ of mandamus requiring the election commission to certify the results and issued a writ of prohibition cancelling a re-vote as the commission’s decision to schedule a re-vote based on voting irregularities was discretionary and not a ministerial act; and scheduling a re-vote was within its authority under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t23c15s23-15-593" target="_self">23-15-593</a></cite> where voters were not allowed to vote because they were given the wrong ballots and incorrect poll books were used, thereby precluding an interpretation of the will of the voters. In re Election for House of Representatives Dist. 71, 987 So. 2d 917, 2008 Miss. LEXIS 68 (Miss. 2008).

   Although a court could, if necessary, compel by mandamus an election commission to perform its statutory duty upon its failure to do so, or prohibit it by way of injunction or writ of prohibition from exceeding its statutory authority in some respect, use of an extraordinary writ cannot be extended to actually telling an election commission what action to take. Thus, a TRO should not have been entered to stop an election commission from performing its statutory duties under §§<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t23c15s23-15-601" target="_self">23-15-601</a></cite> and<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t23c15s23-15-603" target="_self">23-15-603</a></cite>.

       The 2017 amendment, in (1), substituted “poll managers” for “managers of elections” and “six (6) days” for “five (5) days,” and rewrote the last sentence, which read: “If it shall appear that any two (2) or more of the candidates receiving the highest number of votes shall have received an equal number of votes, the election shall be decided by lot, fairly and publicly drawn by the election commissioners with the aid of two (2) or more qualified electors of the municipality”; in (2), substituted “six (6) days” for “five (5) days” in (a), and inserted “(2)” following “this subsection” once each in (b) and (c) and twice in (d); and made minor stylistic changes.

   In a case challenging an order by a circuit court that a special election had to be held for sheriff because there were irregularities with the absentee ballots in the primary election, 103 ballots violated Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t23c15s23-15-627" target="_self">23-15-627</a></cite> because the blanks where the signatures of the official authorized to administer oaths for absentee balloting were, in fact, blank.

         All absentee voters, excepting those with temporary or permanent physical disabilities or those who are sixty-five (65) years of age or older, who mark their ballots in the county of the residence shall use the registrar of that county as the witness. The absentee voter shall come to the office of the registrar and neither the registrar nor his or her deputy shall be required to go out of the registrar’s office to serve as an attesting witness.
        </li>
        <li id="t23c15s23-15-631ol11b">
         Upon receipt of the enclosed ballot, you will not mark the ballot except in view or sight of the attesting witness. In the sight or view of the attesting witness, mark the ballot according to instructions.

         After marking the ballot, fill out and sign the “ELECTOR’S CERTIFICATE” on the back of the envelope so that the signature is across the flap of the envelope to ensure the integrity of the ballot. All absent electors shall have the attesting witness sign the “ATTESTING WITNESS CERTIFICATE” across the flap on the back of the envelope. Place the necessary postage on the envelope and deposit it in the post office or some government receptacle provided for deposit of mail so that the absent elector’s ballot, excepting presidential absentee ballots, will reach the registrar in which your precinct is located not later than 5:00 p.m. on the day preceding the date of the election.
         <p>
          Any notary public, United States postmaster, assistant United States postmaster, United States postal supervisor, clerk in charge of a contract postal station, or other officer having authority to administer an oath or take an acknowledgment may be an attesting witness; provided, however, that in the case of an absent elector who is temporarily or permanently physically disabled, the attesting witness may be any person eighteen (18) years of age or older and such person is not required to have the authority to administer an oath. If a postmaster, assistant postmaster, postal supervisor, or clerk in charge of a contract postal station acts as an attesting witness, his or her signature on the elector’s certificate must be authenticated by the cancellation stamp of their respective post offices. If an officer having authority to administer an oath or take an acknowledgement acts as attesting witness, his or her signature on the elector’s certificate, together with his or her title and address, but no seal, shall be required. Any affidavits made by an absent elector who is in the Armed Forces may be executed before a commissioned officer, warrant officer, or noncommissioned officer not lower in grade than sergeant rating or any person authorized to administer oaths.

The voter may be given assistance by anyone of the voter’s choice other than a candidate whose name appears on the absentee ballot being marked, the spouse, parent or child of a candidate whose name appears on the absentee ballot being marked or the voter’s employer, an agent of that employer or a union representative; however, a candidate whose name is on the ballot or the spouse, parent or child of such candidate may provide assistance upon request to any voter who is related within the first degree.

      </h4>
      <p>
       Laws of 1987, ch. 499, §§ 20, 21 and 22, provide as follows:
      </p>
      <p>
       “SECTION 20. If any section, paragraph, sentence, clause or phrase of this act is declared to be unconstitutional or void, or for any reason is declared to be invalid or of no effect, the remaining sections, paragraphs, sentences, clauses or phrases shall be in no manner affected thereby but shall remain in full force and effect.
      </p>
      <p>
       “SECTION 21. The Attorney General of the State of Mississippi is hereby directed to submit this act immediately upon its approval by the Legislature to the Attorney General of the United States or the United States District Court for the District of Columbia in accordance with the provisions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, as amended and extended.
      </p>
      <p>
       “SECTION 22. This act shall take effect and be in force from and after the date it is effectuated under the provisions of Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, as amended and extended.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Laws of 1987, ch. 499, § 12, proposed to amend
   Section 23-15-631 by deleting the phrase “or those who are sixty-five (65) years of age or older” from (1)(a), and by deleting a paragraph in (1)(c) which stated “Persons having temporary or permanent physical disabilities shall not be required to have the certificate of attesting witness signed.”
      </p>
      <p>
       On July 24, 1987, the United States Attorney General interposed no objection to the deletion of the paragraph in (1)(c), but did, however, reserve opinion about the deletion of the phrase concerning persons over sixty-five years of age, and requested additional information from the Mississippi Attorney General’s Office about such deletion.
      </p>
      <p>
       As set out above, the provisions of
   Section 23-15-631 appear as printed in Laws of 1987, ch. 499, § 12, with the EXCEPTION of the phrase concerning persons over sixty-five years of age in (1)(a) which has been retained from Laws of 1986, ch. 495, § 203, by direction of the Attorney General of the State of Mississippi.
      </p>
      <p>
       On June 21, 1999, the United States Attorney General interposed no objection under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, as amended and extended, to the amendment of this section by
   Laws of 1999, ch. 420, § 3.
      </p>
      <p>
       On July 28, 2000, the United States Attorney General interposed no objection under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to the amendment of this section by
   Laws, 2000, ch. 592.
      </p>
      <p>
       On June 5, 2006, the United States Attorney General interposed no objection under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, to the amendment of this section by
   Laws, 2006, ch. 574, § 18.
      </p>
      <p>
       The effective date of the bill that amended this section, Chapter 526, Laws of 2012 (House Bill No. 921), is “from and after the date it is effectuated under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, as amended and extended.” However, after the bill was submitted to the United States Attorney General under Section 5, the United States Supreme Court, in the case of
       <i>
        Shelby County v. Holder
       </i>
       (June 25, 2013), struck down the coverage formula that determined what jurisdictions are subject to Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, so the coverage formula can no longer be used as a basis for subjecting jurisdictions to preclearance under Section 5.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because of the
       <i>
        Shelby County
       </i>
       decision, the United States Attorney General is not making any determinations under Section 5 on voting or election changes made by states.
   The Supreme Court did not strike down Section 5, so it is still in effect.
   Chapter 526 was submitted to the United States Attorney General before the
       <i>
        Shelby County
       </i>
       decision was rendered.
   In a letter dated August 5, 2013, the United States Attorney General responded that he is not making determinations on the merits of any bill that is submitted under Section 5.
   The submission of Chapter 526 and the response from the United States Attorney General technically met the requirements of Section 5 and fulfilled the condition in the effective date of Chapter 526, so Chapter 526 became effective on the date of the response letter from the United States Attorney General, August 5, 2013.

       The 2000 amendment inserted “across the flap” in the second sentence of (1)(c).

   Circuit court properly found that mail-in absentee ballots that did not comply with Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t23c15s23-15-635ol11" target="_self">23-15-635(1)</a></cite> were illegal since strict compliance was necessary; however, once it found that a losing candidate received the greatest number of legal votes, it was error to order a special election instead of utilizing Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t23c15s23-15-951" target="_self">23-15-951</a></cite>. Ruhl v. Walton, 955 So. 2d 279, 2007 Miss. LEXIS 186 (Miss. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Although a disabled person’s signature on an absentee ballot envelope was not required to be sworn, the ballot could not be counted because no person had signed the ballot envelope as an attesting witness as required by Miss. Code Ann. §§<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t23c15s23-15-631ol11c" target="_self">23-15-631(1)(c)</a></cite> and<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t23c15s23-15-635" target="_self">23-15-635</a></cite>.

       Trial court erred in granting a candidate for county supervisor a directed verdict in election contest case, as the completion of as many as 30 absentee ballots by the candidate’s supporter on behalf of illiterate and/or disabled voters called into question the integrity of these ballots.

      </p>

       Under Mississippi’s election statutes, absentee ballots may be executed in one of 2 ways – by appearing in person before the county registrar and executing an application and ballot, or by requesting a ballot by mail and mailing it back.

       The United States Attorney General, by letter August 16, 1993, interposed no objection, under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, to the amendment of this section by
   Laws of 1993, ch. 528, § 9.
      </p>
      <p>
       On June 5, 2006, the United States Attorney General interposed no objection under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, to the amendment of this section by
   Laws of 2006, ch. 574, § 19.
      </p>
      <p>
       The effective date of the bill that amended this section, Chapter 526, Laws of 2012 (House Bill No. 921), is “from and after the date it is effectuated under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, as amended and extended.” However, after the bill was submitted to the United States Attorney General under Section 5, the United States Supreme Court, in the case of
       <i>
        Shelby County v. Holder
       </i>
       (June 25, 2013), struck down the coverage formula that determined what jurisdictions are subject to Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, so the coverage formula can no longer be used as a basis for subjecting jurisdictions to preclearance under Section 5.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because of the
       <i>
        Shelby County
       </i>
       decision, the United States Attorney General is not making any determinations under Section 5 on voting or election changes made by states.
   The Supreme Court did not strike down Section 5, so it is still in effect.
   Chapter 526 was submitted to the United States Attorney General before the
       <i>
        Shelby County
       </i>
       decision was rendered. In a letter dated August 5, 2013, the United States Attorney General responded that he is not making determinations on the merits of any bill that is submitted under Section 5.
   The submission of Chapter 526 and the response from the United States Attorney General technically met the requirements of Section 5 and fulfilled the condition in the effective date of Chapter 526, so Chapter 526 became effective on the date of the response letter from the United States Attorney General, August 5, 2013.

       Evidence supported determination of county democratic executive committee and election commission that voter’s signature on absentee ballot did not match signature on ballot envelope, and therefore, court’s order to committee to reconvene, open, and count such absentee ballot constituted reversible error; several persons involved in vote counting process determined that signatures did not match, voter’s testimony was unclear, and members of committee testified that candidate stated that voter’s daughter, rather than voter, signed ballot and envelope.

       Rejection of absentee ballot by election commissioners for “signature differences” between ballot and envelope was permissible under statute allowing rejection of absentee ballot for failure of signature on ballot and envelope to “correspond”; true intent of legislature was to disallow any ballot where signatures were different.

       Absentee ballots, although larger in size than home ballots and containing name of candidate who had not qualified, was a sufficient compliance with requirement that an absentee ballot be a regular ballot containing the names of persons to be voted for or against in primary elections, taking into consideration purpose of statute to permit soldiers to express their right of suffrage, and fact that such soldiers are in distant lands, making it necessary that ballots be sent to them early, although changes in ballots may be necessary because of death, disability or withdrawal of candidates in the interim before election.

However, such ballots shall be printed on paper of different tints or colors and shall be styled so as to show which ballot is to be used for the first election and which ballot is to be used for the second election.
     </p>
     <p>
      When the proper application is made as is otherwise provided herein, the registrar shall send to the absent voter the proper absent voter ballots for the elections as is otherwise provided herein, and with such ballots there shall be sent also separate official envelopes for the return thereof. No additional ballot shall be thereafter sent to the absent voter for the second election but the absent voter shall ascertain which of the candidates who originally qualified are candidates in the second election and he or she may vote for his choice between them on the second election ballot previously sent him. If an absentee voter shall vote for any candidate on the second election ballot who is not a candidate in the second election, his vote for that office shall be disregarded.

   Government properly established, for purposes of Fed. R. Civ. P. 52, that a political party executive committee and its chairman violated § 2 of the Voting Rights Act, 42 U.S.C.S. § 1973 [now 52 USCS § 10301], by intentionally diluting the voting power of white members of the party by obtaining large numbers of defective absentee ballots from black voters, facilitating improper counting of absentee ballots, and permitting improper assistance of black voters, contrary to the requirements of Miss. Code Ann. §§<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t23c15s23-15-263" target="_self">23-15-263</a></cite>,<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t23c15s23-15-715" target="_self">23-15-715</a></cite>, and<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t23c15s23-15-549" target="_self">23-15-549</a></cite>.

      </p>
      <p>
       Under Mississippi’s election statutes, absentee ballots may be executed in one of 2 ways-by appearing in person before the county registrar and executing an application and ballot, or by requesting a ballot by mail and mailing it back. Lewis v. Griffith, 664 So. 2d 177, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 450 (Miss. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   The language in §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t23c15s23-15-17" target="_self">23-15-17</a></cite> which sets forth the manner for applying for and executing absentee ballots is mandatory. Lewis v. Griffith, 664 So. 2d 177, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 450 (Miss. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       The statutes requiring a voter to request an absentee ballot, actually vote his or her own ballot, and place and seal the ballot in the provided envelope are intended to ensure the integrity of absentee ballots. Lewis v. Griffith, 664 So. 2d 177, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 450 (Miss. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       In performing statutory duties with respect to absentee ballots, the county registrar must perform in strict compliance with the statutes. Lewis v. Griffith, 664 So. 2d 177, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 450 (Miss. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       A town clerk’s actions were not in compliance with the statutes governing absentee ballots where she hand-delivered 3 absentee ballots to her able-bodied relatives after normal business hours, and the ballots were executed outside the town hall. Lewis v. Griffith, 664 So. 2d 177, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 450 (Miss. 1995).

        Editor’s Notes —
       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       On June 17, 1999, the United States Attorney General interposed no objection under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, as amended and extended, to the amendment of this section by
   Laws of 1999, ch. 420, § 5.
      </p>
      <p>
       On August 7, 2008, the United States Attorney General interposed no objection under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, as amended and extended, to the amendment of this section by
   Laws of 2008, ch. 528.
      </p>
      <p>
       The effective date of the bill that amended this section, Chapter 526, Laws of 2012 (House Bill No. 921), is “from and after the date it is effectuated under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, as amended and extended.”
   However, after the bill was submitted to the United States Attorney General under Section 5, the United States Supreme Court, in the case of
       <i>
        Shelby County v. Holder
       </i>
       (June 25, 2013), struck down the coverage formula that determined what jurisdictions are subject to Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, so the coverage formula can no longer be used as a basis for subjecting jurisdictions to preclearance under Section 5.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because of the
       <i>
        Shelby County
       </i>
       decision, the United States Attorney General is not making any determinations under Section 5 on voting or election changes made by states.
   The Supreme Court did not strike down Section 5, so it is still in effect.
   Chapter 526 was submitted to the United States Attorney General before the
       <i>
        Shelby County
       </i>
       decision was rendered.
   In a letter dated August 5, 2013, the United States Attorney General responded that he is not making determinations on the merits of any bill that is submitted under Section 5.
   The submission of Chapter 526 and the response from the United States Attorney General technically met the requirements of Section 5 and fulfilled the condition in the effective date of Chapter 526, so Chapter 526 became effective on the date of the response letter from the United States Attorney General, August 5, 2013.

     <p>
      Any presidential absentee ballots received by the registrar subsequent to the delivery of ballot boxes to the election managers and prior to the time for the closing of the polls on election day shall be retained by the registrar and shall be delivered, together with the applications of the qualified absentee elector to an election official designated to receive them. The registrar shall receive a receipt from the designated election official for all such ballots and applications delivered. The designated election officials shall, upon the canvassing of the returns, count such ballots as if delivered to the proper precincts and such ballots shall be considered valid for all purposes as if they had been actually deposited in the proper precinct ballot boxes. The appropriate election officials shall examine the affidavit of each envelope. If the officials are satisfied that the affidavit is sufficient and that the absentee voter is otherwise qualified to vote, an official shall announce the name of the voter and shall give any person present an opportunity to challenge in like manner and for the same cause as the voter could have been challenged had he presented himself personally in such precinct to vote. The ineligibility of the voter to vote by absentee ballot shall be a ground for a challenge. The officials shall consider any absentee voter challenged when a person has previously filed a written challenge of such voter’s right to vote. The election officials shall handle any such challenge in the same manner as other challenged ballots are handled, and if the challenge is not affirmed, the officials shall then open the envelope. The officials shall then open the envelope in such manner as not to destroy the affidavit printed thereon and shall deposit the ballot marked “OFFICIAL ABSENTEE BALLOT,” in a ballot box reserved for absentee ballots. The commissioners shall endorse on their pollbooks a proper notation to indicate that the absentee voter has voted in such election by absentee ballot.

       § 23-15-813.
    Civil penalty for failure to file campaign finance disclosure report; notice to candidate of failure to file; assessment of penalty by Mississippi Ethics Commission; hearing; appeal.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      In addition to any other penalty permitted by law, the Mississippi Ethics Commission shall require any candidate or political committee, as identified in Section 23-15-805(a), and any other political committee registered with the Secretary of State, who fails to file a campaign finance disclosure report as required under Sections 23-15-801 through 23-15-813, or Sections 23-17-47 through 23-17-53, or who shall file a report that fails to substantially comply with the requirements of Sections 23-15-801 through 23-15-813, or Sections 23-17-47 through 23-17-53, to be assessed a civil penalty as follows:
     </p>
     <p>
      Within five (5) calendar days after any deadline for filing a report pursuant to Sections 23-15-801 through 23-15-813, or Sections 23-17-47 through 23-17-53, the Secretary of State shall compile a list of those candidates and political committees who have failed to file a report. The list shall be provided to the Mississippi Ethics Commission. The Secretary of State shall provide each candidate or political committee, who has failed to file a report, notice of the failure by first-class mail.
     </p>
     <p>
      Beginning with the tenth calendar day after which any report is due, the Mississippi Ethics Commission shall assess the delinquent candidate and political committee a civil penalty of Fifty Dollars ($50.00) for each day or part of any day until a valid report is delivered to the Secretary of State, up to a maximum of ten (10) days. In the discretion of the Mississippi Ethics Commission, the assessing of the fine may be waived, in whole or in part, if the Commission determines that unforeseeable mitigating circumstances, such as the health of the candidate, interfered with the timely filing of a report. Failure of a candidate or political committee to receive notice of failure to file a report from the Secretary of State is not an unforeseeable mitigating circumstance, and failure to receive the notice shall not result in removal or reduction of any assessed civil penalty.
     </p>
     <p>
      Filing of the required report and payment of the fine within ten (10) calendar days of notice by the Secretary of State that a required statement has not been filed constitutes compliance with Sections 23-15-801 through 23-15-813, or Sections 23-17-47 through 23-17-53.
     </p>
     <p>
      Payment of the fine without filing the required report does not excuse or exempt any person from the filing requirements of Sections 23-15-801 through 23-15-813, and Sections 23-17-47 through 23-17-53.
     </p>
     <p>
      If any candidate or political committee is assessed a civil penalty, and the penalty is not subsequently waived by the Mississippi Ethics Commission, the candidate or political committee shall pay the fine to the Commission within ninety (90) days of the date of the assessment of the fine. If, after one hundred twenty (120) days of the assessment of the fine the payment for the entire amount of the assessed fine has not been received by the Commission, the Commission shall notify the Attorney General of the delinquency, and the Attorney General shall file, where necessary, a suit to compel payment of the civil penalty.
     </p>
     <p>
      (i) Upon the sworn application, made within sixty (60) calendar days of the date upon which the required report is due, of a candidate or political committee against whom a civil penalty has been assessed pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary of State shall forward the application to the State Board of Election Commissioners. The State Board of Election Commissioners shall appoint one or more hearing officers who shall be former chancellors, circuit court judges, judges of the Court of Appeals or justices of the Supreme Court, to conduct hearings held pursuant to this article. The hearing officer shall fix a time and place for a hearing and shall cause a written notice specifying the civil penalties that have been assessed against the candidate or political committee and notice of the time and place of the hearing to be served upon the candidate or political committee at least twenty (20) calendar days before the hearing date. The notice may be served by mailing a copy of the notice by certified mail, postage prepaid, to the last-known business address of the candidate or political committee.
     </p>
     <p>
      The hearing officer may issue subpoenas for the attendance of witnesses and the production of documents at the hearing. Process issued by the hearing officer shall extend to all parts of the state and shall be served by any person designated by the hearing officer for the service.
     </p>
     <p>
      The candidate or political committee has the right to appear either personally, by counsel or both, to produce witnesses or evidence in his or her behalf, to cross-examine witnesses and to have subpoenas issued by the hearing officer.
     </p>
     <p>
      At the hearing, the hearing officer shall administer oaths as may be necessary for the proper conduct of the hearing. All hearings shall be conducted by the hearing officer, who shall not be bound by strict rules of procedure or by the laws of evidence, but the determination shall be based upon sufficient evidence to sustain it. The scope of review at the hearing shall be limited to making a determination of whether failure to file a required report was due to an unforeseeable mitigating circumstance.
     </p>
     <p>
      In any proceeding before the hearing officer, if any witness fails or refuses to attend upon a subpoena issued by the commission, refuses to testify, or refuses to produce any documents called for by a subpoena, the attendance of the witness, the giving of his or her testimony or the production of the documents shall be enforced by a court of competent jurisdiction of this state in the manner provided for the enforcement of attendance and testimony of witnesses in civil cases in the courts of this state.
     </p>
     <p>
      Within fifteen (15) calendar days after conclusion of the hearing, the hearing officer shall reduce his or her decision to writing and forward an attested true copy of the decision to the last-known business address of the candidate or political committee by way of United States first-class, certified mail, postage prepaid.
     </p>
     <p>
      (i) The right to appeal from the decision of the hearing officer in an administrative hearing concerning the assessment of civil penalties authorized pursuant to this section is granted. The appeal shall be to the Circuit Court of Hinds County and shall include a verbatim transcript of the testimony at the hearing. The appeal shall be taken within thirty (30) calendar days after notice of the decision of the commission following an administrative hearing. The appeal shall be perfected upon filing notice of the appeal and the prepayment of all costs, including the cost of preparing the record of the proceedings by the hearing officer, and filing a bond in the sum of Two Hundred Dollars ($200.00), conditioned that if the decision of the hearing officer is affirmed by the court, the candidate or political committee will pay the costs of the appeal and the action in court. If the decision is reversed by the court, the Mississippi Ethics Commission will pay the costs of the appeal and the action in court.
     </p>
     <p>
      If there is an appeal, the appeal shall act as a supersedeas. The court shall dispose of the appeal and enter its decision promptly. The hearing on the appeal may be tried in vacation, in the court’s discretion. The scope of review of the court shall be limited to a review of the record made before the hearing officer to determine if the action of the hearing officer is unlawful for the reason that it was 1. not supported by substantial evidence, 2. arbitrary or capricious, 3. beyond the power of the hearing officer to make, or 4. in violation of some statutory or constitutional right of the appellant. The decision of the court may be appealed to the Supreme Court in the manner provided by law.
     </p>
     <p>
      If, after forty-five (45) calendar days of the date of the administrative hearing procedure set forth in subsection (b), the candidate or political committee identified in subsection (a) of this section fails to pay the monetary civil penalty imposed by the hearing officer, the Secretary of State shall notify the Attorney General of the delinquency. The Attorney General shall investigate the offense in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, and where necessary, file suit to compel payment of the unpaid civil penalty.
     </p>
     <p>
      If, after twenty (20) calendar days of the date upon which a campaign finance disclosure report is due, a candidate or political committee identified in subsection (a) of this section shall not have filed a valid report with the Secretary of State, the Secretary of State shall notify the Attorney General of those candidates and political committees who have not filed a valid report, and the Attorney General shall prosecute the delinquent candidates and political committees.

      Except as otherwise provided by law, the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November of each year shall be designated the regular special election day, and on that day an election shall be held to fill any vacancy in county, county district, and district attorney elective offices, and any vacancy in the office of circuit judge or chancellor.

       Although a vacancy on a county board of supervisors will be filled pursuant to special election proceedings under Miss.

   Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t23c15s23-15-855" target="_self">23-15-855</a></cite> is silent regarding the situation in which a senatorial vacancy occurs after a general state or congressional election, and the statute fails to implement the specific power granted to the legislature by the Seventeenth Amendment for directing the filling of the vacancy by election. As such, the general power granted to the executive branch of the state by the Seventeenth Amendment to issue writs of election is controlling. Barbour v. State ex rel.

   As portions of Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t23c15s23-15-855" target="_self">23-15-855</a></cite> were ambiguous, and others silent, a writ of election issued by the Governor on December 20, 2007, designating November 4, 2008, as the general election day for electing a U.S. Senator to complete the term of office of a Senator who had resigned was not constitutionally infirm. The circuit court erred, as a matter of law, in deeming §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t23c15s23-15-855" target="_self">23-15-855</a></cite> plain, clear, and unambiguous, and then finding the writ of election exceeded the Governor’s constitutional and statutory authority.

       When there is a vacancy in an elective office in a city, town or village, the unexpired term of which shall not exceed six (6) months, the same shall be filled by appointment by the governing authority or remainder of the governing authority of the city, town or village. The municipal clerk shall certify the appointment to the Secretary of State and the appointed person or persons shall be commissioned by the Governor.
      </li>
      <li id="t23c15s23-15-857ol12">
       When there is a vacancy in an elective office in a city, town or village, the unexpired term of which shall exceed six (6) months, the governing authority or remainder of the governing authority of the city, town or village shall make and enter on the minutes an order for an election to be held in the city, town or village to fill the vacancy and fix a date upon which the election shall be held. The order shall be made and entered upon the minutes at the next regular meeting of the governing authority after the vacancy occurs, or at a special meeting to be held not later than ten (10) days after the vacancy occurs, Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays excluded, whichever shall occur first. The election shall be held on a date not less than thirty (30) days nor more than forty-five (45) days after the date upon which the order is adopted.
       <p>
        Notice of the election shall be given by the municipal clerk by notice published in a newspaper published in the municipality. The notice shall be published once each week for three (3) successive weeks preceding the date of the election. The first notice shall be published at least thirty (30) days before the date of the election. Notice shall also be given by posting a copy of the notice at three (3) public places in the municipality not less than twenty-one (21) days before the date of the election. One (1) of the notices shall be posted at the city, town or village hall. In the event that there is no newspaper published in the municipality, such notice shall be published as provided for above in a newspaper that has a general circulation within the municipality and by posting as provided for above. Additionally, the governing authority may publish the notice in that newspaper for as many additional times as may be deemed necessary by the governing authority.
       </p>
       <p>
        Each candidate shall qualify by petition filed with the municipal clerk by 5:00 p.m. at least twenty (20) days before the date of the election. If the twentieth day to file the petition before the election falls on a Sunday or legal holiday, the petition filed on the business day immediately following the Sunday or legal holiday shall be accepted. The petition shall be signed by not less than the following number of qualified electors:
       </p>
       <ol type="a">
        <li id="t23c15s23-15-857ol12a">
         For an office of a city, town, village or municipal district having a population of one thousand (1,000) or more, not less than fifty (50) qualified electors.

         <p>
          No qualifying fee shall be required of any candidate, and the election shall be held as far as practicable in the same manner as municipal general elections.
         </p>
         <p>
          The candidate receiving a majority of the votes cast in the election shall be elected. If no candidate receives a majority vote at the election, the two (2) candidates receiving the highest number of votes shall have their names placed on the ballot for the election to be held three (3) weeks thereafter. The candidate receiving a majority of the votes cast in the election shall be elected. However, if no candidate receives a majority and there is a tie in the election of those receiving the next highest vote, those receiving the next highest vote and the candidate receiving the highest vote shall have their names placed on the ballot for the election to be held three (3) weeks thereafter, and whoever receives the most votes cast in the election shall be elected.
         </p>
         <p>
          Should the election held three (3) weeks thereafter result in a tie vote, the prevailing candidate shall be decided by a toss of a coin or by lot fairly and publicly drawn under the supervision of the election commission.
         </p>
         <p>
          The clerk of the election commission shall then give a certificate of election to the person elected, and return to the Secretary of State a copy of the order of holding the election and runoff election results, certified by the clerk of the governing authority. The person elected shall be commissioned by the Governor.
         </p>
         <p>
          However, if nineteen (19) days before the date of the election only one (1) person shall have qualified as a candidate, the governing authority, or remainder of the governing authority, shall dispense with the election and appoint that one (1) candidate in lieu of an election. In the event no person shall have qualified by 5:00 p.m. at least twenty (20) days before the date of the election, the governing authority or remainder of the governing authority shall dispense with the election and fill the vacancy by appointment. The clerk of the governing authority shall certify the appointment to the Secretary of State, and the appointed person shall be commissioned by the Governor.

      <p>
       If a town forgoes holding a general election in the event no person qualifies to run in that election, the incumbent officials would hold over after the expiration of their regular terms of office until such time as new officers are elected; further any action taken by those officers during this hold-over period would be valid and binding as official acts. 2001 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 254.
      </p>
      <p>
       As the Special Charter of a city contains provisions which establish the time frame in which a special election to fill a vacancy shall be held, there is no need to refer to general law, and the provisions of the Charter would control. 2003 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 269.
      </p>
      <p>
       If only one person qualifies to run for office to fill a vacancy in a special charter municipality as of the day after the date established for qualification, the governing authorities of the city would have the authority to fill the vacancy by appointment of the person who has qualified, without having the election. 2003 Miss.

       Where a vacancy exists on a town board of alderman which has persisted for several months without being filled as required by this section, and a quorum of the board
   has failed to meet to conduct the necessary business of the town, as a way of moving
   the apparent impasse, the mayor should set at the next and subsequent meetings of the board as the first item on the agenda the matter of filling the vacancy on the board by declaring the vacancy and ordering a special election to be held between 30 and 45 calendar days after the date of the order and fill the vacancy. 2004 Miss.

      <p>
       An incumbent alderman who served for the preceding term in an office for which no candidate has filed a valid qualifying petition for the upcoming term could “hold over” in accordance with Sections 21-15-1 and 25-1-7, until a special election to fill a vacancy is held as required by Section 23-15-857, assuming his bond remains in effect. 2005 Miss.

   There is no authority for municipal governing authorities to remove or suspend an elected police chief based on an indictment. A municipal governing authority may make the police chief or other municipal officers appointive, rather than elective, by adopting an ordnance, not within 90 days of an election, that will become effective when the current officer’s term expires.

       While the special tribunal correctly found that a special election was required, it erred in excluding a losing candidate from the special election because a general election had already occurred and the statutes at issue did not limit a special election to certain candidates.

   Where the voters, residing in various wards within a city, alleged that the city violated the U.S. Constitution’s one person, one vote principle by refusing to re-evaluate population deviations within the city’s ward scheme in light of the 2000 decennial census figures and a 1993 annexation, and in failing for over 10 years to propose a redistricting plan to the United States Department of Justice that would pass constitutional muster and receive preclearance under § 5 of the Voting Rights Act, 42 U.S.C.S. § 1973c, the district court declared vacant the offices of city council and mayor, and the district court ordered a special election. The court found that the special election procedure in Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t23c15s23-15-857" target="_self">23-15-857</a></cite> was remedially appropriate. Garrard v.

     <p>
      Whenever under any statute a special election is required or authorized to be held in any municipality, and the statute authorizing or requiring the election does not specify the time within which the election shall be called, or the notice which shall be given, the governing authorities of the municipality shall, by resolution, fix a date upon which the election shall be held. The date shall not be less than twenty-one (21) nor more than thirty (30) days after the date upon which such resolution is adopted, and not less than three (3) weeks’ notice of the election shall be given by the clerk by a notice published in a newspaper published in the municipality once each week for three (3) weeks next preceding the date of the election, and by posting a copy of the notice at three (3) public places in the municipality. Nothing herein, however, shall be applicable to elections on the question of the issuance of the bonds of a municipality or to general or primary elections for the election of municipal officers.
     </p>
     <p>
      The provisions of this section shall be applicable to all municipalities of this state, whether operating under a code charter, special charter or the commission form of government, except in cases of conflicts between the provisions of the section and the provisions of the special charter of a municipality, or the law governing the commission form of government, in which cases of conflict the provisions of the special charter or the statutes relative to the commission form of government shall apply.

      <p>
       As the Special Charter of a city contain provisions which establish the time frame in which a special election to fill a vacancy shall be held, there is no need to refer to general law, and the provisions of the Charter would control. 2003 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 269.
      </p>
      <p>
       While a city’s special charter provides for a time frame in which to hold a special election to fill a vacancy in a municipal office, but is silent as to the proper publication of such election, using Section 23-15-859 as guidance on the question of publication is reasonable and within the authority of the governing authorities of the city. 2003 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 269.

     <p>
      If during any election campaign in Mississippi any newspaper either domiciled in the state, or outside of the state circulating inside the State of Mississippi, shall print any editorial or news story reflecting upon the honesty or integrity or moral character of any candidate in such campaign or on the honesty and integrity or moral character of any candidate who was elected or defeated in such campaign, such newspaper shall, on the written or telegraphic request of such candidate or his agents, print in such newspaper not later than the second issue of such newspaper following the receipt of such request, a statement by the candidate or his duly accredited representative giving the candidate’s reply. Such statement shall be printed in the exact language which the candidate or his representative presents and shall be printed as near as is practical on the same page, in the same position, and in the same size type and headlines as the original editorial or news story reflecting on the candidate had been printed.
     </p>
     <p>
      This section shall be construed to include those news stories wherein the newspaper quotes from a candidate or individual statements attacking the honesty or integrity or moral character of a candidate or ex-candidate.
     </p>
     <p>
      If such newspaper fails or refuses to publish such answer when requested, the owner of such newspaper shall be liable to a suit for damages by the candidate claiming to be injured by such publication. In event of a verdict in favor of the plaintiff, the measure of damages shall be the injury suffered or a penalty of Five Hundred Dollars ($500.00), whichever is the larger amount. In all cases, the truth of the charge may be offered as defense to the suit. But nothing herein contained shall be construed to abolish any existing legal rights of action in such cases.

       This section [Code 1942, § 3175] does not require that the publisher of a newspaper make amends for an unjust criticism of a candidate for public office by printing the candidate’s reply, except in cases where the editorial and news story reflects upon the honesty, or integrity or moral character of the candidate. Manasco v. Walley, 216 Miss. 614, 63 So. 2d 91, 1953 Miss. LEXIS 677 (Miss. 1953).

       The word “moral” means righteous or upright. Manasco v. Walley, 216 Miss. 614, 63 So. 2d 91, 1953 Miss. LEXIS 677 (Miss. 1953).
      </p>
      <p>
       The word “integrity” means moral soundness, freedom from corrupting influence or practice. Manasco v. Walley, 216 Miss. 614, 63 So. 2d 91, 1953 Miss. LEXIS 677 (Miss. 1953).
      </p>
      <p>
       The word “honesty” means fairness and straight-forwardness of conduct, integrity, freedom from fraud. Manasco v. Walley, 216 Miss. 614, 63 So. 2d 91, 1953 Miss. LEXIS 677 (Miss. 1953).
      </p>
      <p>
       The word “reflect” as used in this section [Code 1942, § 3175] means to cast aspersion or reproach. Manasco v. Walley, 216 Miss. 614, 63 So. 2d 91, 1953 Miss. LEXIS 677 (Miss. 1953).

      <p>
       In an action for damages for defamation based upon statute making newspaper liable if it refuses to publish candidate’s answer to editorial or a news story reflecting upon his honesty, integrity or moral character, the meaning of the editorial must be ascertained from the language used, as commonly understood.

      It shall be unlawful for the Mississippi Transportation Commission or any member of the Mississippi Transportation Commission, or the board of supervisors of any county or any member of the board of supervisors of such county, to employ, during the months of May, June, July and August of any year in which a general primary election is held for the nomination and election of members of the Mississippi Transportation Commission and members of the boards of supervisors, a greater number of persons to work and maintain the state highways, in any highway district, or the public roads, in any supervisors district of the county, as the case may be, than the average number of persons employed for similar purposes in such highway district or supervisors district, as the case may be, during the months of May, June, July and August of the three (3) years immediately preceding the year in which such general primary election is held. It shall be unlawful for the Mississippi Transportation Commission, or the board of supervisors of any county, to expend out of the state highway funds, or the road funds of the county or any supervisors district thereof, as the case may be, in the payment of wages or other compensation for labor performed in working and maintaining the highways of any highway district, or the public roads of any supervisors district of the county, as the case may be, during the months of May, June, July and August of such election year, a total amount in excess of the average total amount expended for such labor, in such highway district or supervisors district, as the case may be, during the corresponding four-month period of the three (3) years immediately preceding.
     </p>
     <p>
      It shall be the duty of the Mississippi Transportation Commission and the board of supervisors of each county, respectively, to keep sufficient records of the numbers of employees and expenditures made for labor on the state highways of each highway district, and the public roads of each supervisors district, for the months of May, June, July and August of each year, to show the number of persons employed for such work in each highway district and each supervisors district, as the case may be, during said four-month period, and the total amount expended in the payment of salaries and other compensation to such employees, so that it may be ascertained, from an examination of such records, whether or not the provisions of this chapter have been violated.

   Violations of the 150-foot rule of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t23c15s23-15-895" target="_self">23-15-895</a></cite>, which prohibits any candidate or any candidate’s representative from posting or distributing campaign literature within 150 feet of any building where an election is being held, will not necessarily require throwing out a precinct box. Where the violations involve “failures in material particulars . . .
   to such an extent that it is impossible to arrive at the will of the voters at such precinct,” the entire box may be thrown out; however, if it appears “with reasonable certainty” that the violations were not condoned by any of the election precinct managers for the purpose of electing or defeating a certain candidate, then a hearing should be held and the commission or executive committee should make such determination as is just. The statute does not rule out an order, either by the election body or the court in review, to hold another election at that precinct with new managers. Rizzo v. Bizzell, 530 So. 2d 121, 1988 Miss.

      <p>
       The 2017 amendment rewrote the section, which read: “No person shall write, print, post or distribute or cause to be distributed, a notice, placard, bill, poster, dodger, pamphlet, advertisement or any other form of publication (except notices, posters, and the like, which simply announce speaking date and invite attendance thereon) which is designed to influence voters for or against any candidate at any election, unless and until the same shall have been submitted to, and approved and subscribed by the candidate or by his campaign manager or assistant manager, which subscription shall in all cases be printed as so subscribed, and not otherwise. As, for instance, it shall be unlawful to write, print, post, distribute or cause to be written, printed, posted or distributed any such matter when the authority therefor is designated simply as ‘paid political advertisement,’ or ‘contributed by a friend,’ or ‘contributed by the friends and supporters,’ and the like. Nor shall any radio or television station allow any time or place on any of its programs for any address for or against any candidate at any election, except in accordance with the provisions of the federal statutes and the rules and regulations of the Federal Communications Commission as applied to the use of radio and television facilities by a candidate or candidates for office. But the aforesaid written or printed matter and the time for radio and television addresses shall be paid for at the usual and ordinary rates, and only by a person authorized to make expenditures in behalf of the candidate, as is provided in this chapter in regard to other expenditures.

       The United States Attorney General, by letter dated August 16, 1993, interposed no objection, under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, to certain changes occasioned by Laws of 1993, ch. 528. However, with respect to procedures for processing complaints alleging election law violations, the Attorney General concluded that the information submitted was insufficient to support a determination that the proposed change did not have the purpose and would not have the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race or color, as required by Section 5, and requested additional information.

       Laws of 1993, ch. 528, § 19, provides as follows:

       The 2000 amendment added (2).

       The 2017 amendment rewrote (1), which read: “When the returns for a box and the contents of the ballot box and the conduct of the election thereat have been canvassed and reviewed by the county election commission in the case of general elections or the county executive committee in the case of primary elections, all the contents of the box required to be placed and sealed in the ballot box by the managers shall be replaced therein by the election commission or executive committee, as the case may be, and the box shall be forthwith resealed and delivered to the circuit clerk, who shall safely keep and secure the same against any tampering therewith. At any time within twelve (12) days after the canvass and examination of the box and its contents by the election commission or executive committee, as the case may be, any candidate or his representative authorized in writing by him shall have the right of full examination of said box and its contents upon three (3) days’ notice of his application therefor served upon the opposing candidate or candidates, or upon any member of their family over the age of eighteen (18) years, which examination shall be conducted in the presence of the circuit clerk or his deputy who shall be charged with the duty to see that none of the contents of the box are removed from the presence of the clerk or in any way tampered with.

      <p>
       No statute specifically makes it a crime to fail to comply with the statute in general, although willful violations of law are provided for in Section 97-13-19. 2000 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 703.
      </p>
      <p>
       This section contemplates that once the examination by a candidate begins it is to be a continuous one from day to day until completion. It is our opinion that once the examination is completed and the boxes resealed a second examination by that candidate is not contemplated or authorized. 2003 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 517.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a letter of complaint apparently seeking an examination of ballot boxes was received by the circuit clerk more than 12 days after certification of the election results by the county election commission, and there was no indication that the other candidates were given the required notice,
   no examination could be conducted. 2003 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 661.

       Circuit court properly granted summary judgment to a winning candidate and the political party’s executive committee in a losing candidate’s action for a new primary election based on ballot box security issues because, while the losing candidate made largely uncontradicted allegations of lapses in ballot-box security, he made no allegations of illegal voting and no specific allegations of fraudulent election activity.

       Allowance of appeal with supersedeas from writ of mandamus ordering circuit clerk to permit candidate to examine ballot boxes after primary election as provided by the Corrupt Practices Act was an abuse of discretion, where such allowance had the practice or effect of denying the writ so far as affording any relief before the day of the general election, and it appeared on review that the appeal was without merit and instituted for the purpose of delay.

       The 2012 amendment substituted “selected to hear election disputes” for “listed and selected to hear election disputes as provided in Section 23-15-951, Mississippi Code of 1972” in the first sentence and substituted “send judges to the sites of disputes” for “make judges available to hear disputes in the county in which the disputes occur” and made a related change in the fourth sentence.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 2017 amendment, in the first sentence, inserted “listed and” and “as provided in Section 23-15-951”; and in the next-to-last sentence, deleted “subdistrict” following “district” and made a gender neutral change.

      </h4>
      <p>
       A party executive committee is under an obligation to dispose of an election contest sufficiently in advance of the general election as will allow the orderly preparation of the ballot and conduct of said election by the county election commission. 1991 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 886.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the executive committee delays disposing of the contest and the election commission proceeds to have the ballots for the general election printed with the certified nominee’s name included thereon and, in this case, conducts the general election and certifies the nominee in question as the winner, the committee, loses its jurisdiction over the matter and any findings by the committee thereafter would be of no effect. 1991 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 886.
      </p>
      <p>
       Absent an election contest, this section provides no authority to conduct an investigation with regard to an election result. 2003 Miss. Op. Att'y Gen. 471.

   While the candidate did not file the candidate’s earlier petition contesting the election with a member of the Houston Democratic Executive Committee pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t23c15s23-15-921" target="_self">23-15-921</a></cite>, the candidate did later file a petition with the committee; the statute does not prohibit submission of an additional petition, and thus the winner’s argument concerning the specificity of the earlier petition was irrelevant since the candidate submitted a more specific petition seven days later, the specificity of which the winner did not challenge. Moore v. Parker, 962 So. 2d 558, 2007 Miss. LEXIS 476 (Miss. 2007).

       Nothing in the statute limits the committee’s inquiry regarding the contesting of a primary election to allegations of fraud. Upton v. McKenzie, 761 So. 2d 167, 2000 Miss. LEXIS 136 (Miss. 2000).

       When a political party Executive Committee meets to hear charges of irregularity concerning primary election contests, it sits as a quasi judicial body whose specific responsibility is to ensure the public of honest elections. The Chairman of the Committee is analogous to a judge and, in regards to recusal, an objective test is followed whereby “a judge is required to disqualify himself if a reasonable person, knowing all the circumstances, would harbor doubts about his impartiality.” Pearson v.

A petition for judicial review must be filed within ten (10) days after any contest or complaint has been filed with an executive committee. The petition for a judicial review shall not be filed unless it bears the certificate of two (2) practicing attorneys stating that they have each fully made an independent investigation into the matters of fact and of law upon which the protest and petition are based, and that after the investigation they believe that the protest and petition should be sustained and that the relief prayed in the protest and petitions should be granted; the two (2) attorneys may not be practicing in the same law firm. The petitioner shall give a cost bond in the sum of Three Hundred Dollars ($300.00), with two (2) or more sufficient sureties conditioned to pay all costs in case his petition be dismissed, and an additional bond may be required, by the judge, if necessary, at any subsequent stage of the proceedings. The filing of the petition for judicial review in the manner set forth in this section shall automatically supersede and suspend the operation and effect of the order, ruling or judgment of the executive committee appealed from.

   former third sentence as the third and fourth sentences and inserted “in the protest and petitions” and “the two (2) attorneys may not be practicing in the same law firm” in the third sentence; and made minor stylistic changes throughout.

   Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t23c15s23-15-927" target="_self">23-15-927</a></cite> did not impermissibly violate separation of powers or Miss. Const. art. 6, § 146; rather, the judicial relief sought under the election code was unique unto itself and established by statute, until the process reached the Mississippi Supreme Court, where procedure was controlled by the Mississippi Rules of Appellate Procedure. Jackson v. Bell, 123 So.3d 436, 2013 Miss. LEXIS 549 (Miss. 2013).

   Appeal from a decision in an election contest concerning a primary mayoral race was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.09.html#t09c03s9-3-9" target="_blank">9-3-9</a></cite> because documents required under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t23c15s23-15-927" target="_self">23-15-927</a></cite> were not included in the appellate record. Moore v. Parker, 2007 Miss. LEXIS 127 (Miss.

   In a contest concerning a county election, a special tribunal had subject matter because the losing candidate’s petition for judicial review complied with Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t23c01s23-1-927" target="_self">23-1-927</a></cite>; no sworn document was required in front of a county committee, the verification was sufficient, the petition for judicial review did not exceed the scope of the initial complaint, and the cost bond requirement was satisfied. Waters v. Gnemi, 907 So. 2d 307, 2005 Miss. LEXIS 321 (Miss. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       The statute does not define any specific irregularities which may be reviewed by a specific county executive committee, but rather provides for the filing of a petition in the circuit court where a county executive committee delays or denies relief to the petitioner. The irregularities which may be reviewed are not limited to such things as discrepancies in vote counting, the number of voters signing the registration book as compared to the number of ballots in the ballot box, illegal votes, and the security of the ballot box. Upton v. McKenzie, 761 So. 2d 167, 2000 Miss. LEXIS 136 (Miss. 2000).
      </p>

   Amendment of a petition for judicial review of an election contest is permitted under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t23c15s23-15-927" target="_self">23-15-927</a></cite> since Rule 15, Miss. R. Civ. P. permits such an amendment and there is nothing in the statutes conflicting with the rules regarding amendments. Pearson v. Parsons, 541 So. 2d 447, 1989 Miss. LEXIS 143 (Miss. 1989).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   A petition for judicial review of an election contest was filed in the circuit court “forthwith,” as required by §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t23c15s23-15-927" target="_self">23-15-927</a></cite>, where the petition was filed 9 working days (a total of 13 days including 2 weekends) after the decision of the executive committee was rendered.

       Attorneys who are in fact representing contestant with respect to election contest are disqualified from providing certificate required by statute. McDaniel v. Beane, 515 So. 2d 949, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2908 (Miss. 1987).

      <p>
       As indicated numerous times by the Mississippi supreme court, whether each of the two certifying attorneys may perform an “independent” investigation was not determined by the nature of their relationship with each other, but their association with the election contest; attorneys employed by the same firm were not incapable of performing independent investigations. Moore v. Parker, 962 So. 2d 558, 2007 Miss. LEXIS 476 (Miss. 2007).

   What is required under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t23c15s23-15-927" target="_self">23-15-927</a></cite> to be attached to the petition for judicial review is “a sworn copy” of the petition filed with the county executive committee, not a “copy of the sworn petition” filed with the county executive committee. Court expressly overruled Robinson v. Briscoe (1976), and to the extent that Miller v. Oktibbeha County Democratic Executive Committee (1979) can be interpreted to have been decided based on Robinson, the court likewise overrules Miller. Waters v. Gnemi, 907 So. 2d 307, 2005 Miss. LEXIS 321 (Miss. 2005).

      <p>
       In a contest of the primary election for the office of county supervisor, an attorney who certified the petition was not disqualified by the fact that he served as attorney for the county board of supervisors at a time that the petitioner was a member of the board of supervisors.

       Circuit court properly set aside the results of a primary election because the nominee was disqualified where she did not maintain a residence in the ward. Glenn v. Powell, 149 So.3d 480, 2014 Miss. LEXIS 516 (Miss. 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Special judge erred by dismissing a candidate’s petition for review of a tax commissioner election with prejudice for the nonmerits issue of lack of jurisdiction because she failed to attach two attorney certificates to her petition, as required by Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t23c15s23-15-927" target="_self">23-15-927</a></cite>; dismissal should have been without prejudice. Jackson v. Bell, 123 So.3d 436, 2013 Miss. LEXIS 549 (Miss. 2013).
      </p>
      <p>
       Candidate filed his petition for judicial review of the election 15 days, including 11 working days, after the last committee meeting in which the contest was scheduled to be addressed; filing within 11 working days was not a significant departure from the nine working days the Mississippi supreme court found to be “forthwith” in a prior case, and as such the “forthwith” requirement was satisfied. Moore v. Parker, 962 So. 2d 558, 2007 Miss. LEXIS 476 (Miss. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       Primary election candidate’s blanket allegation implying that the incumbent sheriff illegally directed his deputies to transport prisoners to the polls never materialized into an actual claim of injustice since he never presented the claim with particularity or supported it with credible evidence.

       Statute contains no language requiring the petitioner to wait until the executive committee has ruled before filing a petition for judicial review; on the contrary, the statute clearly requires the petition to be filed within ten days of the filing of the complaint with the executive committee, without regard for whether the committee has ruled on the complaint, and in the event the committee rules on the election contest, the timely filing of a petition supersedes and suspends that ruling. Chandler v. McKee, 202 So.3d 1269, 2016 Miss. LEXIS 444 (Miss. 2016).

      <p>
       Circuit court erred in failing to grant a candidate’s motion to dismiss a contestant’s petition for judicial review because the petition was untimely since the contestant did not comply with the ten-day filing requirement; because the Legislature materially changed the statute by adding a ten-day filing requirement, the circuit court erred in relying on cases that interpreted previous versions of the statute.

   Because the election at issue specifically concerned a party primary election, the case was brought squarely within the purview of the more specific Miss. Const. art. 12, § 247, wherein the people directed the Legislature to enact laws to secure fairness in party primary elections; the adoption of Miss. Code Ann. §§<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t23c15s23-15-955" target="_self">23-15-955</a></cite> and<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t23c15s23-15-927" target="_self">23-15-927</a></cite> is clear support for the distinction. Dillon v. Myers, 227 So.3d 923, 2017 Miss. LEXIS 134 (Miss. 2017).
      </p>
      <p>
       Circuit court erred in allowing election officials to intervene as parties in a candidate’s action contesting the results of a primary election when the statute mandated contrary duties because intervention was inconsistent with the election officials’ statutory duties during judicial review of an election contest; the circuit clerk is a mandatory participant, as are the election commissioners, who serve as advisors and assistants to the trial judge. Dillon v. Myers, 227 So.3d 923, 2017 Miss. LEXIS 134 (Miss. 2017).
      </p>
      <p>
       Circuit court erred in finding that it lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over a candidate’s action contesting the results of the Democratic primary for Mississippi House of Representatives because the primary election determined only the Democratic nominee for the general election; only the subsequent general election could result in one acquiring the right to become a member of the Legislature. Dillon v. Myers, 227 So.3d 923, 2017 Miss. LEXIS 134 (Miss. 2017).
      </p>
      <p>
       Judgment of a special tribunal affirming primary results was affirmed where the election contestant failed to prove that a sufficient number of illegal votes were cast to change the results of the election; although he discovered some questionable ballots during trial, it was too late to raise those issues. Boyd v. Tishomingo County Democratic Exec. Comm. & Members, 912 So. 2d 124, 2005 Miss. LEXIS 840 (Miss. 2005).

   Candidate’s challenge to a primary election under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t23c15s23-15-927" target="_self">23-15-927</a></cite> failed, as the disqualification of the absentee votes (seven percent of the total votes) was not substantial enough to cause the will of the voters to be impossible to discern and to warrant a special election, and there were not enough illegal votes cast for the incumbent to change the outcome. Harpole v. Kemper County Democratic Exec. Comm., 908 So. 2d 129, 2005 Miss. LEXIS 463 (Miss. 2005).

       <p>
   The chancellor appointed to determine an election contest did not err in failing to order a new election, where the illegal votes cast were only 1.9 percent or at most 3.9 percent of the total votes cast, and where the results were not changed nor was any doubt or uncertainty cast on the result being in conformity with the will of a majority of the voters. Furthermore, the chancellor did not err in allowing petitioner’s opponent to amend his crosspetition by deleting certain allegations of irregularities in certain voting precincts, since pursuant to §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t23c03s23-3-49" target="_self">23-3-49</a></cite> [Repealed.], he had all the power of a chancellor in term time and since the usual rules of procedure prevailed. Pyron v. Joiner, 381 So. 2d 627, 1980 Miss. LEXIS 1931 (Miss. 1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   In a proceeding to protest an election pursuant to this section, the concurrence of the three commissioners who participated in the decision-making process fulfilled the requirements of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t23c03s23-3-51" target="_self">23-3-51</a></cite> [Repealed.], and the findings of fact by the presiding judge were not subject to review. The finding of the special tribunal convened pursuant to §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t23c03s23-3-47" target="_self">23-3-47</a></cite> [Repealed.], that there was no evidence of fraud, casting of illegal votes, or that confusion caused by redistricting had any effect on the election, was supported by the evidence before the tribunal. Berryhill v. Smith, 380 So. 2d 1278, 1980 Miss. LEXIS 1889 (Miss. 1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the special tribunal held that votes of more than one-third of the voters in primary election for office of supervisor, were held void for failure to comply with mandatory provisions of the statute, it was impossible for one to reasonably say that result arrived at by the special tribunal represented the will of the voters. May v. Layton, 213 Miss. 129, 55 So. 2d 460, 56 So. 2d 89, 1951 Miss. LEXIS 519, 1952 Miss. LEXIS 340 (Miss. 1951).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where there is a total departure from the mandatory provisions of the statute and it is not possible to ascertain the will of the electors because a substantial portion of the votes were void, a new election should be ordered for the purpose of ascertaining a voter’s choice. May v. Layton, 213 Miss. 129, 55 So. 2d 460, 56 So. 2d 89, 1951 Miss. LEXIS 519, 1952 Miss. LEXIS 340 (Miss. 1951).

       In a proceeding to review a primary election contest, where the court decided that each of the candidates received an equal number of votes there was a tie and neither candidate is the nominee. Hopkins v. Wilson, 212 Miss. 404, 54 So. 2d 661, 1951 Miss. LEXIS 464 (Miss. 1951).
      </p>

       The statute is not solely for the benefit of contestants before the executive committee, but a contestee may appear before the committee and there present in writing by answer or by answers and cross complaint all of the facts which support his side of the case, and if the action of the committee is adverse to him he may appeal to the special judicial tribunal for a review. Darnell v. Myres, 202 Miss. 767, 32 So. 2d 684, 1947 Miss. LEXIS 339 (Miss. 1947).
      </p>
      <p>
       As in the case of a contestant, when the contestee would complain to the special judicial tribunal, he must show by exhibit with his complaint what he had placed before the executive committee, either by specific denial or by specific cross complaint, and wherein the executive committee had wrongfully acted or failed to act on what he had thus placed before the committee for its determination and action. Darnell v. Myres, 202 Miss. 767, 32 So. 2d 684, 1947 Miss. LEXIS 339 (Miss. 1947).

       The purpose of the act is that the proceedings preliminary to and during the course of a judicial review of a primary election contest shall be conducted with such diligence, expedition, and dispatch as will enable the trial court to have a full and orderly hearing and to conclude it in such time that, if practically possible, a new primary, if ordered, may be held before the day of the general election in November of the same year.

   Where the losing candidate in a municipal primary runoff election filed his original petition for judicial review 4 days after the decision of the political party’s executive committee, and 15 days after that petition was dismissed by the special tribunal without prejudice he refiled for judicial review, his petition for review was filed “forthwith” within the meaning of that term as appearing in §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t23c03s23-3-45" target="_self">23-3-45</a></cite> [Repealed.].

       A delay of 26 days in filing a petition for review, brought within the “forthwith” requirement of this section [Code 1942, § 3182] was not excused by a misconception of the petitioner as to the proper procedure. Turner v. Henry, 187 Miss. 689, 193 So. 631, 1940 Miss. LEXIS 239 (Miss. 1940).
      </p>
      <p>
       The term “forthwith” in this section [Code 1942, § 3182] is a relative one and means within such time as to permit that which is to be done lawfully and orderly and effectually according to the practical and ordinary force of the thing or things to be performed or accomplished; and it is, therefore, not to be used by way of a penalty when accidental interventions or difficulties of which the party is not to be charged with foresight, have upset what otherwise would have been reasonable calculations as to the available time. Harris v. Stewart, 187 Miss. 489, 193 So. 339, 1940 Miss. LEXIS 226 (Miss. 1940).
      </p>
      <p>
       Having regard to the fact that the Act fixes a specific time within which most of the steps mentioned therein are required to be taken, without specifying any time with respect to the filing of a petition for judicial review “forthwith,” the Act recognizes that in this particular the fixing of a precise time limitation would be unwise and that the circumstances of each particular case should govern. Harris v. Stewart, 187 Miss. 489, 193 So. 339, 1940 Miss. LEXIS 226 (Miss. 1940).
      </p>
      <p>
       The filing of a petition for a judicial review of a primary election of October 25 after a primary on August 29, having regard to the particular circumstances involved, satisfied the statutory requirement of a filing “forthwith.” Harris v. Stewart, 187 Miss. 489, 193 So. 339, 1940 Miss. LEXIS 226 (Miss. 1940).

   Failure of a candidate to comply with the requirement of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t23c03s23-3-45" target="_self">23-3-45</a></cite> [Repealed.] by pledging the independence of the investigation conducted into facts underlying his petition and protest regrading the results of a primary election did not require dismissal of his petition, since no allegations of bias or prejudice were made, and the challenge, which went to the fullness of the investigation that had been conducted, was the sort of inquiry proscribed by decisional law. Noxubee County Democratic Executive Committee v. Russell, 443 So. 2d 1191, 1983 Miss. LEXIS 3064 (Miss. 1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       A special tribunal, designated to hear petitions to contest an election, properly dismissed petitioner’s letter contesting election results for a supervisorial post where it was not sworn as originally filed with the Executive Committee. Miller v. Oktibbeha County Democratic Executive Committee, 377 So. 2d 917, 1979 Miss. LEXIS 2554 (Miss. 1979), overruled in part, Waters v. Gnemi, 907 So. 2d 307, 2005 Miss. LEXIS 321 (Miss. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       The validity of a petition on appeal in a primary election contest, made merely on information and belief, is not to be measured by Code 1942, § 1294, modifying the rule requiring two witnesses or one witness and corroborating circumstances to overthrow and answer under oath, since the statute in question is after all but a rule of evidence. Fillingane v. Breland, 212 Miss. 423, 54 So. 2d 747, 1951 Miss. LEXIS 466 (Miss. 1951).
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the Corrupt Practices Act does not provide a form for verification of the petition on appeal, a petition made merely on information and belief is proper where the affiant states that the allegations thereof are true and correct. Fillingane v. Breland, 212 Miss. 423, 54 So. 2d 747, 1951 Miss. LEXIS 466 (Miss. 1951).
      </p>
      <p>
       The validity of a petition on appeal in a primary election contest, made merely on information and belief, is not to be tested by the fact that it would not support a decree if there were no answer. Fillingane v. Breland, 212 Miss. 423, 54 So. 2d 747, 1951 Miss. LEXIS 466 (Miss. 1951).
      </p>
      <p>
       No cause of action for judicial review of a primary election contest exists unless a sworn copy of the contestant’s protest or contest before the executive committee is made a part of his petition. Darnell v. Myres, 202 Miss. 767, 32 So. 2d 684, 1947 Miss. LEXIS 339 (Miss. 1947).
      </p>
      <p>
       Allegations and proof by a contestant or a petition for judicial review of a primary election that a number of illegal votes were cast and counted to change the result of the election was sufficient, and he was not required to prove that enough of the illegal votes were actually cast for the contestee to give him the apparent, although not real, majority. Harris v. Stewart, 187 Miss. 489, 193 So. 339, 1940 Miss. LEXIS 226 (Miss. 1940).
      </p>
      <p>
       In order for it to appear that the executive committee has wrongfully denied the relief sought, it must appear either from the petition or exhibits thereto that if the matters complained of should be decided in the complainant’s favor, the result would be that he and not the contestee would be the nominee for the office in question; without an allegation to that effect, the petition presents no cause of action. Hickman v. Switzer, 186 Miss. 720, 191 So. 486, 1939 Miss. LEXIS 259 (Miss. 1939).
      </p>
      <p>
       A petition for judicial review complaining of the dismissal by the executive committee of the petitioner’s protest, a copy of which showed that it merely challenged the vote of one voting precinct without setting forth what the effect of sustaining the challenge and discarding the vote of the precinct would be as to whether it would change the result arrived at by the executive committee, was insufficient to constitute a cause of action under this section. Hickman v. Switzer, 186 Miss. 720, 191 So. 486, 1939 Miss. LEXIS 259 (Miss. 1939).
      </p>
      <p>
       It is contemplated by this section [Code 1942, § 3182] that, when a person desires to contest the nomination of another person and has the purpose to follow up his contest by a petition for a judicial review, his contest or petition or complaint before the executive committee shall be reasonably specific in his charges and not in mere general language. Shaw v. Burnham, 186 Miss. 647, 191 So. 484, 1939 Miss. LEXIS 258 (Miss. 1939).

       The petition of a contestee for judicial review must be accompanied by a sworn exhibit of what issues he placed before the executive committee; this requirement cannot be met after the petition has been filed by annexing by way of amendment a sworn copy of the contestee’s answer. Darnell v. Myres, 202 Miss. 767, 32 So. 2d 684, 1947 Miss. LEXIS 339 (Miss. 1947).

      <p>
       When a contestant has made charges of wrong or illegality before the executive committee, the contestee, as a matter of right, may file a cross complaint with the committee, the cross complaint to be in reasonably specific and particular terms and not in assertions of mere generalities.

        12. —Certificate of practicing attorneys.
       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       An attorney who is “of counsel” to the firm in which the petitioner’s attorney is a partner is not eligible to make the certification of a practicing attorney that an independent assessment of the claim has been made. Esco v. Scott, 735 So. 2d 1002, 1999 Miss. LEXIS 104 (Miss. 1999), overruled in part, Jackson v. Bell, 123 So.3d 436, 2013 Miss. LEXIS 549 (Miss. 2013).
      </p>
      <p>
       The evident and material purpose of the requirement of the certificate of two independent practicing attorneys was to prevent, or at least to minimize, the bringing before the courts of captious or unsubstantial political contests of primary elections-that such a certificate would independently show that there was real merit from a substantial legal standpoint in the proposed contents, and would tend to forestall, in a large measure, spiteful partisan litigation which would needlessly cast doubt upon the future title of the successful candidates in the nomination for the public office involved. Harris v. Stewart, 187 Miss. 489, 193 So. 339, 1940 Miss. LEXIS 226 (Miss. 1940).
      </p>
      <p>
       The only facts which will disqualify a certifying attorney are: Employment of the attorney, past, present, contingent or prospective, by or for the contestant as his attorney in respect to the manner involved in the contest, or such facts as will disqualify a judge under § 165, Constitution 1890. Harris v. Stewart, 187 Miss. 489, 193 So. 339, 1940 Miss. LEXIS 226 (Miss. 1940).
      </p>
      <p>
       The investigation of a certifying attorney, as a quasi judicial officer, is not subject to a collateral inquiry as to how he made his investigation or how fully he made it. Harris v. Stewart, 187 Miss. 489, 193 So. 339, 1940 Miss. LEXIS 226 (Miss. 1940).
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that a certifying attorney had an office on the same floor with one of the attorneys for the petitioner, and that he and petitioner’s attorney were intimate friends and often associated together in cases, did not disqualify him under this section. Harris v. Stewart, 187 Miss. 489, 193 So. 339, 1940 Miss. LEXIS 226 (Miss. 1940).
      </p>
      <p>
       The certificate of two disinterested attorneys, required by this section [Code 1942, § 3182] to accompany a petition for judicial review, is just as important as the petition itself, and is jurisdictional. Pearson v. Jordan, 186 Miss. 789, 192 So. 39, 1939 Miss. LEXIS 283 (Miss. 1939).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where one of the two attorneys signing the certificate required by this section [Code 1942, § 3182] was an attorney in the case throughout the proceedings and was of counsel in the appeal, such certificate was equivalent to no certificate at all, so that the special tribunal was without jurisdiction to hear and determine the cause. Pearson v. Jordan, 186 Miss. 789, 192 So. 39, 1939 Miss. LEXIS 283 (Miss. 1939).
      </p>
      <p>
       The certificate required to accompany the petition for judicial review signed by attorneys who represent a contestant at the time their investigation of the matter is made, or at the time his petition for a judicial review is filed, is not a compliance with this section. Pittman v. Forbes, 186 Miss. 783, 191 So. 490, 1939 Miss. LEXIS 263 (Miss. 1939).
      </p>
      <p>
       The purpose of the provision of this section [Code 1942, § 3182] requiring a petition for a judicial review to be accompanied by a certificate of two practicing attorneys is to prevent persons declared party nominees from being harassed with trivial applications for a judicial review thereof, and contemplate, as the word “independent” connotes, a certificate by lawyers who are without bias or prejudice.

P. 15(a) controls and amendments are allowed at any time before a responsive pleading is served; in the case at bar, no responsive pleading from the County Democratic Executive Committee was on record, and even if there was a response by the Committee served upon the candidate (who opposed the holding of a new primary election), in the record, Miss. R. Civ. P. 15(a) allowed the amendment of pleadings after a responsive pleading was served “by leave of the court.” Jefferson Davis County v. Davies, 912 So. 2d 837, 2005 Miss.

       Where the original protest charged that only one ballot was illegally marked in ordinary pencil, the finding of the tribunal on appeal must be restricted to such allegation notwithstanding that an examination of the ballots showed that there were three such ballots cast for the contestee, since the petition on appeal may not overrun the allegations of the original protest.

   Trial court was correct in overruling the decision of the Jefferson Davis County Democratic Executive Committee, to conduct a new election for the Democratic nominee for Jefferson Davis County Chancery Clerk. The requirements to hold a new election under
   Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t23c15s23-15-593" target="_self">23-15-593</a></cite> were not met, as §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t23c15s23-15-593" target="_self">23-15-593</a></cite> authorized new elections for individual precincts if the requirements were met, not a new election county or district wide. To have held a new election county wide, the Committee would had to have determined that all precincts failed in material particulars to comply with the requirements of
   Miss. Code Ann. §§<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t23c15s23-15-591" target="_self">23-15-591</a></cite> and
  <cite class="ocms"><a href="#t23c15s23-15-895" target="_self">23-15-895</a></cite> to such an extent that it was impossible to arrive at the will of the voters; there was no evidence that there were violations of
   Miss. Code Ann. §§<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t23c15s23-15-591" target="_self">23-15-591</a></cite> and
  <cite class="ocms"><a href="#t23c15s23-15-895" target="_self">23-15-895</a></cite> and the committee exceeded its authority under
   Miss. Code Ann. § 23-15-593 in ordering a new election.
   Jefferson Davis County v. Davies, 912 So. 2d 837, 2005 Miss. LEXIS 212 (Miss. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Although §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t23c15s23-15-935" target="_self">23-15-935</a></cite> grants the special judge the power to compel the attendance of the election commissioners, this statute contemplates a situation where the special judge, in the interest of time and judicial efficiency, can proceed to hear the election contest without any one of the commissioners or all of them; the statutory framework relating to election contests requires that they be completed as quickly as possible in order that the scheduled primary elections can proceed as planned, as indicated by §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t23c15s23-15-929" target="_self">23-15-929</a></cite> which directs the special judge to determine the election contest “at the earliest possible date.” Hatcher v. Fleeman, 617 So. 2d 634, 1993 Miss. LEXIS 149 (Miss. 1993), overruled in part, Smith v. Hollins, 905 So. 2d 1267, 2005 Miss. LEXIS 388 (Miss. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 23-15-929, which directs that the judge appointed by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court hear the election contest at the earliest possible date, should not be used as a penalty when accidental interventions or difficulties have upset what otherwise would have been reasonable calculations as to the available time. Pearson v. Parsons, 541 So. 2d 447, 1989 Miss. LEXIS 143 (Miss. 1989).
      </p>
      <p>
       Among the members of a special tribunal formed to hear election contests, the special judge is the “controlling judge” of both the facts and the law, though the election commissioners sit as advisors in the determination of facts. Rizzo v. Bizzell, 530 So. 2d 121, 1988 Miss. LEXIS 325 (Miss. 1988).

       Since the proceedings in a judicial review of a municipal primary election contest are in the nature of an appeal, no matter may be presented to the special tribunal which has not been previously heard and decided by the executive committee of the party. Shannon v. Henson, 499 So. 2d 758, 1986 Miss. LEXIS 2883 (Miss. 1986).

   In a proceeding to protest an election pursuant to §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t23c03s23-3-45" target="_self">23-3-45</a></cite> [Repealed.], the concurrence of the three commissioners who participated in the decision-making process fulfilled the requirements of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t23c03s23-3-51" target="_self">23-3-51</a></cite> [Repealed.], and the findings of fact by the presiding judge were not subject to review. The finding of the special tribunal convened pursuant to this section, that there was no evidence of fraud, casting of illegal votes, or that confusion caused by redistricting had any effect on the election, was supported by the evidence before the tribunal. Berryhill v. Smith, 380 So. 2d 1278, 1980 Miss. LEXIS 1889 (Miss. 1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a petition for judicial review has been filed, and the petitioner takes a voluntary nonsuit, the chief justice is not without power to make a second designation of a judge to hear the same matter upon the filing of a second petition. Harris v. Stewart, 187 Miss. 489, 193 So. 339, 1940 Miss. LEXIS 226 (Miss. 1940).
      </p>
      <p>
       Upon the overruling of a demurrer to a petition for judicial review of a primary election and the contestee’s declination to plead further, all the averments of the petition properly pleaded are to be taken as true in view of the concluding lines of this section. Harris v. Stewart, 187 Miss. 489, 193 So. 339, 1940 Miss. LEXIS 226 (Miss. 1940).

     <p>
      When the day for the hearing has been set, the circuit clerk shall issue subpoenas for witnesses as in other litigated cases, and he shall also issue a summons to each of the five (5) election commissioners of the county, unless they waive summons, requiring them to attend the hearing, throughout which the commissioners shall sit with the judge as advisors or assistants in the trial and determination of the facts, and as assistants in counts, calculations and inspections, and in seeing to it that ballots, papers, documents, books and the like are diligently secured against misplacement, alteration, concealment or loss both in the sessions and during recesses or adjournments. The judge is, however, the controlling judge both of the facts and the law, and has all the power in every respect of a circuit judge in termtime. The tribunal shall be attended by the sheriff, and clerk, each with sufficient deputies, and by a court reporter. The special tribunal so constituted shall fully hear the contest or complaint de novo, and the original contestant before the party executive committee shall have the burden of proof and the burden of going forward with the evidence in the hearing before the special tribunal. The special tribunal, after the contest or complaint has been fully heard anew, shall make a finding dictated to the reporter covering all controverted material issues of fact, together with any dissents of any commissioner, and thereupon, the trial judge shall enter the judgment which the county executive committee should have entered, of which the election commissioners shall take judicial notice, or if the matter be one within the jurisdiction of the State Executive Committee, the judgment shall be certified and promptly forwarded to the Secretary of the State Executive Committee, and, in the absence of an appeal, it shall be the duty of the State Executive Committee forthwith to reassemble and revise any decision theretofore made by it so as to conform to the judicial judgment; that when the contest is upon a complaint filed with the State Executive Committee and the petition to the court avers that the wrong or irregularity is one which occurred wholly within the proceedings of the state committee, the petition to the court shall be filed in the Circuit Court of Hinds County and, after notice served, shall be promptly heard by the circuit judge of that county, without the attendance of commissioners.

       Circuit court erred in allowing election officials to intervene as parties in a candidate’s action contesting the results of a primary election when the statute mandated contrary duties because intervention was inconsistent with the election officials’ statutory duties during judicial review of an election contest; the circuit clerk is a mandatory participant, as are the election commissioners, who serve as advisors and assistants to the trial judge. Dillon v. Myers, 227 So.3d 923, 2017 Miss. LEXIS 134 (Miss. 2017).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   By virtue of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t23c15s23-15-931" target="_self">23-15-931</a></cite>, the special judge is the “controlling judge” of both the facts and the law in an election contest hearing, though the election commissioners sit as advisors to the determination of the facts; the statute strongly suggests that the special judge is the “true trier of facts.” Hatcher v. Fleeman, 617 So. 2d 634, 1993 Miss. LEXIS 149 (Miss. 1993), overruled in part, Smith v. Hollins, 905 So. 2d 1267, 2005 Miss. LEXIS 388 (Miss. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       The trial court in a judicial review of a primary election contest had the authority to require the withdrawal of both parties’ attorneys where the judge was told that both attorneys were to be witnesses on the contested issues of the election.

   State judicial elections come within coverage of “results test” provisions of § 2 of Voting Rights Act of 1965 (42 USCS § 1973), as amended in 1982; if term “representatives” limited coverage with respect to judicial elections, limitation would exclude all claims involving judicial elections; better reading of term describes winners of representative, popular elections. Chisom v. Roemer, <cite class="us_code">501 U.S. 380</cite>, <cite class="s_court">111 S. Ct. 2354</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">115 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 348, 1991 U.S. LEXIS 3627 (U.S. 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       The chancellor appointed to determine an election contest did not err in failing to order a new election, where the illegal votes cast were only 1.9 percent or at most 3.9 percent of the total votes cast, and where the results were not changed nor was any doubt or uncertainty cast on the result being in conformity with the will of a majority of the voters. Furthermore, the chancellor did not err in allowing the petitioner’s opponent to amend his cross-petition by deleting certain allegations of irregularities in certain voting precincts, since pursuant to this section he had all the power of a chancellor in term time and since the usual rules of procedure prevailed. Pyron v. Joiner, 381 So. 2d 627, 1980 Miss. LEXIS 1931 (Miss. 1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       A petition for judicial review of a primary election contest 22 days thereafter satisfies the requirement that such a petition be filed “forthwith,” where filed immediately upon the dismissal, for failure to meet statutory requirements, of a petition filed six days thereafter. Wallace v. Leggett, 248 Miss. 121, 158 So. 2d 746, 1963 Miss. LEXIS 382 (Miss. 1963).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a proceeding for judicial review for executive committee’s order rescinding its order declaring the petitioner a nominee, the special tribunal did not have authority to determine that respondent, because of alleged violations of Corrupt Practices Act, was disqualified from holding an office of supervisor and for that reason could not run for the Democratic Primary and perhaps become a nominee for that office. Blakeney v. Mayfield, 226 Miss. 53, 83 So. 2d 748, 1955 Miss. LEXIS 606 (Miss. 1955).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence that after counting of ballots and before recount thereof circuit clerk failed to seal the ballot boxes in question and to keep a record of the seals as required by statute, and that such boxes and their contents were tampered with, warranted affirmance of order of special tribunal adjudging validity of election ballots as against contestant who received a majority on account. Allen v. Funchess, 195 Miss. 486, 15 So. 2d 343, 1943 Miss. LEXIS 143 (Miss. 1943).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where special tribunal’s findings of fact were unanimously concurred in, the only recourse of contestant on appeal was to show either that there was no evidence whatever to sustain the findings, or that there was no substantial evidence in support of the finding. Allen v. Funchess, 195 Miss. 486, 15 So. 2d 343, 1943 Miss. LEXIS 143 (Miss. 1943).
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the clerk of the circuit court is the clerk of the special tribunal, filing of bill of exceptions and cost bond by contestant, within time allotted for appeal by special tribunal, in the office of the circuit clerk and such clerk’s approval of bonds, were sufficient to place appeal in supreme court. Evans v. Hood, 195 Miss. 743, 15 So. 2d 37, 1943 Miss. LEXIS 134 (Miss. 1943).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a contestant proved that sufficient illegal votes were cast at the primary election to change the result thereof, the lower court properly ordered another primary election. Harris v. Stewart, 187 Miss. 489, 193 So. 339, 1940 Miss. LEXIS 226 (Miss. 1940).
      </p>
      <p>
       The special tribunal set up by the corrupt practices act has no authority to go beyond ascertaining the will of the qualified electors participating in the party primary, and in this regard, it has authority and duty to determine whether those voting or offering to vote are qualified electors and entitled to vote, and whether in all substantial respects the election was fairly and honestly held in compliance with the various provisions of the law. McKenzie v. Thompson, 186 Miss. 524, 191 So. 487, 1939 Miss. LEXIS 260 (Miss. 1939).
      </p>
      <p>
       The special tribunal, under this section, is limited in its jurisdiction to determining the fairness of the primary election and the correctness of the result and has no jurisdiction to pass upon the qualifications of the successful candidate and determine his right to hold the office, if elected, since the latter raises a public and not a private question, the only remedy being in the nature of a quo warranto as to the general election under Section 3053, Code 1930 [Code 1942, § 1120]. McKenzie v. Thompson, 186 Miss. 524, 191 So. 487, 1939 Miss. LEXIS 260 (Miss. 1939).

       Appellant argued that nothing suggested what commissioners attended which days of the hearings, but the statute contains no roll-call requirement that, at each hearing, requires the making of a list of which commissioners were present for the statute to apply. Bryant v. Dickerson, 236 So.3d 28, 2017 Miss. LEXIS 436 (Miss. 2017).
      </p>
      <p>
       Appellant’s claims were based on the circuit court’s factual finding that he was a resident of Sunflower County, but such factual finding was not subject to the court’s review pursuant to the statute. Bryant v. Dickerson, 236 So.3d 28, 2017 Miss. LEXIS 436 (Miss. 2017).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   While Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t23c15s23-15-933" target="_self">23-15-933</a></cite> deems final the tribunal’s findings of fact, its legal conclusions are reviewable by the Mississippi supreme court on appeal, and the statute presents no bar to any issues in the case since all issues presented were questions of law; moreover, the issues raised for the supreme court’s consideration did not require review of the findings of fact the tribunal made with regard to the nine fraudulently voted ballots. Moore v. Parker, 962 So. 2d 558, 2007 Miss. LEXIS 476 (Miss. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where only two of the three commissioners who participated in the result concurred fully in the judge’s findings, the third commissioner dissented in part, and the part to which that commissioner dissented was not in the record, the court was free to make such findings as the evidence required. Campbell v. Whittington, 733 So. 2d 820, 1999 Miss. LEXIS 99 (Miss. 1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       Determination of intent of voters of certain contested ballots is by its very nature fact inquiry to be made by Special Tribunal and Supreme Court’s duty is to respect Special Tribunal’s findings where it was not manifestly wrong. Wade v. Williams, 517 So. 2d 573, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2971 (Miss. 1987).

   In a proceeding to protest an election pursuant to §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t23c03s23-3-45" target="_self">23-3-45</a></cite> [Repealed.], the concurrence of the three commissioners who participated in the decision-making process fulfilled the requirements of this section, and the findings of fact by the presiding judge were not subject to review. The finding of the special tribunal convened pursuant to §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t23c03s23-3-47" target="_self">23-3-47</a></cite> [Repealed.], that there was no evidence of fraud, casting of illegal votes, or that confusion caused by redistricting had any effect on the election, was supported by the evidence before the tribunal. Berryhill v. Smith, 380 So. 2d 1278, 1980 Miss. LEXIS 1889 (Miss. 1980).

      <p>
       By this section [Code 1942, § 3185] the Legislature intended to facilitate speedy appeals in primary election contests. Anders v. Longmire, 226 Miss. 215, 83 So. 2d 828, 1955 Miss. LEXIS 627 (Miss. 1955).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where special tribunal’s findings of fact were unanimously concurred in, the only recourse of contestant on appeal was to show either that there was no evidence whatever to sustain the findings, or that there was no substantial evidence in support of the finding. Allen v. Funchess, 195 Miss. 486, 15 So. 2d 343, 1943 Miss. LEXIS 143 (Miss. 1943).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence that after counting of ballots and before recount thereof circuit clerk failed to seal the ballot boxes in question and to keep a record of the seals as required by statute, and that such boxes and their contents were tampered with, warranted affirmance of order of special tribunal adjudging election ballots as against contestant who received a majority on recount. Allen v. Funchess, 195 Miss. 486, 15 So. 2d 343, 1943 Miss. LEXIS 143 (Miss. 1943).
      </p>
      <p>
       The special tribunal provided for hereunder is a proper inferior court from which an appeal might be taken direct to the Supreme Court. Hayes v. Abney, 186 Miss. 208, 188 So. 533, 1939 Miss. LEXIS 209 (Miss. 1939).
      </p>
      <p>
       A special tribunal, consisting of a circuit judge and the municipal election commissioners, was such an inferior court as might be established under § 172, Const of 1890. Hayes v. Abney, 186 Miss. 208, 188 So. 533, 1939 Miss. LEXIS 209 (Miss. 1939).
      </p>
      <p>
       Requirement of statute that appeals from decisions in election contests to Supreme Court shall be “referred to the court in banc” held not binding on Supreme Court, since constitutional amendment providing for separation of court into two divisions delegates to court itself and not to legislature duty of determining which cases shall be heard by division and which by court sitting in banc.

       In a primary election contest where the appointed judge and the election commissioners unanimously found as to number of ballots cast, the attaching of transcripts of testimony before special tribunal to the appellant’s bill of exceptions to the Supreme Court was in the face of the express prohibition of this section. [Code 1942, § 3185]. Anders v. Longmire, 226 Miss. 215, 83 So. 2d 828, 1955 Miss. LEXIS 627 (Miss. 1955).
      </p>
      <p>
       Purported bill of exceptions on appeal from decision of judge and election commissioners in election contest setting up some of contentions but failing to set up points of law with rulings thereon with synopsis of pertinent evidence and rulings sought to be reversed, nor containing statement signed by trial judge that bill was a correct statement of proceedings, but stating that bill did not set up facts established by cross-examination of witnesses by contestees or examination by trial judge, and was never presented to and signed by two attorneys as provided by statute on failure or refusal of trial judge to sign, held insufficient to confer jurisdiction on Supreme Court. McDonald v. Spence, 179 Miss. 342, 174 So. 54, 1937 Miss. LEXIS 11 (Miss. 1937).
      </p>
      <p>
       Contents of bill of exceptions contemplated by Corrupt Practices Act on appeal in election contest must include petition, answers, and exhibits thereto, points raised before special tribunal, setting forth rulings thereon, and pertinent facts necessary to an understanding thereof, in absence of which jurisdiction is not conferred on Supreme Court, and does not authorize sending up of stenographer’s notes except in case of disagreement as to facts between judge and one or more of election commissioners.

      <p>
       The filing of an appeal bond with the clerk of supreme court within the time allowed by this section [Code 1942, § 3185] constitutes a sufficient filing of the bond. May v. Layton, 213 Miss. 129, 55 So. 2d 460, 56 So. 2d 89, 1951 Miss. LEXIS 519, 1952 Miss. LEXIS 340 (Miss. 1951); Evans v. Hood, 195 Miss. 743, 15 So. 2d 37, 1943 Miss. LEXIS 134 (Miss. 1943).
      </p>
      <p>
       In view of the fact that statute governing appeal from judgment of special tribunal in election contests is silent as to where required bond shall be filed or who shall approve it, and the fact that the clerk of the circuit court is by the statute the clerk of the special tribunal, a circuit clerk, under the usual rules of procedure, is the person with whom the appeal bond is to be filed and by whom it is to be approved, in order to place appeal in supreme court. Evans v. Hood, 195 Miss. 743, 15 So. 2d 37, 1943 Miss. LEXIS 134 (Miss. 1943).

     <p>
      The trial judge shall have the same power to compel the attendance of the election commissioners upon and throughout the hearings as is given to the judge of a circuit court to compel the attendance of jurors, and the commissioners must attend unless physically unable so to do. But if any one or more or all of the commissioners are absent so as to not be served with notice, or is or are physically unable to attend, the trial judge shall proceed without them or any of them, so that the hearing shall not be delayed on their account or on account of any one or more of them. When, under Section 23-15-937, the hearing is transferred in whole or in part to another county or counties, the election commissioners of the county or counties to which the hearing is transferred shall attend the hearings in their respective counties, subject to foregoing provisions in respect to absent or disabled commissioners.

     <p>
      If more than one (1) county is involved in a contest or complaint, the judge shall have the authority to transfer the hearing to a more convenient county within the district, if the contest or complaint involves a district office, or within the state if the contest or complaint involves a state office; or the judge may proceed to any county or counties in which the facts complained of are charged to have transpired, and there hear the evidence and make a finding of facts relating to that county and any convenient neighboring county or counties, but, in any event, if possible with due diligence to do so, the hearing must be completed and final judgment rendered in time to permit the printing and distribution of the official ballots at the election for which the contested nomination is made. When any judge lawfully designated to hear a contest or complaint shall not promptly and diligently proceed with the hearing and final determination of the contest or complaint, he shall be guilty of a high misdemeanor in office unless excused by actual illness, or by an equivalent excuse. When no final decision has been made by the time the official ballots are required to be printed, the name of the nominee declared by the party executive committee shall be printed on the official ballots as the party nominee, but the contest or complaint shall not thereby be dismissed but the cause shall nevertheless proceed to final judgment and if the judgment is in favor of the contestant, the election of the contestee shall thereby be vacated and the Governor, or the Lieutenant Governor, in case the Governor is a party to the contest, shall call a special election for the office or offices involved. If the contestee has already entered upon the term he shall vacate the office upon the qualification of the person elected at the special election, and may be removed by quo warranto if he fail so to do.

       While the special tribunal correctly found that a special election was required, it erred in excluding a losing candidate from the special election because a general election had already occurred and the statutes at issue did not limit a special election to certain candidates. Randle v. Ivy, — So.3d —, 2019 Miss. LEXIS 51 (Miss. Jan. 31, 2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   In a case in which there were irregularities in the absentee ballots in the primary election for county sheriff so that neither candidate, which included the incumbent, had a majority, but the incumbent won the general election, the governor’s writ of election ordering a special primary runoff election to determine the winner and after the primary was decided a new general election violated Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t23c15s23-15-937" target="_self">23-15-937</a></cite>. Under that statute, only one special election was to be held after the general election has already occurred. Thompson v. Jones, 17 So.3d 524, 2008 Miss. LEXIS 704 (Miss. 2008).

   Where candidate one prevailed in an action contesting the results of a primary election and candidate two, who had run unopposed in the general election, had already taken office, Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t23c15s23-15-937" target="_self">23-15-937</a></cite> required that a special election be conducted; the court had no discretion to hold that a special election was not required. The court overruled the case of Hatcher v. Fleeman, 617 So. 2d 634 (Miss. 1993), to the limited extent that the court erroneously held there that a special election was not required. Smith v.

   A special election was not warranted after the disqualification of 2 ballots by a special judge in an election contest hearing, even though the disqualification changed the result of the election, the election contest hearing was not held in the county where the dispute originated, the election commissioners were not issued subpoenas, and the originally successful candidate claimed he was not given reasonable notice of the hearing, where the 2 disqualified “affidavit” ballots were not in compliance with §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t23c15s23-15-573" target="_self">23-15-573</a></cite> and were therefore illegal.

       Where a successful challenge to a primary election did not reach the Supreme Court in time to have a primary election to determine the party’s nominee prior to the general election, a special election for the office involved must be held.

      </p>
      <p>
       It cannot be validly asserted, even inferentially, that this section [Code 1942, § 3187], or any other section, contemplates that the original canvass of election results of the executive committee shall be reinstated merely by filing a petition for judicial review.

       The phrase “special election” is clearly intended to mean a special election in the usual sense of that term, and not a party primary. Blakeney v. Mayfield, 226 Miss. 53, 83 So. 2d 748, 1955 Miss. LEXIS 606 (Miss. 1955).
      </p>

       Under this section [Code 1942, § 3187] a party primary after the general election is not contemplated, before the calling of a special election, at least as to state, district and county offices. Blakeney v. Mayfield, 226 Miss. 53, 83 So. 2d 748, 1955 Miss. LEXIS 606 (Miss. 1955).

       Where a special court improvidently granted a stay of the special primary election which it had ordered, no party nominee was selected for the office of supervisor and the general election was already held before Supreme Court’s decision on appeal from judgments of the special court, a special election must be called and held. Blakeney v. Mayfield, 226 Miss. 53, 83 So. 2d 748, 1955 Miss. LEXIS 606 (Miss. 1955).

       This section [Code 1942, § 3187] is applicable where contestee’s nomination at second primary was adjudged invalid so that subsequent election of contestee in November election was void. Smith v. Deere, 195 Miss. 502, 16 So. 2d 33, 1943 Miss. LEXIS 181 (Miss. 1943).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the statute provides for expedition in contest proceedings with the view of pleading the contest in time for the general election, if that can be done, this section provides that the contest shall not thereby be dismissed but proceed to final judgment, and if the judgment is in favor of the contestant, the election of the contestee shall thereby be vacated and the governor shall call a special election to the office involved, and if the contestee has already entered upon the term, he shall vacate the office upon the qualification of the person elected at such special election and may be removed by quo warranto if he fails to do so.

      Except as otherwise provided by Section 23-15-955 or 23-15-961, a person desiring to contest the election of another person returned as elected to any office within any county, may, within twenty (20) days after the election, file a petition in the office of the clerk of the circuit court of the county, setting forth the grounds upon which the election is contested. When such a petition is filed, the circuit clerk shall immediately notify, by registered letter, telegraph, telephone, or personally the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court or in his absence, or disability, some other Justice of the Supreme Court, who shall forthwith designate and notify a circuit judge or chancellor of a district other than that which embraces the district, subdistrict, county or any of the counties, involved in the contest or complaint, to proceed to the county in which the contest or complaint has been filed to hear and determine the contest or complaint. The circuit clerk shall also cause a copy of such petition to be served upon the contestee, which shall serve as notice to such contestee.

     <p>
      The Supreme Court shall compile a list of judges throughout the state to hear such disputes before an election. It shall be the official duty of the designated circuit judge or chancellor to proceed to discharge the duty of hearing the contest at the earliest possible date. The date of the contest shall be fixed by the judge or chancellor, and the judge or chancellor shall provide reasonable notice to the contestant and the contestee of the date and time fixed for the contest. The judge or chancellor shall cause the contestant and contestee to be served in a reasonable manner. When the contestee is served, such contestee shall promptly file his answer, and cross-complaint, if the contestee has a cross-complaint.

      The court shall, at the first term, cause an issue to be made up and tried by a jury, and the verdict of the jury shall find the person having the greatest number of legal votes at the election. If the jury shall find against the person returned elected, the clerk shall issue a certificate thereof; and the person in whose favor the jury shall find shall be commissioned by the Governor, and shall qualify and enter upon the duties of his office. Each party shall be allowed ten (10) peremptory challenges, and new trials shall be granted and costs awarded as in other cases. In case the election of district attorney or other state district election be contested, the petition may be filed in any county of the district or in any county of an adjoining district within twenty (20) days after the election, and like proceedings shall be had thereon as in the case of county officers, and the person found to be entitled to the office shall qualify as required by law and enter upon the duties of his office.

      </h4>
      <p>
       Laws of 1999, ch. 301, was House Bill 1609, 1998 Regular Session, and originally passed both Houses of the Legislature on April 3, 1998. The Governor vetoed House Bill 1609 on April 17, 1998. The veto was overridden by the State Senate and House of Representatives on January 5, 1999.
      </p>
      <p>
       On January 15, 1999, the United States Attorney General interposed no objection under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, as amended and extended, to the amendment of this section by Laws of 1999, ch. 301, § 13.
      </p>
      <p>
       On August 7, 2000, the United States Attorney General interposed no objection under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to the amendment of this section by Laws of 2000, ch. 450.
      </p>
      <p>
       The effective date of Chapter 432, Laws of 2013, which amended this section, is “from and after the date it is effectuated under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, as amended and extended.” However, after the bill was approved, the United States Supreme Court, in the case of
       <i>
        Shelby County v. Holder
       </i>
       (June 25, 2013), struck down the coverage formula that determined what jurisdictions are subject to Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, so the coverage formula can no longer be used as a basis for subjecting jurisdictions to preclearance under Section 5.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because of the
       <i>
        Shelby County
       </i>
       decision, the United States Attorney General is not making any determinations under Section 5 on voting or election changes made by states.
   The Supreme Court did not strike down Section 5, so it is still in effect.
   For that reason, the Mississippi Attorney General’s Office submitted Chapter 432, Laws of 2013, to the United States Attorney General, in order to technically meet the requirements of Section 5 and fulfill the condition in the effective date of the bill, which will allow the bill to take effect.
      </p>
      <p>
       By letter dated October 22, 2013, the United States Attorney General responded that he is not making determinations on the merits of any bill that is submitted under Section 5. The submission of Chapter 432 and the response from the United States Attorney General technically met the requirements of Section 5 and fulfilled the condition in the effective date of Chapter 432, so Chapter 432 became effective from and after October 22, 2013, the date of the United States Attorney General’s response letter.

   Circuit court properly found that mail-in absentee ballots that did not comply with Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t23c15s23-15-635ol11" target="_self">23-15-635(1)</a></cite> were illegal since strict compliance was necessary; however, once it found that a losing candidate received the greatest number of legal votes, it was error to order a special election instead of utilizing Miss.

Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t23c15s23-15-951ol12001" target="_self">23-15-951 (2001)</a></cite> was the proper statute for the trial court to apply in an appeal by the losing candidate for county election commissioner, who successfully alleged that the winning candidate was disqualified on the grounds of his residency in the wrong county.

      <p>
       House of Representatives had jurisdiction to conduct proceedings in which it interviewed election commission and heard from candidates in disputed election for House seat; while statute allowed challenger to file petitions in circuit court, statute also gives legislature, or committee appointed to investigate facts concerning election of member, power to compel witness testimony and production of documents relating to investigation. Esco v. Blackmon, 692 So. 2d 74, 1997 Miss. LEXIS 156 (Miss. 1997).

       While statute permits jury to be empaneled to decide issues in election contest, it does not mandate full trial of all issues before jury. Esco v. Blackmon, 692 So. 2d 74, 1997 Miss. LEXIS 156 (Miss. 1997).

   A trial court properly ruled as a matter of law on an issue pertaining to the propriety of a town clerk’s hand-delivery of 3 absentee ballots to her able-bodied relatives; while §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t23c15s23-15-951" target="_self">23-15-951</a></cite> permits a jury to be impaneled to decide issues in an election contest, it does not mandate a full trial of all issues before a jury. Lewis v. Griffith, 664 So. 2d 177, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 450 (Miss. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 23-15-951 is the exclusive remedy for deciding election contest issues, of which the legality of votes cast is one, and, therefore, it would have been inappropriate to decide by declaratory judgment how to legally count affidavit ballots because that issue would not become ripe for judicial resolution until a statutory election contest was commenced following the election commission’s certification. The initial determination of whether to accept or reject ballots in an election is statutorily lodged with the election commission; with the exception of remedial writs in aid of future jurisdiction, the judiciary is compelled to stay its hand until an election contest is filed in accordance with the statute. In re Wilbourn, 590 So. 2d 1381, 1991 Miss. LEXIS 835 (Miss. 1991).

       Although ballots are controlling as primary evidence where their proponent affirmatively demonstrates that the integrity of the ballot box has been maintained inviolate, where the parties stipulate into evidence what would otherwise be both primary and secondary proof, the presumption of correctness of the results certified by the election commissioners prevails unless the jury finds the presumption overcome by some plausible explanation of the discrepancy. Thus, in a contest challenging the election of one candidate to a county board of education, the trial court properly upheld the election on the basis of tally sheets as enclosed in the ballot box, despite a discrepancy between the sheets and the actual ballot count, where the ballots and tally sheets were introduced into evidence by stipulation of the parties and where no explanation was offered by either of the parties for the discrepancy. Blakeney v. Hawkins, 384 So. 2d 1035, 1980 Miss. LEXIS 2007 (Miss. 1980).

       In an action contesting an election, voters legally entitled to vote cannot be required to tell for whom they voted. Hubbard v. McKey, 193 So. 2d 129, 1966 Miss. LEXIS 1277 (Miss. 1966).

      <p>
       In an action contesting an election, a voter cannot be compelled to disclose how he voted if the legality of the vote is in doubt. Hubbard v. McKey, 193 So. 2d 129, 1966 Miss. LEXIS 1277 (Miss. 1966).
      </p>
      <p>
       In an action contesting an election, the presumption of the legality of a vote must be overcome by affirmative proof before the voter can be required to tell for whom he voted. Hubbard v. McKey, 193 So. 2d 129, 1966 Miss. LEXIS 1277 (Miss. 1966).
      </p>
      <p>
       One contesting an election has the burden of proof to show that voters were disqualified, and how they voted. Hubbard v. McKey, 193 So. 2d 129, 1966 Miss. LEXIS 1277 (Miss. 1966).

      <p>
       The power of the circuit court to issue a writ of mandamus to the circuit clerk to permit inspection of the ballot boxes is necessary, supplemental to and in support of the statutory right of candidate to contest a general or special election. Lopez v. Holleman, 219 Miss. 822, 69 So. 2d 903, 1954 Miss. LEXIS 392 (Miss. 1954).
      </p>
      <p>
       Section which gives any candidate in a primary election contest a right to have full examination of ballot boxes at any time within twelve days after the canvass by the executive committee is in pari materia with this section [Code 1942, § 3287], in that it is indicative of a general policy of the state on a cognate subject matter to allow contesting candidates the right to obtain the facts concerning an election precedent to filing a contest. Lopez v. Holleman, 219 Miss. 822, 69 So. 2d 903, 1954 Miss. LEXIS 392 (Miss. 1954).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section [Code 1942, § 3287] provides an exclusive remedy for one who contests the manner or results of an election. State ex rel. Livingston v. Bounds, 212 Miss. 184, 54 So. 2d 276, 1951 Miss. LEXIS 442 (Miss. 1951).
      </p>
      <p>
       When an election contestee pleads an affirmative defense he must set forth the grounds upon which his defense rests. Simmons v. Crisler, 197 Miss. 547, 20 So. 2d 85, 1944 Miss. LEXIS 319 (Miss. 1944).
      </p>
      <p>
       Election contestee’s plea that votes of named individuals were invalid because they had not paid their poll taxes as required by § 241 of the Constitution was insufficient, even assuming that failure to have paid their poll taxes disqualified such voters, where the plea failed to set forth for whom alleged illegal votes were cast, so that trial court committed no error in striking therefrom all allegations relative thereto, and contestee would not be permitted to amend his plea where he stated therein that he did not know and could not ascertain for whom alleged illegal votes were cast until proof thereof was made at the trial. Simmons v. Crisler, 197 Miss. 547, 20 So. 2d 85, 1944 Miss. LEXIS 319 (Miss. 1944).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section [Code 1942, § 3287] limits the right to contest in the person or persons who were candidates in the election, and does not give a taxpayer or qualified elector the right to contest the election of a county officer. Jones v. Election Comm'rs of Hancock County, 187 Miss. 636, 193 So. 3, 1940 Miss. LEXIS 215 (Miss. 1940).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section [Code 1942, § 3287] does not authorize a taxpayer or qualified elector to contest an election abolishing the office of county attorney. Jones v. Election Comm'rs of Hancock County, 187 Miss. 636, 193 So. 3, 1940 Miss. LEXIS 215 (Miss. 1940).
      </p>
      <p>
       One who contested the election of another to a municipal office because of his illegal nomination in the primary, who made no claim to have been elected himself, was not entitled to contest the election, the proper remedy in such case being quo warranto, since the question is a public and not a private one. Omar v. West, 186 Miss. 136, 188 So. 917, 1939 Miss. LEXIS 196 (Miss. 1939).
      </p>
      <p>
       That contestee was disqualified from holding office did not affect legality of votes cast for him. May v. Young, 164 Miss. 35, 143 So. 703, 1932 Miss. LEXIS 220 (Miss. 1932).
      </p>
      <p>
       As respects remedy by quo warranto, declaration of election commissioners that certain person received majority of legal votes cast at election and was duly elected could be contested only in accordance with statute providing for election contest. Warren v. State, 163 Miss. 817, 141 So. 901, 1932 Miss. LEXIS 90 (Miss. 1932).
      </p>
      <p>
       Judgment in election contest over office of county superintendent, in view of issues determined, held not res judicata, in subsequent quo warranto proceeding, of issue involving contestant’s removal from State. Weisinger v. McGehee, 160 Miss. 424, 134 So. 148, 1931 Miss. LEXIS 186 (Miss. 1931).
      </p>
      <p>
       Writ of certiorari could not issue against county election commissioners, where it was sought to conduct in circuit court a contest of election. Board of Supervisors v. Stephenson, 130 So. 684 (Miss.), rev'd, 160 Miss. 372, 134 So. 142, 1931 Miss. LEXIS 182 (Miss. 1930).
      </p>
      <p>
       Refusal of continuance in election contest held not to require reversal without showing that such refusal denied substantial rights. Tonnar v. Wade, 153 Miss. 722, 121 So. 156, 1929 Miss. LEXIS 56 (Miss. 1929).
      </p>
      <p>
       One claiming commissioner erred in counting votes, and that he should have been inducted into office, cannot bring quo warranto under this section [Code 1942, § 3287]. Loposser v. State, 110 Miss. 240, 70 So. 345, 1915 Miss. LEXIS 30 (Miss. 1915).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a contest for a county office it may be shown by the contestant that he was deprived of his rightful majority by the fraudulent practice of the managers at certain precincts in returning a greater number of votes than were actually cast, and receiving votes of persons not qualified electors, and votes which had been marked and furnished to voters by others in disregard of the constitution. Sproule v. Fredericks, 69 Miss. 898, 11 So. 472, 1892 Miss. LEXIS 10 (Miss. 1892).
      </p>
      <p>
       Elections to municipal offices are not embraced herein. Easly v. Badenhausen, 59 Miss. 580, 1882 Miss. LEXIS 165 (Miss. 1882).
      </p>
      <p>
       The filing of the petition gives the court jurisdiction of the contest, and the failure to issue the summons at once does not authorize the quashing of the proceedings. Hall v. Lyon, 59 Miss. 218, 1881 Miss. LEXIS 107 (Miss. 1881).

Code Ann. §§<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t23c15s23-15-955" target="_self">23-15-955</a></cite> and<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t23c15s23-15-927" target="_self">23-15-927</a></cite> is clear support for the distinction. Dillon v. Myers, 227 So.3d 923, 2017 Miss. LEXIS 134 (Miss. 2017).
      </p>
      <p>
       Statute governing proceedings with respect to election of member of legislature does not provide for legislature to elect its own members, but rather merely allows legislature to examine elective process after winner is certified to determine if illegal or corrupt practices have taken place, and does not violate provision of State Constitution under which legislature may not elect any other than its own officers and state librarian. Esco v. Blackmon, 692 So. 2d 74, 1997 Miss. LEXIS 156 (Miss. 1997).

At least two (2) days before the hearing to consider the petition, the appropriate executive committee shall give notice to both the petitioner and the contested candidate of the time and place of the hearing on the petition.

       Any party aggrieved by the action or inaction of the appropriate executive committee may file a petition for judicial review to the circuit court of the county in which the executive committee whose decision is being reviewed sits. The petition must be filed no later than fifteen (15) days after the date the petition was originally filed with the appropriate executive committee. The person filing for judicial review shall give a cost bond in the sum of Three Hundred Dollars ($300.00) with two (2) or more sufficient sureties conditioned to pay all costs in case his petition be dismissed, and an additional bond may be required, by the court, if necessary, at any subsequent stage of the proceedings.

It shall be the official duty of the trial judge to proceed to the discharge of the designated duty at the earliest possible date to be fixed by the judge and of which the contestant and contestee shall have reasonable notice. The contestant and contestee are to be served in a reasonable manner as the judge may direct, in response to which notice the contestee shall promptly file his answer, and also his cross-complaint if he has a cross-complaint. The hearing before the trial court shall be de novo. The matter shall be tried to the trial judge, without a jury. After hearing the evidence, the trial judge shall determine whether the candidate whose qualifications have been challenged is legally qualified to have his name placed upon the ballot in question.

The bill of exceptions shall be signed by the trial judge, or in case of his absence, refusal or disability, by two (2) disinterested attorneys, as is provided by law in other cases of bills of exception. The filing of such appeals shall automatically suspend the decision of the circuit court and the appropriate executive committee is entitled to proceed based upon their decision unless and until the Supreme Court, in its discretion, stays further proceedings in the matter. The appeal shall be immediately docketed in the Supreme Court and referred to the court en banc upon briefs without oral argument unless the court shall call for oral argument, and shall be decided at the earliest possible date, as a preference case over all others.

After a party nominee assumes an elective office, his qualifications to hold that office may be contested as otherwise provided by law.

      <p>
       The effective date of Chapter 406, Laws of 2013, which amended this section, is “from and after the date it is effectuated under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, as amended and extended.” However, after the bill was approved, the United States Supreme Court, in the case of
       <i>
        Shelby County v. Holder
       </i>
       (June 25, 2013), struck down the coverage formula that determined what jurisdictions are subject to Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, so the coverage formula can no longer be used as a basis for subjecting jurisdictions to preclearance under Section 5.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because of the
       <i>
        Shelby County
       </i>
       decision, the United States Attorney General is not making any determinations under Section 5 on voting or election changes made by states.
   The Supreme Court did not strike down Section 5, so it is still in effect.
   For that reason, the Mississippi Attorney General’s Office submitted Chapter 406, Laws of 2013, to the United States Attorney General, in order to technically meet the requirements of Section 5 and fulfill the condition in the effective date of the bill, which will allow the bill to take effect.
      </p>
      <p>
       By letter dated August 1, 2013, the United States Attorney General responded that he is not making determinations on the merits of any bill that is submitted under Section 5. The submission of Chapter 406 and the response from the United States Attorney General technically met the requirements of Section 5 and fulfilled the condition in the effective date of Chapter 406, so Chapter 406 became effective from and after August 1, 2013, the date of the United States Attorney General’s response letter.

       Statute did not apply because a candidate was not qualified for public office at a general election, as the Election Commission had disqualified him; the candidate was not contesting the qualifications of another person but was challenging his own disqualification.

   State judicial elections come within coverage of “results test” provisions of § 2 of Voting Rights Act of 1965 (52 USCS § 10301), as amended in 1982; if term “representatives” limited coverage with respect to judicial elections, limitation would exclude all claims involving judicial elections; better reading of term describes winners of representative, popular elections.

      <p>
       The United States Attorney General interposed no objection under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, to the amendment of this section by Laws of 1991 Extra Session, ch. 2, § 1, on February 21, 1992.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a result of the 2000 federal decennial census, the number of representatives in Congress to which the State of Mississippi is entitled was reduced from five to four.
   The State of Mississippi was unable to redraw its congressional districts to reduce the number of districts.
   The United States District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi, in the case of
       <i>
        Smith v. Clark
       </i>
       (Civil Action No. 3:01-CV-855WS), by order dated February 26, 2002, enjoined the state from implementing the five-district congressional redistricting plan codified in
   Section 25-15-1037 and ordered the state to implement the four-district congressional redistricting plan adopted by the court in that order for congressional primary and general elections for the State of Mississippi in 2002 and all succeeding congressional primary and general elections thereafter, until the State of Mississippi produced a constitutional congressional redistricting plan.
   The State of Mississippi was again unable to redistrict its congressional districts following the 2010 federal decennial census. The United State District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi in the case of
       <i>
        Smith v. Hosemann
       </i>
       (Civil Action No. 3:01-cv-855-HTW-DCB), by order dated December 30, 2011,
   ordered the state to implement the four-district congressional redistricting plan adopted by the court in that order
   for conducting congressional primary and general elections for the State of Mississippi in 2012,
   and all succeeding congressional primary and general elections thereafter until such time as the State of Mississippi produces a constitutional congressional redistrict plan.
      </p>
      <p>
       The congressional districts that the court ordered implemented by the December 30, 2011, order are as described below:

   Since the State Legislature failed in its duty to provide for new congressional districts after its delegation to the United States House of Representatives was reduced from five representatives to four representatives following the decennial census, the default procedure under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t23c15s23-15-1039" target="_self">23-15-1039</a></cite> provided for at-large elections; however, such a procedure could not be presently used since the State was under a federal court injunction directing that it use the congressional districts drawn by the three-judge federal trial court and, thus, that the court either had to vacate the injunction or the State Legislature had to draw a redistricting plan meeting federal voting law requirements before an at-large election could be held.

       Although the philosophy of the National Democratic Party may be altruistic in the apportionment of its delegates, there is in reality no possible method or manner by which a state convention through its “grass roots” and precinct levels can select by secret ballot, in a democratic fashion, a proportionate representation of individuals to comply with such a theory. Riddell v. National Democratic Party, 344 F. Supp. 908, 1972 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12898 (S.D. Miss. 1972), rev'd, 508 F.2d 770, 1975 U.S. App. LEXIS 15984 (5th Cir. Miss. 1975).

       The essential aim of Code 1942, §§ 3107, 3107-02, 3107-04 and 3107-06 controlling political party electoral processes is that voters and those who wish to participate have notice of the caucuses and conventions at a fixed time and place, with an unfettered opportunity to participate, free from confusion and intimidation. Riddell v. National Democratic Party, 344 F. Supp. 908, 1972 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12898 (S.D. Miss. 1972), rev'd, 508 F.2d 770, 1975 U.S. App. LEXIS 15984 (5th Cir. Miss. 1975).

      <p>
       The provisions of this section [Code 1942, § 3107] of a method whereby the state political party conventions may select two slates of presidential electors, one slate pledged to support the nominee of the national political party, and one slate unpledged, offends no provision of the United States Constitution, for this section expressly provides that nothing therein shall prohibit a slate of electors pledged to support the national party candidate from running on the same general election ballot, and Code 1942, § 3260 enables such a slate to get on the ballot upon the petition of 1,000 voters. Gray v. Mississippi, 233 F. Supp. 139, 1964 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7357 (N.D. Miss. 1964).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section [Code 1942, § 3107] applies uniformly to all members of the electorate and the one man-one vote principle is in no way violated, and the section does not on its face discriminate among voters or between political parties.

       Mississippi voters are not denied the opportunity to vote for electors pledged to support a national party nominee under the provisions of this section [Code 1942, § 3107], but they are denied the opportunity to vote for a pledged slate running under the national party label.

       Although the philosophy of the National Democratic Party may be altruistic in the apportionment of its delegates, there is in reality no possible method or manner by which a state convention through its “grass roots” and precinct levels can select by secret ballot, in a democratic fashion, a proportionate representation of individuals to comply with such a theory. Riddell v. National Democratic Party, 344 F. Supp. 908, 1972 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12898 (S.D. Miss. 1972), rev'd, 508 F.2d 770, 1975 U.S. App. LEXIS 15984 (5th Cir. Miss. 1975).

       The essential aim of Code 1942, §§ 3107, 3107-02, 3107-04 and 3107-06 controlling political party electoral processes is that voters and those who wish to participate have notice of the caucuses and conventions at a fixed time and place, with an unfettered opportunity to participate, free from confusion and intimidation. Riddell v. National Democratic Party, 344 F. Supp. 908, 1972 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12898 (S.D. Miss. 1972), rev'd, 508 F.2d 770, 1975 U.S. App. LEXIS 15984 (5th Cir. Miss. 1975).

   Under this section [Code 1942, § 3107-02] the secretary of state has the power to hear evidence and decide facts and is an inferior tribunal having quasi judicial powers. Hoskins v.

   Where a political organization which for many years had used the word Republican in its name and then changed the name but continued the use of the word Republican and changing of name did not alter organization or membership or officers or representatives of this organization, this name change did not justify a rejection of application for registration under the statutes.

       The sponsor of an initiative must identify in the text of an initiative the amount and source of revenue required to implement the initiative; if the initiative would reduce government revenues or would require a reduction of funds to programs or a reallocation of funds between programs, then the sponsor must set forth in the text of the initiative exactly which program or programs will be cut back or eliminated, and the sponsor must provide sufficient facts so that the voters are informed as to the effect of the initiative on sources of government revenues and current programs; if the sponsor asserts that no adverse impact will occur in sources of government revenues, the sponsor must establish a rational basis to support such assertion. 2001 Miss.

Neither the statement nor the summary may intentionally be an argument, nor likely to create prejudice, either for or against the measure. Such concise statement shall constitute the ballot title. The ballot title formulated by the Attorney General shall be the ballot title of the measure unless changed on appeal. When practicable, the question posed by the ballot title shall be written in such a way that an affirmative answer to such question and an affirmative vote on the measure would result in a change in then current law, and a negative answer to the question and a negative vote on the measure would result in no change to then current law.

      If an initiative measure proposed to the Legislature has been rejected by the Legislature and an alternative measure is passed by the Legislature in lieu thereof, the serial numbers and ballot titles of both such measures shall be printed on the official ballots so that a voter can express separately two (2) preferences: First, by voting for the approval of either measure or against both measures, and, secondly, by voting for one measure or the other measure. If the majority of those voting on the first issue is against both measures, then both measures fail, but in that case the votes on the second issue nevertheless shall be carefully counted and made public. If a majority voting on the first issue is for the approval of either measure, then the measure receiving a majority of the votes on the second issue and also receiving not less than forty percent (40%) of the total votes cast at the election at which the measure was submitted for approval shall be law. Any person who votes against both measures on the first issue may vote but shall not be required to vote for any of the measures on the second issue in order for the ballot to be valid. Substantially the following form shall be a compliance with this section:
