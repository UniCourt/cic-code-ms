     <p>
      In order to utilize the services of a judge temporarily assigned to chancery or circuit court in a county, the chancery or circuit court judge is authorized to extend a term of his court in one (1) county in a district, even if it overlaps into a term of that court in another county in the same district, so long as the term of court in the county into which the extension runs shall not be pretermitted. The Nineteenth Chancery Court District and the Eighteenth Circuit Court District are hereby excepted from the provisions of this section.

      The word “county” wherever used herein shall be construed to mean “judicial district” in counties having two (2) judicial districts.

   A practicing attorney selected as a special judge for service on the Supreme Court may remain of counsel in all cases presently pending in the state and federal courts. However, pursuant to §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t09c01s9-1-25" target="_self">9-1-25</a></cite> which applies to any judge of the Supreme Court, a special judge may not be engaged in the practice of law and, therefore, may not practice in any of the state courts during his tenure as a special judge. A special judge may, pursuant to the same statute, practice in the federal courts in any case in which he or she was engaged when appointed. Hurst, May, 21, 2004, A.G. Op. 04-0180.

       In a case alleging tortious interference with business relations, there was no error based on a trial judge’s failure to recuse himself under Miss. Unif. Cir. & Cty. R. 1.15 because the owners failed to raise the issue of alleged impartiality at the trial court level; the owners’ website showed that they knew of a grounds for recusal at the time of trial, and even if the owners had not been able to raise this issue before the trial judge, a reversal would still not have been granted because the judge was not connected to the objectors by affinity or consanguinity, and he had no interest in the outcome of the case based on vague allegations that the judge had eaten at the owners’ lodge.

       A trial judge who was the brother of a senior partner in a law firm representing a principal defendant should have recused himself from the case because of the appearance of impropriety. Trial judges in such a situation, particularly where the judge has filed a notice of relationship and a motion has been made for recusal because of the close kinship, should grant the motion and decline to participate in the case.

   Trial judge abused his discretion in declining to recuse himself in a prosecution for aggravated assault and forcible rape of child, since he had served as county prosecuting attorney in an earlier youth-court shelter hearing regarding the child’s custody as a result of the events giving rise to the criminal charges, and 1) the threshold issue in that hearing was whether the complainant was an “abused child” under Miss.

   Evidence that a Supreme Court justice had served as Attorney General at the time the defendant was extradited from another state was insufficient to overcome the presumption that the justice was qualified and unbiased, where the justice had no personal involvement in or actual knowledge of the defendant’s case while he was Attorney General, the Office of Attorney General exercised no responsibility in the defendant’s trial, the involvement of the Office of Attorney General in the actual extradition of the defendant was minimal, and the Attorney General’s entrance into the case arose after being noticed by the filing of the defendant’s appeal which occurred only one week prior to the justice’s departure from the Office of Attorney General.

       A judge who had served as the prosecutor at the time of the defendant’s indictment should have disqualified himself; the very functions involved in the performance of the positions of judge and prosecutor are contradictory and no person can be considered to be impartial while that person is also acting as a partisan. Since the judge failed to disqualify himself, the defendant was deprived of due process, which includes a fair and impartial trial. Jenkins v. State, 570 So. 2d 1191, 1990 Miss.

   Chancery court could hold a mother in contempt pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t09c01s9-1-17" target="_self">9-1-17</a></cite> because her failure to pay her portion of a car lease constituted a direct violation of the chancery court’s order. Mercier v. Mercier, 11 So.3d 1283, 2009 Miss. App. LEXIS 365 (Miss. Ct. App. 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a decedent’s daughter was held in contempt for failing to inventory and turn over to decedent’s wife all assets in her possession that belonged to the decedent’s estate, the contempt was civil and not criminal because: (1) the contempt order’s primary purpose was to enforce the wife’s rights to possess the decedent’s property, and (2) the daughter had been ordered not to pay a fine to the court, but only to pay the wife’s attorney’s fees. Fisher v. Patton (In re Estate of Patton), 971 So. 2d 1281, 2008 Miss. App. LEXIS 10 (Miss. Ct. App. 2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       The limits of the statute apply only where the sanction is imposed for direct contempt; the limits do not apply to constructive contempt. Wyssbrod v. Wittjen, 798 So. 2d 352, 2001 Miss. LEXIS 23 (Miss. 2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       It was proper for a chancellor to find a father not in contempt for failure to pay the full amount of child support required where the father filed for a modification of child support before the children’s mother filed the motion for contempt concerning the arrearage in child support payments. Thurman v. Thurman, 559 So. 2d 1014, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 185 (Miss. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       A petition to hold a county board of supervisors in contempt for failure to comply with a consent decree was a petition for criminal contempt rather than civil contempt, where the alleged contempt did not consist of the defendants refusing to do any affirmative act required but rather doing that which had been prohibited, and the petition recited that prior acts of the defendants justified an increase in previously imposed criminal sanctions “in order to deter such defendants from further violations.” Common Cause of Mississippi v. Smith, 548 So. 2d 412, 1989 Miss. LEXIS 362 (Miss. 1989).

   The indemnitor of surety company, which had furnished payment and performance bonds in connection with construction contracts, held in civil contempt for refusal to comply with decree of state chancery court requiring him to provide financial statements and disclose the whereabouts of his assets, and whose refusal was based on the ground that compliance with the decree would result in self-incrimination under the fourth and fifth amendments to the federal constitution, was directed to furnish the required information if granted immunity from prosecution under state criminal statutes. Morgan v. Thomas, 448 F.2d 1356, 1971 U.S. App. LEXIS 8009 (5th Cir. Miss. 1971), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">405 U.S. 920</cite>, <cite class="s_court">92 S.

      <p>
       This section [Code 1942 § 1656] does not apply to the scope of punishment for contempt occurring while the court is not sitting, the applicable section under these circumstances is Code 1942, § 2562, applying to offenses for which a penalty is not provided elsewhere by statute. Melvin v. State, 210 Miss. 132, 48 So. 2d 856, 1950 Miss. LEXIS 329 (Miss. 1950).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section [Code 1942 § 1656] defines the extent of punishment only while the court is sitting, but it does not exclude the power to punish for contempt while the court is not sitting. Melvin v. State, 210 Miss. 132, 48 So. 2d 856, 1950 Miss. LEXIS 329 (Miss. 1950).

       Contrition and apology serve only to ameliorate the offense of contempt and to mitigate the punishment. Brannon v. State, 202 Miss. 571, 29 So. 2d 916, 1947 Miss. LEXIS 319 (Miss. 1947).
      </p>
      <p>
       Provision empowering the court to punish any person for breach of any decree or order of the court, by fine or imprisonment, or both, provides for criminal contempt, while a provision providing that, if any person refuses to obey or perform any order or judgment of the court, the court shall have power to fine and imprison him until the order or judgment is complied with, provides for civil or quasi criminal contempt; the order for imprisonment in the former case is for a past and completed act or omission, is punitory and must be suffered, and its purpose is to preserve the power and vindicate the dignity of the court; in the latter case the punishment is coercive and the contemnor may discharge himself by compliance with the terms of the decree violated, and its purpose is to compel obedience to its decrees. Evans v. Evans, 193 Miss. 468, 9 So. 2d 641, 1942 Miss. LEXIS 116 (Miss. 1942).

       Chancellor erred in finding a father in contempt because the lack of specificity in the parties’ property-settlement agreement, combined with the mother’s failure to timely submit the invoices or bills, made it impossible for the father to pay his half of the expenses, and the findings that the father failed to pay child support and that he had overpaid child support were incompatible. Jones v. Jones, 265 So.3d 195, 2019 Miss. App. LEXIS 58 (Miss. Ct. App. 2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       Husband was not in contempt for failure to comply with a modified child support order; the order made it virtually impossible for the husband to be held in contempt by allowing him to estimate and subtract college expenses from the monthly support obligation during the summer months. Weeks v. Weeks, 29 So.3d 80, 2009 Miss. App. LEXIS 860 (Miss. Ct. App. 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       Husband was not in contempt for failing to provide a wife with evidence that he had complied with a previous order to maintain the wife as an irrevocable beneficiary on a life insurance policy, because the order only required him to maintain the coverage, not to provide her with proof of coverage. Weeks v. Weeks, 29 So.3d 80, 2009 Miss. App. LEXIS 860 (Miss. Ct. App. 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancery court’s refusal to hold the husband in contempt was not error where the wife failed to show that he had not maintained a life insurance policy with her as an irrevocable beneficiary. Weeks v. Weeks, 2008 Miss. App. LEXIS 187 (Miss. Ct. App. Apr. 1, 2008), op. withdrawn, sub. op., 29 So.3d 80, 2009 Miss. App. LEXIS 860 (Miss. Ct. App. 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       Contemnor failed to comply with divorce decree, and a chancellor did not commit manifest error or abuse the chancery court’s discretion by incarcerating the contemnor, as the chancellor’s decision was supported by the record, which included the chancellor’s findings that the contemnor was not credible; further, the divorce decree was not ambiguous, so the contemnor’s argument that the contemnor could not obey because of the decree’s alleged vagueness was rejected. Stribling v. Stribling, 960 So. 2d 556, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 1 (Miss. Ct. App. 2007).

       Through the court reporter’s repeated failure to complete trial transcripts in a timely manner, the court reporter had a serious negative effect on the efficiency of the court; pursuant to Miss. R. Governing Certified Ct. Reporters IX(A)(2), the court reporter was in willful constructive criminal contempt of the Mississippi Supreme Court for his repeated failure to comply with its orders and the Supreme Court revoked his court reporter certification and ordered him to pay all costs of the the contempt proceedings, including attorney’s fees and court reporter’s fees. In re Hoppock, 849 So. 2d 1275, 2003 Miss. LEXIS 342 (Miss. 2003).
      </p>

       A chancellor was “manifestly in error” when he found a mother in contempt of court for effectively curtailing the father’s court-ordered visitation rights with the parties’ daughter by moving to Alaska. The mother never ignored an order of the court since there was nothing in the court order that restricted her from moving to another state. Stevison v. Woods, 560 So. 2d 176, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 205 (Miss. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       A former husband was properly held in contempt of court for failure to pay his former wife monies due for insurance premiums under the parties’ original divorce decree, which provided that the former wife was to purchase insurance on behalf of the parties’ children and that the former husband was to reimburse the former wife for the premium allocated to the parties’ son, in spite of the former husband’s arguments that he had obtained health insurance on the children’s behalf and should be absolved of any responsibility to reimburse the former wife for any insurance she obtained; the divorce judgment required the former husband to reimburse the former wife for the son’s premiums, which the former husband failed to do. Stevison v. Woods, 560 So. 2d 176, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 205 (Miss. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       A father was not in contempt for failure to pay child support under an automatic adjustment clause of a property settlement agreement where the agreement was uncertain in that a genuine dispute existed over the amount owed, over the commencement year of the escalation clause, and over which consumer price index was to be utilized. Wing v. Wing, 549 So. 2d 944, 1989 Miss. LEXIS 443 (Miss. 1989).
      </p>
      <p>
       Direct criminal contempt is one which takes place in very presence of judge, making all elements of offense personal knowledge, and such may be summarily punished without affidavit, pleading, or formal charges, and no evidence or proof other than court’s own knowledge is required to punish such contempt. Varvaris v. State, 512 So. 2d 886, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2783 (Miss. 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       Appellant, who contended that certain household goods and an automobile which had been in the possession of the deceased actually belonged to his wife and his principal, respectively, was not guilty of contempt by filing replevin action against the administratrix, in her individual capacity, to recover possession of the property while the estate was in process of administration. Ballew v. Case, 232 Miss. 183, 98 So. 2d 451, 1957 Miss. LEXIS 458 (Miss. 1957).
      </p>
      <p>
       Contempt is complete when there is a deliberate purpose or calculation to corrupt administration of justice and that purpose or calculation is accompanied by definite overt act or declaration on part of contemnor, designed to carry that purpose or calculation into effect; and failure of design becomes immaterial, except as it may have some place in considering punishment to be inflicted. Jones v. State, 208 Miss. 762, 45 So. 2d 576, 1950 Miss. LEXIS 294 (Miss. 1950).
      </p>
      <p>
       One who attempts to bribe or influence decision of juror is guilty of contempt of court, regardless of whether act which constitutes contempt is committed in or out of presence of court, or whether juror is actually sworn on particular case or is only member of panel from which trial jury is to be selected. Jones v. State, 208 Miss. 762, 45 So. 2d 576, 1950 Miss. LEXIS 294 (Miss. 1950).
      </p>
      <p>
       Person is guilty of contempt of court when he approaches prospective juror, who has been summoned for trial of murder case, at juror’s home and advises juror that there are some things in favor of defendant that court will not permit to go to jury, that deceased had been running over defendant, but that fact would be kept from jury and if it wasn’t brought out juror should give defendant a break. Jones v. State, 208 Miss. 762, 45 So. 2d 576, 1950 Miss. LEXIS 294 (Miss. 1950).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where defendant, as a witness in a criminal prosecution, had the appearance of being intoxicated on the witness stand, was chewing gum and smoking a cigarette, and upon retiring from the witness stand faced the district attorney, and in close proximity to the judge’s bench, gritted his teeth at the district attorney and scowled at him in a hostile and threatening manner and said “I’ll see you when you come down,” conduct constituted contempt. Estes v. State, 192 Miss. 400, 6 So. 2d 132, 1942 Miss. LEXIS 28 (Miss. 1942).
      </p>
      <p>
       Any words or conduct which impedes, embarrasses, obstructs, defeats or corrupts the administration of courts of justice or which to a substantial degree is calculated, or would tend so to do, is a contempt and within the protection of the rule are included all those who are actually a part of the official personnel of the court and when the prohibited language or conduct has a real relation to the discharge by them of official functions appertaining to the court as a court, and so long as the protected person is acting in a lawfully authorized manner; and it is immaterial that the prohibited language or conduct had no successful eventuation. Estes v. State, 192 Miss. 400, 6 So. 2d 132, 1942 Miss. LEXIS 28 (Miss. 1942).
      </p>
      <p>
       The right of the court to enforce respect for itself begins where the right of the citizen to speak ends, and the line of demarcation is fixed at that point where that which is spoken or published is calculated to obstruct the functioning processes of the court or to impede or impair the efficiency of its machinery then in motion, it being immaterial whether the obstruction is by force, insult, persuasion or disobedience, whether committed by act or word, or whether it affects the judge, the grand or petit jury, or any person made part of its personnel by its process. Sullens v. State, 191 Miss. 856, 4 So. 2d 356, 1941 Miss. LEXIS 195 (Miss. 1941).
      </p>
      <p>
       The citizens may reasonably criticize even the court or the judges thereof; and the exercise of this right may embarrass the particular functionary; it may depreciate the effectiveness of our legal procedure, yet so long as it pulls up short of the obstruction or impediment of the machinery of the court then in motion, it is free from interference by the court. Sullens v. State, 191 Miss. 856, 4 So. 2d 356, 1941 Miss. LEXIS 195 (Miss. 1941).
      </p>

       A newspaper article, stating that a good show was then being staged in the Hinds County Circuit Court room, that on the stage or screen it would be well worth the price of admission, and that statutes ought to provide an admission fee for court rooms when big human dramas were being staged to help in defraying court expenses, when viewed through the lens of the constitutional provision protecting freedom of speech, did not constitute contempt nor indicate any reasonable tendency to obstruct, embarrass or hinder the court in the proper exercise of its functions. Sullens v. State, 191 Miss. 856, 4 So. 2d 356, 1941 Miss. LEXIS 195 (Miss. 1941).

      </p>
      <p>
       “Direct contempt” is language or conduct which interferes with orderly administration of justice, and may be an open insult in the presence of the court, or defiance or resistance of the court’s authority. Neely v. State, 98 Miss. 816, 54 So. 315, 1910 Miss. LEXIS 128 (Miss. 1910).
      </p>
      <p>

       Evidence that the accused, who had not on any prior occasion been before a court, was in the witness room when another witness came in and announced that the case “was off,” whereupon the accused went home and failed to appear at trial time the next morning, but, upon being brought into the court room within 45 minutes, after an attachment was issued, stated that he did not act intentionally, was not sufficient to prove that the accused was guilty of constructive criminal contempt.

       This section [Code 1942 § 1656] defines the extent of the punishment only while the court is sitting, but it does not exclude the power to punish for contempt while the court is not sitting, and the power to deal with constructive contempts is derived from the inherent power of the court.

       Defendant is guilty of constructive contempt of court, when, knowing that juror was on special venire to try criminal case, defendant went to juror’s home at night and told juror that he was friend of man to be tried, that his friend had made mistake and if juror would be as light on him as he possibly could without doing anything he thought he should not do, friend would try to repay juror some way or other.

       Constructive contempt is any act done which tends to impede, degrade, obstruct, embarrass, interrupt, defeat or corrupt the administration of justice when the act is done beyond the presence of the court.

   Defendant’s due process rights were not violated by a contempt conviction because a trial court, even though not required for direct contempt, gave defendant notice and conducted a hearing where she was allowed to present evidence.

       Inability to pay to avoid incarceration is a continuing defense to civil contempt since imprisonment does not accomplish the purpose of the civil contempt decree, but merely punishes. A litigant may be incarcerated for civil contempt for failure to pay a judgment but that litigant is always entitled to offer evidence of inability to pay as a defense, not to the contempt, but to the incarceration. Thus, when a chancellor suspended a contemnor’s incarceration and granted her an additional month to pay the judgment, the suspension carried with it the right of the contemnor prior to the hearing to determine whether or not she should be incarcerated and an opportunity to again offer proof on the defense to the incarceration of inability to pay, and it was reversible error for the chancellor to refuse to hear such proof. Stewart v. Wilkinson, 566 So. 2d 210, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 482 (Miss. 1990).

       Individual held in prison for civil contempt was improperly held without being afforded opportunity to prove present inability to pay. defendant may avoid judgment of contempt by establishing that he is without present ability to discharge obligation, he has burden of proving his inability to pay, and such showing must be made with particularity and not in general terms. Where contemnor is unable to pay, even if that present inability is due to his misconduct, imprisonment cannot accomplish purpose of civil contempt decree, which is to compel obedience. Jones v. Hargrove, 516 So. 2d 1354, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2950 (Miss. 1987).

   As a matter of due process, a defendant who, during the course of representing himself in a state prosecution, repeatedly engaged in disruptive conduct and denounced, insulted and slandered the trial judge, was entitled to a public trial before another judge on criminal contempt charges entered at the conclusion of the trial, and the trial judge erred in pronouncing the defendant guilty of 11 criminal contempts and sentencing him to 11 to 22 years thereon, after a jury verdict of guilty in the criminal trial, since marked personal feelings were evident on both sides.

       Where defendant was arrested in October 1948, and he was arraigned at the following November term of county court, at which time he waived a trial by jury but there was a six-month delay between his arraignment and trial in May, 1949, the court in the exercise of its judicial discretion erred in not granting the defendant a trial by jury.

       Even where there has been established a prima facie case of contempt, the contemnor may avoid judgment of contempt by establishing that he or she is without present ability to discharge the obligation; if the contemnor raises this as a defense, he or she has the burden of proving his or her inability to pay, and this showing must be made with particularity.

       Only court contemned has jurisdiction to punish contemnor. Contempt was against Chancery Court of Lowndes County, and not Washington County, where Lowndes Chancery Judges recused themselves from cause, and Chancery Judge from Washington County was designated special judge to hear cause; contempt is affront to court, and not to judge as individual.

   A state trial judge in whose courtroom a contemptuous act was allegedly committed by a civil rights worker, should recuse himself from hearing any later proceedings in the matter of the contempt charge, where it was said in affidavits submitted that the judge had previously made intemperate remarks concerning civil rights litigation generally, and where the judge had been a losing defendant in a civil rights suit filed by the alleged contemnor.

       A trial judge can only adjudge a witness in contempt and punish him for false swearing where he finds the witness guilty as a result of his own personal or judicial knowledge of the facts in regard to which the testimony has been given and knows beyond a reasonable doubt that the witness has wilfully and corruptly sworn falsely; otherwise, the procedure prescribed by Code 1942 § 2479, should be followed.

       The procedural availability of remedial writ is proper to promote judicial efficiency and economy with respect to determination of whether the defendant’s constitutional right to have trial conducted in the “county where the offense was committed,” which was waived at his first trial, may be reinstated after appellate reversal. State v. Caldwell, 492 So. 2d 575, 1986 Miss. LEXIS 2531 (Miss. 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       No appeal may be taken from the court’s refusal to set aside a transfer made under this section [Code 1942 § 1657]. McMahan v. Adult Membership Boards of Phi Kappa, etc., 244 Miss. 692, 145 So. 2d 692, 1962 Miss. LEXIS 497 (Miss. 1962).

       Appeal from transfer in vacation from a circuit to a chancery court held to have been improvidently granted. McMahan v. Adult Membership Boards of Phi Kappa, etc., 244 Miss. 692, 145 So. 2d 692, 1962 Miss. LEXIS 497 (Miss. 1962).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section [Code 1942 § 1657], providing for remedial writs grantable by supreme and circuit judges, deals solely with original jurisdiction. Alexander v. Johnson, 165 Miss. 721, 138 So. 329, 1931 Miss. LEXIS 321 (Miss. 1931).

       Where attempted appeal from order granting temporary injunction was abortive, Supreme Court judge could not grant writ of supersedeas under this section [Code 1942 § 1657]. Alexander v. Johnson, 165 Miss. 721, 138 So. 329, 1931 Miss. LEXIS 321 (Miss. 1931).

      <p>
       Although the refusal by the circuit judge to issue a writ of coram nobis is not an appealable action the Supreme Court will consider the petition in banc in a regular term on its merits as being addressed to the inherent constitutional powers of the court in its revisory capacity with reference to a case pending before it. Wetzel v. State, 225 Miss. 450, 76 So. 2d 188, 76 So. 2d 194, 76 So. 2d 846, 78 So. 2d 774, 84 So. 2d 429, 1954 Miss. LEXIS 607, 1954 Miss. LEXIS 608, 1955 Miss. LEXIS 601, 1955 Miss. LEXIS 602, 1956 Miss. LEXIS 396, 1957 Miss. LEXIS 583 (Miss. 1957).
      </p>
      <p>
       Refusal of Supreme Court to grant an appeal from trial court’s refusal to grant writ of error coram nobis did not leave petitioner without further remedy, since petitioner could apply to judge of Supreme Court for such writ. Buckler v. State, 173 Miss. 350, 161 So. 683, 1935 Miss. LEXIS 224 (Miss. 1935).
      </p>
      <p>
       Writ of error coram nobis may be granted by judges of Supreme Court, although trial judge refused to grant writ and although writ is not in aid of appellate jurisdiction of Supreme Court, since writ is remedial. Buckler v. State, 173 Miss. 350, 161 So. 683, 1935 Miss. LEXIS 224 (Miss. 1935).

       A Mississippi Supreme Court Justice is prohibited from practicing law after taking office with the exception of continuing any representation of clients whose cases are in a federal court; however, a Supreme Court Justice may represent himself in a matter by presenting a motion to a court for payment of services rendered prior to becoming a Supreme Court Justice.

       Once an attorney has concluded his or her service as a special judge, the prohibition of this section would no longer apply. Therefore, the attorney may return to the practice of law in all cases in which the attorney was designated as counsel of record before his selection as special judge. The length of the appointment’s term does not change this conclusion. Hurst, May, 21, 2004, A.G. Op. 04-0180.

      <p>
       A practicing attorney selected as a special judge for service on the Supreme Court may remain of counsel in all cases presently pending in the state and federal courts. However, pursuant to this section which applies to any judge of the Supreme Court, a special judge may not be engaged in the practice of law and, therefore, may not practice in any of the state courts during his tenure as a special judge. A special judge may, pursuant to the same statute, practice in the federal courts in any case in which he or she was engaged when appointed. Hurst, May, 21, 2004, A.G. Op. 04-0180.

In the process of the preparation of the plan, the judges, at their request, may receive advice, suggestions, recommendations and other assistance from the Administrative Office of Courts. The Administrative Office of Courts must approve the positions, job descriptions and salaries before the positions may be filled. The Administrative Office of Courts shall not approve any plan which does not first require the expenditure of the funds in the support staff fund for compensation of any of the support staff before expenditure is authorized of county funds for that purpose. Upon approval by the Administrative Office of Courts, the judge or judges may appoint the employees to the position or positions, and each employee so appointed will work at the will and pleasure of the judge or judges who appointed him but will be employees of the Administrative Office of Courts. Upon approval by the Administrative Office of Courts, the appointment of any support staff shall be evidenced by the entry of an order on the minutes of the court. When support staff is appointed jointly by two (2) or more judges, the order setting forth any appointment shall be entered on the minutes of each participating court.

      In any action in which a court is authorized to award reasonable attorneys’ fees, the court shall not require the party seeking such fees to put on proof as to the reasonableness of the amount sought, but shall make the award based on the information already before it and the court’s own opinion based on experience and observation; provided however, a party may, in its discretion, place before the court other evidence as to the reasonableness of the amount of the award, and the court may consider such evidence in making the award.

       In a case where there are many billable hours that the trial court is unable to observe or lacks knowledge of, it is incumbent upon the party requesting attorney fees to place before the trial court evidence as to the reasonableness of the amount of the award, so that the record as a whole can support the award of attorney’s fees.

       Standard of review for award of attorneys’ fees is abuse of discretion, and such awards must be supported by credible evidence. Regency Nissan v. Jenkins, 678 So. 2d 95, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 435 (Miss. 1996).

       Award of $7,500 in attorney fees to successful plaintiff in action against used car dealer for violation of Odometer Disclosure Act was not abuse of discretion; plaintiff supported his claim with sixteen pages of itemized expenses, plaintiff’s attorney billed 82.50 hours at $140 per hour plus expenses of $164.91 for total of $11,714.91, and amount was adjusted downward by trial court.

       Chancery court did not abuse its discretion in by awarding a father attorney’s fees given the lengthy procedural history of the case and the mother’s persistent contempt of court; An award of $ 5,000 was not an unreasonable amount for prosecution of the contempt action, which required three hearings in chancery court and forced the father to retain counsel in Missouri. Brown v. Hewlett, — So.3d —, 2019 Miss. App. LEXIS 94 (Miss. Ct. App. Mar. 12, 2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancery court did not abuse its discretion in connection with the issue of attorney’s fees because a father was not entitled to fees that he would have incurred anyway litigating issues of custody, which was the primary issue in the case, or child support; with no specific evidence as to the amount of fees that the father incurred because of the mother’s contempt, the chancellor did not abuse his discretion by awarding the father attorney’s fees. Heisinger v. Riley, 243 So.3d 248, 2018 Miss. App. LEXIS 154 (Miss. Ct. App. 2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancery court did not err in awarding attorney’s fees to a mother because it determined that the award was a reasonable amount based on its experience, observation, and the information before it, i.e., the pleadings that requested the attorney’s fees and a three-day hearing that required the presence of the mother’s attorney Taylor v. Timmons (In re C.T.), 228 So.3d 311, 2017 Miss. App. LEXIS 332 (Miss. Ct. App. 2017).

       Where the court found that debt owed by debtor was nondischargeable in the amount of $2,903.89, and the creditor’s attorney requested $11,988.75 in fees and costs, considering the Miss. R. Prof. Conduct 1.5 factors and the lodestar amount, the court reduced the amount requested by 50% because it found no basis to justify a fee award so much greater than the amount recovered. Hometown Credit, LLC v. Peters (In re Peters), — B.R. —, 2017 Bankr. LEXIS 861 (Bankr. S.D. Miss. Mar. 28, 2017).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where debtor agreed to nondischargeable judgment in amount of $1,347.90 on underlying debt and creditor requested $5,080 in attorney fees, court, applying factors in Miss. R. Prof. Conduct 1.5, reduced amount to $1,270 because there was no basis to justify award of fees so much greater than amount recovered, the customary fee for actions of this type was one-third of the amount of the indebtedness and the questions presented were not novel or difficult. Pikco Finance, Inc. v. Staten (In re Staten), 559 B.R. 666, 2016 Bankr. LEXIS 3997 (Bankr. S.D. Miss. 2016).

      <p>
       Chancellor did not abuse the chancellor’s discretion in ordering a former spouse to pay damages to the ex-spouse in a contempt judgment because, while there was no itemized bill of the legal services or travel expenses of the ex-spouse, the record showed the amount of legal work performed and the ex-spouse’s residence in another state. Moreover, the award was reasonable. Moseley v. Smith, 180 So.3d 667, 2014 Miss. App. LEXIS 689 (Miss. Ct. App. 2014), cert. dismissed, — So.3d —, 2015 Miss.

      <p>
       In this declaratory judgment action, plaintiff was awarded attorney’s fees and expenses because the time billed by plaintiff in pursuit of the declaratory judgment, including the time billed pursuing summary judgment, was neither excessive nor unreasonable where plaintiff’s briefs were thoroughly researched and well written — a fact that greatly contributed to its success in this proceeding.
   MGM Resorts Miss., Inc. v. Thyssenkrupp Elevator Corp., — F. Supp. 3d —, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 118483 (N.D. Miss. Sept. 4, 2015).

       Trial court did not err in awarding a wife attorney’s fees because it awarded a reasonable amount of attorney’s fees to the wife pursuant to the statute based on its experience, observation, and the information before it, i.e., the pleadings and a one-day hearing. Riley v. Riley, 196 So.3d 1159, 2016 Miss. App. LEXIS 505 (Miss. Ct. App. 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a divorce action, the trial court’s award of attorneys fees to the wife was not supported by the evidence; although she testified about her lack of income, she did not submit a financial statement to substantiate her inability to pay, and there was no evidence as to the amount or reasonableness of the fees. Speights v. Speights, 126 So.3d 76, 2013 Miss. App. LEXIS 743 (Miss. Ct. App. 2013).
      </p>
      <p>
       Award of attorney’s fees was not an abuse of discretion because there was evidence of the actual attorney’s fees homeowners incurred; since there was a basis for the award of punitive damages, an award of attorney’s fees was proper.

   In a products liability action alleging three welding rod manufacturers’ failure to warn, the court granted the married couple’s request for an attorney’s fee award; exercising its discretion under Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(d) and recognizing the factors for determining a reasonable fee, set forth in Miss. R. Prof. Conduct 1.5, as well as the legislative dictated regarding reasonable fees in Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t09c01s9-1-41" target="_self">9-1-41</a></cite>, the court allowed the manufacturers to either stipulate to the fee amount requested by the couple, $2,173,185.73, or to provide the court with a challenge to the couple’s fee request within 28 days from the date of the court’s order. Jowers v. BOC Group, Inc., 608 F. Supp. 2d 724, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 28806 (S.D. Miss. 2009), vacated, in part, 617 F.3d 346, 2010 U.S. App. LEXIS 17862 (5th Cir. Miss. 2010).

       Where an insurance salesman breached an employment agreement by selling policies to former clients, the award of attorney’s fees was proper because the former employer was not require to provide any additional offer of proof on the necessity or reasonableness of attorneys’ fees.

       In a collection suit, an award of attorney’s fees in the amount of one-third of the judgment was presumptively reasonable based on the application of several factors, such as the difficulty in collecting the judgment due to a bankruptcy filing and a fee agreement.

   In a complex contract case regarding damages to equipment owned by a utilities commission, a trial court did not abuse its discretion by awarding fees to two attorneys in the case, as it was clear from the language of the trial judge’s order that the judge did in fact apply the reasonableness factors under McKee v. McKee, 418 So. 2d 764 (Miss 1982), even though he did not detail his reasoning; moreover, it was unnecessary to determine whether McKee predated Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t09c01s9-1-41" target="_self">9-1-41</a></cite>. Upchurch Plumbing, Inc. v. Greenwood Utils. Comm'n, 964 So. 2d 1100, 2007 Miss. LEXIS 495 (Miss. 2007).

       Chancery court erred in finding that there was nothing before it to show that the creditor’s accountant’s fees were reasonable; but for the fraud of the debtor, the creditor would not have incurred this expense. Allred v. Fairchild, 916 So. 2d 529, 2005 Miss. LEXIS 809 (Miss. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       An award of one-third of the amount collected was appropriate where the defendant had to defend against the plaintiff’s claim in order to collect the amount owed and where the defendant presented testimony from an experienced trial attorney in Mississippi who stated that 25 percent of the amount collected is a reasonable attorneys’ fee in Mississippi for collection of an open account if suit is not filed and that 33 1/3 percent is appropriate if suit is filed. Par Indus. v. Target Container Co., 708 So. 2d 44, 1998 Miss. LEXIS 41 (Miss. 1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       Attorneys’ fees awarded in a case involving an employer’s bad faith failure to pay a worker’s compensation claim were improperly granted because the trial court abused its discretion by making inaccurate findings regarding the factors outlined in determining the reasonableness of such an award.

       Under Section 9-1-43, the only time that a relative of a chancery or circuit clerk may be paid a salary, which combined with the clerk’s fees would exceed the cap, would be when that relative was employed by the clerk’s office prior to the time the clerk was first elected to office. To allow otherwise would defeat the intent of the statute. Ashley, August 10, 1995, A.G. Op. #95-0477.

       In a case in which defendant, a former county circuit clerk, was convicted of embezzlement, in violation of 18 U.S.C.S. § 666(a)(1), his reliance on the Phillips decision, a Louisiana case, was misplaced. In the Phillips case, defendant, a former tax assessor of a parish, was not an agent of the parish under 18 U.S.C.S. § § 666(d)(1), because Louisiana law completely separated the tax assessor’s office from the parish government; however, in Mississippi, circuit clerks were not completely separated from county governments in Mississippi, and the Phillips decision was not applicable in the present case.

All such fees received by the office of chancery or circuit clerks that are in excess of the salary limitation shall be deposited by such clerk into the county general fund on or before April 15 for the preceding calendar year. If the chancery clerk or circuit clerk serves less than one (1) year, then he shall not receive as compensation any fees in excess of that portion of the salary limitation that can be attributed to his time in office on a pro rata basis.

However, the prohibition of this subsection shall not apply to any individual who was an employee of the clerk’s office prior to the date his or her relative was elected as chancery or circuit clerk. The spouse and/or any children of the chancery clerk or circuit clerk employed in the office of the chancery clerk may be paid a salary; however, the combined annual salaries of the clerk, spouse and any child of the clerk may not exceed an amount equal to the salary limitation.

   Assignment of causes or matters to a county judge pursuant to §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t09c09s9-9-35" target="_self">9-9-35</a></cite> is by consent of the county judge. Therefore, the latter has discretion is accepting assignments while the former does not appear to have the same authority. Yerger, July 23, 2004, A.G. Op. #04-0312.

       Trial court properly dismissed individuals’ complaint against the Supreme Court chief justice for appointing a special chancellor to hear outstanding matters regarding two underlying cases as the chief justice enjoyed judicial immunity and the appointment was a judicial act. Vinson v. Prather, 879 So. 2d 1053, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 555 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).

       Whether a chancellor will call in another chancellor under [Code 1942 § 1652], because of his disqualification, or certify his disqualification to the governor for the appointment of a special chancellor under this section, is a matter pertaining to the administrative functions of his office, and is not subject to review.

       Constitution § 165, authorizing the Governor to commission a lawyer to preside at a term of the court or in a case necessarily encompasses the right of the commissioned special judge to sign orders and decrees in a case or cases over which he has been designated to preside. De Moe v. McLeod, 228 Miss. 481, 89 So. 2d 730, 1956 Miss. LEXIS 537 (Miss. 1956).

       A special chancellor, appointed and commissioned by the Governor under Constitution § 165 to try a suit to confirm title to real estate, has authority to sign a final decree in vacation. De Moe v. McLeod, 228 Miss. 481, 89 So. 2d 730, 1956 Miss. LEXIS 537 (Miss. 1956).
      </p>
      <p>
       Fact that a special judge presided at the murder trial and regular judge heard and denied a motion for new trial did not constitute reversible error where the motion was properly denied on its merits and there was no showing that a special judge would have sustained the motion. Sims v. State, 209 Miss. 545, 47 So. 2d 849, 1950 Miss. LEXIS 412 (Miss. 1950).
      </p>
      <p>
       The appointment of a special judge becomes effective upon the signing of his commission by the governor and its attestation by the secretary of state, even though the commission is not received until later by the appointee; and acts done by the appointee after acceptance of the appointment and qualification by taking the prescribed oath are valid. Smith v. State, 200 Miss. 184, 26 So. 2d 543, 1946 Miss. LEXIS 280 (Miss. 1946).

       A special judge commissioned under this section is a de facto officer and his acts are valid although he failed to take the required official oath before assuming the duties of office. Powers v. State, 83 Miss. 691, 36 So. 6, 1903 Miss. LEXIS 90 (Miss. 1903), overruled,

       Section 27-104-1 provides that the term “Fiscal Management Board” shall mean the “Department of Finance and Administration”.
      </p>
      <p>
       Laws of 1993, ch. 518, § 45, provides as follows:
      </p>
      <p>
       “SECTION 45. Section 32 of this act shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage and the remainder of this act shall take effect and be in force from and after July 2, 1993, or the date it is effectuated under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, as amended and extended, whichever is later.”
      </p>
      <p>
       On July 13, 1993, the United States Attorney General interposed no objection under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, as amended and extended to the amendment of this section by
   Laws of 1993, ch. 518.
      </p>
      <p>
       On March 1, 2002, the United States Attorney General interposed no objection under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to the amendment of this section by

        Amendment Notes —

      </h4>
      <p>
       The 2001 amendment, in the first sentence of (1), deleted “who are at least sixty-two (62) years of age” following “Justices” and inserted “and who are either at least sixty-two (62) years of age or are receiving retirement benefits” following “eight (8) years.”
      </p>
      <p>
       The 2016 amendment substituted “six (6) years” for “eight (8) years” in the first sentence of (1); and substituted “sum equal to 1/260ths” for “sum equal to 1/260” in the first sentence of (4).

   Jury did not return proper verdict as it was instructed to find for either the husband and wife or the driver, but by its verdict, the jury did neither; only then was the circuit judge authorized to enter a judgment upon that verdict, and since there was no proper verdict, it was improper for the circuit judge to enter a final judgment, and the appellate court did not have jurisdiction under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t09c03s9-3-9" target="_self">9-3-9</a></cite>. Baham v. Sullivan, 924 So. 2d 580, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 1032 (Miss. Ct. App. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Supreme Court’s authority to impose sanctions on a judge is not dependant upon the recommendations of the Commission on Judicial Performance. The Supreme Court has full jurisdiction to increase or diminish sanctions based on its review of the record made before the commission. In re Collins, 524 So. 2d 553, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2932 (Miss. 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Supreme Court has no jurisdiction where there had ceased to be a controversy. Insured Sav. & Loan Asso. v. State, 242 Miss. 547, 135 So. 2d 703, 1961 Miss. LEXIS 592 (Miss. 1961).
      </p>
      <p>
       Supreme Court cannot temporarily suspend its jurisdiction, confer the same on a circuit court to pass upon a matter, and, after it has done so, to report back to, and reinvest the Supreme Court with jurisdiction. Copeland v. Robertson, 236 Miss. 95, 108 So. 2d 419, 1959 Miss. LEXIS 299 (Miss. 1959).
      </p>
      <p>
       On appeal to Supreme Court, it is primary duty of court to determine ex mero motu its jurisdiction of cause. Roach v. Black Creek Drainage Dist., 206 Miss. 794, 41 So. 2d 5, 1949 Miss. LEXIS 301 (Miss. 1949).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   What properly belongs to a court of appeals depends on consideration of public policy, and is mainly to be determined by the legislature. The legislature has the power to make a decision of a lower court final. Dismukes v. Stokes, 41 Miss. 430, 1867 Miss. LEXIS 15 (Miss. 1867), but see De La Beckwith v. State, 615 So. 2d 1134, 1992 Miss. LEXIS 807 (Miss. 1992), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">510 U.S. 884</cite>, <cite class="s_court">114 S. Ct. 232</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">126 L.

       Supreme Court would not act as trial court and would not invoke its discretionary jurisdiction to hear Governor’s petition, brought in his capacity as Governor and Administrator of Medicaid Division, for mandamus or prohibition to prevent Attorney General from proceeding with suit against tobacco companies for reimbursement of medicaid expenditures on ground that he lacked authority to do so. In re Fordice, 691 So. 2d 429, 1997 Miss. LEXIS 104 (Miss. 1997).

      </p>

       Supreme Court has no jurisdiction on appeal where no judgment of justice of peace is filed in circuit court. Rayborn v. Cothern, 43 So. 70 (Miss. 1907), overruled,
   Jones v. State, 155 Miss. 364, 123 So. 882, 1929 Miss. LEXIS 261 (Miss. 1929); Jones v. State, 47 So. 479 (Miss. 1908); Murphy v. Hutchinson, 47 So. 666 (Miss. 1908), overruled,

      </p>
      <p>
       The Supreme Court has no jurisdiction of a suit begun in the court of a justice of the peace where the record does not show the proceedings in that court nor a bond for appeal to the circuit court, and the case will be dismissed by the Supreme Court of its own motion. Ruff v. Montgomery, 83 Miss. 184, 35 So. 465, 1903 Miss. LEXIS 30 (Miss. 1903), overruled,
   Jones v. State, 155 Miss. 364, 123 So. 882, 1929 Miss. LEXIS 261 (Miss. 1929).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Supreme Court has no jurisdiction of a case begun in the court of a justice of the peace, unless the circuit court had jurisdiction. Ball, Brown & Co. v. Sledge, 82 Miss. 747, 35 So. 214, 1903 Miss. LEXIS 199 (Miss. 1903), overruled,
   Jones v. State, 155 Miss. 364, 123 So. 882, 1929 Miss. LEXIS 261 (Miss. 1929).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Supreme Court has jurisdiction of an appeal by a claimant from the circuit court in cases originating in a justice’s court where the property claimed exceeds fifty dollars in value and has been by the circuit court subjected to execution for more than that sum, although the amount in controversy in the original suit was less than fifty dollars. Andrews v. Partee, 79 Miss. 80, 29 So. 788, 1901 Miss. LEXIS 9 (Miss. 1901).

      </p>
      <p>
       Motion filed, as a suggestion of error, for advisory opinion which may be of advantage to the administration of justice by clarification of certain matters must be overruled when no action by Supreme Court is sought by way of changing the judgment rendered or otherwise than an advisory opinion. Gipson v. State, 203 Miss. 434, 35 So. 2d 327, 1948 Miss. LEXIS 289 (Miss. 1948).
      </p>
      <p>
       The importance of questions submitted does not give to Supreme Court power to render advisory opinions which it does not have under the Constitution and law. Gipson v. State, 203 Miss. 434, 35 So. 2d 327, 1948 Miss. LEXIS 289 (Miss. 1948).

       Supreme Court has no jurisdiction to make conclusive adjudication of title to property on appeal of proceeding under Code 1942, § 948, begun in justice of peace court, where neither justice of peace court nor circuit court on appeal had jurisdiction to make final and conclusive adjudication of title to property as between parties to litigation. McCoy v. McRae, 204 Miss. 309, 37 So. 2d 353, 1948 Miss. LEXIS 368 (Miss. 1948).
      </p>
      <p>
       Supreme Court, circuit courts, chancery courts and county courts, when acting on appeal from a special possessory court of a justice or justices of peace, have only such jurisdiction to adjudicate regarding title to land as is vested in special court from which appeal was taken.

       Although the Rules of Discipline for the Mississippi Bar provide for reinstatement through petition, an order of automatic reinstatement is within the scope of the Supreme Court’s exclusive and inherent jurisdiction of attorney discipline matters. Broome v. Mississippi Bar, 603 So. 2d 349, 1992 Miss. LEXIS 385 (Miss. 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless some property rights are involved, civil courts have no jurisdiction over ecclesiastical controversy and are without jurisdiction to decide who is, or who ought to be, presiding bishop of the diocese. Conic v. Cobbins, 208 Miss. 203, 44 So. 2d 52, 1950 Miss. LEXIS 240 (Miss. 1950).
      </p>
      <p>
       Provision in church manual permitting bishops to retain 10% of all monies raised by them in their respective dioceses does not give an ousted bishop such property rights in monies raised by his successor in the diocese as to entitle him to invoke jurisdiction of civil courts as to the 10% claimed by him.

       Where disputes of fact must be settled before the law may be applied to them, an interlocutory appeal should rarely be granted. Where the question presented is one of law application, certification for appeal is not per se precluded since in some sense every question of law will likely involve some application of law to fact. Nevertheless, an interlocutory appeal ought ordinarily to be granted only where at its core the question concerns a dispute regarding the content of the applicable law, a dispute with respect to which there is a substantial basis for a difference of opinion, or where the difficulty of application makes the case the substantial equivalent of one wherein the legal principles are not well settled.

      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that a case is certified for interlocutory appeal by a lower court pursuant to Rule 5(a), Miss. Sup. Ct. R,. does not preclude a de novo review by the Supreme Court as to whether the rule’s criteria have been met and whether the application for interlocutory appeal should be granted. The Supreme Court retains absolute authority to decide whether an interlocutory appeal should be granted, notwithstanding the rule’s provision that the lower courts may assist in the exercise of that authority. American Electric, Div. of FL Industries v. Singarayar, 530 So. 2d 1319, 1988 Miss. LEXIS 418 (Miss. 1988).

       An order of a Circuit Court holding in abeyance a motion to dissolve a preliminary injunction was not appropriate for interlocutory appeal since the motion was not denied or granted, and thus there was no final order.

       In exceptional circumstances appeals from circuit court interlocutory orders are warranted; thus, such appeals may be granted where the appeal may settle an important principle of law in the case and may advance the ultimate determination of the action, and where justice may be served without delay and expense to the litigant and the court. Sonford Products Corp. v. Freels, 495 So. 2d 468, 1986 Miss. LEXIS 2658 (Miss. 1986), overruled,

       Where an interlocutory appeal was taken by defendants in a suit for contract construction and specific performance, and the chancellor failed to make special findings of fact and law as requested by the complainants, and undisposed issues of law and fact existed at the time the appeal was taken, it was improvidently granted and was dismissed by the Supreme Court on the ground that the court lacked jurisdiction to act as a trial court in the decisions of propositions which should have been settled by the court below.

   The Supreme Court was authorized to treat a circuit court’s denial of a criminal defendant’s motion to dismiss the indictment against him on double jeopardy grounds as a “final judgment” in a civil action under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.11.html#t11c51s11-51-3" target="_blank">11-51-3</a></cite>, which authorizes an appeal from a final judgment, and §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t09c03s9-3-9" target="_self">9-3-9</a></cite>, which gives the Supreme Court jurisdiction of an appeal from any final judgment in the circuit court, since the double jeopardy claim went beyond the defendant’s right not to be convicted in that it involved his constitutional right not to be prosecuted for the offense, and therefore denial of the claim was final and justified immediate determination.

      </p>
      <p>
       In reviewing a school district’s decision not to renew an employee’s contract, the Supreme Court’s inquiry concerns whether the nonrenewal decision was (1) made for a reason not specifically prohibited by law, (2) made in accordance with the applicable procedural requirements, (3) supported by substantial evidence, and (4) arbitrary or capricious.

      </p>
      <p>
       When a defendant raises the issue of severance, a trial court should hold a hearing on the issue. The State has the burden of making a prima facie case showing that the offenses charged fall within the language of the statute allowing multi-count indictments. If the State meets its burden, the defendant may rebut by showing that the offenses were separate and distinct acts or transactions. In making its determination regarding severance, the trial court should pay particular attention to whether the time period between the occurrences is insignificant, whether the evidence proving each count would be admissible to prove each of the other counts, and whether the crimes are interwoven. If a trial court follows this procedure, the Supreme Court will review the trial court’s decision under the abuse of discretion standard giving due deference to the trial court’s findings. On review, the Supreme Court will defer to the trial court’s findings even if the jury later acquits the defendant on one or more counts or if the Supreme Court concludes on appeal that a directed verdict, j.n.o.v. or new trial should have been granted on one or more counts. Corley v. State, 584 So. 2d 769, 1991 Miss. LEXIS 480 (Miss. 1991).

       The Supreme Court has the independent authority to reassess the punishment meted out by the Complaint Tribunal and to increase or decrease the punishment as it deems proper; there is no standard as to what punishment for particular misconduct ought to be, and cases are considered on a case by case basis. Mississippi State Bar v. Attorney D., 579 So. 2d 559, 1991 Miss. LEXIS 252 (Miss. 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Supreme Court conducts a de novo review in a bar disciplinary matter which necessarily includes a review of the sanctions imposed. Deference is accorded the findings of the complaint tribunal but the Supreme Court “has the non-delegable duty of ultimately satisfying itself as to the facts, and reaching such conclusions and making such judgments as it considers appropriate and just.” Mississippi State Bar v. Smith, 577 So. 2d 1249, 1991 Miss. LEXIS 185 (Miss. 1991).

       In the youth court, as elsewhere, requests for continuance are addressed to the sound discretion of the court, except that in youth court more so than almost any other there is an imperative that the Court proceed with the matter as promptly as may fairly be done. The Supreme Court will not reverse the youth court in exercising its discretion in these cases unless the youth court abused its discretion and the Supreme Court is convinced that injustice would result therefrom. In Interest of T.L.C., 566 So. 2d 691, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 431 (Miss. 1990), overruled in part, D.T. v. Hinds Cnty. Youth Court (In re J.T.), 188 So.3d 1192, 2016 Miss. LEXIS 165 (Miss. 2016).

      <p>
       The Supreme Court acts as the fact-finder in judicial misconduct proceedings, giving great deference to the findings, based on clear and convincing evidence, and the recommendations of the Mississippi Judicial Performance Commission. However, the Supreme Court is not bound by the recommendations of the Commission and may impose additional sanctions. Mississippi Judicial Performance Com. v. Walker, 565 So. 2d 1117, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 291 (Miss. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       The review of the decisions of the Workers’ Compensation Commission is like the review of any other administrative body which sits as a trier of fact. If the decision of the Commission is based upon substantial evidence and there is no error of law, the decision will be affirmed on appeal. Thus, if there is a quantum of credible evidence which supports the decision of the Commission, no court will reverse the decision. The Supreme Court will not determine where the preponderance of the evidence lies when the evidence is conflicting, the assumption being that the Commission, as the trier of facts, has previously determined which evidence is credible and which is not. This is not to say that the reviewing court will merely “rubber stamp” the Commission’s actions; where no evidence or only a scintilla of evidence supports a Workers’ Compensation Commission decision, the Supreme Court would not hesitate to reverse. Metal Trims Industries, Inc. v. Stovall, 562 So. 2d 1293, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 277 (Miss. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       There are practical and institutional limitations upon the Supreme Court’s ability to find facts; consequently, much deference is placed upon the trial judge’s full discharge of his or her responsibility to make findings of fact as to the question of whether Miranda rights have been intelligently, knowing and voluntarily waived. However, when the trial judge fails to make specific findings and only makes general findings thereby allowing admissibility of evidence, the Supreme Court’s scope of review is considerably broader particularly when the trial judge’s findings on the precise points at issue on appeal are not clearly inferable from the findings made. McCarty v. State, 554 So. 2d 909, 1989 Miss. LEXIS 499 (Miss. 1989).

   A prosecutor’s biblical references during closing argument at the sentencing phase of a capital murder prosecution did not deprive the defendant of a fair trial, as the comments were within the “broad latitude” afforded counsel in closing argument.

       A trial court abused its discretion when it sustained the State’s objection to the defense counsel’s use during closing argument of a homemade chart as a visual aid to demonstrate to the jury the various standards of proof and belief which fell short of the “beyond a reasonable doubt” standard; while distinctions between reasonable doubt, all possible doubt, beyond a shadow of a doubt, and the like, are not properly the subject of jury instructions, they are permissible during a trial counsel’s closing argument. However, the trial court’s error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt since there was nothing depicted on the chart that could not have been generously explored and explained via the spoken word. Heidelberg v. State, 584 So. 2d 393, 1991 Miss. LEXIS 437 (Miss. 1991).

   Any error in prosecutor’s comment on defendant’s demeanor, which might have been taken as a comment on failure to testify, was cured by instructions to jurors to disregard remarks of counsel which have no basis in the evidence and to not draw any unfavorable inference against defendant because of his failure to testify.

   A prosecutor’s remarks during the penalty phase of a capital murder prosecution did not constitute an improper comment on the defendant’s failure to testify where the prosecutor stated that the defendant “showed no compassion, but would send a lawyer up here and ask you for compassion,” since the argument pointed out the lack of a mitigation defense presented by the defendant, and that he was reduced to sending his lawyer in to plead for his life after all else had failed.

   The prosecutor’s closing argument in the guilt phase of a capital murder prosecution did not constitute an improper comment on the defendant’s right to remain silent following arrest where the prosecutor, while discussing a county jail inmate’s testimony as to statements made by the defendant while he was in the jail, referred to the relationship between the defendant and the witness, and described the circumstances under which the statements were made. Carr v. State, 655 So. 2d 824, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 56 (Miss. 1995), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">516 U.S. 1077</cite>, <cite class="s_court">116 S. Ct. 783</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">133 L.

   A prosecutor’s closing argument in a capital murder case did not constitute a comment on the defendant’s failure to testify at trial, in spite of the defendant’s argument that the prosecutor’s comments highlighted the fact that the only people alive who could have testified as to the events surrounding the murders were the defendant and his accomplice, where the prosecutor merely stated that the defendant and his accomplice saw to it that there were no eyewitnesses, and that “people who kill their victims and kill their eyewitnesses cannot be set free.” Carr v.

       In the sentencing phase of a capital murder prosecution, the State’s closing argument did not constitute a comment on the defendant’s failure to take the witness stand in his own defense where the State made the following argument: “Do you think she was suffering? Do you think that’s cruel and atrocious, and what’s even more than that, what do you think was running through [defendant’s] head as he sat through watching her gag on her own blood? What do you think he was thinking?” Thorson v. State, 653 So. 2d 876, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 600 (Miss. 1994).

      <p>
       A prosecutor did not improperly comment during closing argument on the defendant’s right to remain silent where the prosecutor remarked that the victim could not talk because she was dead and stated that only the defendant and God knew what happened, but he did not observe the defendant’s silence during trial; the prosecutor’s comments would be a reference to the defendant’s failure to testify only if innuendo and insinuation were employed. Alexander v. State, 610 So. 2d 320, 1992 Miss. LEXIS 580 (Miss. 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       A prosecutor improperly commented during closing argument on a capital murder defendant’s failure to testify where the prosecutor stated that the defendant “hasn’t told you the whole truth yet,” that “you still don’t know the whole story,” and that the defendant was the only person alive who could give the whole story. Butler v. State, 608 So. 2d 314, 1992 Miss. LEXIS 588 (Miss. 1992).

       A prosecutor did not improperly comment on the defendant’s failure to testify when he stated during closing argument: “That’s what you have got before you, and that’s all you have got before you. All the evidence in this case points to one thing and one thing only”; the prosecutor’s comment related to the evidence presented in the trial by both the State and defense as a whole, rather than the failure of the defendant to take the stand. Rogers v. State, 599 So. 2d 930, 1992 Miss. LEXIS 123 (Miss.), overruled in part, Mayfield v. State, 612 So. 2d 1120, 1992 Miss. LEXIS 861 (Miss. 1992).

      <p>
       <p>
   In a capital murder prosecution, the prosecutor’s statement that there had not been any testimony that the defendant acted in self-defense did not constitute an impermissible comment upon the failure of the defendant to testify, where the prosecutor’s statement was made in connection with his argument that the State had proved the required element that the defendant’s actions were not done in necessary self-defense. Ladner v. State, 584 So. 2d 743, 1991 Miss. LEXIS 434 (Miss.), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">502 U.S. 1015</cite>, <cite class="s_court">112 S. Ct. 663</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">116 L.

      </p>
      <p>
       A prosecutor’s statement in closing argument that “they” hadn’t bothered to tell the jury what the defendant was doing at a certain location was not an impermissible comment on the defendant’s failure to testify since it was proper for the prosecutor to question the defense’s inability to successfully explain the defendant’s presence in the area where the crime took place, and the prosecutor’s use of the word “they” appeared to be a reference to the defendant’s 2 attorneys rather than the defendant himself.

       An assignment of error based on the prosecutor’s comment on the defendant’s failure to testify was not procedurally barred for failure to make a contemporaneous objection because the right not to take the witness stand is a fundamental constitutional right.

       A prosecutor’s comments on the defendant’s failure to testify reached a constitutional dimension so egregious that failure on the part of the defense counsel to make a proper objection either at trial or in his motion for a new trial did not waive the error where the prosecutor made 4 separate statements telling the jury that the State’s witness’ testimony was “unopposed,” “unimpeached,” “unrebutted,” and that there was “no evidence whatsoever toward their unreliability.” Whigham v.

       It was improper for a prosecutor to comment on a burglary defendant’s failure to call a witness who was allegedly with the defendant at the time the crime was committed, where there was no suggestion that the witness was not equally available to the State, the witness was not identified as a person under the control of the defendant, and he was not a close relative who would ordinarily be expected to be put in an unacceptable compromising position should he be called to testify as to the validity of the defendant’s alibi.

      <p>
       A prosecutor’s comment in closing argument regarding the defense’s failure to call the defendant’s “good friend” to testify was reversible error since the failure of either party to examine a witness equally accessible to both parties is not a proper subject for comment before a jury.

       Supreme Court does not review jury instructions in isolation. Hoops v. State, 681 So. 2d 521, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 433 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       On review of jury instructions, state Supreme Court does not review instructions in isolation, but rather, reads instructions as whole to determine if jury was properly instructed; accordingly, defects in specific instructions do not require reversal where all instructions taken as whole fairly, although not perfectly, announce applicable primary rules of law, however, if those instructions do not fairly or adequately instruct jury, state Supreme Court can and will reverse. Boone v. Wal-Mart Stores, 680 So. 2d 844, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 500 (Miss. 1996).

       In reviewing trial judge’s denial of request for peremptory instructions that direct a verdict, Supreme Court will consider evidence in light most favorable to appellee, giving that party the benefit of all favorable inferences that may be reasonably drawn from evidence, and if facts so considered point so overwhelmingly in favor of appellant that reasonable men could not have arrived at contrary verdict, Supreme Court is required to reverse and render; if there is substantial evidence in support of the verdict, however, affirmance is required. McBride v. Chevron U.S.A., 673 So. 2d 372, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 132 (Miss. 1996), modified, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 271 (Miss. May 23, 1996).

      </p>
      <p>
       Fact that instruction is technically inaccurate will not alone cause a reversal of judgment; but when case on appeal is examined as a completed trial, and substantial error has not been committed and a fair and just result has been reached, judgment will be affirmed, notwithstanding error in instruction. Neely v. Charleston, 204 Miss. 360, 37 So. 2d 495, 1948 Miss. LEXIS 374 (Miss. 1948).

       The factual findings of a chancery court in a civil contempt case are affirmed unless manifest error is present and apparent.

       Trial courts should advise criminal defendants of their rights concerning appeal on the record at the time of sentencing and should solicit a decision in that regard. Should a decision be made on the record to appeal, the defendant should be advised that the decision will stand unless a written statement to the contrary, signed by the defendant and the attorney, is filed with the court. Should the decision be made to waive appeal, the defendant should nevertheless be informed of the timeliness for appeal and told that the decision to waive shall stand unless the defendant gives written notice to the court and the attorney prior to the expiration of the time. Should no decision be made, the court should inform the defendant that the failure to express the desire to appeal shall be considered a waiver of the right to appeal and that such waiver will stand unless the defendant gives written notice to the court and counsel prior to the expiration of the time in which to perfect the appeal.

Before destroying such records the clerk of the supreme court shall advise the director of the department of archives and history of the contemplated destruction of the records, and, if the director of the department of archives and history shall so desire, the records, or such of them as he may desire, shall not be destroyed, but shall be immediately delivered to him for preservation in his office.
     </p>
     <p>
      The transcripts of all existing records, briefs of counsel, and all other related documents, which the said clerk is not authorized to destroy, shall be collected by said clerk, under the direction of the Supreme Court, shall be cleaned, organized, and placed in shelves or files with adequate identifications of such records, and shall be maintained by the clerk in a place or places accessible to lawyers, judges and the general public, and in a manner best suited to their preservation. The capitol commission shall provide additional adequate and proper space for the storage of all such records, which in the opinion of the supreme court cannot be stored conveniently and efficiently in the clerk’s record storage room of the new capitol adjoining the courtroom.

       A divorced wife appealing from a judgment of contempt of court for her failure to return a house to her divorced husband in good condition in violation with the provisions of the divorce decree, could enter a plea for mitigation of punishment by reason of insanity, for the first time on appeal. Adair v. Holden, 222 So. 2d 834, 1969 Miss. LEXIS 1562 (Miss. 1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the Supreme Court may direct a trial judge to act as facility or agent for the Supreme Court for the purpose of developing evidence as to whether a defendant or his attorneys deliberately waived defendant’s right to object to testimony with reference to the search of his automobile, the burden is upon the Supreme Court to determine whether it is satisfied that such a waiver had or had not occurred. Mixon v. Black, 198 So. 2d 213, 1967 Miss. LEXIS 1247 (Miss. 1967).
      </p>
      <p>
       When matters are to be presented to the Supreme Court in the form of evidence, as permitted by this section, it is better practice for appellee for file a plea in bar. Insured Sav. & Loan Asso. v. State, 242 Miss. 547, 135 So. 2d 703, 1961 Miss. LEXIS 592 (Miss. 1961).

       Supreme Court will receive affidavits; and determine whether title to judgment on which appealing execution creditor relies has been transferred to third person. McInnis v. Simmons, 162 Miss. 606, 139 So. 872, 1932 Miss. LEXIS 162 (Miss. 1932).
      </p>
      <p>
       Motion to dismiss plaintiff’s appeal because he accepted payment of the judgment pending appeal must be dismissed, the proper way of raising the question being by plea in bar, supported by proper evidence. Adams v. Carter, 92 Miss. 578, 46 So. 59, 1908 Miss. LEXIS 201 (Miss. 1908).
      </p>
      <p>
       A plea in bar of an appeal based on the statute of limitations may be filed in and passed upon by the Supreme Court. Farmer v. Allen, 85 Miss. 672, 38 So. 38, 1904 Miss. LEXIS 181 (Miss. 1904).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the court of original jurisdiction rendered a judgment on the merits of a case on specific grounds, declining to pass on other grounds duly presented, the Supreme Court may, nevertheless, affirm on the grounds not passed on.

       The Supreme Court has no jurisdiction to try a claimant’s issue for property seized under execution from it, since the court has no power to try any issue of fact not necessary to be decided for the disposition of a pending appeal. The remedy is replevin. State v. Booker, 61 Miss. 16, 1883 Miss. LEXIS 62 (Miss. 1883).

       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       There are practical and institutional limitations upon the Supreme Court’s ability to find facts; consequently, much deference is placed upon the trial judge’s full discharge of his or her responsibility to make findings of fact as to the question of whether Miranda rights have been intelligently, knowing and voluntarily waived. However, when the trial judge fails to make specific findings and only makes general findings thereby allowing admissibility of evidence, the Supreme Court’s scope of review is considerably broader particularly when the trial judge’s findings on the precise points at issue on appeal are not clearly inferable from the findings made. McCarty v. State, 554 So. 2d 909, 1989 Miss. LEXIS 499 (Miss. 1989).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section [Code 1942 § 1960] does not apply to a case where no appeal has been perfected, for under its terms the issues of fact which the Supreme Court may try are limited to those arising out of the appeal. Windom v. State, 192 So. 2d 689, 1966 Miss. LEXIS 1263 (Miss. 1966).
      </p>
      <p>
       On appeal of a libel action where the lower court’s findings as to malice were not clear, the Supreme Court had authority under this section [Code 1942 § 1960] and its rules to require the trial judge who heard the case on the merits and sitting without a jury to supplement his findings of fact with specific findings on the issue of malice, and as to whether the proof of malice was made to the extent and in the manner required by decisions of the federal courts. Reaves v. Foster, 191 So. 2d 423, 1966 Miss. LEXIS 1217 (Miss. 1966).
      </p>
      <p>
       The jurisdiction of the Supreme Court under this section [Code 1942 § 1960] is limited to the trial of issues of fact which may arise out of any appeal before it and necessary to the disposition thereof, and consequently does not permit issuance by the clerk of the trial court of a writ of garnishment to collect costs incurred on appeal to the Supreme Court. State v. Keeton, 176 Miss. 590, 169 So. 760, 1936 Miss. LEXIS 143 (Miss. 1936).

       The purpose of rule 6 of the rules of the Supreme Court is to dispense with the necessity for a motion for new trial when the error assigned is based upon any ruling made in the trial, but in the absence of error in any of the rulings of the trial court, the rule in question does not dispense with the necessity for a motion for a new trial when the assignment of error is based solely upon objection to the amount of the verdict.

       A suggestion of error under rule 14 is to all intents and purposes a request for rehearing, and may be filed without an order of the court if done within the original fifteen days allowed, or within the extended time granted by order of the court therefor; and in such event it suspends the judgment and also the effect and operation of any mandate issued thereon until the suggestion of error shall have been disposed of.

       Failure of the Supreme Court to recall a mandate issued to and received by the court below after reversal of a manslaughter prosecution by a division of the Supreme Court, pending a hearing on a suggestion of error, prior to judgment of affirmance of the conviction or before the expiration of the term, did not deprive the Supreme Court of power to recall the same, where the court entered an order on its minutes continuing all matters undisposed of to the next succeeding term; and the issuance by the clerk of a mandate under the judgment of affirmance in lieu of the former mandate would be effective ipso facto to revoke and recall the original mandate.

       It is within the authority of the Court of Appeals, upon proper referral from the Supreme Court, to grant a motion for a discretionary interlocutory appeal. McGriggs v. Montgomery, 710 So. 2d 886, 1998 Miss. App. LEXIS 192 (Miss. Ct. App. 1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no rule, statute, or constitutional provision which would limit the state’s right to seek certiorari review of a Court of Appeals decision which reverses a criminal conviction and remands for a new trial. Cohen v. State, 732 So. 2d 867, 1998 Miss. LEXIS 623 (Miss. 1998).

      <p>
       <p>
   While jurisdiction of Court of Appeals is limited solely to those cases assigned to it by Supreme Court, once such an assignment is made, that court considers and disposes of each case not by way of preliminary review but as fully empowered appellate court; except as to those cases which by statute must be retained by Supreme Court, no litigant has right to further review by certiorari. Harris v. State, 704 So. 2d 1286, 1997 Miss. LEXIS 47 (Miss.), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">522 U.S. 827</cite>, <cite class="s_court">118 S. Ct. 90</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">139 L.

      <p>
       The United States Attorney General, by letter dated September 6, 1994, interposed no objection, under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, to the amendment of this section by Laws, 1994, ch. 564, § 1.
      </p>
      <p>
       Laws 2002, ch. 713 (Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 543), provides in pertinent part:
      </p>
      <p>
       “BE IT RESOLVED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI, That the following amendment to the Mississippi Constitution of 1890 is proposed to the qualified electors of the state:
      </p>
      <p>
       “Amend Section 153, Mississippi Constitution of 1890, to read as follows:
      </p>
      <p>
       “‘Section 153. The judges of the circuit and chancery courts shall be elected by the people in a manner and at a time to be provided by the Legislature. The judges elected for a term of office beginning from and after January 1, 2003, shall hold their office for a term of six (6) years.’
      </p>
      <p>
       “BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That this proposed amendment shall be submitted by the Secretary of State to the qualified electors at an election to be held on the first Tuesday after the first Monday of November 2002, as provided by Section 273 of the Constitution and by general law.
      </p>
      <p>
       “BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That the explanation of this proposed amendment for the ballot shall read as follows: ‘This proposed constitutional amendment increases the terms of office of circuit and chancery court judges from four to six years beginning January 1, 2003.’
      </p>
      <p>
       “BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That the Attorney General of the State of Mississippi shall submit this resolution, immediately upon adoption by the Legislature, to the Attorney General of the United States or to the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, in accordance with the provisions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, as amended and extended.”
      </p>
      <p>
       This section was set out to correct an error in the 2014 Replacement Volume. The version of the section that was to become effective upon effectuation under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, as amended and extended, provided a proposed amendment to Section 153 of the Mississippi Constitution (by Chapter 713, Laws of 2002) was ratified by the electorate, was erroneously set out in the bound volume. The United States Attorney General interposed no objection to the amendment of this section by Chapter 356, Laws of 2002, but the constitutional amendment was defeated by the electorate, and the amendment by Chapter 356, Laws of 2002, never became law. The section as set out above is the section as it appeared prior to the 2002 amendment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Laws of 2015, ch. 476, § 63, provides in part:
      </p>
      <p>
       “SECTION 63. (1) The Standing Joint Legislative Committee on Reapportionment is directed to provide the counties census block equivalency files and maps necessary to assist the counties in identifying the boundaries of any subdistricts within a chancery or circuit court district.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(2)(a) The Split Precinct Block List developed in conjunction with House Bill No. 703, 2015 Regular Session [Chapter 476, Laws of 2015], that details the portions of the partial or split precincts that are contained within a judicial subdistrict by census block number as that list is utilized to detail partial or split precincts for judicial subdistricts in this act is hereby incorporated into and shall be construed to be an integral part of this act. A partial or split precinct contained in this act is identified by an asterisk (*) following its designation within any judicial subdistrict. The Standing Joint Legislative Committee on Reapportionment shall file the Split Precinct Block List with the Secretary of State.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(3)(a) This act shall be liberally construed to effectuate the purposes hereof and to redistrict the trial courts of this state in compliance with constitutional requirements.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(b) It is intended that this act and the districts and subdistricts described herein completely encompass all the area within the state and all the voters in this state. It is also intended that no district shall include any of the area included within the description of any other district, and that no subdistrict shall include any of the area included within the description of any other subdistrict.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(c)(i) If the districts or subdistricts described in this act do not carry out the purposes hereof because of: omissions; duplication; overlapping areas; erroneous nomenclature; lack of adequate maps or descriptions of political subdivisions, wards or other divisions thereof, or of their boundary lines; then the Secretary of State, at the joint request of the Lieutenant Governor and the Speaker of the House, by order, shall correct any omissions, overlaps, erroneous nomenclature or other defects in the description of the districts and subdistricts so as to accomplish the purposes and objectives of this act.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(ii) In promulgating any order under this subsection (3), the Secretary of State, in addition to insuring that all areas of the state are completely and accurately encompassed in the districts and subdistricts, shall be guided by the following standards:
      </p>
      <p>
       “1. Gaps in the description of any district or subdistrict shall be completed in a manner that results in a total description of the district or subdistrict that is consonant with the description of adjacent districts or subdistricts and results in complete contiguity of districts and subdistricts;
      </p>
      <p>
       “2. In any allocation of area or correction of descriptions made pursuant to this subsection, the Secretary of State shall, consistent with the foregoing standards, preserve the contiguity and compactness of districts and subdistricts and avoid the unnecessary division of political subdivisions.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(d) A copy of any order issued under this subsection shall be filed by the Secretary of State in his own office and in the offices of the affected commissioners of election and registrars. The Secretary of State may adopt reasonable rules regulating the procedure for applications for orders under this act and the manner of serving and filing any notice or copy of orders. Upon the filing of an order, the description of any affected district or subdistrict shall be deemed to have been corrected to the full extent as if the correction had been contained in the original description set forth in this act.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(e) The redistricting contained in this act supersedes any prior redistricting.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Laws of 2015, ch. 476, § 63, was enacted with a subdivision (2)(a) but no (2)(b).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chapter 476, Laws of 2015 amended a number of sections in Chapters 5 and 7 of Title 9. For a complete list of Code sections affected by Chapter 476, Laws of 2015, see Table B, Allocation of Acts, in the Statutory Tables Volume.

Court shall be held in chancery court districts consisting of a single county on the same dates state agencies and political subdivisions are open for business excluding legal holidays. The dates upon which terms shall commence and the number of days for which terms shall continue in chancery court districts consisting of more than one (1) county shall be set by order of the chancellor in accordance with the provisions of subsection (2) of this section.

Notice of the dates upon which terms of court shall commence and the number of days for which the terms shall continue in each of the counties within a chancery court district shall be posted in the office of the chancery clerk of each county within the district and mailed to the office of the Secretary of State for publication and distribution to all Mississippi Bar members.

       Separate maintenance was related to the transaction forming the basis of a former husband’s complaint for divorce as he conceded that he sought a divorce in Florida in order to avoid or cease his separate maintenance obligation in Mississippi; in his Florida complaint, the husband asserted that no alimony was sought. To the contrary, the Mississippi separate maintenance orders showed a basis for a possible award of alimony, and the former wife’s motion to enforce the Mississippi orders did not waive personal jurisdiction for alimony purposes. Because the Florida court did not obtain personal jurisdiction over the former wife, and its judgment was not res judicata over her claim for alimony, the issue of alimony was properly before a chancery court in Mississippi.

       The version of this section that is currently in effect is not certain.
   The amendments in the second tier of this section are to take effect from and after the date the bill containing the amendments is effectuated under Section 5 of the Voting Right Act of 1965, as amended and extended.
   The bill was submitted to the United States Attorney General under Section 5, but the Attorney General has not yet responded to the submission.
   The United States Supreme Court, in the case of
       <i>
        Shelby County v. Holder
       </i>
       (June 25, 2013), struck down the coverage formula that determined what jurisdictions are subject to Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, so the coverage formula can no longer be used as a basis for subjecting jurisdictions to preclearance under Section 5.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because of the
       <i>
        Shelby County
       </i>
       decision, the United States Attorney General is not making any determinations under Section 5 on voting or election changes made by states.
   The Supreme Court did not strike down Section 5, so it is still in effect.
   It has not yet been determined if bills that were submitted to the United States Attorney General under Section 5 and were pending at the time of the
       <i>
        Shelby County
       </i>
       decision are now in effect as a result of that decision. After such a determination has been made, that information will be included in the Advance Code Service.

       While subject matter jurisdiction lay within either the circuit or the chancery court, the circuit court had subject matter jurisdiction of heavy equipment vendor’s action against a county board of supervisors where the amended complaint, although it sought some relief equitable in nature, in substantial part partook of an action at law, in that it charged the board of supervisors with breach of duties not unlike those generally contractual, and the complaint sought the assessment of civil penalties. Canton Farm Equipment, Inc. v. Richardson, 501 So. 2d 1098, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2273 (Miss. 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where under a divorce decree, entered pursuant to an agreement of the parties thereto relative to the support and maintenance of the parties’ two children, the father assumed obligation to transfer to the children two insurance policies, but failed to do so before his death, equity would treat the children as clothed with the same interests as if the duty had been actually performed. Mahaffey v. First Nat'l Bank, 231 Miss. 798, 97 So. 2d 756, 1957 Miss. LEXIS 567 (Miss. 1957).

      <p>
       Court of equity is court of conscience, and exercising broad discretion should see that wrong and oppression are not inflicted under guise of legal procedure, but that justice is done as the right of each case demands. Herring v. Sutton, 86 Miss. 283, 38 So. 235, 1905 Miss. LEXIS 19 (Miss. 1905).

       A personal injury action arising out of an automobile accident was outside the subject matter jurisdiction of the chancery court although it was alleged that full, adequate and expeditious relief could not be granted by a circuit court and the expenses for discovery required in circuit court would be exorbitant, time consuming and inadequate. Blackledge v. Scott, 530 So. 2d 1363, 1988 Miss. LEXIS 434 (Miss. 1988).
      </p>

       Mortgagee will not be enjoined from foreclosing until accounting can be had between parties concerning a difference in attorney’s fees where there was a plain, adequate, and complete remedy at law. Hub Bldg. & Loan Ass'n v. Warren, 207 Miss. 297, 42 So. 2d 203, 1949 Miss. LEXIS 340 (Miss. 1949).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancery court having taken jurisdiction on any ground of equity will administer full relief, although ground of equity fails under proof and remaining issues present legal subjects only and decree will cover only legal rights and grant legal remedies. McClendon v. Mississippi State Highway Com., 205 Miss. 71, 38 So. 2d 325, 1949 Miss. LEXIS 413 (Miss. 1949).

       The chancery court is a court of record and of general jurisdiction. Hollingsworth v. Central Oil Co., 236 Miss. 779, 112 So. 2d 518, 1959 Miss. LEXIS 376 (Miss. 1959).
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 147 of Constitution, prohibiting reversal of decree in chancery for want of jurisdiction by reason of error as to whether cause was one of equity or common-law jurisdiction, covers only cases in which trial judge assumes jurisdiction, but where judge declines jurisdiction when in fact case is one good in equity, his action is reviewable. McClendon v. Mississippi State Highway Com., 205 Miss. 71, 38 So. 2d 325, 1949 Miss. LEXIS 413 (Miss. 1949).
      </p>

       Chancery court taking jurisdiction will retain the cause and adjust all equities. Barber v. Barber, 106 Miss. 128, 63 So. 343, 1913 Miss. LEXIS 114 (Miss. 1913).
      </p>
      <p>
       The court having taken jurisdiction of a bill because of an equitable feature charged, does not lose it because such feature is not maintained by the evidence, and may adjudicate the legal rights of the parties. Atkinson v. Felder, 78 Miss. 83, 29 So. 767, 1900 Miss. LEXIS 175 (Miss. 1900).
      </p>
      <p>
       The inhibition of § 147 of the Constitution against the reversal of a decree because the case was one of common law jurisdiction, does not confer jurisdiction of such a case upon the chancery court. Carbolineum Wood-Preserving & Mfg. Co. v. Meyer, 76 Miss. 586, 25 So. 297, 1898 Miss. LEXIS 138 (Miss. 1898).
      </p>
      <p>
       The court will not take jurisdiction where the matters in controversy are actually pending in the circuit court, since to do so might lead to different results in the two courts. Ricks v. Richardson, 70 Miss. 424, 11 So. 935, 1892 Miss. LEXIS 81 (Miss. 1892).
      </p>
      <p>
       “Full jurisdiction” indicates that where a court takes hold of a subject it ought to dispose of it fully and finally. Bank of Mississippi v. Duncan, 52 Miss. 740, 1876 Miss.

       Chancery court has jurisdiction to hear and adjudicate controversy involving validity and effect of power of attorney, which has not been acknowledged and recorded in manner of conveyance of land, with respect to conveyance of real property situated in Republic of Greece where all parties reside in Mississippi and have been effectively subjected to in personam jurisdiction of chancery court; court may enter personal judgment, even though controlling substantive law is that of Greece; final adjudication would effectively bind parties in Mississippi and presumably in all other states even though adjudication may not be enforceable in Greece as matter of right and maybe not even as matter of comity. Kountouris v. Varvaris, 476 So. 2d 599, 1985 Miss. LEXIS 2245 (Miss. 1985).

       In an action relating to waste disposal, a transfer to a chancery court was improper because equitable claims were not added until after the transfer, and the action had been pending in the circuit court for five years before the transfer was requested. Georgia-Pacific Corp. v. Mooney, 909 So. 2d 1081, 2005 Miss. LEXIS 73 (Miss. 2005).

      <p>
       The court has jurisdiction, where one corporation transfers all its property to another, to enforce its liabilities against the property in the hands of the purchasing corporation, if the transfer is not in good faith, and its jurisdiction is not affected because incidentally the ascertainment of unliquidated damages is involved.

       Jurisdiction of court of equity to relieve against fraud and its legal equivalent with respect to judgments and decrees is as ample as that respecting contracts, dominant requirements being that facts constituting fraud, accident, mistake or surprise must have been controlling factors in effectuation of original decree, without which original decree would not have been made as it was made; facts justifying relief must be clearly and positively alleged as facts and must be clearly and convincingly proved; facts must not have been known to injured party at time of original decree, and his ignorance at time must not have been result of want of reasonable care and diligence.

   Defendants’ unconditional offer to sell, by warranty deed, their rights to certain land for $30,000 cash was an offer of a cash sale as distinguished from sale on credit, and plaintiff’s statement, contained in his acceptance, that he would deliver a cashier’s check upon execution of the deed was not a counteroffer, and the chancellor erred in refusing specific performance.

   As a general rule, to be subject to specific performance a contract must be specific and distinct in its terms, plain and definite in its meaning, and must show with certainty that the minds of the parties have met and mutually agreed as to all its details upon the offer made on one hand and accepted on the other, but if any of these requisites are lacking, specific performance will not be decreed by a court of equity.

       Separate maintenance was related to the transaction forming the basis of a former husband’s complaint for divorce as he conceded that he sought a divorce in Florida in order to avoid or cease his separate maintenance obligation in Mississippi; in his Florida complaint, the husband asserted that no alimony was sought. To the contrary, the Mississippi separate maintenance orders showed a basis for a possible award of alimony, and the former wife’s motion to enforce the Mississippi orders did not waive personal jurisdiction for alimony purposes. Because the Florida court did not obtain personal jurisdiction over the former wife, and its judgment was not res judicata over her claim for alimony, the issue of alimony was properly before a chancery court in Mississippi. Lofton v. Lofton, 924 So. 2d 596, 2006 Miss. App. LEXIS 168 (Miss. Ct. App. 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       Bill to set aside decree of divorce granted in another state on the ground of fraud and praying for decree that complainant and defendant are husband and wife under the law of Mississippi, is beyond the power of the chancery court to grant, since the decree, if granted, would be merely advisory, there being no affirmative or executory relief prayed for. Cliburn v. Cliburn, 209 Miss. 631, 48 So. 2d 126, 1950 Miss. LEXIS 424 (Miss. 1950).

       When husband has submitted himself to general jurisdiction of chancery court by filing bill of review praying for review of decree in favor of wife on ground that court was without jurisdiction to award custody of child, alimony, attorney’s fees and lien upon process by publication, wife’s motion for rehearing on whole case should be sustained to extent of granting her rehearing upon such portions of her original bill as court has under its jurisdiction in view of husband’s entry of appearance.

      <p>
       Decree in separate maintenance suit is conclusive as res judicata in subsequent divorce suit, so far as concerns any issue which was litigated between parties in separate maintenance suit, and if issue was decided in favor of wife in that suit, it bars husband in any subsequent divorce suit brought by him predicated on facts which were in existence at time of maintenance decree and which were put in issue and decided in favor of wife therein.

       While the general rule is that in order for a decree or judgment awarding the custody of children to be valid, the child or children must be within the territorial jurisdiction of the court, their removal from the jurisdiction prior to decree after the court has once acquired jurisdiction of such children does not deprive the court of jurisdiction to fix their custody.

      </h4>
      <p>
       Grant of a wife’s petition for separate maintenance was upheld because the chancery court did not manifestly err in finding that the wife, although admittedly partly to blame for the couple’s separation, did not substantially contribute to the separation; considering each party’s financial state and additional factors, the chancery court did not abuse its discretion in awarding $1,200 per month to the wife, even though this award was in excess of the husband’s income after expenses. Tackett v. Tackett, 967 So. 2d 1264, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 746 (Miss. Ct. App. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       The jurisdiction of the chancery court to make an allowance to a wife living apart from her husband for her separate maintenance is to be exercised according to equitable principles, and the amount to be allowed in any case must be determined according to the facts disclosed by the record in the particular case, and is largely within the discretion of the trial judge. Gardiner v. Gardiner, 230 Miss. 778, 90 So. 2d 668, 93 So. 2d 638, 1957 Miss. LEXIS 421, 1957 Miss. LEXIS 422 (Miss. 1957).

      <p>
       Separate maintenance of $250 per month for wife and her two children did not compel correction where husband was worth between $15,000 and $18,000 with a net annual income of from $5,000 to $6,000, especially since it remained subject to the court’s revision.

       Suits for separate maintenance, wherein there is no prayer by bill or cross-bill for divorce, are not based upon statute (Code 1942, § 2743) providing for allowances under divorce decrees, or any other statute, but are lodged in the equity jurisdiction of the chancery courts and are regulated by equitable principles independently of, and apart from, statutes of divorce.

       Chancery court has jurisdiction of suit to cancel settlement between two persons, both of whom claim all of a decedent’s estate, on ground that one party was incompetent mentally to agree to it and that it was improvident and fraudulent, and it is unimportant that plaintiff described himself as co-administrator rather than next friend of incompetent, since the court looks to substance and not to the form of pleading.

       This section [Code 1942 § 1263] is full, specific and definite, and authorizes the court at which letters of administration or of guardianship have been granted, to hear and determine all questions in relation to the execution of the trust of the executor, administrator, guardian or other officer appointed for the administration and management of all the estate, and all demands against it by heirs at law, distributees, devisees, legatees, wards, creditors or others.

       The chancellor, in the administration of estates and guardianships, may supervise and inquire into the management; he need not personally conduct the inquiry or consult witnesses and prepare the papers necessary to such supervision, but may appoint such assistants as may be required for the proper development and conduct of such cases, under his supervision; and the chancery court has full jurisdiction of proceedings against administrators, executors or guardians and sureties on their bonds to enforce claims or other liabilities against them, in his own court. Newsom v. Federal Land Bank, 184 Miss. 318, 185 So. 595, 1939 Miss. LEXIS 38 (Miss. 1939).

       Beneficiaries’ complaint focused on the administration of the trust, and they had labeled their claims as negligence, breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, and gross negligence; however, the bank’s actions or inactions that were at issue arose solely from its capacity as trustee and any duty it might have had arose from its appointment as trustee, such that because the action sought to interpret the trustee’s obligations under the terms of the trust, the trust was under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Warren County Chancery Court and had been since its inception.

    Power to punish for violation of injunction.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The chancery court, or the chancellor in vacation, or judge granting the writ, shall have power to punish any person for breach of injunction, or any other order, decree, or process of the court, by fine or imprisonment, or both, or the chancellor or judge granting the writ may require bail for the appearance of the party at the next term of the court to answer for the contempt; but such person shall be first cited to appear and answer. And any person so punished by order of the chancellor in vacation, may on five (5) days’ notice to the opposite party, apply to a judge of the Supreme Court, who, for good cause shown, may supersede the punishment until the meeting of the said chancery court.
     </p>
     <p>
      At the discretion of the court, any person found in contempt for failure to pay child support and imprisoned therefor may be referred for placement in a state, county or municipal restitution, house arrest or restorative justice center or program, provided such person meets the qualifications prescribed in Section 99-37-19.

       Contempt findings were reversed, based on lack of jurisdiction over various named defendants, where there was failure to properly issue service of process, which is required before named person becomes party to motion; knowledge by way of media is not sufficient to bring person before court. Mississippi Asso. of Educators v. Trustees of Jackson Municipal Separate School Dist., 510 So. 2d 123, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2439 (Miss. 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       Criminal contempt is punishment for a past offense, is quasi criminal, and a defendant is presumed innocent until proved guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, and the essence of the offense is that a defendant wilfully, maliciously, and contumaciously has refused to comply with the decree of court. Langford v. Langford, 253 Miss. 483, 176 So. 2d 266, 1965 Miss. LEXIS 1006 (Miss. 1965).
      </p>
      <p>
       A statute empowering the court to punish any person for breach of any decree or order of the court, by fine or imprisonment, or both, provides for criminal contempt, while a statute providing that if any person refused to obey or perform any order or judgment of the court, the court shall have power to fine and imprison him until the order or judgment is complied with, provides for civil or quasi criminal contempt; the order for imprisonment in the former case is for a past and completed act or omission, is punitory and must be suffered, and its purpose is to preserve the power and vindicate the dignity of the court; in the latter case the punishment is coercive and the contemnor may discharge himself by compliance with the terms of the decree violated, and its purpose is to compel obedience to its decrees. Evans v. Evans, 193 Miss. 468, 9 So. 2d 641, 1942 Miss. LEXIS 116 (Miss. 1942).

       Contemnor failed to comply with divorce decree, and a chancellor did not commit manifest error or abuse the chancery court’s discretion by incarcerating the contemnor, as the chancellor’s decision was supported by the record, which included the chancellor’s findings that the contemnor was not credible; further, the divorce decree was not ambiguous, so the contemnor’s argument that the contemnor could not obey because of the decree’s alleged vagueness was rejected. Stribling v. Stribling, 960 So. 2d 556, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 1 (Miss. Ct. App. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       Individual held in prison for civil contempt was improperly held without being afforded opportunity to prove present inability to pay. While defendant may avoid judgment of contempt by establishing that he is without present ability to discharge obligation, he has burden of proving his inability to pay, and such showing must be made with particularity and not in general terms. Where contemnor is unable to pay, even if that present inability is due to his misconduct, imprisonment cannot accomplish purpose of civil contempt decree, which is to compel obedience. Jones v. Hargrove, 516 So. 2d 1354, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2950 (Miss. 1987).

       The chancery court does not have the power to punish for an injunction prohibiting gambling operations under Code 1942 § 2562, which covers penalty where none fixed elsewhere by statute, but under this section. Alexander v. State, 210 Miss. 517, 49 So. 2d 890, 1951 Miss. LEXIS 290 (Miss. 1951).

Murphy v. State, 202 Miss. 890, 32 So. 2d 875, 1947 Miss. LEXIS 352 (Miss. 1947).

       The power to punish for contempt in vacation hereunder is not confined to injunction cases but expressly includes “any other order, decree or process of the court,” and, therefore, includes the enforcement of an alimony decree in vacation.

       A restraining order is foreign to the practice in this state and such an order without bond is a nullity; Wherefore defendant charged with violating a restraining order issued upon an amended bill can only be adjudged guilty of violating such void order, and their guilt cannot be predicated on a violation of an injunction issued upon the original bill.

       Trial court did not have sufficient facts before it to properly issue contempt order where Supreme Court’s review of record revealed no clear and explicit evidence that order placing defendants in contempt of court was well taken, and judgment of conviction did not contain material facts known to court constituting contempt.

   In determining whether a person cited for contempt has the right to a jury trial, which determination must be based on whether the contempt is to be treated as a serious or a petty offense, the court must look to the maximum sentence which could be imposed under the statute if a maximum penalty has been set, and if no maximum penalty has been set, the court should look to the penalty actually imposed as the best evidence of the seriousness of the offense. McGowan v. State, 258 So. 2d 801, 1972 Miss. LEXIS 1516 (Miss.), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">409 U.S. 1006</cite>, <cite class="s_court">93 S. Ct. 430</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">34 L.

       Since the chancellor had power both in vacation and term time to hear and determine a petition alleging that the appellant was in contempt of the court’s injunction, the chancellor did not divest himself of the power to hear the matter in vacation by a citation requiring appellant to execute a bond, where neither the citation nor the bond required appellant to appear at the next term of court, but required his appearance on the vacation date named in the order for citation, and it further appeared that the appellant never executed the bond in question.

      <p>
       Where evidence is insufficient to show beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant deliberately and contumaciously intended to defy the power and dignity of the court in failing to comply with the alimony and child support provisions of a divorce decree, his imprisonment for criminal contempt is not justified.

       Regardless of the rule as to the essentials of a prima facie case in civil contempt, mere proof of failure to pay alimony without more is not sufficient to make a case of proof beyond a reasonable doubt of an intent deliberately and contumaciously to defy the power and dignity of the court justifying imprisonment as for criminal contempt.

       In a proceeding for criminal contempt for failure of a husband, defendant in a divorce suit, to obey a decree ordering the payment of alimony and solicitor’s fees, a prima facie case of “wilful, deliberate and contumacious refusal” was not established, where the only evidence was the testimony of the wife as to the mere fact that the alimony had not been paid.

       A guardian ad litem should object to incompetent testimony, and if he fails to do so, the court of its own motion should reject it. Neblett v. Neblett, 70 Miss. 572, 12 So. 598, 1893 Miss. LEXIS 17 (Miss. 1893).

   Because the child’s best interest was the court’s “polestar” consideration in determining child custody, the importance of guardian ad litem appointments in child custody proceedings could not be overemphasized; in a case where a mother sought modification of child custody, and there was an allegation of abuse, it was mandatory that a guardian ad litem be appointed, under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.93.html#t93c05s93-5-23" target="_blank">93-5-23</a></cite> (Supp. 2002). Robison v. Lanford, 841 So. 2d 1119, 2003 Miss.

       In an action to construe a will wherein the question was whether the intended devisee was the testatrix’ minor granddaughter, or testatrix’ daughter, the decree of the chancery court was not void as against the minor because no guardian ad litem had been appointed, where the minor and her father, with whom she resided, were made parties to the petition, and were both served with process, and the natural father and mother of the minor were both very active and diligent in behalf of the minor on the trial of the case.

       Where a grantee and optionee sued the grantor and trustee in a deed of trust, seeking a declaration as to the mental competency of the grantor and confirmation of title in the grantee, and the grantor had never disclaimed the grantee’s title until this was done by the guardian ad litem, the grantee and the optionee rather than the grantor should be charged with compensation of the guardian ad litem.

       Where a testatrix left all of her property to the use of her incompetent brother during his life, with the remainder to his guardian, and a guardian ad litem, who was appointed by the court to represent the incompetent during the probate proceedings, filed an answer on behalf of his ward, the incompetent was adequately represented at the probate.

      Whenever it shall appear by petition to the chancery court, or chancellor in vacation, that any bond given by an assignee, receiver, executor, administrator, guardian, or trustee is in excess of the value of the estate being administered, and as such is an unnecessary expense to the estate, or that other sufficient cause appears for so doing, the chancery court or chancellor in vacation may, after five days’ service of copy of said petition on the surety, cancel the bond or reduce the same to an amount sufficient to protect the estate, or accept a new bond in substitution of an existing one. However, the decree rendered shall not affect the liability upon a bond which accrued prior to its cancellation, reduction or substitution.

     <p>
      The clerk of the chancery court, before he enters upon the duties of the office, shall take the oath of office and give bond, with sufficient surety, to be payable, conditioned and approved as provided by law, in a penalty equal to five percent (5%) of the sum of all the state and county taxes shown by the assessment rolls and the levies to have been collectible in the county for the year immediately preceding the commencement of the term of office for such clerk; however, such bond shall not exceed the amount of One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000.00). Such clerk may be required by the court, or the chancellor in vacation, to give additional bond in any particular case, which shall be a cumulative security, and shall not in any manner affect the liability on his official bond for any matter covered by it. His official bond shall be held to cover all his official acts, and all moneys which may come into his hands according to law or by order of the court or chancellor.

      The clerk shall not suffer any paper filed to be withdrawn but by leave of the chancellor, and then only by retaining a copy to be made at the cost of the party obtaining the leave. Provided, however, that any duly licensed and practicing attorney in good standing in the court may remove court files and related legal papers other than youth court and adoption court files and related papers from the clerk’s office by signing therefor himself, or by a designated representative of his law office, on a record to be provided for that purpose. Such files or documents so removed shall be attested to by the clerk or his deputy at the time of removal, and said attorney shall be personally responsible for their safekeeping and return within ten (10) days, or before the first day of the next term of chancery court, whichever comes first and such files or documents shall not be removed from the county where the same are filed except that said files or documents may be taken by said attorney for use in a vacation hearing to such county where the hearing may be held. Failure to return any such court files or related legal papers as provided herein shall constitute contempt of court.

       The approval of sufficiency of an appeal bond is not the equivalent of the filing of the bond, when the provisions of this section [Code 1942 § 1238] have not been complied with. Wood v. Warren, 193 So. 2d 123, 1966 Miss. LEXIS 1274 (Miss. 1966).

       A paper is not filed in the legal sense, notwithstanding it may be marked “filed,” until it has been delivered to the proper official with the purpose that the usual steps be taken in reference thereto. Where a bill is handed to the clerk and marked “filed” by him, but immediately carried away by the solicitor who stated that he did not wish process issued, there has been no such filing as will give priority of lien over another creditor who, before the return of the bill and issuance of process, has filed a like bill and had process issued thereon.

      The clerk of the chancery court shall subscribe to at least one (1) and not more than two (2) of the newspapers published in his county as the court or chancellor may direct; and in the event no newspaper is published in the county, the clerk shall subscribe to the newspaper in which the publications ordered by the court are usually made.

Before the clerk may utilize microfilm copies of newspapers presently on file and of those newspapers to be received in the future, the written approval of the court and the board of supervisors must be obtained. The expense of the subscriptions and the expense of the binding of filed newspapers or of the microfilming process shall be paid out of the county treasury.

       In view of public policy to encourage small holdings in fee, equality among heirs, activity of sales, and freedom of transfers, and the fact that the statutes provide for recording of instruments affecting title to land, and charge the public with notice of such instruments and their contents, the law should be liberalized as to the right of inspection of records and making copies thereof. Logan v. Mississippi Abstract Co., 190 Miss. 479, 200 So. 716, 1941 Miss. LEXIS 68 (Miss. 1941).

      <p>
       The right to make copies of public records is restricted as to time to “all reasonable hours on business days,” and as to methods, so as not to interfere unduly with the use of the records by the public, or with the clerk in the discharge of his duties, or materially to lessen the compensation of the clerk. Logan v. Mississippi Abstract Co., 190 Miss. 479, 200 So. 716, 1941 Miss. LEXIS 68 (Miss. 1941).

       The word “copy” in the statute includes photographic copies. Logan v. Mississippi Abstract Co., 190 Miss. 479, 200 So. 716, 1941 Miss. LEXIS 68 (Miss. 1941).

       A Mississippi corporation, chartered to own, use, make and keep a full set of abstract books and records, by which to make and compile abstracts of title and ownership maps covering the real estate in the state, and in connection therewith, to make copies of public records by all means and devices, had the right to examine and make photostatic copies of the records of Coahoma County, although such corporation had no special existing or prospective interest in any lands in such county nor present employment to examine and copy the records. Logan v. Mississippi Abstract Co., 190 Miss. 479, 200 So. 716, 1941 Miss. LEXIS 68 (Miss. 1941).

     <p>
      Any chancellor in this state may, by an order made and entered on the minute book of the chancery court in each of said counties in his district, require the docket of said court to be provided and kept as follows:
     </p>
     <p>
      The clerk shall provide and keep, for the use of the chancellor, a loose leaf judge’s docket, in which he shall enter, on a separate sheet, each matter or cause now pending in the court, or hereafter instituted therein, together with a chronological list of all pleadings, orders and decrees in each such matter or cause.
     </p>
     <p>
      The sheets on which the various matters or causes are entered shall be arranged in such docket as the chancellor may direct, and shall remain therein until each matter or cause is finally disposed of, when the sheet containing the entries concerning the same shall be removed, and placed in numerical order in a transfer binder.
     </p>
     <p>
      All litigated or contested matters or causes appearing on the judge’s docket, which are triable by law, or by consent, at any term, shall be set for trial by the chancellor at such time during the term as he may direct. Provided, however, when any chancellor has entered an order on the minute book of the chancery court of the counties in his district requiring the docket of said court to be kept, as provided in this section, Sections 9-5-205 through 9-5-213 shall not apply to the chancery court of said district.

       Except as provided by subsection (9) of this section, the senior chancellor of each chancery court district in the state may apply to the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court for the appointment of one or more persons to serve as family masters in chancery in each of the counties or for all of the counties within the respective chancery court district if the senior chancellor states in writing that the chancery court district’s docket is crowded enough to warrant an appointment of a family master. The Chief Justice shall determine from the information provided by the senior chancellor if the need exists for the appointment of a family master. If the Chief Justice determines that the need exists, a family master shall be appointed. If the Chief Justice determines that the need does not exist, no family master shall be appointed.

       Family masters in chancery shall have the power to hear cases and recommend orders establishing, modifying and enforcing orders for support in matters referred to them by chancellors and judges of the circuit, county or family courts of such county. The family master in chancery shall have jurisdiction over paternity matters brought pursuant to the Mississippi Uniform Law on Paternity and referred to them by chancellors and judges of the circuit, county or family courts of such county. As used in this section, “order for support” shall have the same meaning as such term is defined in Section 93-11-101.
      </li>
      <li id="t09c05s9-5-255ol13">
       In all cases in which an order for support has been established and the person to whom the support obligation is owed is a nonrelated Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) family on whose behalf the Department of Human Services is providing services, the family master in chancery or any other judge or court of competent jurisdiction shall, upon proper pleading by the department and upon appropriate proceedings conducted thereon, order that the department may recover and that the obligor shall be liable for reasonable attorney’s fees at a minimum of Two Hundred Fifty Dollars ($250.00) or an amount set by the court and court costs which the department incurs in enforcing and collecting amounts of support obligation which exceed administrative fees collected and current support owed by the obligor.

       Persons appointed as family masters in chancery pursuant to this section shall meet and possess all of the qualifications required of chancery and circuit court judges of this state, shall remain in office at the pleasure of the appointing chancellor, and shall receive reasonable compensation for services rendered by them, as fixed by law, or allowed by the court. Family masters in chancery shall be paid out of any available funds budgeted by the board of supervisors of the county in which they serve; provided, however, in the event that a family master in chancery is appointed to serve in more than one county within a chancery court district, then the compensation and expenses of such master shall be equally apportioned among and paid by each of the counties in which such master serves. The chancery clerk shall issue to such persons a certificate of appointment.

       Family masters in chancery shall have power to administer oaths, to take the examination of witnesses in cases referred to them, to examine and report upon all matters referred to them, and they shall have all the powers in cases referred to them properly belonging to masters or commissioners in chancery according to the practice of equity courts as heretofore exercised.
      </li>
      <li id="t09c05s9-5-255ol16">
       Family masters in chancery shall have power to issue subpoenas for witnesses to attend before them to testify in any matter referred to them or generally in the cause, and the subpoenas shall be executed in like manner as subpoenas issued by the clerk of the court. If any witness shall fail to appear, the master shall proceed by process of attachment to compel the witness to attend and give evidence.

       In all cases heard by masters pursuant to this section, such masters shall make a written report to the chancellor or judge who refers the case to him. Such chancellor or judge may accept, reject or modify, in whole or in part, the findings or recommendations made and reported by the master, and may recommit the matter to the master with instructions. In all cases referred to such master, initialing for approval by the master of a proposed decree shall be sufficient to constitute the master’s report.
      </li>
      <li id="t09c05s9-5-255ol19">
       Any chancellor required by this section to appoint a person or persons to serve as family masters in chancery may forego the requirement to appoint such masters or if family masters have been appointed, such chancellor may terminate such appointments and leave such positions vacant, only if an exemption from the United States Department of Health and Human Services is obtained for the county or counties involved. Such positions may remain vacant for as long as such exemption remains in effect.

      <p>
       Laws 2002, ch. 713 (Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 543), provides in pertinent part:
      </p>
      <p>
       “BE IT RESOLVED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI, That the following amendment to the Mississippi Constitution of 1890 is proposed to the qualified electors of the state:
      </p>
      <p>
       “Amend Section 153, Mississippi Constitution of 1890, to read as follows:
      </p>
      <p>
       “‘Section 153. The judges of the circuit and chancery courts shall be elected by the people in a manner and at a time to be provided by the Legislature. The judges elected for a term of office beginning from and after January 1, 2003, shall hold their office for a term of six (6) years.’
      </p>
      <p>
       “BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That this proposed amendment shall be submitted by the Secretary of State to the qualified electors at an election to be held on the first Tuesday after the first Monday of November 2002, as provided by Section 273 of the Constitution and by general law.

      </p>
      <p>
       “BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That the Attorney General of the State of Mississippi shall submit this resolution, immediately upon adoption by the Legislature, to the Attorney General of the United States or to the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, in accordance with the provisions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, as amended and extended.”

       Laws of 2015, ch. 476, § 63, provides in part:
      </p>
      <p>
       “SECTION 63. (1) The Standing Joint Legislative Committee on Reapportionment is directed to provide the counties census block equivalency files and maps necessary to assist the counties in identifying the boundaries of any subdistricts within a chancery or circuit court district.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(2)(a) The Split Precinct Block List developed in conjunction with House Bill No. 703, 2015 Regular Session [Chapter 476, Laws of 2015], that details the portions of the partial or split precincts that are contained within a judicial subdistrict by census block number as that list is utilized to detail partial or split precincts for judicial subdistricts in this act is hereby incorporated into and shall be construed to be an integral part of this act. A partial or split precinct contained in this act is identified by an asterisk (*) following its designation within any judicial subdistrict. The Standing Joint Legislative Committee on Reapportionment shall file the Split Precinct Block List with the Secretary of State.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(3)(a) This act shall be liberally construed to effectuate the purposes hereof and to redistrict the trial courts of this state in compliance with constitutional requirements.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(b) It is intended that this act and the districts and subdistricts described herein completely encompass all the area within the state and all the voters in this state. It is also intended that no district shall include any of the area included within the description of any other district, and that no subdistrict shall include any of the area included within the description of any other subdistrict.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(c)(i) If the districts or subdistricts described in this act do not carry out the purposes hereof because of: omissions; duplication; overlapping areas; erroneous nomenclature; lack of adequate maps or descriptions of political subdivisions, wards or other divisions thereof, or of their boundary lines; then the Secretary of State, at the joint request of the Lieutenant Governor and the Speaker of the House, by order, shall correct any omissions, overlaps, erroneous nomenclature or other defects in the description of the districts and subdistricts so as to accomplish the purposes and objectives of this act.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(ii) In promulgating any order under this subsection (3), the Secretary of State, in addition to insuring that all areas of the state are completely and accurately encompassed in the districts and subdistricts, shall be guided by the following standards:
      </p>
      <p>
       “1. Gaps in the description of any district or subdistrict shall be completed in a manner that results in a total description of the district or subdistrict that is consonant with the description of adjacent districts or subdistricts and results in complete contiguity of districts and subdistricts;
      </p>
      <p>
       “2. In any allocation of area or correction of descriptions made pursuant to this subsection, the Secretary of State shall, consistent with the foregoing standards, preserve the contiguity and compactness of districts and subdistricts and avoid the unnecessary division of political subdivisions.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(d) A copy of any order issued under this subsection shall be filed by the Secretary of State in his own office and in the offices of the affected commissioners of election and registrars. The Secretary of State may adopt reasonable rules regulating the procedure for applications for orders under this act and the manner of serving and filing any notice or copy of orders. Upon the filing of an order, the description of any affected district or subdistrict shall be deemed to have been corrected to the full extent as if the correction had been contained in the original description set forth in this act.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(e) The redistricting contained in this act supersedes any prior redistricting.”

       The United States Attorney General, by letter dated September 6, 1994, interposed no objection, under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, to the amendment of this section by
   Laws, 1994, ch. 564, § 38.
      </p>
      <p>
       The effective date of Chapter 361, Laws of 2013, which amended this section, is “from and after the date it is effectuated under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, as amended and extended.” However, after the bill was approved, the United States Supreme Court, in the case of
       <i>
        Shelby County v. Holder
       </i>
       (June 25, 2013), struck down the coverage formula that determined what jurisdictions are subject to Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, so the coverage formula can no longer be used as a basis for subjecting jurisdictions to preclearance under Section 5.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because of the
       <i>
        Shelby County
       </i>
       decision, the United States Attorney General is not making any determinations under Section 5 on voting or election changes made by states.
   The Supreme Court did not strike down Section 5, so it is still in effect.
   For that reason, the Mississippi Attorney General’s Office submitted Chapter 361, Laws of 2013, to the United States Attorney General, in order to technically meet the requirements of Section 5 and fulfill the condition in the effective date of the bill, which will allow the bill to take effect.
      </p>
      <p>
       By letter dated October 22, 2013, the United States Attorney General responded that he is not making determinations on the merits of any bill that is submitted under Section 5. The submission of Chapter 361 and the response from the United States Attorney General technically met the requirements of Section 5 and fulfilled the condition in the effective date of Chapter 361, so Chapter 361 became effective from and after October 22, 2013, the date of the United States Attorney General’s response letter.

       This section is being set out to correct an error in the 2014 Replacement Volume. The version of the section that was to become effective upon effectuation under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, as amended and extended, provided a proposed amendment to Section 153 of the Mississippi Constitution (by Chapter 713, Laws of 2002) was ratified by the electorate, was erroneously set out in the bound volume.

       Although a judge’s conduct in entering orders regarding a defendant at the same time the senior judge was also entering orders regarding that defendant in some of the same cases did not evidence the level of civility and professionalism expected of judges, the judge’s conduct did not constitute a violation of the statute.

   There has been a vast expansion by statutory enactment of the times within which circuit judges are lawfully empowered to conduct court affairs. Although the Mississippi Constitution contemplates circuit courts being held at fixed, stated terms provided by statute, and the circuit courts of this State have had fixed terms, the legislature by various enactments-§§<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.11.html#t11c01s11-1-7" target="_blank">11-1-7</a></cite> [repealed],<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.11.html#t11c07s11-7-131" target="_blank">11-7-131</a></cite> to 133,<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.11.html#t11c07s11-7-121" target="_blank">11-7-121</a></cite> [repealed],<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.11.html#t11c01s11-1-16" target="_blank">11-1-16</a></cite>, and<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t09c07s9-7-3" target="_self">9-7-3</a></cite>-has granted circuit courts wide latitude in taking official actions in vacation. Griffin v. State, 565 So. 2d 545, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 285 (Miss. 1990), limited, Presley v. State, 792 So. 2d 950, 2001 Miss. LEXIS 153 (Miss. 2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the business of a circuit court does not require that it sit for the entire length of the term as fixed by statute, the trial of a defendant’s appeal was properly dismissed for want of prosecution during the three days which the court sat, and his motion for a new trial was properly overruled. McDowell v. State, 251 Miss. 156, 168 So. 2d 658, 1964 Miss. LEXIS 336 (Miss. 1964).

       The assumption is that the legislature was aware of the rule declared by the supreme court that where there is but one judge of a judicial district, a term held in one county or part of the district during the time fixed by law for holding a term in another county or part of the district is illegal and the proceedings thereat will not be sustained, and that the legislature did not intent to so arrange the terms in the fourth district that the time of a term in any county in the district would overlap upon the term in any other county therein. Candate v. State, 196 Miss. 711, 18 So. 2d 441, 1944 Miss. LEXIS 252 (Miss. 1944).

       By this section the legislature intended to fix, and did fix, for Holmes county a term of four successive weeks beginning each on the first Monday in April and in October. Candate v. State, 196 Miss. 711, 18 So. 2d 441, 1944 Miss. LEXIS 252 (Miss. 1944).
      </p>
      <p>
       Inasmuch as order made on Tuesday, October 5, 1943, for adjournment or recess to October 18 was to a day within the term, the recess order was expressly authorized by Code 1942 § 1649, and inasmuch as the day to which adjournment or recess had been taken was within the term, the judge was authorized to sign the minutes of October 5th on or during the day next in session, which was on October 18, or on any remaining day in session during the four weeks of the term. Candate v. State, 196 Miss. 711, 18 So. 2d 441, 1944 Miss. LEXIS 252 (Miss. 1944).

       Adjournment of the circuit court of Sunflower County, convened in accordance with this section, without trial on felony charge pursuant to indictment returned during term, was not a violation of constitutional right of speedy trial, in that statute (§ 1494, Code 1906), requiring trial of indictments at first term unless good cause shown for continuance, did not prevent subsequent trial within reasonable limits without showing good cause.

      <p>
       The division of time between civil and criminal business as to the circuit court in Leflore County is for convenience in the administration of the business of the court, and does not deprive court of jurisdiction to enter default judgment in civil case during that portion of term allotted for criminal business. Strain v. Gayden, 197 Miss. 353, 20 So. 2d 697, 1945 Miss. LEXIS 295 (Miss. 1945).

       Where court in Holmes county convened on first Monday in October and order adjourning until following day was entered and signed by the presiding judge, and at the close of the following day order was made adjourning court until October 18, a day within the term, but the judge did not sign the minutes containing such order on that day, validity of the term and court’s right to proceed on later date to conviction in criminal case could not be questioned, since it would be presumed that the judge signed the minutes on the day to which adjournment was taken, and on each succeeding day throughout the term, so long as in session, including those on the last day.

       Mississippi justice courts and the circuit courts shared concurrent jurisdiction in matters in which the amount in controversy exceeded $200 but not $2,500. Arant v. Hubbard, 824 So. 2d 611, 2002 Miss. LEXIS 257 (Miss. 2002).
      </p>
      <p>
       Mississippi Constitution Article 4 § 38 vests competence of a candidate’s qualifications for office-including whether the candidate meets residency qualifications-in the Senate. Thus, the circuit court did not have subject matter jurisdiction of an election contest wherein it was alleged that candidates did not meet the residency requirements for service in the Senate as prescribed in Article 4 § 42 of the Mississippi Constitution. Foster v. Harden, 536 So. 2d 905, 1988 Miss. LEXIS 639 (Miss. 1988), overruled in part, Dillon v. Myers, 227 So.3d 923, 2017 Miss. LEXIS 134 (Miss. 2017).

       Circuit court had jurisdiction to decide suit challenging powers being exercised by Lieutenant Governor where there was no exclusive vesting in another court of jurisdiction to hear and decide such claim, and due to nature of relief sought, i.e., that Lieutenant Governor’s exercise of certain powers in Senate be declared unconstitutional and he be debarred from exercising such authority, such case was akin to those historically within circuit court jurisdiction, to-wit: quo warranto proceedings.

       While subject matter jurisdiction lay within either the circuit or the chancery court, the circuit court had subject matter jurisdiction of heavy equipment vendor’s action against a county board of supervisors where the amended complaint, although it sought some relief equitable in nature, in substantial part partook of an action at law, in that it charged the board of supervisors with breach of duties not unlike those generally contractual, and the complaint sought the assessment of civil penalties.

      <p>
       A proper reading of Article III § 27 of the Mississippi Constitution initially requires an indictment that charges the essential elements of the criminal offense. Once the indictment has been served on the defendant, a court having subject matter jurisdiction is empowered to proceed. A subsequent event such as a guilty plea to a lesser related offense in no way ousts the court of personal jurisdiction. This reading is consistent with the purposes which an indictment serves-the reasons it has been accorded the status of a constitutional right-(1) to furnish the accused with such a description of the charge against him or her as will enable the accused to make his or her defense and avail himself or herself of a conviction or acquittal for protection against a further prosecution for the same cause, (2) to inform the court of the facts alleged so that it may decide whether they are sufficient in law to support a conviction if one should be obtained, and (3) to guard against malicious, groundless prosecution. Jefferson v. State, 556 So. 2d 1016, 1989 Miss. LEXIS 485 (Miss. 1989).

       When a juvenile is charged with an offense carrying a potential life sentence, such as rape or murder, jurisdiction is vested exclusively in the circuit court and the Youth Court Act is inapplicable. Smith v. State, 534 So. 2d 194, 1988 Miss. LEXIS 545 (Miss. 1988).
      </p>

       Murder is a crime excepted from the jurisdiction of the youth court. Thus, the circuit court had exclusive jurisdiction over a juvenile charged with murder. Boyd v. State, 523 So. 2d 1037, 1988 Miss. LEXIS 220 (Miss. 1988).

       One of two courts of concurrent jurisdiction may, by valid order of dismissal, relinquish its exclusive jurisdiction acquired by criminal prosecution being first instituted therein, so that the other court may proceed then with prosecution of same offense.

       Dismissal without prejudice to the state of proceeding against defendant in justice of the peace court for unlawful possession of intoxicating liquor on motion of state did not prevent the defendant from being indicted for the same offense in the circuit court having concurrent jurisdiction.

   In an action by the members of a Confederate Veterans society against a university for violating Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.55.html#t55c15s55-15-81" target="_blank">55-15-81</a></cite>, the circuit court properly ruled that, despite their argument to the contrary and the nomenclature used, the case was a mandamus action and not one for injunctive relief, denied the members’ motion to retransfer to the chancery court, and granted a university’s motion to dismiss the action for lack of standing because the members failed to challenge the judgment from the chancery court transferring the case, the circuit court had jurisdiction under two statutes, and the members had no private right that entitled them to require that the university refrain from implementing its diversity plan. Miss. Div. of Sons of Confederate Veterans v. Univ. of Miss., — So.3d —, 2018 Miss. App. LEXIS 425 (Miss. Ct. App. Sept. 4, 2018).

       In the case of an erroneous transfer of an action by the state tax collector to recover the penalty for the unlawful sale of intoxicating liquors and for the abatement of a nuisance from the chancery to the circuit court, the circuit court should and must proceed with the case, since there is no appeal from such erroneous transfer and no provision made for its correction.

       Where an action by the state tax collector for the recovery of penalties for the unlawful sale of intoxicating liquors and for general equitable relief was erroneously transferred from the chancery court to the circuit court, and it did not appear that any substantial right of the complainant was affected by the erroneous transfer, the only course open to the circuit court was to dismiss the action upon complainant’s refusal to proceed.

      <p>
       The jurisdiction of the court, where the affidavit in replevin shows the proper amount, can only be defeated by showing that a false valuation of the property was made on “purpose to confer jurisdiction.” On this point this section [Code 1942, § 1432] applies to the courts of justices of the peace as well as circuit courts.

       It must appear that a greater sum than $200.00 was demanded on purpose to evade the law requiring suits for sums of and under that amount to be brought before a justice of the peace, or the plaintiff cannot be nonsuited. Griffin v. Lower, 37 Miss. 458, 1859 Miss. LEXIS 38 (Miss. 1859).

       In action against Federal Housing Authority under Contract Settlement Act of 1944, court should include in final judgment an allowance of attorney fees equal to minimum fee for collections fixed by local bar association, which fee should include fee for partial payments collected before suit through efforts of attorney.

       Where the plaintiff brought an action for wrongful removal of timber to the plaintiff’s damage in the sum of $525, and he recovered only $40, he was not entitled to costs against the defendant in the absence of a finding and entry in the record by the trial judge that plaintiff had reason to expect to recover more than the jurisdictional amount of $200.

      The clerk of the circuit court, before he enters upon the duties of the office, shall take the oath of office, and give bond, with sufficient surety, to be payable, conditioned and approved as provided by law, in a penalty equal to three percent (3%) of the sum of all the state and county taxes shown by the assessment rolls and the levies to have been collectible in the county for the year immediately preceding the commencement of the term of office for such clerk. However, such bond shall not exceed the amount of One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000.00). And he may be required to give additional bond from time to time, for the faithful application of all moneys coming into his hands by law or order of the court; but such additional bonds shall be cumulative security, and the original bond shall likewise cover all moneys coming into the hands of the clerk by law or order of the court.

       In a case in which defendant, a former county circuit clerk, was convicted of embezzlement, in violation of 18 U.S.C.S. § 666(a)(1), he argued unsuccessfully that the district court erred by refusing to dismiss the embezzlement counts because he was not an agent of a county under 18 U.S.C.S. § 666(d)(1). Since (1) defendant directed and controlled deputy clerks, who were county employees; (2) as an officer of the county, he collected money belonging to the county; and (3) he was authorized to act on behalf of the county in directing county employees, defendant was an agent of the county.

   Since circuit clerks were authorized by Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t09c07s9-7-123" target="_self">9-7-123</a></cite> to hire deputy clerks, Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t09c07s9-7-126" target="_self">9-7-126</a></cite> authorized circuit clerks to supervise the public duties of the deputy clerks who were deemed to be employees of the county, and Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t09c07s9-7-126" target="_self">9-7-126</a></cite> required that county boards of supervisors defray the salaries of deputy clerks with funds from the county treasury, the fact that circuit clerks received county funds to pay deputies and that clerks controlled those county employees strongly weighed in favor of finding that clerks were county agents for purposes of 18 U.S.C.S. § 666(d)(1).

       In a case in which defendant, a former county circuit clerk, was convicted of embezzlement, in violation of 18 U.S.C.S. § 666(a)(1), his reliance on the Phillips decision, a Louisiana case, was misplaced. In the Phillips case, defendant, a former tax assessor of a parish, was not an agent of the parish under 18 U.S.C.S. § § 666(d)(1), because Louisiana law completely separated the tax assessor’s office from the parish government; however, in Mississippi, circuit clerks were not completely separated from county governments in Mississippi, and the Phillips decision was not applicable in the present case.

      <p>
       Pursuant to
   Section 1-1-109, the Joint Legislative Committee on Compilation, Revision and Publication of Legislation deleted the words “for the same term and” preceding “in the same manner” in (2)(a). The words were added by a 2002 bill that was contingent upon ratification of a constitutional amendment which failed. The words were mistakenly left in the code and included in
   Laws of 2017, ch. 318, § 1. The Joint Committee ratified the correction at its August 15, 2017, meeting.

       “BE IT RESOLVED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI, That the following amendment to the Mississippi Constitution of 1890 is proposed to the qualified electors of the state:

       “‘Section 153.
   The judges of the circuit and chancery courts shall be elected by the people in a manner and at a time to be provided by the Legislature.

       Chapter 17 of the Code of 1930, pertaining to county courts, is not a repeal but a re-enactment of the applicable provisions of the Act of 1926. Quitman County v. Turner, 196 Miss. 746, 18 So. 2d 122, 1944 Miss. LEXIS 254 (Miss. 1944).
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the purposes in the establishment of county courts was to provide a judicial officer possessing all the qualifications of a circuit judge or chancellor, who would be available at all times for service in habeas corpus cases and to furnish a speedy remedy in habeas corpus. Cole v. Cole, 194 Miss. 292, 12 So. 2d 425, 1943 Miss. LEXIS 71 (Miss. 1943).
      </p>
      <p>
       County Court Act did not repeal entire eminent domain chapter, but both must be construed together, and all provisions of each not repugnant to provisions of other must stand and in case of repugnancy county court chapter controls. Mississippi State Highway Dep't v. Haines, 162 Miss. 216, 139 So. 168, 1932 Miss. LEXIS 121 (Miss. 1932).

      <p>
       Supreme Court, circuit courts, chancery courts and county courts, when acting on appeal from a special possessory court of a justice of the peace, have only such jurisdiction to adjudicate regarding title to land as is vested in special court from which appeal was taken. McCoy v. McRae, 204 Miss. 309, 37 So. 2d 353, 1948 Miss. LEXIS 368 (Miss. 1948).
      </p>
      <p>
       Original jurisdiction to make conclusive and final adjudication of title to land rests alone with circuit and chancery courts, and to a limited extent with the county courts. McCoy v. McRae, 204 Miss. 309, 37 So. 2d 353, 1948 Miss. LEXIS 368 (Miss. 1948).

       Jurisdiction of county court is not confined to particular justice district, but is concurrent with jurisdiction of all justices of county. Webb v. State, 158 Miss. 715, 131 So. 262, 1930 Miss. LEXIS 108 (Miss. 1930).

       County court had jurisdiction of proceeding for partition of land held by tenants in common in which original bill alleged that value of lots sought to be partitioned at time of filing of bill would not exceed $1000 and final decree of county court adjudicated truth of this fact and found that value of land had increased since time of filing of bill because of discovery of oil nearby and lots brought $1,200 at sale, since jurisdiction having been acquired by original bill it was not defeated by subsequent events. Barnes v. Rogers, 206 Miss. 887, 41 So. 2d 58, 1949 Miss. LEXIS 311 (Miss. 1949).
      </p>
      <p>
       Jurisdiction of a court is determined by amount in controversy at time when court is first called on to exercise jurisdiction, which, in trial court, is amount claimed at time when suit is filed, and jurisdiction once acquired is not defeated by subsequent events, even though they are of such character as would have prevented jurisdiction from attaching in first instance. Barnes v. Rogers, 206 Miss. 887, 41 So. 2d 58, 1949 Miss. LEXIS 311 (Miss. 1949).

       A judgment of the trial court sustaining a demurrer to an action to enforce a money reserve title contract, based on the claim that the amount sued for exceeded the jurisdictional amount and that the plaintiff failed to demand possession of the chattel before bringing suit, was not on the merits, and so the defense of res judicata was not available in a second action, in which the sum sued for was within the jurisdictional amount.

       The salary provision in this section [Code 1942 § 1608] for county judge applies only to the larger counties automatically established by the Act of 1926, and the sliding-scale provision of Code 1942 § 1618 applies to the smaller counties which elected to establish county courts under the enabling provisions of the Act of 1926, so that the annual salary for judge of Quitman County Court, established by the people under the enabling provisions of the Act of 1926 at a salary of $2,000, continued to remain at $2,000 after the adoption of the 1930 Code since that county fell in that category under Code 1942 § 1618, in view of the fact that § 697 of 1930 Code merely carried over the automatic provision of the Act of 1926, whereas § 706, Code 1930 (Code 1942 § 1618) carried over the enabling provisions of the Act of 1926.

       While an order, under which a term of county court was to open at the county court house but would thereafter convene in another city for the trial of cases originating in certain supervisors’ districts of the county, was valid, it did not circumscribe the jurisdiction of the county court as to venue in any particular portion of the county, or deprive the court of jurisdiction, while sitting at the county court house, to dismiss a prosecution which had been instituted and tried in such other city, and, therefore, a subsequent prosecution of the same charge in the circuit court was not subject to the defense that the prosecution was still pending in county court.

       It is not within the allowance of the statute that an order by the county judge should be so framed as to confine the territorial jurisdiction of the court when sitting at a place, fixed in the order, to cases originating within the area of, and adjacent to, that place and to the effect that thereby the court would have no territorial jurisdiction of that area while sitting elsewhere in the county.

       The jurisdiction of the county court shall be as follows: It shall have jurisdiction concurrent with the justice court in all matters, civil and criminal of which the justice court has jurisdiction; and it shall have jurisdiction concurrent with the circuit and chancery courts in all matters of law and equity wherein the amount of value of the thing in controversy shall not exceed, exclusive of costs and interest, the sum of Two Hundred Thousand Dollars ($200,000.00), and the jurisdiction of the county court shall not be affected by any setoff, counterclaim or cross-bill in such actions where the amount sought to be recovered in such setoff, counterclaim or cross-bill exceeds Two Hundred Thousand Dollars ($200,000.00). Provided, however, the party filing such setoff, counterclaim or cross-bill which exceeds Two Hundred Thousand Dollars ($200,000.00) shall give notice to the opposite party or parties as provided in Section 13-3-83, and on motion of all parties filed within twenty (20) days after the filing of such setoff, counterclaim or cross-bill, the county court shall transfer the case to the circuit or chancery court wherein the county court is situated and which would otherwise have jurisdiction. It shall have exclusively the jurisdiction heretofore exercised by the justice court in the following matters and causes: namely, eminent domain, the partition of personal property, and actions of unlawful entry and detainer, provided that the actions of eminent domain and unlawful entry and detainer may be returnable and triable before the judge of said court in vacation.

      <p>
       The effective date of Chapter 361, Laws of 2013, which amended this section, is “from and after the date it is effectuated under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, as amended and extended.” However, after the bill was approved, the United States Supreme Court, in the case of
       <i>
        Shelby County v. Holder
       </i>
       (June 25, 2013), struck down the coverage formula that determined what jurisdictions are subject to Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, so the coverage formula can no longer be used as a basis for subjecting jurisdictions to preclearance under Section 5.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because of the
       <i>
        Shelby County
       </i>
       decision, the United States Attorney General is not making any determinations under Section 5 on voting or election changes made by states.
   The Supreme Court did not strike down Section 5, so it is still in effect.
   For that reason, the Mississippi Attorney General’s Office submitted Chapter 361, Laws of 2013, to the United States Attorney General, in order to technically meet the requirements of Section 5 and fulfill the condition in the effective date of the bill, which will allow the bill to take effect.
      </p>
      <p>
       By letter dated October 22, 2013, the United States Attorney General responded that he is not making determinations on the merits of any bill that is submitted under Section 5. The submission of Chapter 361 and the response from the United States Attorney General technically met the requirements of Section 5 and fulfilled the condition in the effective date of Chapter 361, so Chapter 361 became effective from and after October 22, 2013, the date of the United States Attorney General’s response letter.

       A county court properly exercised jurisdiction in a criminal proceeding for hunting during a closed season and hunting without wearing fluorescent orange where the county court judge reviewed the tickets issued to the defendant and noted that they were not supported by affidavits, and held that the justice court never attained jurisdiction over the case.

       A county court, though having concurrent jurisdiction with a justice of the peace court over the crime of assault and battery, did not have jurisdiction to proceed with defendant’s prosecution for that crime where the justice of the peace court had first acquired full and exclusive jurisdiction of the case and the case was still pending there when an affidavit charging defendant with the same crime was filed with the county court.

In all cases pending in, or within the jurisdiction of, his court, he shall have, in term time, and in vacation, the power to order, do or determine to the same extent and in the same manner as a justice of the peace or a circuit judge or a chancellor could do in term time or in vacation in such cases. But he shall not have original power to issue writs of injunction, or other remedial writs in equity or in law except in those cases hereinabove specified as being within his jurisdiction: Provided, however, that when any judge or chancellor authorized to issue such writs of injunction, or any other equitable or legal remedial writs hereinabove reserved, shall so direct in writing the hearing of application therefor may be by him referred to the county judge, in which event the said direction of the superior judge shall vest in the said county judge all authority to take such action on said application as the said superior judge could have taken under the right and the law, had the said application been at all times before the said superior judge.

      In any civil case instituted in the circuit court, wherein all parties file a motion to transfer said case to the county court for trial, or wherein all parties file an instrument of writing consenting to such a transfer, the circuit court may, in its discretion, transfer the case to the county court for trial; and the said county court shall have full jurisdiction of and shall proceed to try any case so transferred, provided, however, that such order of transfer be rendered prior to the empaneling of the jury in such cases.

       County court clerk, who by law is the same person as the circuit court clerk, and who, as circuit clerk, received an allowance for public service not particularly provided for under Code 1942 § 3934, subsection (c), was not entitled to an additional allowance, as county clerk, for public service not particularly provided for, since by statute the compensation of the county clerk is expressly confined to the fees allowed by law for like duties in the circuit and chancery courts, which means that the county clerk must look to the fixed schedule of the fees specifically allowed by law for services in the circuit and chancery courts, and there is no authority to make allowance to the county clerk as such for public service not particularly provided for.

       The effective date of Chapter 361, Laws of 2013, which amended this section, is “from and after the date it is effectuated under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, as amended and extended.” However, after the bill was approved, the United States Supreme Court, in the case of
       <i>
        Shelby County v. Holder
       </i>
       (June 25, 2013), struck down the coverage formula that determined what jurisdictions are subject to Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, so the coverage formula can no longer be used as a basis for subjecting jurisdictions to preclearance under Section 5.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because of the
       <i>
        Shelby County
       </i>
       decision, the United States Attorney General is not making any determinations under Section 5 on voting or election changes made by states.
   The Supreme Court did not strike down Section 5, so it is still in effect.
   For that reason, the Mississippi Attorney General’s Office submitted Chapter 361, Laws of 2013, to the United States Attorney General, in order to technically meet the requirements of Section 5 and fulfill the condition in the effective date of the bill, which will allow the bill to take effect.
      </p>
      <p>
       By letter dated October 22, 2013, the United States Attorney General responded that he is not making determinations on the merits of any bill that is submitted under Section 5. The submission of Chapter 361 and the response from the United States Attorney General technically met the requirements of Section 5 and fulfilled the condition in the effective date of Chapter 361, so Chapter 361 became effective from and after October 22, 2013, the date of the United States Attorney General’s response letter.

      When hereafter any county of the state shall become eligible by reason of the growth in population, in assessed valuation and the existence therein of a municipality of the number of inhabitants all as specified in Section 9-9-1 of this chapter, it shall be the duty of the Governor, upon the determination by him of the facts aforesaid, to issue his public proclamation establishing a county court in the said county, and calling an election on a date to be fixed in said proclamation for the election of a county judge. The term of office of a county judge elected under this section and Section 9-9-39 shall expire thereafter at the same time at which there expires the regular terms of circuit judges and chancellors. When in the last year of any four-year judicial period any county has fallen below the requirements of eligibility as stated in Section 9-9-1 of this chapter, it shall be the duty of the Governor so to ascertain and proclaim, thereupon after the expiration of the then four-year term, the county court shall cease to exist in such county, unless by an election held under the provisions of Section 9-9-39 the said court be retained or reestablished.

       Mississippi justice courts and the circuit courts shared concurrent jurisdiction in matters in which the amount in controversy exceeded $200 but not $2,500. Arant v. Hubbard, 824 So. 2d 611, 2002 Miss. LEXIS 257 (Miss. 2002).
      </p>
      <p>
       The appearance of the defendant before a justice of the peace cures a defective service of summons. Helmer Bros. v. Hastings, 142 Miss. 403, 107 So. 551, 1926 Miss. LEXIS 95 (Miss. 1926).
      </p>
      <p>
       A justice of the peace may suspend business to try a criminal case and render a valid judgment by default at the same term by resuming the business of his court. Welch v. Hannie, 112 Miss. 79, 72 So. 861, 1916 Miss. LEXIS 69 (Miss. 1916).
      </p>
      <p>
       Under a municipal charter which provides for an additional justice of the peace for the town, the civil jurisdiction of such justice under the general law is not limited by a provision of the charter that the mayor and councilmen may fix penalties for violations of the charter or ordinances, the offense to be ascertained by trial before the mayor or justice of the peace for the town. Matthews v. Cotton, 83 Miss. 472, 35 So. 937, 1903 Miss. LEXIS 66 (Miss. 1903).
      </p>
      <p>
       The civil jurisdiction of justices of the peace was conferred by constitutional grant and not by legislation. Illinois C. R. Co. v. Brookhaven Mach. Co., 71 Miss. 663, 16 So. 252, 1893 Miss. LEXIS 87 (Miss. 1893).
      </p>
      <p>
       The jurisdiction embraces suits “founded on any penal statute,” although these words, which appear in the corresponding section of Code 1857 p. 405, were not brought forward in the Codes of 1871, 1880 and 1892. Western Union Tel. Co. v. Sullivan, 70 Miss. 447, 12 So. 460, 1892 Miss. LEXIS 127 (Miss. 1892).

      <p>
       Jurisdiction of justice of peace is determined by amount demanded in good faith in pleadings. Simpson County v. Furlow, 160 Miss. 232, 134 So. 146, 1931 Miss. LEXIS 184 (Miss. 1931).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where plaintiff filed statement charging defendant with $200 for killing horse and $10 for killing yearling, and judgment was entered for $110, justice of the peace had no jurisdiction. Simpson County v. Furlow, 160 Miss. 232, 134 So. 146, 1931 Miss. LEXIS 184 (Miss. 1931).
      </p>
      <p>
       Test as to jurisdictional amount in controversy is determined at time of filing suit. Catchot v. Russell, 160 Miss. 330, 134 So. 140, 1931 Miss. LEXIS 180 (Miss. 1931).
      </p>
      <p>
       The amount honestly claimed by plaintiff determines jurisdiction. Betts v. Falgo, 126 Miss. 252, 88 So. 636, 1921 Miss. LEXIS 31 (Miss. 1921).
      </p>
      <p>
       The amount that a tenant may owe for the rent of a place does not determine the jurisdiction of the justice of the peace to dispossess said tenant on the ground he is in default of rent. Simpson v. Boykin, 118 Miss. 701, 79 So. 852, 1918 Miss. LEXIS 123 (Miss. 1918), overruled,
   Jackson v. Schwartz, 240 So. 2d 60, 1970 Miss. LEXIS 1267 (Miss. 1970).
      </p>
      <p>
       A tenant remanding the case of his landlord to the justice court because of want of jurisdiction cannot afterwards in the same case be heard to contend that the amount sued for is over $200.00. Weatherall v. Brown, 113 Miss. 887, 74 So. 765, 1917 Miss. LEXIS 161 (Miss. 1917).
      </p>
      <p>
       Items denied by the defendant and eliminated from the account which reduces amount originally claimed below $200.00 gives the justice of the peace jurisdiction of the case. Kantrovitz v. McNeill, 110 Miss. 873, 71 So. 13, 1916 Miss. LEXIS 220 (Miss. 1916).
      </p>
      <p>
       The value of the property honestly claimed in the affidavit determines the jurisdiction of the justice of the peace regardless of the findings of the jury as to its value. Johnson v. Tabor, 101 Miss. 78, 57 So. 365, 1911 Miss. LEXIS 101 (Miss. 1911).
      </p>
      <p>
       A compromise with one carrier as co-defendant, which reduces the amount sued for below the jurisdiction of the circuit court, deprives that court of jurisdiction. Mobile, J. & K. C. R. Co. v. Hitt & Rutherford, 99 Miss. 679, 55 So. 484, 1911 Miss. LEXIS 237 (Miss. 1911).
      </p>
      <p>
       The demand, where honestly made, fixes and determines the amount in controversy. Fenn v. Harrington, 54 Miss. 733, 1877 Miss. LEXIS 91 (Miss. 1877); Ross v. Natchez, J. & C. R. Co., 61 Miss. 12, 1883 Miss. LEXIS 61 (Miss. 1883); Griffin v. McDaniel, 63 Miss. 121, 1885 Miss. LEXIS 29 (Miss. 1885).
      </p>
      <p>
       The principal of the debt at the time suit is brought, after deducting credits if any, is the test of jurisdiction. Martin v. Harden, 52 Miss. 694, 1876 Miss. LEXIS 276 (Miss. 1876).

      </p>
      <p>
       The principal amount in controversy, exclusive of the interest, determines jurisdiction. Wainwright v. Atkins, 104 Miss. 438, 61 So. 454, 1913 Miss. LEXIS 49 (Miss. 1913).
      </p>
      <p>
       In suits on penal bonds, jurisdiction is determined by the amount of damages honestly claimed. Shattuck v. Miller, 50 Miss. 386, 1874 Miss. LEXIS 71 (Miss. 1874); State v. Luckey, 51 Miss. 528, 1875 Miss. LEXIS 74 (Miss. 1875).
      </p>
      <p>
       In computing the amount in controversy, costs, damages and interest are excluded. N. O., J. & G. N. R. Co. v. Evans, 49 Miss. 785, 1874 Miss. LEXIS 13 (Miss. 1874); Jackson v. Whitfield, 51 Miss. 202, 1875 Miss. LEXIS 35 (Miss. 1875).

      <p>
       Where agreed percentage of principal and interest added as attorney’s fee to face of note, excluding interest, exceeded $200, circuit court had jurisdiction, attorney’s fee being part of “principal amount in controversy.” Catchot v.

      </p>
      <p>
       The stipulation in a promissory note for 10% added for attorney’s fees makes the attorney part of the cause of action in determining the amount sued for. Parks v. Granger, 96 Miss. 503, 51 So. 716, 1910 Miss. LEXIS 189 (Miss. 1910).

   A justice court is a “court of record” as contemplated by §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.99.html#t99c15s99-15-17" target="_blank">99-15-17</a></cite>; thus, appointed counsel who was representing indigent defendants at preliminary hearings in justice court was not limited to a fee of $200 per case plus out-of-pocket expenses. Gibson v. Board of Supervisors, 656 So. 2d 312, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 275 (Miss. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       A justice of the peace court is a court of record and has inherent power to correct clerical errors at any time and to make the judgment entry correspond with the judgment rendered, and this power exists in criminal prosecutions as well as in civil cases. Kitchens v. State, 253 Miss. 734, 179 So. 2d 13, 1965 Miss. LEXIS 1040 (Miss. 1965).
      </p>
      <p>
       Circuit court has jurisdiction of both subject-matter and parties, on appeal with supersedeas, from default judgment by justice of the peace, in summary proceeding under Code 1942 § 948, to obtain possession of real property rendered on invalid service of process, although justice of the peace had jurisdiction only of subject-matter when default judgment was rendered. McCoy v. McRae, 204 Miss. 309, 37 So. 2d 353, 1948 Miss. LEXIS 368 (Miss. 1948).
      </p>
      <p>
       Neither justice of the peace, nor circuit court on appeal, in proceeding under Code 1942 § 948, have any jurisdiction to make final and conclusive adjudication of title to property involved. McCoy v. McRae, 204 Miss. 309, 37 So. 2d 353, 1948 Miss. LEXIS 368 (Miss. 1948).
      </p>
      <p>
       The rule that continuances rest in the sound discretion of the trial court, subject to review upon appeal only for abuse of discretion, cannot apply to courts of justices of the peace for the reason that upon appeal to the circuit court such cases are tried there de novo. Gardner v. Price, 199 Miss. 809, 25 So. 2d 459, 1946 Miss. LEXIS 249 (Miss. 1946).
      </p>
      <p>
       Court of justice of peace is court of record and of general jurisdiction. Simpson v. Phillips, 164 Miss. 256, 141 So. 897, 1932 Miss. LEXIS 208 (Miss. 1932).
      </p>
      <p>
       The presumption of law is that justice of peace court, as a court of record, had sufficient proof before it before rendering judgment. Simpson v. Phillips, 164 Miss. 256, 141 So. 897, 1932 Miss. LEXIS 208 (Miss. 1932).

      <p>
       A justice of the peace whose district is partly in two circuit court districts of the county may hold his court in either or both districts and will have entire jurisdiction of persons within his district, but appeals from his court to the circuit court must be to the circuit court of the district in which the suit is tried. Woods v. Speer, 127 Miss. 593, 90 So. 322, 1921 Miss. LEXIS 262 (Miss. 1921).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a justice of the peace has two regular places in his district and alternates in holding his terms of court on certain days at specific places, a writ of garnishment on judgment rendered at one place may be returnable to the next regular term of his court at said place, although a regular intervening term of court may be held at the other place. Edwards v. Kingston Lumber Co., 92 Miss. 598, 46 So. 69, 1908 Miss. LEXIS 207 (Miss. 1908).
      </p>
      <p>
       A justice must hold his court within the district for which he was elected and is without jurisdiction to hold it elsewhere. State v. Tate, 77 Miss. 469, 27 So. 619, 1899 Miss. LEXIS 88 (Miss. 1899).
      </p>
      <p>
       Perjury cannot be predicated on false swearing before a justice assuming to hold court without his district. State v. Tate, 77 Miss. 469, 27 So. 619, 1899 Miss. LEXIS 88 (Miss. 1899).

      </p>
      <p>
       Although a justice may continue to hold court from day to day following his regular court day, so long as business may require, he must hold regular terms, and an adjournment of his court from a regular court day to a day other than his next regular court day on the mistaken idea that the day of adjournment is a legal holiday is unauthorized and a judgment by default rendered on the day to which he so adjourned is void. Alabama G. S. R. Co. v. Dalton, 86 Miss. 299, 38 So. 285, 1905 Miss. LEXIS 21 (Miss. 1905).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the plaintiff’s attorney caused the defendant’s attorney to act upon the belief that a case would be continued at the next term of the justice’s court, a judgment taken by plaintiff himself at said term in the absence of the defendant and his attorney is fraudulent and after the defendant without fault has lost the right to appeal it will be enjoined and a new trial granted in equity, although the plaintiff’s attorney had no intent to deceive.

       Default judgment against garnishee, entered by justice of peace after service of garnishee summons, not specifying time and place for hearing, held void and ineffective. Swift & Co. v. Fox, 163 Miss. 783, 141 So. 277, 1932 Miss. LEXIS 86 (Miss. 1932).
      </p>

       Summons issued and returnable, not to regular term of justice court, but to special day, is not void, but merely irregular. McCormick Motor Car Co. v. McDonald, 153 Miss. 409, 121 So. 121, 1929 Miss. LEXIS 40 (Miss. 1929).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where summons was returnable to a past day which was an impossible date, and the law did not fix the time or place of the next term, such matters being left to the discretion and convenience of the justice of the peace, the judgment rendered pursuant thereto was void. Howell v. Kersh, 152 Miss. 266, 119 So. 186, 1928 Miss. LEXIS 254 (Miss. 1928).
      </p>
      <p>
       A judgment of a justice, unless against a non-resident or transient person as authorized by this section, upon less than five days’ service of process, is void. Comenitz v. Bank of Commerce, 85 Miss. 662, 38 So. 35, 1904 Miss. LEXIS 178 (Miss. 1904), overruled,
   Bank of Philadelphia v. Posey, 130 Miss. 530, 92 So. 840, 1922 Miss. LEXIS 176 (Miss. 1922).
      </p>
      <p>
       A judgment of a justice in a civil case against two or more defendants is an entirety and being void as to one is void as to all. Comenitz v. Bank of Commerce, 85 Miss. 662, 38 So. 35, 1904 Miss. LEXIS 178 (Miss. 1904), overruled,
   Bank of Philadelphia v. Posey, 130 Miss. 530, 92 So. 840, 1922 Miss. LEXIS 176 (Miss. 1922).
      </p>
      <p>
       On appeal of a case involving a non-resident wherein the trial at a “reasonable time” is left to the decision of the justice, the circuit court cannot dismiss the case on the ground that reasonable notice was not given, but will try it anew on its merits.

       Justice court judge’s receiving a criminal defendant’s bond and loaning bond money to other defendants was willful, or at least negligent, misconduct which he knew or should have known was beyond legitimate exercise of his legal authority and constituted judicial misconduct, even though judge’s handling of money was limited to a few occasions, and there was no evidence that he materially benefited from collection of fine money.

       It is improper for a justice court judge to handle money in lieu of court clerk handling money. Mississippi Comm'n on Judicial Performance v. Dodds, 680 So. 2d 180, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 425 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       A justice court judge should undertake the responsibility of personally receiving fine money only in isolated and clearly necessitous circumstances. If such an extreme occasions arises, the judge must give a written receipt, keep the money segregated and apart from his or her own, and at the very first opportunity deliver it to the justice court clerk with an explanation of why the judge received it personally. Mississippi Judicial Performance Com. v. Justice Court Judge, 580 So. 2d 1259, 1991 Miss. LEXIS 303 (Miss. 1991).

       The responsibility to oversee the everyday administrative duties of the justice court clerk lies with the board of supervisors and may not be delegated to the justice court judge; the justice court judge has the authority to oversee the duties of the justice court clerk and deputy clerks with respect to the conducting of trials and hearings, but such authority does not extend to the administrative level; the board of supervisors may seek advice from the justice court judge on matters concerning the operation of the justice court, but any policy making decisions with regards to the operation of the justice court clerk’s office should be made by the board of supervisors.

       There is nothing in statutes specifically requiring justice court clerk to attend court and to record all proceedings; however, it is duty of justice court clerk under Miss.

      </p>
      <p>
       Legislative intent of Section 9-11-27 is to allow Justice Court Clerk to operate independently or without judicial direction as to execution of her specific statutory duties; thus, while board of supervisors has administrative supervision over Justice Court Clerk, Justice Court Judge may direct clerk in carrying out of such duties and tasks as are necessary to actual conduct of trials. Tucker, Feb. 2, 1994, A.G. Op. #93-0997.

       Officer was sworn in by a justice court judge to fulfill the duties of a justice court deputy clerk in June 2015, and he was acting as a de facto officer and possessed the requisite authority to administer the oath and swear to the charging affidavit; therefore, any defects that may have existed in the appointment of the officer did not negate that he was acting under the color of appointment at the time he issued defendant’s affidavit.

       Section 9-11-33 does not give a justice court judge the authority to set aside a not guilty verdict from a criminal charge. Furthermore, any attempt to retry a defendant for a crime in which he has already been found not guilty would constitute double jeopardy. Nash, April 26, 1996, A.G. Op. # 96-0278.

       A justice court judge may correct errors or set aside judgments in cases conducted before such judge but does not have authority to set aside or modify a judgment in a case heard before another judge. Cooper, July 3, 1997, A.G. Op. #97-0378.

     <p>
      The circuit judge, chancellor, family court judge or county judge may, by an order spread upon the minutes and made a part of the records of the court, appoint an additional court reporter for a term or part of a term whose duties, qualifications and compensation shall be the same as is now provided by law for official court reporters. The additional court reporter shall be subject to the control of the judge or chancellor, as is now provided by law for official court reporters, and the judge or chancellor shall have the additional power to terminate the appointment of such additional court reporter, whenever in his opinion the necessity for such an additional court reporter ceases to exist, by placing upon the minutes of the court an order to that effect. The regular court reporter shall not draw any compensation while the assistant court reporter alone is serving; however, in the event the assistant court reporter is serving because of the illness of the regular court reporter, the court may authorize payment of said assistant court reporter from the Administrative Office of Courts without diminution of the salary of the regular court reporter, for a period not to exceed forty-five (45) days in any one (1) calendar year. However, in any circuit, chancery, county or family court district within the State of Mississippi, if the judge or chancellor shall determine that in order to relieve the continuously crowded docket in such district, or for other good cause shown, the appointment of an additional court reporter is necessary for the proper administration of justice, he may, with the advice and consent of the board of supervisors if the court district is composed of a single county and with the advice and consent of at least one-half (1/2) of the boards of supervisors if the court district is composed of more than one (1) county, by an order spread upon the minutes and made a part of the records of the court, appoint an additional court reporter. The additional court reporter shall serve at the will and pleasure of the judge or chancellor, may be a resident of any county of the state, and shall be paid a salary designated by the judge or chancellor not to exceed the salary authorized by Section 9-13-19. The salary of the additional court reporter shall be paid by the Administrative Office of Courts, as provided in Section 9-13-19; and mileage shall be paid to the additional court reporter by the county as provided in the same section. The office of such additional court reporter appointed under this section shall not be abolished or compensation reduced during the term of office of the appointing judge or chancellor without the consent and approval of the appointing judge or chancellor.

      <li id="t09c13s9-13-19ol11">
       Court reporters for circuit and chancery courts may be paid an annual salary payable by the Administrative Office of Courts not to exceed Forty-nine Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($49,500.00) for court reporters with five (5) years’ experience or less; not to exceed Fifty-eight Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($58,500.00) for court reporters who have more than five (5) years’experience but less than ten (10) years; and not to exceed Sixty-four Thousand Dollars ($64,000,00) for court reporters who have ten (10) years or more experience. No amount of the increase in the maximum salary authorized by this section shall be paid from the State General Fund. The board of supervisors of any county is authorized to pay its court reporters the applicable amount of the maximum salary authorized by this section. In addition, any court reporter performing the duties of a court administrator in the same judicial district in which the person is employed as a court reporter may be paid additional compensation for performing the court administrator duties. The annual amount of the additional compensation shall be set by vote of the judges and chancellors for whom the court administrator duties are performed, with consideration given to the number of hours per month devoted by the court reporter to performing the duties of a court administrator. The additional compensation shall be submitted to the Administrative Office of Courts for approval.
      </li>
      <li id="t09c13s9-13-19ol12">
       The several counties in each respective court district shall transfer from the general funds of those county treasuries to the Administrative Office of Courts a proportionate amount to be paid toward the annual compensation of the court reporter, including any additional compensation paid for the performance of court administrator duties. The amount to be paid by each county shall be determined by the number of weeks in which court is held in each county in proportion to the total number of weeks court is held in the district. For purposes of this section, the term “compensation” means the gross salary plus all amounts paid for benefits, or otherwise, as a result of employment or as required by employment, but does not include transcript fees otherwise authorized to be paid by or through the counties. However, only salary earned for services rendered shall be reported and credited for retirement purposes. Amounts paid for transcript fees, benefits or otherwise, including reimbursement for travel expenses, shall not be reported or credited for retirement purposes.
       <p>
        For example, if there are thirty-eight (38) scheduled court weeks in a particular district, a county in which court is scheduled five (5) weeks out of the year would have to pay five-thirty-eighths (5/38) of the total annual compensation.
       </p>
      </li>
      <li id="t09c13s9-13-19ol13">
       The salary and any additional compensation for the performance of court administrator duties shall be paid in twelve (12) installments on the last working day of each month after it has been duly authorized by the appointing judge or chancellor and an order duly placed on the minutes of the court. Each county shall transfer to the Administrative Office of Courts one-twelfth (1/12) of the amount required to be paid pursuant to subsection (2) of this section by the twentieth day of each month for the salary that is to be paid on the last working day of the month. The Administrative Office of Courts shall pay to the court reporter the total amount of salary due for that month. Any county may pay, in the discretion of the board of supervisors, by the twentieth day of January of any year, the amount due for a full twelve (12) months.
      </li>
      <li id="t09c13s9-13-19ol14">
       From and after October 1, 1996, all circuit and chancery court reporters will be employees of the Administrative Office of Courts.

      <li id="t09c13s9-13-19ol15">
       No circuit or chancery court reporter shall be entitled to any compensation for any special or extended term of court after passage of this section.

       No chancery or circuit court reporter shall practice law in the court within which he or she is the court reporter.

       For all travel required in the performance of official duties, the circuit or chancery court reporter shall be paid mileage by the county in which the duties were performed at the same rate as provided for state employees in Section 25-3-41. The court reporter shall file in the office of the clerk of the court which he serves a certificate of mileage expense incurred during that term and payment of such expense to the court reporter shall be paid on allowance by the judge of such court.

      The court reporter shall attend each session of the court of the district for which he was appointed, from day to day, and unless the same be waived, shall take, under the control of the judge or chancellor full and complete notes, stenographically (and may use recording machines in aid thereof) of all the oral evidence and other oral proceedings, except arguments of counsel, in each case, civil and criminal, tried therein upon an issue of facts and, in any other matter or in any other case that the judge or chancellor may especially direct. He shall carefully note the order in which the evidence, both oral and written, is introduced, and by whom it is introduced, giving the name of each witness, and identifying each deposition, exhibit made, or other item of evidence or matter of proceedings by words or figures of description, and he shall carefully note oral motions and all objections of counsel and rulings of the court made during the trial, in the order in which the same shall occur. And, upon request of any party, he shall, within the time required by the Mississippi Supreme Court Rules, or from the time of the demand, if made after the trial, neatly write out in typewriting a complete copy of his stenographic notes as taken therein or he shall neatly write out in typewriting a complete copy of all matters recorded on the recording machine with a caption showing the style of the case, its number, the court in which it was tried, and when tried, and shall affix thereto a suitable index, and shall certify, sign, and file the same in the office of the clerk of the court in which the case was tried; and he shall preserve his stenographic notes or his tape or record made by said recording machine in each case in which an appeal is taken, as a record of his office. If a party demand the writing out of the court reporter’s notes for any other than the bona fide purpose of perfecting an appeal, he shall pay the court reporter in advance Twenty-five Cents (25¢) per hundred words for the same, but such work shall not delay the preparation of records for appeals. The court reporter shall serve in all habeas corpus and other matters which are heard in vacation, by agreement or otherwise, in the county of residence of the judge or chancellor. The court is authorized to purchase recording machines for the use of the court reporter, the cost of which shall be allocated to each county in the district according to the weeks of court held in each county. Any recording machine purchased for this purpose shall be of such quality as to accurately take and preserve all notes and records herein required to be made and preserved.

       To exercise its appellate jurisdiction effectively, the Supreme Court must have before it all records necessary for the proper consideration of cases on appeal, and the court can hear and determine all motions and issues necessary for the exercise of its appeal powers and for the enforcement of its orders; since a proper decision of most cases on appeal requires a detailed consideration of the testimony in the trial court, it is futile to require a clerk to file a record that does not include a transcript of the testimony; although Mississippi Code Annotated section 9-13-41 [Repealed] permits a bill of exceptions in the absence of a transcript of the testimony, where the court reporter’s notes are available, a transcription of such notes is preferable and a bill of exceptions is a poor substitute.

      At any time prior to the expiration of the period allowed by law to perfect an appeal to the supreme court, or before the determination of the suit, any party to said suit, or any witness who may have testified therein, may, upon petition duly filed and presented to the court or presented to the trial judge thereof in vacation, and upon ten days notice to the opposite party or parties, or to one of his attorneys of record, in which notice the time and place of the presentation of the petition shall be given, obtain an order from the court or judge authorizing the clerk of the court to permit said petitioning party to withdraw from the clerk’s custody, any exhibit, map or other item of evidence, which may be the property of said party or witness, if in the opinion of the court or judge such withdrawal shall be proper. Provided, however, the party or witness requesting the withdrawal shall cause a true copy of such exhibit, map, or other item of evidence, or matter of proceeding to be made by the clerk, and such clerk shall duly certify to the correctness of the copy, and such party or witness shall pay all fees authorized by law for making such copy and for such certificate; the clerk shall be required to make the copy and certificate upon the payment of such fees. Thereafter such certified copy of said exhibit, map or other item of evidence, or matter of proceedings shall remain in custody of the clerk, and during any hearing or trial of the cause and for all other purposes the duly certified copy of such exhibit, map or item of evidence, or matter of proceeding shall be deemed and considered as the true exhibit, map, item of evidence or matter of proceeding exhibited and introduced in such suit.

     <p>
      In all criminal cases, and (a) in all civil cases, and (b) matters in probate, and (c) in matters of special proceedings, wherein property or demands of as much as Fifty Dollars ($50.00) may be in issue, no party shall be required without his consent to go to trial in a circuit or chancery court unless the case is attended by a court reporter; provided, however, that the judge of any chancery court may dispense with the requirement of a court reporter in hearings on temporary support and maintenance and/or temporary child custody in domestic cases unless one (1) or both of the parties request a court reporter. And in and by means of the court reporter’s shorthand notes, it shall be competent and effectual, for the purposes of appeal and all otherwise, to make of the record every part of the proceedings arising and done during the trial, from the opening until the conclusion thereof, including motions so arising to amend the pleadings, except amendments to indictments, and the ruling of the court thereon and all other motions and steps that may occur in the trial, in addition to the oral testimony. And in such a trial, provided objections are duly made and noted, no exceptions need be taken, either for the purposes of appeal or otherwise, or if taken shall not be noted, to any ruling or decision of the court, and this provision shall include the rulings of a court on objections to testimony. If any ruling or decision of the court as to any matter arising during the trial appear in the copy of the court reporter’s notes, it shall not be necessary to take any exceptions or bill of exceptions thereto. Exceptions and bills of exception shall be necessary only when it is desired to reserve exceptions to some ruling or decision of the court which would not otherwise appear of record. No bill of exceptions need be taken to the action of the court in overruling a motion for a new trial. In all cases tried either in the circuit or chancery court in which the evidence is taken down by an official court reporter, all pleadings and all papers filed or introduced in the case, all orders of the court entered on the minutes, all instructions and a copy of the court reporter’s notes shall constitute the record and no bill of exceptions shall be necessary in order to make any of the above matters part of the record.

       Language of statute which authorizes county to pay its pro rata share of costs and to receive grants, gifts, donations or federal funds for benefit of court administrator’s office, is to empower county to lawfully expend funds for court administrator’s office, and was not intended to give county option of withdrawing from its obligation of paying its pro rata share of costs of court administrator’s office.

   Although the Mississippi Administrative Office of the Courts (AOC) receives federal funding for certain programs, its purpose under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t09c21s9-21-1" target="_self">9-21-1</a></cite> is to assist in administration of the nonjudicial business of the state courts. Therefore, bribes which were allegedly paid by an attorney to two circuit judges to influence the outcome of cases filed in their courts were not connected with the transactions or business of the AOC, and thus their convictions of federal program bribery under 18 U.S.C.S. § 666 were erroneous.

      “Non-English speaker” means any party or witness who cannot readily understand or communicate in spoken English and who consequently cannot equally participate in or benefit from the proceedings unless an interpreter is available to assist the individual. The fact that a person for whom English is a second language knows some English does not prohibit that individual from being allowed to have an interpreter.

       The Legislature recognizes that our military veterans have provided an invaluable service to our country. In doing so, many may have suffered the effects of, including, but not limited to, post-traumatic stress disorder, traumatic brain injury and depression, and may also suffer drug and alcohol dependency or addiction and co-occurring mental illness and substance abuse problems. As a result of this, some veterans come into contact with the criminal justice system and are charged with felony offenses. There is a critical need for the justice system to recognize these veterans, provide accountability for their wrongdoing, provide for the safety of the public, and provide for the treatment of our veterans. It is the intent of the Legislature to create a framework for which specialized veterans treatment courts may be established at the circuit court level and at the discretion of the circuit court judge.
      </li>
      <li id="t09c25s9-25-1ol12">
       Authorization.— A circuit court judge may establish a Veterans Treatment Court program. The Veterans Treatment Court may, at the discretion of the circuit court judge, be a separate court program or as a component of an existing drug court program. At the discretion of the circuit court judge, the Veterans Treatment Court may be operated in one (1) county within the circuit court district, and allow veteran participants from all counties within the circuit court district to participate.
      </li>
      <li id="t09c25s9-25-1ol13">
       Eligibility.— (a)In order to be eligible to participate in a Veterans Treatment Court program established under this section, the attorney representing the state must consent to the defendant’s participation in the program.
