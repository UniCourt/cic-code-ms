   In a products liability/negligence suit, the court reserved judgment on whether expert testimony as to whether Occupational Safety and Health Administration standards had been violated should be admitted under Fed. R. Evid. 702 with regard to whether a ladder that provided access to an industrial machine was defectively designed; under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c01s71-1-1ol1f" target="_self">71-1-1(f)</a></cite>, OSHA regulations did not have compulsory force on the issue of defective design. Walker v.

       Evidence of regulations promulgated under Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) is not admissible to show negligence. Sumrall v. Mississippi Power Co., 693 So. 2d 359, 1997 Miss. LEXIS 82 (Miss. 1997).

       Trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to allow evidence of Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) violations to impeach witness after trial court had in general refused to allow evidence of OSHA regulations, in negligence action brought by employee of contractor retained by electric utility to install new fly ash pond discharge structure for coal-burning facility against utility, arising from injuries allegedly suffered while working in trench; there was little doubt that true intent of counsel for employee was not to impeach witness’ credibility but, rather, to present evidence of OSHA violations which he could not introduce otherwise.

       With respect to what constitutes work in a mill or manufacturing establishment, use of same language in Child Labor Statute (Code 1942, § 6987) as in Hours of Labor Statute in same chapter of code is persuasive of legislative intent that the same construction should be put on Child Labor Statute as on other statute, else different phraseology would have been inserted.

       Under Laws 1912, ch. 157 [Code 1942, § 6986] working employees in a manufacturing establishment for more than ten hours in any one day constitutes only one offense. Buckeye Cotton Oil Co. v. State, 103 Miss. 767, 60 So. 775, 1912 Miss. LEXIS 230 (Miss. 1912).

       Whether an employee works more than ten hours a day depends upon the fact whether during the hours he is not actually working, he is confined to precincts of the establishment, charged with some responsibility for operation of the machinery.

     <p>
      A trust of real or personal property, or real and personal property combined, created either heretofore or hereafter by an employer as part of a pension plan, disability or death benefit plan, or profit-sharing plan for the exclusive benefit of some or all of his or its employees, to which contributions are made by such employer or employees, or both, for the purpose of distributing to such employees the earnings and the principal of such trust, shall not be deemed to be invalid as violating any existing laws against perpetuities, restraints on alienation, suspension of the power of alienation, or the accumulation of income; but such a trust may continue for such time as may be necessary to accomplish the purpose for which it may be created.
     </p>
     <p>
      No trust of real or personal property, or real and personal property combined, created either heretofore or hereafter under a retirement plan for which provision has been made under the laws of the United States of America exempting such trust from federal income tax shall be deemed to be invalid as violating any existing laws against perpetuities, restraints on alienation, suspension of the power of alienation of title to property, or the accumulation of income; but such a trust may continue for such time as may be necessary to accomplish the purposes for which it may be created, may be permitted to accumulate the income arising from the property held therein until such time as such income shall become distributable to the beneficiary or beneficiaries under the terms of the trust, may according to its terms be made irrevocable, and the interests of its beneficiary or beneficiaries therein may be made nontransferable by assignment or otherwise.

       Workers’ Compensation Act contemplates three-party agreement among employer, employee, and compensation insurance carrier. Although employer is considered to be insured party, Act views employee as intended beneficiary of insurance contract. Thus, when employer-insured contracts with insurer for benefit of its employee-third party beneficiary, insurer owes same duty to designate a third party as it owes to insured, entity which actually makes contract.

       An employee’s injury did not arise out of and in the course of his employment as a sack boy at a grocery store where the injury occurred when a firecracker which the employee had been given by another worker exploded in his hand, and the store had a policy of no foul play, which included fireworks, so that the employee’s conduct was against the rules of the business; the accident and injury were the result of the employee’s own misuse of and involvement with an object which was prohibited and outside the scope of the employee’s employment, and therefore the injury sustained was not compensable.

   A route salesman who stopped to assist an apparently disabled motorist and who was rendered permanently and totally disabled when the motorist struck him with a gun was entitled to workmen’s compensation, despite the employer’s contention that his injuries did not arise out of and in the course of his employment within the meaning of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c03s71-3-3ol1b" target="_self">71-3-3(b)</a></cite>; an employer may reasonably foresee that his traveling employee will stop to aid a distressed motorist when implored to do so, and since the present claimant’s injury resulted from a humanitarian act which was literally thrown into his path because of his employment, the employee was entitled to compensation. The singular purpose pervading the Workmen’s Compensation Act is to promote the welfare of laborers within the state, and it should be construed fairly to further its humanitarian aims.

   Mississippi Workers’ Compensation Commission’s decision that a worker suffered an accidental injury, pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c03s71-3-3ol1b" target="_self">71-3-3(b)</a></cite>, within the course and scope of the worker’s employment, pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c03s71-3-1ol13" target="_self">71-3-1(3)</a></cite>, was not contrary to the overwhelming weight of the evidence because, although no one saw the worker pick a tire up and injure the worker’s back, the worker informed the worker’s supervisor immediately following the injury, and the supervisor testified that the worker emerged from beneath a van, stood up, and stated that the worker’s back was bothering the worker. The only contradictory evidence presented was by the store manager, who claimed that the worker never said that the worker hurt the worker’s back; however, the manager did admit that the worker complained of the worker’s back hurting, and the administrative judge found that the testimony of the worker was definitely more credible than that of the store manager.

       The evidence was sufficient to support the Workers’ Compensation Commission’s finding that an employee’s mental disability was caused by a deliberate course of conduct by his employer and that there was nothing in his psychological background to suggest a pre-existing personality disorder, so that the stresses to which the employee was subjected were “more than the ordinary incidents of employment” and were “untoward events or unusual occurrences” culminating in his subsequent disability, where a psychiatrist who treated the employee for over 2 years testified that the employee was psychologically disabled and that his work played a significant part in causing it, and testimony from the employee, the employee’s wife, and fellow employees established a protracted pattern by the employer to put pressure and stress upon the employee.

       A doctor’s inability to pinpoint the exact physical cause of an employee’s disability did not alone defeat the employee’s claim for compensation, given the beneficent purpose of the Workers’ Compensation Act, where there was uncontradicted testimony that the employee was injured while performing his job and that he was totally and permanently disabled.

       The test of recovery under Workmen’s Compensation Law is not a causal relation between the nature of employment of the injured person and the accident, nor is it necessary that the employee be engaged at the time of the injury in activity of benefit to his employer, and all that is required is that the obligations or conditions of employment create a zone of special danger out of which the injury arose.

       A defendant who has successfully defended an action for personal injuries resulting from a beating the plaintiff received from defendant’s foreman, on the ground that the relationship of employer-employee existed between defendant and plaintiff, cannot thereafter challenge the applicability of the Workmen’s Compensation Law to the plaintiff’s claim; provided claim for benefits is timely filed within the time extended by Code 1942, § 6998-18(c) beginning with the date of the order dismissing plaintiff’s appeal.

   In a Title VII racial discrimination case in which an employee’s claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress was not barred by the three-year limitation period in Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.15.html#t15c01s15-1-49" target="_blank">15-1-49</a></cite>, the claim nonetheless failed since a claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress did not arise from acts of intentional discrimination. Furthermore, any state tort claim grounded in negligence asserted by the employee would be barred by the exclusive remedy provision of the Mississippi Workers' Compensation Law. Fortenberry v.

       A pipeline operator which contracted with an injured welder’s employer for the construction of a pipeline was not immune from tort liability on the ground of the “statutory employer” defense; since the pipeline operator was not a “contractor,” and because the employer had secured compensation for the welder’s benefit, the Workers’ Compensation Act imposed no duty on the pipeline operator and, accordingly, the pipeline operator enjoyed no benefits under the Act. The pipeline operator could not gain tort immunity by assuming compensation obligations which in fact and in law it did not have. Magee v.

       Employee’s injury was compensable under the Workers’ Compensation Act because the Act was to be construed liberally in favor of claimants and because there was no doubt that a doctor’s expert medical opinion supported the Workers’ Compensation Commission’s decision regarding the employee’s injury; while there was a conflict in expert medical opinion, the appellate court was not permitted to resolve conflicts in the evidence based on its mandated presumption that the commission resolved all such conflicts.

       A person performing work as part of his sentence for a criminal conviction is not an “employee” according to this definition as there is no “contract of hire”. Donald, Nov. 20, 1991, A.G. Op. #91-0866.
      </p>
      <p>
       Juror does not serve under “any contract of hire or apprenticeship” under Miss. Code Section 71-3-3(d); juror is required to perform jury duty by law and not by any contract with state or county; therefore, jurors are not covered by Workers’ Compensation Act. Trapp, Mar. 12, 1993, A.G. Op. #93-0133.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pursuant to Section 71-3-3(d), individuals serving as members on a board and receiving travel expenses and per diem are simply being reimbursed for their expenses and are not receiving compensation for their services to that board. Thus, those individuals are not considered employees for purposes of workers’ compensation. Ranck, October 13, 1995, A.G. Op. #95-0691.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even though individuals are elected rather than hired under a contract
   of employment, elected officials receive a salary and perform official duties on behalf of the municipality, and this being the case, are to be considered “employees” of the municipality for purposes of workers’ compensation coverage. Tullos, Dec. 19, 2003, A.G. Op. 03-0580.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the absence of any compensation, volunteer firemen are not “employees” of the municipality, and would not be entitled to workers’ compensation coverage. However, whether the volunteer is compensated by the municipality should not be the sole consideration, and the situation in each municipality should be reviewed independently. Tullos, Dec. 19, 2003, A.G. Op. 03-0580.
      </p>
      <p>
       A contract worker who falls within the statutory definition of “employee”, as provided in Section 71-3-3, would be considered an employee for purposes of workers’ compensation coverage. Walker, Nov. 10, 2006, A.G. Op. 06-0563.

       Substantial evidence supported the finding of the Mississippi Worker’s Compensation Commission that the employee, a 61-year-old heavy equipment operator, was permanently and totally disabled due to spinal stenosis and related complications. While the medical evidence was in dispute as to whether he had suffered a total or partial permanent injury, it was a dispute to be resolved by the Commission; the Commission chose to credit a primary treating physician’s assessment that the employee could not hold any type job, and that assessment was corroborated by the employee’s testimony as well as the employer’s statement to the Mississippi Public Employees Retirement System that the employee was totally disabled. Pike County Bd. of Supervisors v. Varnado, 912 So. 2d 477, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 233 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 921 So. 2d 344, 2005 Miss. LEXIS 668 (Miss. 2005).

       Where claimant suffered a single injury in 1981 and the injury gradually worsened and progressed to a permanent injury which manifested itself as a total disability in July 1993, the rate of compensation should be based on Johnson’s salary and/or wages for July 1993.

       Both the 10 percent penalty imposed for failure to pay an installment of compensation payable without an award within 14 days after it becomes due, and the 20 percent penalty for failure to pay an installment payable under the terms of an award within 14 days after it becomes due, could be imposed upon the same installments of compensation, so that when an employer failed to pay a judgment within 14 days after the award became final, the 20 percent penalty applied to the judgment, which consisted of vested installments together with interest and the 10 percent penalty, as well as to installments due after the award.

      </p>
      <p>
       Compensation may be allowed for disabling pain in the absence of positive medical testimony as to any physical cause whatever. When the patient complains of pain, the doctor usually takes the fact of pain for granted and the absence of physical findings to account for the pain will not necessarily bar compensation. In such cases, evidence of an accident followed by disabling pain and the absence of evidence as to the cause of the pain from objective medical findings may be sufficient as a basis for compensation, in the absence of circumstances tending to show malingering or indicating that the claimant’s testimony as to pain is inherently improbable, incredible, unreasonable or untrustworthy. However, there is a great potential for abuse in claims which are based predominantly upon pain reported by the patient, particularly in circumstances where the patient’s testimony or statement to the physician is the sole evidence of its continued presence. In these cases, it would be prudent to obtain additional medical evidence to either support or dispute the claim. Morris v. Lansdell's Frame Co., 547 So. 2d 782, 1989 Miss. LEXIS 336 (Miss. 1989).

       In work-connected injury cases where the evidence establishes (a) successive injuries experienced by the employee where following the first injury the employee engages in full-time employment for a substantial period of time prior to the second injury; or (b) a preexisting (symptomatic or asymptomatic) condition which causes the employee to experience no pre-injury occupational disability, apportionment may not be ordered. On the other hand, in cases where (a) there is evidence of a medically cognizable, identifiable, symptomatic condition which antedated the injury; and (b) the employee experienced some absence of normal (for him or her) wage earning capacity, then apportionment must be ordered.

       The onset of an employee’s essential tremors arose out of and in the course of employment where a cold tablet purchased from her employer exacerbated her pre-existing congenital condition and contributed to the onset of her essential tremor; the employer gained the benefits of lessening absenteeism due to illness by distributing the medication and, by memoranda, the employer suggested to its employees that they avail themselves of the medication provided at the employer’s first-aid station.

   Mississippi Workers’ Compensation Commission improperly applied the relevant law to the question of whether the death of a truck driver, who was shot and killed by a bar patron after both left a bar where the truck driver had been drinking for 11 hours, was “because of” his employment under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c03s71-3-3ol1b" target="_self">71-3-3(b)</a></cite>; his death was not a result of his employment and it was not compensable. Total Transp., Inc. v. Shores, 968 So. 2d 400, 2007 Miss. LEXIS 525 (Miss. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       A circuit court judgment affirming the Workers’ Compensation Commission’s denial of benefits to a deceased employee’s children was not supported by substantial evidence and would be reversed where the onset of the employee’s death occurred at her place of employment and the employer failed to rebut the presumption that the employee’s work activities did not cause or contribute to the condition from which she died; the unrebutted “found dead” legal presumption prevailed, satisfying the causal connection between the employee’s work duties and the condition which resulted in her death. Nettles v. Gulf City Fisheries, 629 So. 2d 554, 1993 Miss. LEXIS 545 (Miss. 1993).
      </p>

       The Workers’ Compensation Commission’s apportionment of an award of death benefits by 2/3 on the basis of pre-existing health conditions was supported by substantial evidence where the worker, who died of a heart attack arising out of and in the course of his employment, had smoked 3 packs of cigarettes daily since his teenage years and consumed approximately “1/2 bottle of alcohol” daily for an unspecified number of years, and his family had a history of heart-related problems.

       Workers’ Compensation Commission’s decision that the child was not a dependent of the decedent and thus not entitled to an award of death benefits was supported by substantial evidence; because of the child’s age (26-years old) and marital status (married), an award of death benefits to her would not be proper unless she was wholly dependent on the decedent, and given the myriad income sources available to and used by the child, the appellate court could hardly view the receipt of such income as sporadic or insubstantial.

       Workers Compensation Commission, on remand, erred in holding that an employee successfully rebutted the presumption that she was entitled to no permanent disability as a result of her brief return to accommodated employment because the employee returned to work at the employer full-time with the same job duties and expectations as before and with no accommodations for over seven months, neither the employee’s for-cause termination nor her lack of a more advanced degree related to any incapacity to earn wages “because of injury,” and the employee failed to present substantial evidence to rebut the presumption that she sustained no loss of wage-earning capacity.

      <p>
       Claimant for workers’ compensation benefits was not entitled to permanent partial disability benefits because the claimant did not suffer a loss of wage-earning capacity as the claimant admitted that the claimant returned to work at the same plant, in the same division, and in the same job but making a higher wage.

       Employer failed to rebut the testimony, the employee’s work restrictions, or any medical evidence to overcome the employee’s prima facie case of permanent-partial disability from the time of his layoff in 2008 to the present; as the employee proved a work-related injury, a loss of wage-earning capacity resulting in permanent-partial disability, and that the injury related to his disability, the order denying his claim for benefits was reversed.

      </p>
      <p>
       Mississippi Workers’ Compensation Commission did not err in finding that an employee failed to prove she suffered a permanent disability because the presumption of no loss of wage-earning capacity applied since her post-injury wages were the same as her pre-injury wages; the employee failed to rebut the presumption because she presented no evidence of an increase in wage levels since her injury, that she was working additional hours, or that she was being paid out of her employer’s sympathy.

       Workers’ compensation benefits claimant was permanently and totally disabled because an employer refused to rehire the claimant within his restrictions, and the employer did not offer the claimant work in the time period between the restrictions and the date of his termination for allegedly falsifying his original employment application; moreover, the claimant made a valid, but unsuccessful, job search within his restrictions of both sedentary and light work. The claimant’s age, education, permanent work restrictions, geographical location, past work experience, inability to return to past employment, loss of access to the job market, and his lack of computer, clerical, or sales experience were all considered.

       Workers’ Compensation Commission erred in denying a former employee benefits for a permanent and total disability. The testimony from the employee’s vocational specialist indicated that the employee had a 100% loss in the labor market, and the testimony of the opposing vocational expert showed that the employee should, at the very least, have been assess a loss of wage-earning capacity.

Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c03s71-3-3ol1i" target="_self">71-3-3(i)</a></cite>, was compensable because it was work-related under Miss.

       <p>
   Award of permanent disability benefits was affirmed because substantial evidence supported an administrative judge’s finding that an employee sustained a 75 percent loss of wage-earning capacity due to a work-related injury to the employees’ back, which rendered the employee disabled under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c03s71-3-3ol1i" target="_self">71-3-3(i)</a></cite>.

      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence supported the workers’ compensation commission’s finding that an employee had sustained a fifty percent loss of wage-earning capacity and the award of temporary total disability benefits as the record showed that, while the employee presented to the employer for re-hire after his original injury, his post-injury condition progressively worsened, ultimately resulting in his retirement; however, as acknowledged by the commission, the employee failed to seek alternative work positions from the employer before retiring, even though he had the capacity to perform alternative duties.

      </p>
      <p>
       Mississippi Workers’ Compensation Commission’s finding that there was no loss of wage-earning capacity was supported by substantial evidence because the evidence showed that the claimant could have returned to the claimant’s previous job had there been a job available, and that the claimant could have found employment earning the same amount of pre-injury income. Whiddon v. Southern Concrete Pumping, LLC, 114 So.3d 18, 2013 Miss. App. LEXIS 208 (Miss. Ct. App. 2013).

       <p>
   Denial of permanent partial disability benefits to the employee in a workers’ compensation action was improper because his post-injury income would have been higher but for a climbing restriction and therefore, the Workers’ Compensation Commission erred by finding that the injury had no impact on his wage-earning potential, Miss.

      <p>
       Where a workers’ compensation claimant was released to work with a 10 percent disability rating and a climbing restriction, as his post-injury earnings exceeded his pre-injury earnings, the record indicated that his employer accommodated him as a matter of policy, not generosity, and as his testimony failed to show that he could not earn overtime pay or perform his job duties with his climbing restriction, he failed to present sufficient evidence to rebut the presumption of no loss of wage-earning capacity. Gregg v. Natchez Trace Elec. Power Ass'n, 64 So.3d 489, 2010 Miss. App. LEXIS 289 (Miss. Ct. App. 2010), rev'd, 64 So.3d 473, 2011 Miss. LEXIS 280 (Miss. 2011).

      <p>
       Substantial evidence supported the ruling of the Mississippi Workers’ Compensation Commission to affirm an administrative law judge’s (ALJ) decision awarding an employee permanent partial disability benefits of $ 15 per week for 450 weeks because the employee made it clear during his testimony that he chose to stay at home and not seek employment, and the ALJ determined that the employee’s decision did not alleviate his duty to seek employment; the ALJ ultimately found that the employee had not satisfied his burden of seeking alternative employment and found that the evidence did support some loss of wage-earning capacity.

       There was substantial evidence on which the workers’ compensation commission could have found that a claimant did not prove that she was disabled where, inter alia, while it did appear that she attempted, on one occasion, to contact her employer and return to her job in July of 1996, she did not assert that she sought any other employment, rather, she simply argued that she was unable to even attempt to go to work. That argument was contrary to her arguments before the unemployment appeals referee, wherein she claimed to have been able to return to light duty work and it was also contrary to the testimony of all three testifying physicians.

       In an action in which an employer appealed from a judgment of the Harrison County Circuit Court, which affirmed the Mississippi Workers’ Compensation Commission decision that the employee’s worker’s compensation claim was compensable, the judgment was affirmed where: (1) substantial evidence existed from which the Commission could have determined that the employee’s employment caused his injury; (2) the list provided by the employee in mid-January of 2004 enumerated six attempts to locate employment between September 3, 2003, and October 6, 2003; and (3) the Commission was not clearly erroneous for finding that the employee’s job search was diligent, despite his refusal to work with the vocational expert. Imperial Palace Casino v. Wilson, 960 So. 2d 549, 2006 Miss. App. LEXIS 928 (Miss. Ct. App. 2006), cert. denied, 959 So. 2d 1051, 2007 Miss. LEXIS 402 (Miss. 2007).

   As medical testimony established that an employee suffered from bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome and a vocational expert testified about the difficulty the employee would have in finding other work, the employee met his burden of proving a disability under Miss.

   Finding that the employee in a workers’ compensation case was permanently and totally disabled was appropriate because he had met his burden set forth in Miss.

   Workers’ Compensation Commission erred in applying the no loss of wage presumption because the claimant’s disability or inability to earn his pre-injury wages as provided in Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c03s71-3-3ol1i" target="_self">71-3-3 (i)</a></cite> had not fully manifested itself when he returned to work after surgery.

       Trial court properly denied an employee’s claim for permanent disability benefits in a case where the employee’s post-injury unemployment arose due to her unwillingness to carry out tasks she was physically capable of performing, rather than from a permanent diminished physical ability to perform in the workplace arising out of her work-related neck injury. Wagner v. Hancock Med. Ctr., 825 So. 2d 703, 2002 Miss. App. LEXIS 485 (Miss. Ct. App. 2002).

       The Worker’s Compensation Commission erred as a matter of law when it refused to consider the extent of the claimant’s efforts to find other suitable employment for which he might be suited in his post-injury condition when assessing the extent of his permanent partial disability.

       The claimant did not sustain a disability within the meaning of the statute and, therefore, was not entitled to permanent disability benefits, notwithstanding that she sustained an 8-10 percent permanent impairment, where her post-injury income exceeded her pre-injury income.

       The fact that the claimant voluntarily retired from her position together with the fact that she did not try to find another job for seven months after leaving her employer supported the determination that she did not make reasonable efforts to obtain gainful employment and, therefore, was not disabled.

       Workers’ compensation claimant who has reached maximum medical recovery can establish prima facie showing of total disability if claimant reports back to work, and employer refuses to reinstate or rehire claimant, and burden then shifts to employer to prove that claimant suffered only partial disability or that claimant suffered no loss of wage earning capacity.

       A finding by the Workers’ Compensation Commission that an injured manual laborer who was restricted by his doctor to lifting less than 40 pounds suffered only minimal industrial incapacity was not supported by substantial evidence where the decision was based largely on an alleged policy of the employer requiring workers to seek assistance when lifting more than 40 pounds, but the record contained no evidence of such a policy.

       A finding by the Workers’ Compensation Commission that a lumberyard worker had sustained only a 50 percent loss of wage-earning capacity, and therefore suffered only partial rather than total permanent disability, would be reversed where the evidence indicated that he had difficulty performing “make-work” tasks at his employer’s lumberyard after he returned to work and that his efforts to find other employment were unsuccessful, and the Commission’s finding was based on the conclusion that the employee should have been able to secure “some type of gainful employment” merely because he had a high school education.

       Despite a claimant’s increase in earnings, his earning capacity and his employability in the market place had been reduced due to Meniere’s Syndrome where the presumption of earning capacity commensurate with post-injury earnings was rebutted by the following factors: (1) Meniere’s Syndrome is a whole body disability; (2) it is lifelong in nature; (3) it affects the activities of daily living, both occupationally and socially; (4) the claimant’s daily bouts with vertigo would put him at a disadvantage in an industrial setting where there were machines in operation; (5) one of the claimant’s biggest fears was losing his balance and falling into one of the machines he was operating; and (6) there had been an increase in general wage levels for all employees in the claimant’s class since 1984.

      </p>
      <p>
       The evidence was sufficient to support a finding that a claimant suffered only a 5 percent permanent partial occupational disability by reason of a work-connected injury to his left hand, where the claimant failed to offer evidence that he had unsuccessfully attempted to perform his usual duties, and he failed to offer evidence that he was refused employment based upon the disability to his hand in that he made no search for work outside his prior employment, stating that his car had been repossessed and he was without transportation. Walker Mfg. Co. v. Cantrell, 577 So. 2d 1243, 1991 Miss. LEXIS 190 (Miss. 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       A claimant who suffered a 25 percent permanent impairment to the body was not entitled to an award of permanent partial disability benefits since she did not establish a loss of wage earning capacity attributable to the compensable injury, where the evidence showed that she experienced an overall increase of post-injury wages and she offered no proof to rebut the presumption of no loss of wage earning capacity by showing that the post-injury earnings were not reliable in determining wage earning capacity. International Paper Co. v. Kelley, 562 So. 2d 1298, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 274 (Miss. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       An employee’s job-related contact dermatitis caused by exposure to sulfur dioxide constituted a permanent loss of wage earning capacity, such that the employee was entitled to permanent partial disability benefits, where the employee’s sensitivity was permanent in nature so that he could not be exposed to sulfur dioxide in the future, and he made reasonable though unsuccessful efforts to find other comparably gainful employment. Piper Industries, Inc. v. Herod, 560 So. 2d 732, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 196 (Miss. 1990).
      </p>

       Generally, “medical” disability is the equivalent of functional disability and relates to actual physical impairment. “Industrial” disability is the functional or medical disability as it affects the claimant’s ability to perform the duties of employment. Robinson v. Packard Electric Div., General Motors Corp., 523 So. 2d 329, 1988 Miss. LEXIS 199 (Miss. 1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the disability contemplated by the Worker’s Compensation Act is an occupational disability, an injured employee is entitled to compensation to the extent that he has been incapacitated to earn wages, and the fact that such employee retains substantial functional abilities in no way undercuts the conclusion that he or she may be totally occupationally disabled. Marshall Durbin, Inc. v. Hall, 490 So. 2d 877, 1986 Miss. LEXIS 2493 (Miss. 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       A claimant who developed a work-related respiratory ailment made out a prima facie case of disability which was unrebutted by his employer where, after the claimant had presented evidence of his physical impairment, age, education, work experience, and unsuccessful efforts to secure employment, the employer failed to present any evidence from such sources as employment agencies clearly showing the local accessibility of substantial gainful employment suited to the claimant’s medical condition. Pontotoc Wire Products Co. v. Ferguson, 384 So. 2d 601, 1980 Miss. LEXIS 2009 (Miss. 1980).

      <p>
       In determining whether a claimant for worker’s compensation is unable to earn wages in former or other employment so as to fall within the statutory definition of the term “disabled,” the claimant has the burden of proof to make out a prima facie case for disability, after which the burden of proof shifts to the employer to rebut or refute the claimant’s evidence.

       The 1960 amendment of this section [Code 1942, § 6998-02] does not operate to make medical findings the exclusive basis for establishing extent of disability. I. Taitel & Son v. Twiner, 247 Miss. 785, 157 So. 2d 44, 1963 Miss. LEXIS 356 (Miss. 1963).

       Denial of a workers’ compensation claim was appropriate because, considering the inconsistencies in the claimant’s testimony, the inconsistencies in the claimant’s reported medical history, the extended period of time between the claimant’s alleged injury and the claimant’s report of a work-related injury, and the conflicting medical testimony, the claimant failed to carry the claimant’s burden of proof as to causation.

       Workers’ compensation benefits claimant met the burden of showing a causal connection between a work injury and her disability based on the testimony of a doctor, despite the fact that his opinion was based upon the subjective medical history given by the claimant; this implicitly determined that the claimant was credible and moreover her complaints were referenced by two other doctors.

       Circuit court properly granted a company summary judgment in a worker’s action alleging it was liable for its employee’s negligence because his exclusive remedy was under the Workers’ Compensation Law; the nature of the work was that of an employee covered by the Law because the work did not involve any particular skill or training, and the worker was not in the business of offering similar services to other entities as part of his own independent business.

      <p>
       Worker’s exclusive remedy was under the Workers’ Compensation Law because pursuant to the “control test,” the worker was a company’s employee not an independent contractor; the company had the right to control the work and it exercised that right, the worker was paid a regular daily wage rather than a fixed fee for some project or job, and the company provided all necessary tools and could have fired him at any time.

       Mississippi Workers’ Compensation Commission did not err in granting a job applicant benefits for an injury he sustained while performing a pre-employment job-function test because there was substantial evidence he was an employee at the time of his injury under an implied contract for hire; the evidence was sufficient to show there was mutual consent for hire and sufficient consideration for a contract for hire, and the employer controlled the applicant’s actions in performing the test.

      <p>
       Mississippi Workers' Compensation Commission properly ordered an employer to pay a worker benefits because the substantial evidence supported a finding that it employed the worker as an employee, rather than an independent contractor; the Commission found that the factor of the right of control weighed in favor of treating the worker as an employee because the employer required him to work every day,and he exclusively worked for the employer.

       In determining the existence of an employer and employee relationship the right to control the employee is one of the dominant factors, but the ultimate right to control is not to be confused with immediate control, for it is the reserved right of control rather than its actual exercise that furnishes a true test of the relationship.

       The workmen’s compensation commission’s finding that the deceased truck driver was an employee of the truck lessee was warranted by evidence showing that it was the truck lessee who exercised all the control necessary to see that its objectives were carried out in detail, and that the person who paid the truck driver’s salary and had the right of discharge, exercised little or no control over the truck driver whatsoever.

Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c03s71-3-3ol1b" target="_self">71-3-3(b)</a></cite>, which followed from the fact that the statutory definition included injuries causes by a willful act committed by someone who was a stranger to the employment relations.

       Mississippi Workers’ Compensation Commission did not err in reversing the administrative judge’s determination that the claimant was acting in the scope of his employment when he rode toward his house after lunch to switch from his motorcycle to his jeep before returning to his office because he was on a personal errand to exchange vehicles unconnected to a business purpose for his employer; he had a fixed place of employment; while aspects of his work included travel to service locations, and he was entitled to reimbursement for that travel, his position was not comparable to that of a truck driver or traveling salesman; and travel to lunch and his personal errand home to exchange vehicles were outside the scope of his employment.

       A claimant failed to make the requisite showing that her mental condition was causally connected to her employment where 2 doctors testified that the claimant had suffered from psychological disorders prior to the incident alleged to have caused her mental injury, the Workers’ Compensation Commission found the testimony of another doctor, who diagnosed the claimant as having severe post-traumatic stress disorder and major depression with some psychotic symptoms, to be unconvincing, and the incident alleged to have caused the claimant’s mental injury-a private meeting with her supervisor during which the supervisor threatened to fire her-was not an “untoward event.” Bates v.

       The evidence was sufficient to support the Workers’ Compensation Commission’s finding that an employee’s mental disability was caused by a deliberate course of conduct by his employer and that there was nothing in his psychological background to suggest a pre-existing personality disorder, so that the stresses to which the employee was subjected were “more than the ordinary incidents of employment” and were “untoward events or unusual occurrences” culminating in his subsequent disability, where a psychiatrist who treated the employee for over 2 years testified that the employee was psychologically disabled and that his work played a significant part in causing it, and testimony from the employee, the employee’s wife, and fellow employees established a protracted pattern by the employer to put pressure and stress upon the employee.

       Mental injury of worker unaccompanied by physical trauma is not directly linked to untoward event, unusual occurrence, accident or injury incident to employment, as required for worker to be entitled to worker’s compensation benefits, where worker claims that mental injury results from termination of worker due to business conditions eliminating need for worker’s employment; if worker were entitled to benefits at all, it would only be to apportioned benefits if worker has long history of mental and emotional disorders prior to termination.

       Court of appeals erred in finding that an employee made a prima facie showing of permanent total disability and in awarding her compensation because the substantial evidence supported a finding that the employee did not have a permanent, total disability, and there was substantial evidence that the lack of employment was not due to the employee’s injury; the employee’s termination notice stated that she was being terminated due to her probationary status rather than as a consequence of her injury, and the Mississippi Workers’ Compensation Commission’s conclusion that the employee was unable to find employment due to the depressed economic conditions in the area where she lived and not to the injury itself was based on substantial evidence presented by the employee’s expert. he employee was terminated from her position with the group home shortly after her accident.

       In a workers’ compensation case, a claimant’s treating physician stated in his deposition that the claimant’s cerebral hemorrhage was caused by poorly controlled hypertension and could not be related to the stress of his employment to a reasonable degree of medical probability; there was nothing in the record to suggest that the opinion of the treating physician was not credible evidence upon which the Mississippi Workers’ Compensation Commission was entitled to rely. Also, the Commission acted within its discretion in discounting another doctor’s testimony since that doctor had not examined the claimant or even spoken with him, and had failed to review all of the pertinent medical records; therefore, the Commission’s decision denying the claimant workers’ compensation benefits was neither arbitrary nor capricious as the treating physician’s testimony provided substantial support for the Commission’s finding that the claimant had failed to show that his intracerebral hemorrhage was caused or contributed to by the stress he experienced in his employment as a deputy sheriff.

       Medical testimony from the employee’s treating physicians supported the permanence of his disability as follows: (1) one physician testified that he had suffered a 20 percent permanent medical impairment to his entire body due to his neck injury’ (2) a second physician restricted him to medium duty based on clinical examinations, diagnostic tests, and his complaints of pain; (3) three years after the accident, the employee was further restricted to light duty; and (4) a third physician concluded that he would “never be able to return to duty without severe spasm.” The record was clear that he was unable to return to his work as a diesel mechanic due to his injury, and that he had also incurred a 50 percent reduction in his earning capacity given his pain, his age, and his occupational history.

       The Workers’ Compensation Commission’s denial of benefits to an asthmatic employee would be reversed, even though a physician testified that there was not a “strong work-related causal connection between [the employee’s] pneumonia and emphysema,” where medical testimony established a causal connection between the exacerbation of her pre-existing respiratory problems and the inhalation of irritants in her work environment, and the employee’s uncontroverted testimony of the onset pain in her side and back along with shortness of breath while she was performing her job duties established that her injury arose out of and in the course of her employment.

       The circuit court did not err in reversing the Workers’ Compensation Commission’s finding that a claimant with a back injury had reached maximum medical improvement and suffered no permanent disability where there was evidence that the claimant had 2 ruptured discs surgically removed, specialists who initially concluded that the claimant had no ruptured discs did not later examine him after the discovery of the ruptured discs was made, and the employer failed to show that the claimant suffered any disassociated intervening injury which caused the ruptured discs, their surgical removal and the resulting disability.

       A finding that a claimant was not entitled to permanent disability benefits because his disability, which arose from slippage in the spine, was attributable entirely to preexisting spondylolisthesis was not supported by substantial evidence where there was conflicting medical testimony from 2 treating physicians as to the cause of the claimant’s permanent disability and neither physician could determine how and when the slippage actually occurred, since close questions of compensability should be resolved in favor of the claimant, and the Workers’ Compensation Act should be liberally construed to carry out its remedial purpose.

       Certainty is not a requisite in deciding a workers’ compensation case, but, rather, the reviewing court considers reasonable medical probabilities.

       The evidence supported a finding that an employee suffered a 100 percent industrial loss of use of his left leg, rather than only a 40 percent loss, even though the employee’s treating physician testified that the employee had a 40 percent permanent partial impairment of his left leg, where the physician also testified that the employee would be limited in activities such as standing for long periods, climbing ladders and stairs, and carrying heavy loads but that he could work in sedentary types of positions where he could sit to do the work, the employee was a 43-year-old man who dropped out of school during the 10th grade, from that time until the time of his injury he worked in construction, did carpentry work, and delivered furniture, at the time of the injury he was employed at a furniture company where he did not perform any one particular job but was moved around from job to job as needed, some of the jobs that he performed at the company included working in the sanding department, cutting out chest-of-drawer tops, and working in the mill, the employee testified that after his injury he could not do carpentry work and could not do any jobs which required him to stand but he could sand edges and use a table saw, and he testified that he continued to have problems with his leg every day, including swelling and pain.

       The Workers’ Compensation Commission’s findings that a truck driver sustained a compensable injury and that the repeated trauma of his work aggravated a pre-existing non-work-related condition were supported by substantial evidence where the worker’s treating physician and the physician for the employer who conducted a physical examination required by the Department of Transportation had released the worker to return to work following treatment for a non-work-related back injury and the treating physician testified that the worker had a “chronically sore joint in the back that was apparently being aggravated by the nature of his work as a long-distance truck driver.” Miller Transporters, Inc. v.

       Testimony of claimant’s physician giving opinion to reasonable medical certainty that claimant has experienced injury resulting in claimant being 100 percent disabled is sufficient to support finding of disability, notwithstanding contradictory testimony by employer’s physician, where claimant’s physician has examined and treated claimant on 9 or 10 occasions and employer’s physician has examined claimant on only one occasion, some 10 months after most recent examination by claimant’s physician.

       Medical testimony that a claimant’s duties as a meat cutter, which required him to spend 65 per cent of his time lifting and carrying heavy food products, probably aggravated a non-work originating disease contracted by the claimant, warranted a determination that the disease constituted an accidental injury within the meaning of the Workmen’s Compensation Law and supported an award of benefits.

      Domestic servants, farmers and farm labor are not included under the provisions of this chapter, but this exemption does not apply to the processing of agricultural products when carried on commercially. Any purchaser of timber products shall not be liable for workers’ compensation for any person who harvests and delivers timber to such purchaser if such purchaser is not liable for unemployment tax on the person harvesting and delivering the timber as provided by United States Code Annotated, Title 26, Section 3306, as amended. Provided, however, nothing in this section shall be construed to exempt an employer who would otherwise be covered under this section from providing workers’ compensation coverage on those employees for whom he is liable for unemployment tax.
     </p>
     <p>
      Employers exempted by this section may assume, with respect to any employee or classification of employees, the liability for compensation imposed upon employers by this chapter with respect to employees within the coverage of this chapter. The purchase and acceptance by such employer of valid workers’ compensation insurance applicable to such employee or classification of employees shall constitute, as to such employer, an assumption by him of such liability under this chapter without any further act on his part notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, but only with respect to such employee or such classification of employees as are within the coverage of the state fund. Such assumption of liability shall take effect and continue from the effective date of such workers’ compensation insurance and as long only as such coverage shall remain in force, in which case the employer shall be subject with respect to such employee or classification of employees to no other liability than the compensation as provided for in this chapter.
     </p>
     <p>
      An owner/operator, and his drivers, must provide a certificate of insurance of workers’ compensation coverage to the motor carrier or proof of coverage under a self-insured plan or an occupational accident policy. Any such occupational accident policy shall provide a minimum of One Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) of coverage. Should the owner/operator fail to provide written proof of coverage to the motor carrier, then the owner/operator, and his drivers, shall be covered under the motor carrier’s workers’ compensation insurance program and the motor carrier is authorized to collect payment of the premium from the owner/operator. In the event that coverage is obtained by the owner/operator under a workers’ compensation policy or through a self-insured or occupational accident policy, then the owner/operator, and his drivers, shall not be entitled to benefits under the motor carrier’s workers’ compensation insurance program unless the owner/operator has elected in writing to be covered under the carrier’s workers’ compensation program or policy or if the owner/operator is covered by the carrier’s plan because he failed to obtain coverage. Coverage under the motor carrier’s workers’ compensation insurance program does not terminate the independent contractor status of the owner/operator under the written contract or lease agreement. Nothing shall prohibit or prevent an owner/operator from having or securing an occupational accident policy in addition to any workers’ compensation coverage authorized by this section. Other than the amendments to this section by Chapter 523, Laws of 2006, the provisions of this section shall not be construed to have any effect on any other provision of law, judicial decision or any applicable common law.

      Any employer may elect, by proper and written action of its own governing authority, to be exempt from the provisions of the Workers’ Compensation Law as to its sole proprietor, its partner in a partnership or to its employee who is the owner of fifteen percent (15%) or more of its stock in a corporation, if such sole proprietor, partner or employee also voluntarily agrees thereto in writing. Any sole proprietor, partner or employee owning fifteen percent (15%) or more of the stock of his/her corporate employer who becomes exempt from coverage under the Workers’ Compensation Law shall be excluded from the total number of workers or operatives toward reaching the mandatory coverage threshold level of five (5).

       Workers’ Compensation Act applied to an employer because it had at least five employees at the time of a workers’ injury; there was no evidence that any of the employer’s officers had elected to opt out of coverage in writing, and thus, they acted as employees and counted as employees for coverage purposes. Southeastern Auto Brokers v. Graves, 210 So.3d 1012, 2015 Miss. App. LEXIS 205 (Miss. Ct. App. 2015).
      </p>
      <p>
       Self-insured employer was bound by statement in employee handbook provided to every employee that employees would be covered for what would in effect be compensable injury under Workers' Compensation Act. Southwest Miss. Regional Medical Ctr. v. Lawrence, 684 So. 2d 1257, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 642 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Employee proved by preponderance of evidence that his employer did not carry workers’ compensation, as required for every employer with five or more employees. James M. Burns Lumber Co. v. Dilworth, 676 So. 2d 892, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 297 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where an employee was in the course and scope of his employment with both Mississippi and Louisiana employers at the time of his death, a settlement from the Louisiana employers in Louisiana workmen’s compensation proceedings did not bar a claim for death benefits against the Mississippi employer-carrier in Mississippi, but the Mississippi employer-carrier was entitled to credit for the amount paid by the Louisiana employers. Dependents of Roberts v. Holiday Parks, Inc., 260 So. 2d 476, 1972 Miss. LEXIS 1571 (Miss. 1972).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Mississippi Workmen’s Compensation Law was adopted in the exercise of the state’s police power to provide for the welfare of its citizens and others performing labor within its borders, and the state has a legitimate interest in imposing a rule of compensation liability where the injury occurs in that state. Nowlin v. Lee, 203 So. 2d 493, 1967 Miss. LEXIS 1379 (Miss. 1967).

       The requirement that the employer must secure payment of compensation means that he must have in effect an insurance policy complying with the Workmen’s Compensation Law, or must qualify as self-insurer. McCoy v. Cornish, 220 Miss. 577, 71 So. 2d 304, 1954 Miss. LEXIS 474 (Miss. 1954).

       Where decedent was killed while hauling logs for a subcontractor, the subcontractor, a trucking company, was qualified as an employer because it had five or more workmen or operatives under any contract of hire; therefore, the subcontractor had an obligation to secure compensation for its employees, which it did by having the contracting deduct premiums from the contractor’s payments to the subcontractor. Lamar v. Thomas Fowler Trucking, Inc., 956 So. 2d 878, 2007 Miss. LEXIS 279 (Miss. 2007).

      <p>
       In the absence of any statutory provision for omission of out-of-state employees of the same employer in the count for the purpose of determining the minimum number of employees, out-of-state employees should be counted for the purpose of making such a determination. Nowlin v. Lee, 203 So. 2d 493, 1967 Miss. LEXIS 1379 (Miss. 1967).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the employer was engaged in the business of developing real estate in both Tennessee and Mississippi and his employees in Tennessee and Mississippi were all employees of the same establishment and were paid out of the same bank account, it was proper to add the number of his Tennessee employees to those working for him in Mississippi to determine whether he had the statutory minimum of eight employees. Nowlin v. Lee, 203 So. 2d 493, 1967 Miss. LEXIS 1379 (Miss. 1967).

       Under evidence showing that, among other things, the work performed by three commissioned salesmen, who drove their own automobiles, constituted an integral part of the business of a partnership selling sewing machines, the partnership controlled the maximum price of the machines, could accept or reject any deferred payment contracts, required the salesmen to service the machines sold, could fire any of the salesmen at will, and the salesmen turned over to the partnership all funds collected, the attorney-referee and the commission did not err in finding that the commission salesmen were employees and not independent contractors, so that the partnership, which employed five additional persons, was an employer subject to the provisions of the Workmen’s Compensation Law. Kahne v. Robinson, 232 Miss. 670, 100 So. 2d 132, 100 So. 2d 585, 1958 Miss. LEXIS 315, 1958 Miss. LEXIS 316 (Miss. 1958).

      <p>
       If by the character of the work the employer has once regularly employed eight or more persons, he remains under the Workmen’s Compensation Law even when the number employed temporarily falls below the minimum, and it is not necessary that the minimum number of workers shall be employed on the same job or at the same place. Mosley v. Jones, 224 Miss. 725, 80 So. 2d 819, 1955 Miss. LEXIS 535 (Miss. 1955).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Workmen’s Compensation Law does not deny equal protection of the laws because it excludes employees of persons, firms, and corporations having in service less than eight workmen. Walters v. Blackledge, 220 Miss. 485, 71 So. 2d 433, 1954 Miss. LEXIS 464 (Miss. 1954).
      </p>
      <p>
       The question whether the number of men employed is such as to bring the employer within the Workmen’s Compensation Law is to be determined by the character of the work in which the men are employed, however brief or long, and not by the character of the employment whether regular, casual, occasional, periodical, or otherwise, so long as they were hired to do the work in common or unusual business of the employer. Jackson v. Fly, 215 Miss. 303, 60 So. 2d 782, 63 So. 2d 536, 1953 Miss. LEXIS 363 (Miss. 1953).

       Employer was in the business of processing oyster meat, rather than farming, and, therefore, an employee was not exempted from the act where the employer removed oysters from their shells, washed them, and packed them.

      <p>
       A claimant who did not engage in agricultural pursuits of any nature whatsoever and whose sole activity was that of clearing land, using a bulldozer for this purpose and performing mechanical work on the machine, was not a “farm laborer” within the exemption provided by this section [Code 1942, § 6998-03]. Nowlin v. Lee, 203 So. 2d 493, 1967 Miss. LEXIS 1379 (Miss. 1967).
      </p>
      <p>
       A partnership did not lose its right to exemption by merely taking out workmen’s compensation insurance to cover their farm laborers at time of purchase of the farm, where there was no compliance with the statutory requirement as to the posting of notices on the premises, and notification was not given to the workmen’s compensation commission of their election to come under the Workmen’s Compensation Law, and the claimant was not led to believe that he would receive workmen’s compensation benefit if injured in the course of his employment. Eaton v. Joe N. Miles & Sons, 238 Miss. 605, 119 So. 2d 359, 1960 Miss. LEXIS 444 (Miss. 1960).

       Death of a sharecropper and farm laborer resulting from his being thrown from and run over by the landowner’s tractor and trailer while hauling his own cotton from the field to the landowner’s gin arose out of and in the course of his farming activities, so that his widow and dependent could not recover death benefits under the Workmen's Compensation Law.

       Workers’ Compensation Commission properly dismissed an employee’s claim for benefits because the Workers’ Compensation Act excluded transportation and maritime employments for which a rule of liability was provided by the law of the United States, the employee was engaged in maritime employment at that time of his injury, and he had accepted benefits under the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act. Kimbrough v. Fowler's Pressure Washing, LLC, 170 So.3d 609, 2015 Miss. App. LEXIS 116 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 168 So.3d 962, 2015 Miss. LEXIS 401 (Miss. 2015).

      <p>
       In an action against a general contractor and a subcontractor arising from the death of an iron worker while constructing a casino on a barge on a navigable waterway, the general contractor was not entitled to immunity as the decedent’s statutory employer because the decedent was covered by the federal Longshore and Harbor Workers’ Compensation Act at the time of his death. Accu-Fab & Constr., Inc. v. Ladner by & Through Ladner, 970 So. 2d 1276, 2000 Miss. App. LEXIS 111 (Miss. Ct. App. 2000), aff'd, 778 So. 2d 766, 2001 Miss. LEXIS 38 (Miss. 2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       The general contractor and a subcontractor involved in the construction of a barge casino located on a navigable waterway were not entitled to statutory immunity under Workers’ Compensation Act with regard to injuries sustained by an employee of another subcontractor; that employee was covered under the Longshore and Harbor Workers’ Compensation Act at the time of his injury. Accu-Fab & Constr., Inc. v. Ladner by & Through Ladner, 1999 Miss. App. LEXIS 452 (Miss. Ct. App. June 29, 1999), op. withdrawn, sub. op., 970 So. 2d 1276, 2000 Miss. App. LEXIS 111 (Miss. Ct.

      <p>
       The state compensation law is not applicable to injuries sustained by persons employed under maritime contracts, where the particular employment is of a maritime nature and where the injury occurs on waters within admiralty jurisdiction, except in case of matters of local concern the regulation of which by the state will work no material prejudice to the characteristic features of maritime law or interfere with its proper harmony or uniformity in its international or interstate relations.

   Lumber company was properly dismissed as a party in a workers’ compensation case because there was no evidence offered of the existence of an employer-employee relationship between the lumber company or any of the employees of a logging business; moreover, there was no evidence that the lumber company paid the employees of the logging business or that lumber company exercised any control over the employees of the logging business.

       Workers’ Compensation Commission properly found that a decedent’s fatal stroke was a compensable injury and that the accounting firm was obligated to provide workers’ compensation benefits to the decedent’s beneficiaries because the firm was required to obtain workers’ compensation insurance and provide workers’ compensation benefits to its employees where it had more than five employees, nothing in the record indicated that the firm provided any written notice that it was electing to exempt the decedent from coverage, and there was no evidence in the record that the decedent’s stress, stroke, and death were caused by anything other than his professional life.

Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c03s71-3-5" target="_self">71-3-5</a></cite> does not set any timetable for procuring workers’ compensation insurance, it merely gives the coverage criteria; however, given the beneficent purpose of the Mississippi Workers’ Compensation Act, it should be readily apparent to any business owner that workers’ compensation insurance is necessary as soon as the business meets the statutory definition of a covered employer. Therefore, two business owners were not held to a higher standard than other businesses when it was determined that they should have procured workers’ compensation insurance before an accident occurred.

       Compensation shall be payable for disability or death of an employee from injury or occupational disease arising out of and in the course of employment, without regard to fault as to the cause of the injury or occupational disease. An occupational disease shall be deemed to arise out of and in the course of employment when there is evidence that there is a direct causal connection between the work performed and the occupational disease. In all claims in which no benefits, including disability, death and medical benefits, have been paid, the claimant shall file medical records in support of his claim for benefits when filing a petition to controvert. If the claimant is unable to file the medical records in support of his claim for benefits at the time of filing the petition to controvert because of a limitation of time established by Section 71-3-35 or Section 71-3-53, the claimant shall file medical records in support of his claim within sixty (60) days after filing the petition to controvert.

       A post-injury termination for misconduct, even if the misconduct contributed to the injury, does not end the right to benefits. Tyson Foods v. Hilliard, 772 So. 2d 1103, 2000 Miss. App. LEXIS 582 (Miss. Ct. App. 2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Workers’ Compensation Commission, within legal limits, is the sole judge of the weight and sufficiency of the evidence. Evidence which is not contradicted by positive testimony or circumstances, and which is not inherently improbable, incredible, or unreasonable, cannot, as a matter of law, be arbitrarily or capriciously discredited, disregarded or rejected, even though the witness is a party or is interested; unless uncontradicted evidence is shown to be untrustworthy, it is to be taken as conclusive and binding on the triers of fact. Morris v. Lansdell's Frame Co., 547 So. 2d 782, 1989 Miss. LEXIS 336 (Miss. 1989).
      </p>
      <p>
       If maximum medical recovery has occurred before the attorney-referee’s hearing and order, credit for any excess payments by the employer and carrier shall be allowed in future payments; and such allowances and the method for crediting excess payments against future payments shall be determined by the attorney-referee, subject to review. Cockrell Banana Co. v. Harris, 212 So. 2d 581, 1968 Miss. LEXIS 1290 (Miss. 1968).
      </p>
      <p>
       Until maximum medical recovery has been reached the claimant is entitled to full temporary total disability payments unless such disability was total and permanent on the date of injury. Cockrell Banana Co. v. Harris, 212 So. 2d 581, 1968 Miss. LEXIS 1290 (Miss. 1968).
      </p>
      <p>
       A claim for disability under the compensation law is not a suit to recover damages growing out of an industrial injury, but is compensation for loss of earnings as a result of an industrial injury, or the loss to the dependents of a worker because of his death. Thyer Mfg. Co. v. Mooney, 252 Miss. 629, 173 So. 2d 652, 1965 Miss. LEXIS 1134 (Miss. 1965).

       The propriety and fairness of this section [Code 1942, § 6998-04] is not a judicial question. Southeastern Constr. Co. v. Dependent of Dodson, 247 Miss. 1, 153 So. 2d 276, 1963 Miss. LEXIS 277 (Miss. 1963).

       A workmen’s compensation policy covered the employees of insured and the fact that a worker was not named in the policy is immaterial. Nowell v. Harris, 219 Miss. 363, 68 So. 2d 464, 1953 Miss. LEXIS 397 (Miss. 1953).

       In an action against shipper by rail for personal injuries sustained because of alleged improper manner in loading a flatcar, by an employee of consignee, neither the consignee nor its insurance carrier, who were alleged to be paying the employee workmen’s compensation benefits and who received notice of the action, were necessary parties to the action.

       There is no support in the Mississippi Workers’ Compensation Act, or in the case law, for the proposition that an employer which itself is free of any wrongdoing can be held liable on an alter-ego theory for its workers’ compensation carrier’s bad faith failure to pay benefits; the law, in fact, is to the contrary. Toney v. Lowery Woodyards, 278 F. Supp. 2d 786, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14180 (S.D. Miss. 2003).
      </p>

       An employers’ liability under the Workmen’s Compensation Law is not affected by his failure to obtain insurance. Dependents of Dawson v. Delta Western Exploration Co., 245 Miss. 335, 147 So. 2d 485, 1962 Miss. LEXIS 556 (Miss. 1962).
      </p>
      <p>
       Liability for compensation is on the insurer at the time of injury rather than the insurer at the time of resulting disability. Potts v. Lowery, 242 Miss. 300, 134 So. 2d 474, 1961 Miss. LEXIS 559 (Miss. 1961).
      </p>
      <p>
       The act of the employer’s manager in telling claimant that she was under the compensation law and furnishing her with blank forms of claim, does not obligate the employer to pay compensation to one whose claim is not compensable. Ray v. Wells-Lamont Glove Factory, 236 Miss. 154, 109 So. 2d 544, 1959 Miss. LEXIS 304 (Miss. 1959).

Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c03s71-3-7" target="_self">71-3-7</a></cite>, which benefits the employee later received via a settlement, failed because the employer had arguable reasons for its decision where an investigation into whether the employee’s alleged sexual relationship with her manager ever occurred or was the cause of the employee’s mental health problems was inconclusive.

       An employer and its carrier were not entitled to credit for excess payments with regard to payment, pursuant to company policy, of regular salary as sick pay for 90 working days. Pet, Inc., Dairy Div. v. Roberson, 329 So. 2d 516, 1976 Miss. LEXIS 1826 (Miss. 1976).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Workmen’s Compensation Law does not provide for contribution between insurance carriers, and the apportionment provisions of this section [Code 1942, § 6998-04] refer only to the amount of compensation to which the injured employee will be entitled, not to how the payments of the compensation will be apportioned among those liable. Thyer Mfg. Co. v. Mooney, 252 Miss. 629, 173 So. 2d 652, 1965 Miss. LEXIS 1134 (Miss. 1965).

       Although a claimant is not entitled to compensation when he or she receives his or her regular salary in lieu of compensation, sick pay, vacation pay, donations or gratuities are not salary in lieu of compensation; thus, a claimant should have been awarded benefits during the time he was on vacation and receiving vacation pay where he was totally disabled at the time he took his vacation leave.

        6. Pain.
       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       Compensation may be allowed for disabling pain in the absence of positive medical testimony as to any physical cause whatever. When the patient complains of pain, the doctor usually takes the fact of pain for granted and the absence of physical findings to account for the pain will not necessarily bar compensation. In such cases, evidence of an accident followed by disabling pain and the absence of evidence as to the cause of the pain from objective medical findings may be sufficient as a basis for compensation, in the absence of circumstances tending to show malingering or indicating that the claimant’s testimony as to pain is inherently improbable, incredible, unreasonable or untrustworthy. However, there is a great potential for abuse in claims which are based predominantly upon pain reported by the patient, particularly in circumstances where the patient’s testimony or statement to the physician is the sole evidence of its continued presence. In these cases, it would be prudent to obtain additional medical evidence to either support or dispute the claim. Morris v. Lansdell's Frame Co., 547 So. 2d 782, 1989 Miss. LEXIS 336 (Miss. 1989).

   Where both of a workers’ compensation claimant’s doctors testified that the claimant’s injuries were consistent with the injury that the claimant described wherein a patient fell onto the claimant’s shoulder and the claimant’s back popped, the claimant’s resulting disability, defined under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c03s71-3-3ol1i" target="_self">71-3-3(i)</a></cite>, was compensable because it was work-related under Miss.

      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Where the employees’ injuries arose out of and in the course of employment, under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c03s71-3-3ol1b" target="_self">71-3-3(b)</a></cite>, their claims of battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress against the employer were not precluded by the Mississippi Workers’ Compensation Act, Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c03s71-3-9" target="_self">71-3-9</a></cite>, as a matter of law. Franklin Corp. v. Tedford, 2009 Miss. LEXIS 169 (Miss. Apr. 16, 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       An injury occurs in the course of the employment when it takes place within the period of employment, at a place where the employee reasonably may be in the performance of his duties, and while he is fulfilling those duties or engaged in doing something incidental thereto, or where he is engaged in the furtherance of the employer’s business. Jefferson v. T. L. James & Co., 420 F.2d 322, 1969 U.S. App. LEXIS 9766 (5th Cir. Miss. 1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the parties stipulated that a claimant’s wrist injury was work-related, the Mississippi Workers’ Compensation Commission erred in affirming an administrative law judge’s (ALJ’s) ruling that her injury at L-4 was not work-related, because that issue had not been before the ALJ and would ripen for adjudication only if and when she decided to undergo back surgery. Barber Seafood, Inc. v. Smith, 911 So. 2d 454, 2005 Miss. LEXIS 470 (Miss. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       The injury arises out of and in the course the employment if the employment aggravates, accelerates, or contributes to the disability as opposed to being the sole or principal cause. Fought v. Stuart C. Irby Co., 523 So. 2d 314, 1988 Miss. LEXIS 86 (Miss. 1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       Disability attendant on the general stress or normal human wear and tear of the workplace is not compensable under workers’ compensation; however, benefits may be available where an employee experiences a series of identifiable and extraordinarily stressful work-connected incidents. Fought v. Stuart C. Irby Co., 523 So. 2d 314, 1988 Miss. LEXIS 86 (Miss. 1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       The phrase “in the course of employment” as used in Code 1942 § 6998-04, does not mean that the worker must have died on the job or on the premises of the employer. Mississippi Research & Development Center v. Dependents of Shults, 287 So. 2d 273, 1973 Miss. LEXIS 1331 (Miss. 1973).
      </p>
      <p>
       In an action on a claim for workmen’s compensation benefits, it was for the commission, based on the medical and lay testimony, to determine not only whether the bulge or herniated disc and the resultant disability arose out of and in the course of the claimant’s employment, but also to determine, if allowable, when compensability should begin. Central Electric & Machinery Co. v. Shelton, 220 So. 2d 320, 1969 Miss. LEXIS 1454 (Miss. 1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       The signing of an application for group insurance benefits is a factor to be considered in determining whether an injury was work connected or arose out of a pre-existing condition, but it is not per se a bar to a claim under the Workmen’s Compensation Law where the facts are in dispute. Central Electric & Machinery Co. v. Shelton, 220 So. 2d 320, 1969 Miss. LEXIS 1454 (Miss. 1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a case in which it was contended that an employee who was injured as a consequence of a tornado was not entitled to compensation for the reason that his injuries resulted from an “act of God,” the court announced as a general rule that it would recognize an employee’s right to compensation for injury as “arising out of” his employment when the employee is injured at the place he is required to be engaged in the employer’s business, and not that of his own, and where the employer’s business required the employee to be at the place of the accident at the time it occurred. Wiggins v. Knox Glass, Inc., 219 So. 2d 154, 1969 Miss. LEXIS 1417 (Miss. 1969).

       Substantial evidence supported the Mississippi Workers’ Compensation Commission’s finding that an employee was unable to show that limitations on her ability to perform manual labor had any impact on her ability to perform the duties of her employment or resulted in a loss of wage-earning capacity because the employee had a history of employment in sedentary, clerical positions, supporting a reasonable inference that a restriction to light-duty work would not be a hindrance to her.

       Mississippi Workers’ Compensation Commission did not err in finding that an employee failed to prove she suffered a permanent disability because the presumption of no loss of wage-earning capacity applied since her post-injury wages were the same as her pre-injury wages; the employee failed to rebut the presumption because she presented no evidence of an increase in wage levels since her injury, that she was working additional hours, or that she was being paid out of her employer’s sympathy.

       Despite the fact that an administrative law judge held an employee to the correct burden of proof with regard to her claim for workers’ compensation benefits based on depression and anxiety secondary to an accident, the record lacked substantial evidence to support a finding that the employee was entitled to benefits because the medical record did not indicate that her condition was the result of the accident.

       An employee’s usual routine upon reaching the place of business where he worked is irrelevant, and an expert medical witness, in response to a hypothetical question, should not take into consideration “an invariable practice” unless it was proved that the employee followed that routine on the occasion when his death resulted.

       It is doubtful that a presumption of causal connection arises at all unless the claimant dies, because, if he lives, it is within his power, and it is his duty, to meet the burden of showing that his injury arose out of and in the course of his employment.

       It is not necessary to show that the exertion which occurred in precipitating the harm was not in itself unusual or beyond the routine of the employment, but, provided the causal relationship to the employment is shown, aggravating, precipitating, or combining with the disease or infirmity to produce death, the exertion may be usual and customary, and still satisfy the requirement that injury be accidental and arise out of the employment.

       The Workers’ Compensation Commission’s finding that the claimant’s exposure to chemicals in his employment did not result in an injury was not based on substantial evidence since (1) there was no doubt that the claimant suffered an injury, (2) the connections between the claimant’s work environment and his health were simply too numerous to be purely coincidental, and (3) although the claimant was better, his future employment was limited in general and he was permanently restricted from working around such chemicals as found at his employment.

The undisputed testimony demonstrated that he earned half of his regular salary as a long-haul truck driver while driving short hauls or working in the loading and packing divisions, and that he had sought light duty work from both his employer and his union, but that none was offered; thus, an award of permanent partial disability benefits was proper.

       Where the testimony of heart specialist testifying on behalf of claimants and the employer and its insurance carrier clearly showed that regular work such as deceased was doing as the sole attendant of a busy filling station would aggravate the deceased’s heart condition, the conclusion of the workmen’s compensation commission that complainants had failed to prove that the death of the deceased arose out of and in the course of his employment was against the weight of the evidence.

       Where it appeared that a mechanic, who had a pre-existing heart ailment, suffered a fatal attack while driving to a nearby farm to repair a cotton picker as directed by the shop foreman, testimony of lay witnesses and a medical expert, who appeared to be of the opinion that the heart attack which the deceased suffered was probably precipitated by the work that he was performing, was sufficient to justify an award to claimants, although another medical expert had testified that in his opinion there was no causal relationship between the deceased’s employment during the day and his death.

       Under the evidence, including medical testimony, the attorney-referee and the commission properly found that the activities of the deceased as a butcher or market man in the meat department of the employer’s store caused the deceased’s fatal heart attack, and it was not necessary that the claimants show that the deceased had had a pre-existing heart condition or other physical infirmity which could have been aggravated by the work of the deceased.

       A claimant failed to make the requisite showing that her mental condition was causally connected to her employment where 2 doctors testified that the claimant had suffered from psychological disorders prior to the incident alleged to have caused her mental injury, the Workers’ Compensation Commission found the testimony of another doctor, who diagnosed the claimant as having severe post-traumatic stress disorder and major depression with some psychotic symptoms, to be unconvincing, and the incident alleged to have caused the claimant’s mental injury-a private meeting with her supervisor during which the supervisor threatened to fire her-was not an “untoward event.” Bates v.

       The evidence was sufficient to support the Workers’ Compensation Commission’s finding that an employee’s mental disability was caused by a deliberate course of conduct by his employer and that there was nothing in his psychological background to suggest a pre-existing personality disorder, so that the stresses to which the employee was subjected were “more than the ordinary incidents of employment” and were “untoward events or unusual occurrences” culminating in his subsequent disability, where a psychiatrist who treated the employee for over 2 years testified that the employee was psychologically disabled and that his work played a significant part in causing it, and testimony from the employee, the employee’s wife, and fellow employees established a protracted pattern by the employer to put pressure and stress upon the employee.

       Evidence, though conflicting, was sufficient to support Workers’ Compensation Commission’s finding that claimant engulfed in ammonia gas at work suffered compensable injury, but Commission erred in finding that he suffered permanent and total disability, where evidence revealed that pre-existing condition, emphysema, contributed to lung ailment.

       A claimant who has once been adjudged totally and permanently disabled and who has received benefits therefor, but who thereafter resumes gainful employment and becomes injured while so engaged, is not precluded from receiving benefits for loss of wage earning capacity arising out of the later injury; however, a claimant may not pyramid benefits and receive in excess of the maximum weekly benefit provided by statute during any one period.

       Mental injury of worker unaccompanied by physical trauma is not directly linked to untoward event, unusual occurrence, accident or injury incident to employment, as required for worker to be entitled to worker’s compensation benefits, where worker claims that mental injury results from termination of worker due to business conditions eliminating need for worker’s employment; if worker were entitled to benefits at all, it would only be to apportioned benefits if worker has long history of mental and emotional disorders prior to termination.

       It is not necessary that a pre-existing infirmity produce industrial disability prior to an aggravating or supplemental injury, or that it be such as normally would result in disability in time because of the normal progress of the disease, nor is it necessary that the prior infirmity itself have been directly aggravated; the test of the applicability of the apportionment statute is whether the prior infirmity contributed to the employee’s disability.

       In an action on a claim for workmen’s compensation benefits, evidence that the claimant, while at work, slipped and sustained pain to his back, which necessitated his taking some days from work, and that upon his return, he again hurt his back picking up a heavy object, sustained the commission’s findings that a bulge or herniated disc and a resultant disability arose out of and in the course of the claimant’s employment, notwithstanding other evidence that the claimant prior to these injuries was found to have a degree of degenerative arthritis of some duration, and medical testimony suggesting that at least part of the disability was attributable to the pre-existing degenerative condition. Central Electric & Machinery Co. v. Shelton, 220 So. 2d 320, 1969 Miss. LEXIS 1454 (Miss. 1969).

       The 1968 amendment incorporated in this section [Code 1942, § 6998-04] the limitations on apportionment established in Cockrell Banana Co. v. Harris (Miss. 1968) 212 So. 2d 581. Delta Millwork, Inc. v. Terry, 216 So. 2d 542, 1968 Miss. LEXIS 1244 (Miss. 1968).

       Apportionment of death benefits should begin from the date of the employee’s death, applicable to both weekly and maximum compensation. Mississippi Stationery Co. v. Segal, 214 So. 2d 820, 1968 Miss. LEXIS 1335 (Miss. 1968).
      </p>
      <p>
       Apportionment of a disability claim should be applied to weekly and maximum benefits when the claimant has reached maximum medical recovery. Mississippi Stationery Co. v. Segal, 214 So. 2d 820, 1968 Miss. LEXIS 1335 (Miss. 1968).
      </p>
      <p>
       To give the apportionment statute the meaning intended by the legislature, maximum benefits, as well as weekly, are to be subjected to apportionment. Cockrell Banana Co. v. Harris, 212 So. 2d 581, 1968 Miss. LEXIS 1290 (Miss. 1968).
      </p>
      <p>
       Apportionment of disability payments should start as of the time the claimant has reached maximum medical recovery. Cockrell Banana Co. v. Harris, 212 So. 2d 581, 1968 Miss. LEXIS 1290 (Miss. 1968).
      </p>
      <p>
       The date of maximum recovery and the determination of apportionment are questions to be decided by the attorney-referee, subject to review by the full commission; and these are not matters to be determined by the employer or carrier. Cockrell Banana Co. v. Harris, 212 So. 2d 581, 1968 Miss. LEXIS 1290 (Miss. 1968).
      </p>
      <p>
       After the date the employee reaches maximum medical recovery, weekly compensation benefits in the language of the statute shall be reduced by that proportion which the pre-existing physical handicap, disease, or lesion contributes to the results following injury. Cockrell Banana Co. v. Harris, 212 So. 2d 581, 1968 Miss. LEXIS 1290 (Miss. 1968).
      </p>
      <p>
       Apportionment of the maximum death benefit is implicit in apportionment of weekly benefits. B. & D. Theatres, Inc. v. Davis, 190 So. 2d 845, 1966 Miss. LEXIS 1400 (Miss. 1966), overruled,

       The percentage of contribution of a prior condition to an injury is not ordinarily susceptible of exact proof, and the estimate of the commission that a motion picture projectionist, who suffered a coronary occlusion on the job and died of the resulting myocardial infarction, had a pre-existing atherosclerosis constituting a 25 percent contribution to the condition which caused his death will not be overturned on appeal in the absence of evidence reflecting that the commission abused its discretion. B. & D. Theatres, Inc. v. Davis, 190 So. 2d 845, 1966 Miss. LEXIS 1400 (Miss. 1966), overruled,
   Cockrell Banana Co. v. Harris, 212 So. 2d 581, 1968 Miss. LEXIS 1290 (Miss. 1968).
      </p>
      <p>
       When the effect of a claimant’s work-connected injury has subsided, and the injury no longer combines with a pre-existing disease or infirmity to produce disability, any subsequent disability attributable solely to the pre-existing disease or infirmity is not compensable. Lee v. Lumberton Mfg. Co., 198 So. 2d 823, 1967 Miss. LEXIS 1279 (Miss. 1967); M. T. Reed Constr. Co. v. Garrett, 249 Miss. 892, 164 So. 2d 476, 1964 Miss. LEXIS 444 (Miss. 1964).
      </p>
      <p>
       Generally it is necessary for the employer to plead and prove the existence of a pre-existing disease or infirmity in order to be able to claim the benefits of an apportionment. Mississippi Tank Co. v. Dependents of Walker, 187 So. 2d 590, 1966 Miss. LEXIS 1354 (Miss. 1966).
      </p>
      <p>
       The burden of proof is upon the employer to prove by a preponderance of the evidence all of the factors required by the apportionment statute, and these factors are the existence of a pre-existing handicap, disease or lesion, which is a material contributing factor to the results following injury, and these factors must be shown by medical findings. Bill Williams Feed Service v. Mangum, 183 So. 2d 917, 1966 Miss. LEXIS 1453 (Miss. 1966).
      </p>
      <p>
       The basic purpose of the apportionment provision is to encourage employers to employ handicapped persons with pre-existing disease or lesion, whom a prospective employer would be reluctant to employ in the absence of the apportionment provision. Thyer Mfg. Co. v. Mooney, 252 Miss. 629, 173 So. 2d 652, 1965 Miss. LEXIS 1134 (Miss. 1965).
      </p>
      <p>
       The reduction in compensation benefits due to the results following injury by a pre-existing handicap, disease or lesion, refers to benefits which the insured employee will not receive at all, not to benefits which will be paid by someone else. Thyer Mfg. Co. v. Mooney, 252 Miss. 629, 173 So. 2d 652, 1965 Miss. LEXIS 1134 (Miss. 1965).
      </p>
      <p>
       Compensation is required to be reduced by the proportion which a pre-existing physical handicap, disease or lesion contributes to the production of the results following the injury. Dillingham Mfg. Co. v. Upton, 252 Miss. 281, 172 So. 2d 766, 1965 Miss. LEXIS 1100 (Miss. 1965), overruled,
   Cockrell Banana Co. v. Harris, 212 So. 2d 581, 1968 Miss. LEXIS 1290 (Miss. 1968), but see Cockrell Banana Co. v. Harris, 212 So. 2d 581, 1968 Miss. LEXIS 1290 (Miss. 1968).

       Apportionment on account of a pre-existing injury cannot be made where without basis in pleading and proof. Mississippi Federated Cooperatives v. Roberts, 248 Miss. 732, 160 So. 2d 922, 1964 Miss. LEXIS 298 (Miss. 1964).
      </p>
      <p>
       Before an award may be reduced by reason of a pre-existing physical condition, it must be shown by medical findings not only that there was a pre-existing handicap, disease or lesion but also that such condition contributed to the results following the injury. L. B. Priester & Son, Inc. v. Dependents of Bynum, 247 Miss. 664, 157 So. 2d 399, 1963 Miss. LEXIS 340 (Miss. 1963).

       Employer has burden of showing that disability is in part due to pre-existing physical condition. I. Taitel & Son v. Twiner, 247 Miss. 785, 157 So. 2d 44, 1963 Miss. LEXIS 356 (Miss. 1963).
      </p>
      <p>
       The commission’s conclusion as to the degree to which pre-existing disease contributed to the injury will not be set aside by the courts unless not supported by substantial evidence or manifestly wrong. Southeastern Constr. Co. v. Dependent of Dodson, 247 Miss. 1, 153 So. 2d 276, 1963 Miss. LEXIS 277 (Miss. 1963).
      </p>
      <p>
       The extent to which a demonstrated physical condition contributed to an employee’s death is in the sound discretion of the workmen’s compensation commission. Southeastern Constr. Co. v. Dependent of Dodson, 247 Miss. 1, 153 So. 2d 276, 1963 Miss. LEXIS 277 (Miss. 1963).
      </p>
      <p>
       The provision for a proportionate reduction of compensation for disability to which a pre-existing condition has contributed should be construed in a fair manner, equitably and justly. Cuevas v. Sutter Well Works, 245 Miss. 478, 150 So. 2d 524, 1963 Miss. LEXIS 529 (Miss. 1963).
      </p>

       A reduction of compensation under this section [Code 1942, § 6998-04] must be supported by substantial evidence. Cuevas v. Sutter Well Works, 245 Miss. 478, 150 So. 2d 524, 1963 Miss. LEXIS 529 (Miss. 1963).
      </p>
      <p>
       Under this provision the burden is on the employer and his insurer to establish by a preponderance of evidence a pre-existing condition shown by medical findings to be a material contributing factor in the results following injury, and the proportion of such contribution. Cuevas v. Sutter Well Works, 245 Miss. 478, 150 So. 2d 524, 1963 Miss. LEXIS 529 (Miss. 1963).

   Mississippi Workers’ Compensation Commission did not err when it apportioned an employee’s right extremity award, under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c03s71-3-7" target="_self">71-3-7</a></cite>, because the employee’s prior injuries prevented her from working in her previous capacity, the employee did not have a latent prior condition, the employee had prior injuries for which she was compensated, and the Commission could have found that those prior injuries were a material contributing factor to her subsequent injuries.

       The Workers’ Compensation Commission properly apportioned an employee’s disabilities between 2 injuries where there was no evidence of a causal connection between the 2 injuries. Cawthon v. Alcan Aluminum Corp., 599 So. 2d 925, 1991 Miss. LEXIS 713 (Miss. 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       Apportionment of an award of compensation based on the claimant’s pre-existing heart condition was proper, even though his pre-existing heart condition caused no pre-injury occupational disability, since the heart attack which left the plaintiff permanently and totally disabled was materially contributed to by his pre-existing obstructive pulmonary disease and his hypertension. Mitchell Buick, Pontiac & Equipment Co. v. Cash, 592 So. 2d 978, 1991 Miss. LEXIS 980 (Miss. 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Workers’ Compensation Commission’s apportionment of an award of death benefits by 2/3 on the basis of pre-existing health conditions was supported by substantial evidence where the worker, who died of a heart attack arising out of and in the course of his employment, had smoked 3 packs of cigarettes daily since his teenage years and consumed approximately “1/2 bottle of alcohol” daily for an unspecified number of years, and his family had a history of heart-related problems.

      <p>
       In work-connected injury cases where the evidence establishes (a) successive injuries experienced by the employee where following the first injury the employee engages in full-time employment for a substantial period of time prior to the second injury; or (b) a preexisting (symptomatic or asymptomatic) condition which causes the employee to experience no pre-injury occupational disability, apportionment may not be ordered. On the other hand, in cases where (a) there is evidence of a medically cognizable, identifiable, symptomatic condition which antedated the injury; and (b) the employee experienced some absence of normal (for him or her) wage earning capacity, then apportionment must be ordered.

       Where it was undisputed that deceased had a history of hypertensive vascular disease dating from about 1962, apportionment of benefits should be ordered. Alexander v. Campbell Constr. Co., 288 So. 2d 4, 1974 Miss. LEXIS 1834 (Miss. 1974).
      </p>

       Where a claimant had no functional disability before he sustained a transient myocardial ischemia while carrying a water pump and hose weighing about 300 pounds with another worker in the course of his employment, but was permanently disabled, as a result of that injury, from performing the type of work in which he had engaged before the injury, the testimony of the examining physician that the claimant had some degree of pre-existing arteriosclerosis was insufficient to substantiate the commission’s finding that the claimant’s disability was entirely due to his pre-existing arteriosclerosis, and the claimant was entitled to permanent disability benefits apportioned in accordance with the degree to which his pre-existing infirmity contributed to his disability. Youngblood v. Ralph M. Parsons Co., 260 So. 2d 188, 1972 Miss. LEXIS 1552 (Miss. 1972).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a claimant, who suffered a head injury in the course of his employment, which resulted in disabling epileptic seizures, had previously suffered from other conditions including a chronic urinary tract infection and a chronic peptic ulcer, apportionment was required, aside from any aggravation of the convulsions by the infection, where the prior conditions actively contributed to the claimant’s disability before the injury, causing many absences from work, and continued to operate as a source of disability after the accident. International Paper Co. v. Tiffee, 246 So. 2d 535, 1971 Miss. LEXIS 1411 (Miss. 1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the claimants’ decedent had suffered a major heart attack six months before his final and fatal heart attack which was found to have been precipitated by his job activities, there was sufficient evidence in the record to support a finding that a pre-existing condition contributed to the death, and to require apportionment if benefits were awarded, even though the defendants, who pleaded a pre-existing disease and requested apportionment, offered no proof on this issue.

       Where a claimant’s physician testified on cross-examination that the lifting of a ten-pound sack of potatoes was insufficient to cause a herniated thoracic disc unless there was a pre-existing disease which had weakened the spine, and where an x-ray report of the claimant’s spine indicated that there was a degenerative disease of the lower spine, the cause was to be remanded to the commission for a determination as to the duration of temporary disability and the remaining permanent disability with compensation properly apportioned.

      <p>
       Where, following a traverse fracture of the upper one third of the right femur received in the course of his employment, claimant’s leg was amputated, and the evidence established that the amputation was necessitated in part by claimant’s pre-existing osteomyelitis, apportionment of his compensation award was proper.

      </p>
      <p>
       Where there is competent evidence properly before the commission in the form of medical findings of a pre-existing physical handicap, disease or lesion, and proof is undisputed that this was a material contributing factor in the results, it is mandatory under this section [Code 1942, § 6998-04] that the compensation be reduced.

      <p>
       Mississippi Workers’ Compensation Commission’s decision not to apportion disability benefits as a result of a claimant’s preexisting conditions was based on substantial evidence. There was nothing in the record to show that the claimant’s diabetes hindered the claimant from performing the claimant’s job duties as a deputy sheriff, and there was very little evidence describing the claimant’s heart condition, and no mention of how, if at all, it affected the claimant’s ability to perform the claimant’s job duties. Leflore County Bd. of Supervisors v. Golden, 169 So.3d 882, 2014 Miss. App. LEXIS 86 (Miss. Ct. App. 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       No proof existed showing that the employee’s pre-existing high blood pressure or his enlarged heart caused him any loss of wage earning capacity prior to the date of a syncope episode, and until that time he was able to perform the functions of his employment without limitation; under these circumstances, apportionment of the employee’s benefits was inappropriate. Hinds County Bd. of Supervisors v. Johnson, 977 So. 2d 1193, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 578 (Miss. Ct. App. 2007), cert. denied, 977 So. 2d 1144, 2008 Miss. LEXIS 133 (Miss. 2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       While two physicians did state that claimant’s knee injuries sustained at work were exacerbated and perpetuated by claimant’s morbid obesity, and while only preexisting occupational disabilities generated a duty to apportion, in claimant’s case, neither party raised the issue of apportionment, nor was there any evidence presented to prove that claimant had a preexisting disability that caused claimant to be occupationally disabled prior to claimant’s injury at work; thus, the commission’s ruling that claimant had failed to prove that claimant was entitled to permanent disability benefits beyond the 3 percent impairment ratings assigned to each knee was not clearly erroneous or contrary to the overwhelming weight of the evidence. McMillian v. Delphi Packard Elec. Sys., 921 So. 2d 345, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 211 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004), cert. denied, 926 So. 2d 922, 2006 Miss. LEXIS 162 (Miss. 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       Substantial evidence supported an award of permanent partial disability benefits to a claimant resulting from the industrial loss of use of the claimant’s upper extremities due to a work-related injury while employed by the employer; the claimant suffered no prior occupational disability that would have required apportionment of the award. Peco Foods of Miss., Inc. v. Keyes, 820 So. 2d 775, 2002 Miss. App. LEXIS 373 (Miss. Ct. App. 2002).
      </p>
      <p>
       Apportionment was not required in a heart injury case involving a firefighter who worked for a city for over 20 years, but who became unable to work or procure any employment that would not put his life in danger; although the claimant may have been at risk because of family history for pre-existing medical infirmities, those difficulties were not occupational disabilities, and the stress of his job ignited what had been a dormant condition. City of Laurel v. Blackledge, 1999 Miss. App. LEXIS 333 (Miss. Ct. App. June 22, 1999), op. withdrawn, sub. op., 755 So. 2d 573, 2000 Miss. App. LEXIS 88 (Miss. Ct. App. 2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       Apportionment is not proper based on evidence that factors other than those related to the job activity immediately in question contributed to the disabling condition where there is no showing of previous occupational disability.

       There is no basis upon which to award apportionment where cause of employee’s death remained unknown, despite testimony regarding possibility employee had suffered attack of acute malignant arrhythmia.

      </p>
      <p>
       Apportionment was not required upon a showing that up to the time of injury, employee, who had a pre-existing spondylosis, was gainfully employed, and was experiencing no occupational disability as a result of his pre-existing condition. Marshall Durbin, Inc. v. Hall, 490 So. 2d 877, 1986 Miss. LEXIS 2493 (Miss. 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       Compensation is not apportionable until the date of maximum medical recovery, regardless of whether an injury is permanent and total or of lower quality and character; thus, a 10% penalty was correctly applied to the unapportioned amounts payable prior to the date of maximum medical recovery. M. D. Hayles Lumber, Inc. v. Hamilton, 366 So. 2d 1075, 1978 Miss. LEXIS 2440 (Miss. 1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the nature of the alleged preexisting disease was more closely akin to the normal degenerative conditions of the body which accompany age rather than a material contributing factor to the claimant’s condition following injury, the employer was not entitled to apportionment. Huffman v. State, 324 So. 2d 759, 1976 Miss. LEXIS 1973 (Miss. 1976).
      </p>
      <p>
       The record of a prior adjudication of total and permanent disability of a claimant by the workmen’s compensation commission is not sufficient evidence, standing alone, upon which benefits for a subsequent injury may be apportioned and reduced; it was incumbent upon the employer-carrier to not only prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the claimant continued to have his preexisting physical handicap or disease, but additionally, the burden was upon them to prove by medical findings that such preexisting physical handicap or disease was a material contributing factor to his disability following the subsequent injury.

       Worker made a voluntary decision to leave his area of employment and climb 25 feet up a tree, where he was not present and ready to further his employer’s business, and falling out of a tree was not a risk incident to his employment as a pipefitter; the worker’s tree climbing was a complete and serious deviation from his employment and therefore not within the scope and course of his employment, and thus his injury sustained after falling out of the tree was not compensable.

       There was substantial evidence to support the Workers’ Compensation Commission’s conclusion that the worker’s actions did not constitute a willful intent to cause injury to himself, given that the company cited no authority that would have equated the worker’s actions to willful intent, and there was no evidence establishing that his lack of sleep or consumption of pain medication would have caused the accident or shown a willful intent to injure himself.

      <p>
       Under the statute, if the injury or death has been caused by the wilful act of a third person it must be shown that such wilful act was directed against the employee because of his employment while so employed and working on the job, and there must be shown some causal connection between the injury and employment other than the mere fact that the employment brought the employee to the place where he was injured, and the employment must have been connected with the injury in some more direct manner than merely furnishing an opportunity for the employee to be assaulted.

   Employee admitted during testimony that the machine should have been turned off when working on it, and he admitted that he knew how to turn off the machine. He clearly was injured because he failed to properly operate the machine and his level of intoxication (a blood alcohol level of .129 percent about two hours after the accident),was significant; his intoxication was so significant, a pharmacologist opined that his injury was proximately caused by his intoxication, and therefore, pursuant to Miss.

       Intoxication or impairment by other substances, legal or illegal, is not an issue in whether benefits for an injury arising on the job are payable; although the discovery of such conduct before it causes injury may appropriately result in the termination or other discipline of the employee, these considerations cannot result in the denial of disability benefits once an otherwise compensable injury has occurred.

       Restrictions imposed by the seller of standing timber on its removal do not make the buyer a contractor for its removal so as to render him liable for compensation to a workman of one employed by him. Nickerson v. Patridge, 241 Miss. 40, 128 So. 2d 751, 1961 Miss. LEXIS 316 (Miss. 1961).

       Operators of sawmills and their employees who cut and saw standing timber owned by a planing mill and deliver it there for a stated sum per thousand feet, are not employees of the planing mill, which merely designated the timber to be cut, within the Employers Liability Ins.

       Denial of compensation upon the ground that claimants’ decedent was an independent contractor at the time he was killed on lumber company’s premises while unloading logs from a truck was supported by substantial evidence.

       Where claimant was a painter who was engaged in separate business and held himself out to the public as performing an independent service in that he furnished his own tools and equipment, employed his own helpers and paid them their wages, directed the manner of the work, and contracted for a definite completed job, and that he represented the will of his employer only as the result of his work, the claimant was an independent contractor and was not entitled to compensation for injuries sustained.

       In a suit for workmen’s compensation benefits, where deceased was hired to splice a cable on oil well drilling rig and he was not subject to supervision or control of drilling company, and he began to work when it suited him, finished his job and presented his bill, the deceased was an independent contractor and not within coverage under Workmen's Compensation Law.

       Although the employer claimed that apportioning 50 percent of the employee’s benefits to it was improper because stress could not be held to be 50 percent responsible for the employee’s heart attack, and that the employee’s retirement benefits had to be included in the computation of the employee’s average weekly wage, the employer failed to cite any authority in support of its arguments; therefore, the issues were procedurally barred as an assignment of error that was unsupported by any legal authority and need not be considered by the appellate court. Miss. Dep't of Pub. Safety v. Pickens, 859 So. 2d 1057, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 1092 (Miss. Ct. App. 2003).

       Workers’ Compensation Commission’s order was final for purposes of appeal because it determined all matters among the parties and nothing had been retained by Commission or remanded to administrative law judge for further consideration.

       A finding that a claimant was not entitled to permanent disability benefits because his disability, which arose from slippage in the spine, was attributable entirely to preexisting spondylolisthesis was not supported by substantial evidence where there was conflicting medical testimony from 2 treating physicians as to the cause of the claimant’s permanent disability and neither physician could determine how and when the slippage actually occurred, since close questions of compensability should be resolved in favor of the claimant, and the Workers’ Compensation Act should be liberally construed to carry out its remedial purpose.

       There was substantial evidence in a physician’s testimony to support the Workers’ Compensation Commission’s determination as to the date a claimant reached maximum medical recovery, and therefore the circuit court erred in finding a different date based on the opinion of another physician. Jordan v. Hercules, Inc., 600 So. 2d 179, 1992 Miss. LEXIS 224 (Miss. 1992), but see Dulaney v. National Pizza Co., 733 So. 2d 301, 1998 Miss. App. LEXIS 990 (Miss. Ct. App. 1998).

      <p>
       While the Administrative Judge is generally, within the Workers’ Compensation Commission, the individual who conducts the hearing and hears the live testimony, the Commission itself is, in law, the finder of the facts, and on judicial review, the Commission’s findings and decisions are subject to the normal deferential standards, notwithstanding the Administrative Judge’s actions. Walker Mfg. Co. v. Cantrell, 577 So. 2d 1243, 1991 Miss. LEXIS 190 (Miss. 1991).

      </p>
      <p>
       Decisions of the Mississippi Workers’ Compensation Commission on issues of fact will not be overturned if they are supported by substantial evidence. The Commission is the trier of facts as well as the judge of the credibility of the witnesses. Doubtful cases should be resolved in favor of compensation so as to fulfill the beneficial purposes of the statute. Miller Transporters, Inc. v. Guthrie, 554 So. 2d 917, 1989 Miss. LEXIS 495 (Miss. 1989).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because in Mississippi right to compensation benefits is committed to both trier of fact in bad faith tort action and administrative factfinder under Workers’ Compensation Act, and resolution of bad faith claim is totally dependent on validity of underlying compensation claim, exhaustion of administrative remedies on underlying compensation issue is required where plaintiff has initiated administrative proceedings prior to filing bad faith tort action, however, decision is limited to those situations were injured claimant institutes administrative proceedings and subsequently files bad faith claim prior to final conclusion of administrative process, and if administrative process is terminated at some point then no exhaustion of administrative remedies requirement exists. Kitchens v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 659 F. Supp. 467, 1987 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13850 (S.D. Miss. 1987).

       Determination of the degree of contribution of the preexisting disease or injury is a question of fact for the Workmen’s Compensation Commission which should not be disturbed unless the finding lacks substantial support in the evidence or is manifestly wrong.

      </p>
      <p>
       An adverse decision on the merits of the claim by the employee while he was alive bars a dependency claim under the doctrine of res judicata, for the questions have already been fully litigated, and all parties were involved and necessarily so in the manner in which the injury was received. Proctor v. Ingalls Shipbuilding Corp., 254 Miss. 907, 183 So. 2d 483, 1966 Miss. LEXIS 1586 (Miss. 1966).
      </p>
      <p>
       The time within which an award affirmed by the supreme court must be paid in order to avoid the statutory penalty runs from the time a suggestion of error was overruled, and not from the subsequent issue of the court’s mandate. Decker v. Bryan Bros. Packing Co., 249 Miss. 6, 162 So. 2d 648, 1964 Miss. LEXIS 369 (Miss. 1964).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the attorney-referee and commission had adjudicated liability for compensation benefits as to the insured member of a partnership and his insurance carrier, the failure to adjudicate the liability of the uninsured partner, who was also liable for payment of the compensation, gave the insurance carrier an appealable interest in the correctness of the commission’s order; hence, the order of the commission was modified so as to adjudicate the liability for payment and compensation against the uninsured partner in addition to the insured partner’s carrier. United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co. v. Collins, 231 Miss. 319, 95 So. 2d 456, 1957 Miss. LEXIS 516, 1957 Miss. LEXIS 517 (Miss. 1957).

      <p>
       Owner of a petroleum refinery plant was not immune from a negligence action filed by a contractor’s employee, and thus, it was subject to the employee’s tort claim as “any other party,” because it was not statutory employer of the employee; the owner had no duty as an employer or contractor to secure workers’ compensation insurance, and its act of voluntarily purchasing coverage did not change its status.

   Decedent’s employer was not entitled to immunity from suit under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c03s71-3-7" target="_self">71-3-7</a></cite> because it did not indirectly secure workers compensation coverage for its employees by reimbursing a timber company, for whom the employer was a subcontractor, for the workers compensation coverage it obtained for the employer’s employees. The court rejected the employer’s argument that it was entitled to “down-the-line” immunity because it assumed that it was the legislative intent not to create this immunity. Lamar v.

      <p>
       Administrative law judge (ALJ) and the Workers’ Compensation Commission both failed to recognize that the claimant’s return to work created a rebuttable presumption that the claimant suffered no loss of earning capacity. The ALJ committed legal error by failing to recognize this presumption, and the Commission and the appellate court failed to correct the error. Hudspeth Reg'l Ctr. v. Mitchell, 202 So.3d 609, 2016 Miss. LEXIS 438 (Miss. 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       Mississippi Workers’ Compensation Commission’s finding that there was no loss of wage-earning capacity was supported by substantial evidence because the evidence showed that the claimant could have returned to the claimant’s previous job had there been a job available, and that the claimant could have found employment earning the same amount of pre-injury income. Whiddon v. Southern Concrete Pumping, LLC, 114 So.3d 18, 2013 Miss. App. LEXIS 208 (Miss. Ct. App. 2013).
      </p>
      <p>
       Denial of permanent partial disability benefits to the employee in a workers’ compensation action was improper because his post-injury income would have been higher but for a climbing restriction and therefore, the Workers’ Compensation Commission erred by finding that the injury had no impact on his wage-earning potential.

   Language in the uninsured motorist statute, Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.83.html#t83c11s83-11-101" target="_blank">83-11-101</a></cite>, as well as the insured’s UM policy, required that the insured be legally entitled to recover from the owner or operator of the uninsured vehicle; since that insured could not bring a legal action against the co-employee at the time of the accident under Miss.

   Employee’s claim against his employer for bad faith failure to pay worker’s compensation benefits was not barred by the exclusivity provision in Miss.

       <p>
   Movie production company was not liable to its purported employees as the actress suing for benefits after she settled with the movie production company on her workers’ compensation claim did not show the purported employees were not her co-employees who enjoyed, pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c03s71-3-9" target="_self">71-3-9</a></cite>, the same immunity the movie production company received once it settled its workers’ compensation claim with her.

       Material issue of fact existed as to whether physician was employee of hospital, precluding summary judgment based on exclusivity of Workers’ Compensation Act in third party action by hospital against corporation that provided physician, arising out of malpractice claim against physician and hospital brought by patient who was claimed to be hospital employee. Russell v. Orr, 700 So. 2d 619, 1997 Miss. LEXIS 508 (Miss. 1997).

      </p>
      <p>
       Even if physician and patient were employees of hospital, material issue of fact existed as to whether patient sought treatment as member of general public or in course of her employment, precluding summary judgment for physician and hospital on patient’s malpractice claim based on co-employee status or exclusivity feature of Workers' Compensation Act. Russell v. Orr, 700 So. 2d 619, 1997 Miss. LEXIS 508 (Miss. 1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       Prime contractor was statutory employer of sub-subcontractor’s employee, and thus, was immune from liability under Workers’ Compensation Act’s exclusivity of remedy provision in negligence action brought by injured employee, where sub-subcontractor provided compensation coverage to its employees pursuant to its contract with prime contractor. Bradshaw v. Rudder, 227 Miss. 143, 85 So. 2d 778, 1956 Miss. LEXIS 665 (Miss. 1956).
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
       The existence of a contract for indemnity changes the applicability of the exclusivity provision of the Workers’ Compensation Act; the enforcement of an indemnity clause which was freely entered into does not impugn the beneficent purposes of the Act because the employee will still be compensated. Heritage Cablevision v. New Albany Elec. Power Sys., 646 So. 2d 1305, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 599 (Miss. 1994).

   It was not necessary to join Mississippi city as “phantom party” defendant in suit by city employee alleging injury as result of corporation’s release of certain substances into city sewer system, so that jury could fully apportion fault under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.85.html#t85c05s85-5-7" target="_blank">85-5-7</a></cite> even though plaintiff could not sue city directly and corporation could not seek contribution from city, as result of mandate of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c03s71-3-9" target="_self">71-3-9</a></cite>. Statute did not contain clear command that alleged joint-tortfeasors be joined in such a way. White v. Esmark Apparel, 788 F. Supp. 907, 1992 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5771 (N.D. Miss. 1992), aff'd, in part, 44 F.3d 1005, 1995 U.S. App. LEXIS 772 (5th Cir. Miss. 1995).

       Exclusivity provisions of Workers’ Compensation Act preclude consortium claim by wife of injured claimant in actions falling within scope of Act. Stevens v. FMC Corp., 515 So. 2d 928, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2883 (Miss. 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       Intent of legislature was that any common-law recovery or settlement was to be credited toward employer’s or insurer’s liability; liability cannot be imposed on employer under both common-law and Workers’ Compensation Act, as entitlement to one excludes other; decedent was either injured while acting in course and scope of employment thereby making employer liable under Worker’s Compensation Act, or was injured while not acting in course of employment thereby possibly rendering employer liable under common-law negligence liability; therefore, sums paid in settlement of common-law action against employer and co-employees are to be credited against employer’s obligation under Worker's Compensation Act. Sawyer v. Head, 510 So. 2d 472, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2427 (Miss. 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       An electrician who was employed by two companies simultaneously was not entitled to a judgment in an action for personal injuries against one of the companies where he had obtained settlement of a workman’s compensation claim against the second company. Ray v. Babcock & Wilcox Co., 388 So. 2d 166, 1980 Miss. LEXIS 2101 (Miss. 1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       The signing of an application for group insurance benefits is a factor to be considered in determining whether an injury was work connected or arose out of a pre-existing condition, but it is not per se a bar to a claim under the Workmen’s Compensation Law where the facts are in dispute. Central Electric & Machinery Co. v. Shelton, 220 So. 2d 320, 1969 Miss. LEXIS 1454 (Miss. 1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       The requirement that an employer must secure payment of compensation means that he must have in effect an insurance policy complying with the Workmen’s Compensation Law, or that he must qualify as a self-insurer. Taylor v. Crosby Forest Products Co., 198 So. 2d 809, 1967 Miss. LEXIS 1271 (Miss. 1967).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the employer secured the payment of compensation to his employees by qualifying as a self-insurer, the remedy of an employee arises only under the Workmen’s Compensation Law, and that statutory remedy being exclusive, no action at law is available to the employee. Taylor v. Crosby Forest Products Co., 198 So. 2d 809, 1967 Miss. LEXIS 1271 (Miss. 1967).
      </p>
      <p>
       A claim for disability under the compensation law is not a suit to recover damages growing out of an industrial injury, but is compensation for loss of earnings as a result of an industrial injury, or the loss to the dependents of a worker because of his death. Thyer Mfg. Co. v. Mooney, 252 Miss. 629, 173 So. 2d 652, 1965 Miss. LEXIS 1134 (Miss. 1965).
      </p>
      <p>
       An employer’s liability under the Workmen’s Compensation Law is not affected by his failure to obtain insurance. Dependents of Dawson v. Delta Western Exploration Co., 245 Miss. 335, 147 So. 2d 485, 1962 Miss. LEXIS 556 (Miss. 1962).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section [Code 1942, § 6998-05] deprives the employee of his common-law right of action against the employer for compensatory damages. L. B. Priester & Son, Inc. v. Bynum, 244 Miss. 185, 137 So. 2d 907, 1962 Miss. LEXIS 438 (Miss. 1962).
      </p>
      <p>
       An employer’s purchase of a $5,000 policy on the life of an employee did not release him from liability to the widow and dependents of the employee for benefits they were entitled to under the Workmen’s Compensation Law following the death of the employee in the course of employment. Riddell v. Estate of Cagle, 227 Miss. 305, 85 So. 2d 926, 1956 Miss. LEXIS 689 (Miss. 1956).
      </p>
      <p>
       Immunity to common-law suits is extended to statutory employers who come within the provisions of Code 1942, § 6998-04. Mosley v. Jones, 224 Miss. 725, 80 So. 2d 819, 1955 Miss. LEXIS 535 (Miss. 1955).

       Because the court of appeals decided as a matter of law that the employee was acting in the course and scope of his employment when he was injured, that his injuries were not the result of an intentional tort, and that his injuries were compensable under the Mississippi Workers’ Compensation Act, the exclusivity provision of the act barred his tort claims against the employer, and the trial court erred when it denied the employer’s motion for summary judgment. Hurdle v. Holloway, 848 So. 2d 183, 2003 Miss. LEXIS 293 (Miss. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Wrongful death action was remanded because there was an arguably reasonable basis that a sub-subcontractor who did not have workers’ compensation insurance, but whose employees were covered by a statutory employer, was not entitled to the protection of the Workers’ Compensation Act’s exclusivity provision, Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c03s71-3-9" target="_self">71-3-9</a></cite>, and thus was not fraudulently joined. Culpepper v. Double R, Inc., 269 F. Supp. 2d 739, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11513 (S.D. Miss. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Remand was denied because claims against resident managers for personal injuries from exposure to vinyl chloride were actually negligence claims barred by the exclusivity provision of the Mississippi Workers’ Compensation Act, Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c03s71-3-9" target="_self">71-3-9</a></cite>, and thus the managers were fraudulently joined. Frye v. Airco, Inc., 269 F. Supp. 2d 743, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11530 (S.D. Miss. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       Two elements were necessary for an injured employee to avoid the Mississippi workers’ compensation exclusive liability provision: (1) the injury must have been caused by the willful act of another employee acting in the course of employment and in furtherance of the employee’s business, and (2) the injury had to be one that was not compensable under the Workers’ Compensation Act; where the elements were met, then it was appropriate to pursue a claim outside of the confines of the statute. Lewallen v. Slawson, 822 So. 2d 236, 2002 Miss. LEXIS 92 (Miss. 2002).
      </p>
      <p>
       Claimant may not collect on tort claim against employer or co-employee if evidence shows he is entitled to worker’s compensation benefits arising out of same occurrence, although there is nothing wrong with pursuing both remedies when benefits under both are denied. Sawyer v. Head, 510 So. 2d 472, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2427 (Miss. 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Workmen’s Compensation Law affords the exclusive remedy as between employers and employees, except that a claimant, if the employer does not secure compensation, may elect to claim benefits under the Law or sue at law, and if the latter course is pursued the negligence of a fellow servant, the assumption of risk, and contributory negligence cannot be interposed as defenses. Riddell v. Estate of Cagle, 227 Miss. 305, 85 So. 2d 926, 1956 Miss. LEXIS 689 (Miss. 1956).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Workmen’s Compensation Law does not make good faith of an employer in attempting to secure compensation insurance the test in determining whether an employee can sue at common law. McCoy v. Cornish, 220 Miss. 577, 71 So. 2d 304, 1954 Miss. LEXIS 474 (Miss. 1954).
      </p>
      <p>
       When accident happened to an employee, the employer had no compensation insurance and did not apply to the commission for a policy under the assigned risk plan, the employee had a right to bring a common-law action for damages in view of the fact that the employer failed to comply with the Workmen's Compensation Law. McCoy v. Cornish, 220 Miss. 577, 71 So. 2d 304, 1954 Miss. LEXIS 474 (Miss. 1954).

       Company did not waive its exclusive remedy defense because the issue had been at the forefront of the litigation throughout; the company’s third-party complaint made clear that the worker’s status as an employee or independent contractor was a central issue and its affirmative defense in the case, and the company never abandoned the issue in any sense or actively seek to litigate the underlying merits of the worker’s claim. Fortner v. Specialty Contr., LLC, 217 So.3d 736, 2017 Miss. App. LEXIS 54 (Miss. Ct. App. 2017).
      </p>
      <p>
       Doctrines of quasi-estoppel and equitable estoppel did not bar a company from denying that a worker was an independent contractor because the worker failed to articulate how he relied to his detriment on any representation by the company to show that it took inconsistent positions and that the company benefitted from any inconsistent position; the company’s failure to file a timely notice of the worker’s injury did not estop it from raising the exclusive remedy provision as a defense. Fortner v. Specialty Contr., LLC, 217 So.3d 736, 2017 Miss. App. LEXIS 54 (Miss. Ct. App. 2017).
      </p>
      <p>
       Circuit court properly granted a company summary judgment in a worker’s action alleging it was liable for its employee’s negligence because his exclusive remedy was under the Workers’ Compensation Law; the nature of the work was that of an employee covered by the Law because the work did not involve any particular skill or training, and the worker was not in the business of offering similar services to other entities as part of his own independent business. Fortner v. Specialty Contr., LLC, 217 So.3d 736, 2017 Miss. App. LEXIS 54 (Miss. Ct. App. 2017).
      </p>
      <p>
       Coverage under the Workers’ Compensation Law is not limited to employees who work directly with the owner of the business. Fortner v. Specialty Contr., LLC, 217 So.3d 736, 2017 Miss. App. LEXIS 54 (Miss. Ct. App. 2017).
      </p>
      <p>
       Worker’s exclusive remedy was under the Workers’ Compensation Law because pursuant to the “control test,” the worker was a company’s employee not an independent contractor; the company had the right to control the work and it exercised that right, the worker was paid a regular daily wage rather than a fixed fee for some project or job, and the company provided all necessary tools and could have fired him at any time. Fortner v. Specialty Contr., LLC, 217 So.3d 736, 2017 Miss. App. LEXIS 54 (Miss. Ct. App. 2017).
      </p>
      <p>
       Owner of a petroleum refinery plant was not immune from a negligence action filed by a contractor’s employee, and thus, it was subject to the employee’s tort claim as “any other party,” because it was not statutory employer of the employee; the owner had no duty as an employer or contractor to secure workers’ compensation insurance, and its act of voluntarily purchasing coverage did not change its status. Thomas v. Chevron U.S.A., Inc., 212 So.3d 58, 2017 Miss. LEXIS 27 (Miss. 2017).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Because the subcontractor could not be considered an “employee” of the department store company, it was not entitled to tort immunity under the exclusivity provision of the Workers’ Compensation Act, Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c03s71-3-9" target="_self">71-3-9</a></cite>. The subcontractor was in a much better position than a mere employee to distribute the cost of potential tort liability within the enterprise, as the subcontractor could include in its contract bid a price increase which reflected possible tort liability which would be passed on to the company as a cost of doing business. Durr v. MBS Constr. Corp., 665 F. Supp. 2d 700, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 84398 (S.D. Miss. 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Because defendant office owner lacked the control over plaintiff worker required to show an employment relationship and merely had a customer relationship with the worker’s employer cleaning service, the dual employment and borrowed servant doctrines did not apply and the owner had no immunity under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c03s71-3-9" target="_self">71-3-9</a></cite> as to the worker’s injury. Mims v. Renal Care Group, Inc., 395 F. Supp. 2d 458, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 36725 (S.D. Miss.), vacated, 399 F. Supp. 2d 740, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 41099 (S.D. Miss. 2005).

       <p>
   Trial court’s judgment was reversed and rendered to remove the jury’s allocation of contributory negligence as the employer conceded on appeal that the individual was an employee, and contributory negligence was not available as a defense under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c03s71-3-9" target="_self">71-3-9</a></cite> as the employer had not maintained workers’ compensation insurance. Renfroe v. Berryhill, 910 So. 2d 624, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 154 (Miss. Ct. App. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Where the decedent’s employer agreed under the subcontract with the contractor to provide workers’ compensation coverage to the employees, and the employer did so, the contractor was entitled to summary judgment pursuant to Miss. R. Civ. P. 56 in the decedent’s heirs’ wrongful death action; construing Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c03s71-3-7" target="_self">71-3-7</a></cite>, relating to a contractor’s obligation to provide workers’ compensation coverage, and Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c03s71-3-9" target="_self">71-3-9</a></cite>, the workers’ compensation exclusivity provision, together, it was determined that where the employer provided compensation coverage to its employees pursuant to the contract with the contractor, the contractor qualified as a statutory employer and was immune from tort liability claims by the heirs. Thornton v. W. E. Blain &amp; Sons, Inc., 878 So. 2d 1082, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 715 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Prime contractor was statutory employer of sub-subcontractor’s employee, and thus, was immune from liability under Workers’ Compensation Act’s exclusivity of remedy provision in negligence action brought by injured employee, where sub-subcontractor provided compensation coverage to its employees pursuant to its contract with prime contractor. Bradshaw v. Rudder, 227 Miss. 143, 85 So. 2d 778, 1956 Miss. LEXIS 665 (Miss. 1956).

   The defendant was the plaintiff’s statutory employer for purposes of the exclusivity provision of the Workers’ Compensation Act (§<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c03s71-3-9" target="_self">71-3-9</a></cite>) where (1) the plaintiff was originally employed by a temporary employment agency, which placed her in the job with the defendant, (2) the defendant controlled the performance of the work, the plaintiff acquiesced in the situation, and the plaintiff’s original employer temporarily terminated its relationship with the plaintiff while she worked for the defendant, (3) the defendant furnished the premises and materials necessary for the plaintiff’s work, (4) the defendant had a right to discharge the plaintiff, and (5) the plaintiff was paid by her original employer, which passed the costs on to the defendant.

   Representatives of deceased employee were not barred by exclusiveness of remedies provision in Miss Code §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c03s71-3-9" target="_self">71-3-9</a></cite> from maintaining action against wholly-owned subsidiary of decedent’s employer for negligence, where parties presented no evidence suggesting that subsidiary’s corporate identity should be disregarded because of fraud or injustice and facts did not present proper question of piercing corporate veil because subsidiary was being sued for its own acts of alleged negligence, and not acts of parent company.

       Injured employee may not circumvent Workers’ Compensation Act on basis of dual capacity doctrine; employer is not liable in tort to injured employee when employer assumes identity separate and apart from role as employer; employer who designs, manufactures or distributes product used by its employees cannot be held liable to injured employee on theory of products liability. Rader v. U.S. Rubber Reclaiming Co., 617 F. Supp. 1045, 1985 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15521 (S.D. Miss. 1985).

      </p>
      <p>
       A pipeline operator which contracted with an injured welder’s employer for the construction of a pipeline was not immune from tort liability on the ground of the “statutory employer” defense; since the pipeline operator was not a “contractor,” and because the employer had secured compensation for the welder’s benefit, the Workers’ Compensation Act imposed no duty on the pipeline operator and, accordingly, the pipeline operator enjoyed no benefits under the Act. The pipeline operator could not gain tort immunity by assuming compensation obligations which in fact and in law it did not have. Magee v.

       Where an employee asserted an action against a worker’s compensation insurer because of the insurer’s intentional bad-faith refusal to pay worker’s compensation when due, Mississippi law applied because, inter alia, an insurer’s intentional bad-faith refusal to pay worker’s compensation timely is an independent tort committed by the insurer outside of the scope of the worker’s employment and it is legally distinct from and independent of any claims arising under the Mississippi Workers’ Compensation Act, and Mississippi had the most significant relationship to the intentional tort suit.

       In a widow’s bad-faith action against a workers’ compensation insurance carrier, the carrier’s conduct was the equivalent of an unreasonably delayed investigation that had no legitimate or arguable reason. Thus, the jury could have found that the carrier’s habitually delayed “investigation” involving intentional choices to pass along duties was in reckless disregard of the consequences that the widow faced based on the carrier’s failure to resolve her lump-sum order.

Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c03s71-3-7" target="_self">71-3-7</a></cite>, which benefits the employee later received via a settlement, failed because the employer had arguable reasons for its decision where an investigation into whether the employee’s alleged sexual relationship with her manager ever occurred or was cause of the employee’s mental health problems was inconclusive; that the employer stated in an earlier suit filed by the employee that her negligence claims were barred under the exclusive remedy provisions of Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c03s71-3-9" target="_self">71-3-9</a></cite> did not mean that the employer acted in bad faith by advancing inconsistent positions, as the employer never conceded that the employee had a viable workers’ compensation claim.

   As an employee’s complaint against his employer sounded in negligence, and Mississippi had the “most significant relationship” with the action, Mississippi, not Alabama, law applied. Therefore, the employer was immune from suit under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c03s71-3-9" target="_self">71-3-9</a></cite>, as there was no evidence that the employee’s injury was caused by its willful actions or that the injury was not compensable under the Mississippi Workers' Compensation Act.

   Employer’s motion for summary judgment was denied because the court could find no argument under the present state of the law for dismissing a wrongful death action, arising out of a co-worker’s shooting rampage, based on the exclusivity bar provision under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c03s71-3-9" target="_self">71-3-9</a></cite> of Mississippi’s Workers’ Compensation Act; there was nothing to suggest that, at the time of the shootings at the plant, the assailant was acting in the course and scope of his employment and in furtherance of his employer’s business, or that his actions, which were certainly outside the course and scope of his employment, were directed against his victims because of their employment, and thus, the injury was not compensable under the Act, and the exclusivity bar did not apply.

       Where a widow whose husband died while working for a general contractor sued the contractor based on its alleged failure to properly repair damaged bolts, the trial court properly granted summary judgment to the contractor as its conduct was at most gross negligence or reckless indifference, which, as a matter of law, did not defeat the exclusivity provision of the workers’ compensation statutes. Bevis v. Linkous Constr. Co., 856 So. 2d 535, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 445, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 773 (Miss. Ct. App. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the employee had received workers’ compensation medical benefits, this did not preclude compensation for damages that were not compensable under the Workers’ Compensation Act because they were alleged to have been caused by wilful and intentional acts; the damages stemming from the assault and battery were not compensable because they stemmed from a wilful and intentional act, not a negligent or grossly negligent act. Davis v. Pioneer Inc., 834 So. 2d 739, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 2 (Miss. Ct. App. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing in workers’ compensation act made recovery for intentional torts and compensation benefits mutually exclusive and, to the contrary, it was never the intention of the act to bar an employee from pursuing a common law remedy for an injury that was the result of a willful and malicious act of a co-employee. Davis v. Pioneer Inc., 2002 Miss. App. LEXIS 407 (Miss. Ct. App. July 16, 2002), op. withdrawn, sub. op., 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 61 (Miss. Ct. App. Jan. 14, 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where employee is injured in course of employment and seeks treatment from co-employee which aggravates injury, but employee can demonstrate that separate treatment was sought in plaintiff’s capacity as member of general public, then any common law cause of action which arises as result of that treatment will not be excluded by exclusivity provisions of Workers' Compensation Act. Russell v. Orr, 700 So. 2d 619, 1997 Miss. LEXIS 508 (Miss. 1997).

       Where employee is injured in course of employment and seeks treatment from co-employee which aggravates injury, question of fact arises as to whether sufficient nexus exists between plaintiff’s status as employee and treatment sought for injury that would bring claim under Workers’ Compensation Act exclusivity provisions. Russell v. Orr, 700 So. 2d 619, 1997 Miss. LEXIS 508 (Miss. 1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       A mere willful and malicious act is insufficient to give rise to the intentional tort exception under the Workers’ Compensation Act; thus, a workers’ compensation claim would not be removed as an “intentional tort” from the exclusivity of the Act where the employer’s conduct was merely “reckless, negligent, or grossly negligent,” and there was no evidence that the employer acted “with actual intent to injure.” Peaster v. David New Drilling Co., 642 So. 2d 344, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 242 (Miss. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       In order for an injured employee to avoid the Mississippi workers’ compensation exclusive liability provision, the injury must have been caused by the wilful act of another employee acting in the course of employment and in the furtherance of the employee’s business, and the injury must be one that is not compensable under the act. Griffin v. Futorian Corp., 533 So. 2d 461, 1988 Miss. LEXIS 520 (Miss. 1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       Claimant’s exclusive remedy was benefits for accidental injury arising out of and in scope of employment under Mississippi Workers’ Compensation Act; claimant was therefore barred from pursuing common-law tort remedy, where claimant had not presented credible evidence in support of claim of intentional tort by contending that employer intentionally directed its employees to misuse products in complete disregard to warning labels affixed thereto; employer pointed out that claimant stated that employer “negligently” failed to provide him with safe tools and thus his injuries proximately resulted from employer’s “negligence.” Stevens v.

       Exception to exclusivity principle exists where injury is caused by willful act of another employee acting in furtherance of employment and in furtherance of employer’s business and injury is one which is not compensable under Workers’ Compensation Act; derrick hand who suffered injury in fall from drilling rig is limited to workers’ compensation remedy since fall is type of injury contemplated by statute, even though employee alleged that safety belts were not available.

      <p>
       The increased benefits allowed under the 1972 amendment to this section apply only to claims arising on or after July 1, 1972, and the circuit court erred in ordering payments of $56 per week to a claimant whose injury occurred prior to that date. Stuart Mfg. Co. v. Walker, 313 So. 2d 574, 1975 Miss. LEXIS 1676 (Miss. 1975).
      </p>
      <p>
       The interpretation to be placed on the language used in this section [Code 1942, § 6998-07] is that the total amount of weekly benefits to be paid by the employer in totally dependent cases, regardless of the number of dependents, shall not be less than $10 per week. Truck Trailer Sales & Service Co. v. Moore, 244 Miss. 317, 141 So. 2d 541, 1962 Miss. LEXIS 451 (Miss. 1962).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a claimant began work 4 weeks preceding the date of injury and had worked 3 days the 1st week, 2 days during the 2d week, and 3 days during each of the next 2 weeks and her total earnings amounted to $51.28, she should have been awarded compensation in the amount of $10 per week rather than an award based on an average weekly wage of $25. Pepper v. Barrett, 225 Miss. 30, 82 So. 2d 580, 1955 Miss. LEXIS 555 (Miss. 1955).

      </h4>
      <p>
       Employee’s permanent-partial disability compensation period for two injuries that arose from a workplace accident was properly limited to 450 weeks in order to avoid the pyramiding of benefits, as the 450-week award for his body-as-a-whole injury would have still been running when the 200-week award for his shoulder injury would have started to run. Tucker v. Bellsouth Telcoms., Inc., 130 So.3d 96, 2013 Miss. App. LEXIS 357 (Miss. Ct. App. 2013), cert. denied, 131 So.3d 577, 2014 Miss. LEXIS 48 (Miss. 2014), cert. denied, 131 So.3d 577, 2014 Miss. LEXIS 39 (Miss. 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   The minimum payment of $25 per week provided in §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c03s71-3-13" target="_self">71-3-13</a></cite> may not be reduced by the apportionment provided in §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c03s71-3-7" target="_self">71-3-7</a></cite> except in partial dependency cases. Thus, a partially disabled employee was entitled to weekly payments of $25 rather than $12.50, even though her permanent partial disability was due 50 percent to her work-related injury and 50 percent to a preexisting condition. Cross Mfg., Inc. v. Lowery, 394 So. 2d 887, 1981 Miss. LEXIS 1940 (Miss. 1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section [Code 1942, § 6998-07] applies to an award for permanent partial disability. Wiygul Motor Co. v. Pate, 237 Miss. 325, 115 So. 2d 51, 1959 Miss. LEXIS 392 (Miss. 1959).
      </p>
      <p>
       Order of attorney-referee and the commission finding that claimant’s loss of wage earning capacity was $6 per week, and awarding claimant compensation for permanent partial disability at rate of $4 per week, was reversed and judgment entered in supreme court amending the findings so as to show the claimant’s loss of earning capacity at $17.50 per week, and awarding compensation to the claimant for permanent partial disability at the rate of 66 and 2/3 per cent of that amount. Hale v. General Box Mfg. Co., 235 Miss. 301, 108 So. 2d 844, 1959 Miss. LEXIS 430 (Miss. 1959).

       The 1950 amendment to this section [Code 1942, § 6998-07] providing for a minimum weekly compensation of $10.00 “except in partial dependency cases,” permits the payment to a dependent under Code 1942, § 6998-13 of an amount less than the minimum, (a) where his statutory compensation is less than that amount, and (b) where such dependent is partially and not wholly dependent on the deceased employee; if he is wholly dependent, then the $10.00 applies.

       The employer shall furnish such medical, surgical, and other attendance or treatment, nurse and hospital service, medicine, crutches, artificial members, and other apparatus for such period as the nature of the injury or the process of recovery may require. The injured employee shall have the right to accept the services furnished by the employer or, in his discretion, to select one (1) competent physician of his choosing and such other specialists to whom he is referred by his chosen physician to administer medical treatment. Referrals by the chosen physician shall be limited to one (1) physician within a specialty or subspecialty area. Except in an emergency requiring immediate medical attention, any additional selection of physicians by the injured employee or further referrals must be approved by the employer, if self-insured, or the carrier prior to obtaining the services of the physician at the expense of the employer or carrier. If denied, the injured employee may apply to the commission for approval of the additional selection or referral, and if the commission determines that such request is reasonable, the employee may be authorized to obtain such treatment at the expense of the employer or carrier. Approval by the employer or carrier does not require approval by the commission. A physician to whom the employee is referred by his employer shall not constitute the employee’s selection, unless the employee, in writing, accepts the employer’s referral as his own selection. However, if the employee is treated for his alleged work-related injury or occupational disease by a physician for six (6) months or longer, or if the employee has surgery for the alleged work-related injury or occupational disease performed by a physician, then that physician shall be deemed the employee’s selection. Should the employer desire, he may have the employee examined by a physician other than of the employee’s choosing for the purpose of evaluating temporary or permanent disability or medical treatment being rendered under such reasonable terms and conditions as may be prescribed by the commission. If at any time during such period the employee unreasonably refuses to submit to medical or surgical treatment, the commission shall, by order, suspend the payment of further compensation during such time as such refusal continues, and no compensation shall be paid at any time during the period of such suspension; provided, that no claim for medical or surgical treatment shall be valid and enforceable, as against such employer, unless within twenty (20) days following the first treatment the physician or provider giving such treatment shall furnish to the employer, if self-insured, or its carrier, a preliminary report of such injury and treatment, on a form or in a format approved by the commission. Subsequent reports of such injury and treatment must be submitted at least every thirty (30) days thereafter until such time as a final report shall have been made. Reports which are required to be filed hereunder shall be furnished by the medical provider to the employer or carrier, and it shall be the responsibility of the employer or carrier receiving such reports to promptly furnish copies to the commission. The commission may, in its discretion, excuse the failure to furnish such reports within the time prescribed herein if it finds good cause to do so, and may, upon request of any party in interest, order or direct the employer or carrier to pay the reasonable value of medical services rendered to the employee.
      </li>
      <li id="t71c03s71-3-15ol12">
       Whenever in the opinion of the commission a physician has not correctly estimated the degree of permanent disability or the extent of the temporary disability of an injured employee, the commission shall have the power to cause such employee to be examined by a physician selected by the commission, and to obtain from such physician a report containing his estimate of such disabilities. The commission shall have the power in its discretion to charge the cost of such examination to the employer, if he is a self-insurer, or to the insurance company which is carrying the risk.
      </li>
      <li id="t71c03s71-3-15ol13">
       In carrying out this section, the commission shall establish an appropriate medical provider fee schedule, medical cost containment system and utilization review which incorporates one or more medical review panels to determine the reasonableness of charges and the necessity for the services, and limitations on fees to be charged by medical providers for testimony and copying or completion of records and reports and other provisions which, at the discretion of the commission, are necessary to encompass a complete medical cost containment program. The commission may contract with a private organization or organizations to establish and implement such a medical cost containment system and fee schedule with the cost for administering such a system to be paid out of the administrative expense fund as provided in this chapter. All fees and other charges for such treatment or service shall be limited to such charges as prevail in the same community for similar treatment and shall be subject to regulation by the commission. No medical bill shall be paid to any doctor until all forms and reports required by the commission have been filed. Any employee receiving treatment or service under the provisions of this chapter may not be held responsible for any charge for such treatment or service, and no doctor, hospital or other recognized medical provider shall attempt to bill, charge or otherwise collect from the employee any amount greater than or in excess of the amount paid by the employer, if self-insured, or its workers’ compensation carrier. Any dispute over the amount charged for service rendered under the provisions of this chapter, or over the amount of reimbursement for services rendered under the provisions of this chapter, shall be limited to and resolved between the provider and the employer or carrier in accordance with the fee dispute resolution procedures adopted by the commission.
      </li>
      <li id="t71c03s71-3-15ol14">
       The liability of an employer for medical treatment as herein provided shall not be affected by the fact that his employee was injured through the fault or negligence of a third party, not in the same employ, provided the injured employee was engaged in the scope of his employment when injured. The employer shall, however, have a cause of action against such third party to recover any amounts paid by him for such medical treatment.
      </li>
      <li id="t71c03s71-3-15ol15">
       An injured worker who believes that his best interest has been prejudiced by the findings of the physician designated by the employer or carrier shall have the privilege of a medical examination by a physician of his own choosing, at the expense of the carrier or employer. Such examination may be had at any time after injury and prior to the closing of the case, provided that the charge shall not exceed One Hundred Dollars ($100.00) and shall be paid by the carrier or employer where the previous medical findings are upset, but paid by the employee if previous medical findings are confirmed.
      </li>
      <li id="t71c03s71-3-15ol16">
       Medical and surgical treatment as provided in this section shall not be deemed to be privileged insofar as carrying out the provisions of this chapter is concerned. All findings pertaining to a second opinion medical examination, at the instance of the employer shall be reported as herein required within fourteen (14) days of the examination, except that copies thereof shall also be furnished by the employer or carrier to the employee. All findings pertaining to an independent medical examination by order of the commission shall be reported as provided in the order for such examination.
      </li>
      <li id="t71c03s71-3-15ol17">
       Any medical benefits paid by reason of any accident or health insurance policy or plan paid for by the employer, which were for expenses of medical treatment under this section, are, upon notice to the carrier prior to payment by it, subject to subrogation in favor of the accident or health insurance company to the extent of its payment for medical treatment under this section. Reimbursement to the accident or health insurance company by the carrier or employer, to the extent of such reimbursement, shall constitute payment by the employer or carrier of medical expenses under this section. Under no circumstances, shall any subrogation be had by any insurance company against any compensation benefits paid under this chapter.

       Workers’ Compensation Commission did not err in failing to exclude a doctor’s deposition based on the four-factor test applicable to determine whether excluding evidence for a transgression in discovery was an appropriate sanction because the doctor was a nonparty witness selected to perform an an employer’s medical examination; after the employee served a subpoena on the doctor, he filed his own motion to quash the subpoena and relied on the advice of his counsel to refuse to answer questions.

       Denial of workers’ compensation benefits to the employee was proper because, as a result of discrepancies in a doctor’s testimony and records in the case, the doctor’s testimony and opinions were not credible and were unusable in the determination of disability; the Workers’ Compensation Commission was not required to always comply with a treating physician’s opinion.

       In a workers’ compensation case, the employer was not responsible for payment for any medical services or supplies rendered to the claimant by referral doctors because they were not authorized to treat the claimant by the employer; thus, the administrative law judge properly denied payment for the claimant’s medical services rendered by those two doctors.

       Substantial evidence supported the Mississippi Workers’ Compensation Commission’s decision to deny a claimant total disability benefits because various physicians who saw the claimant determined that the claimant’s failure to participate steadfastly in recommended physical therapy impacted the claimant’s condition.

       Substantial evidence supported the Workers’ Compensation Commission’s decision finding that the claimant was entitled to permanent partial disability benefits commensurate with an impairment rating of only 10 percent where there was testimony that the claimant’s failure to follow through with her physical therapy may well have been the reason for her loss of motion range.

       While an injured workman will be denied compensation for incapacity which may be removed or modified by an operation of a simple character, not involving serious suffering or danger, where the operation is of a serious character, involves serious suffering or danger, or is doubtful of success, an injured employee’s refusal to submit to such an operation is not unreasonable, and the right to compensation is not precluded by such refusal.

       Under the pre-1992 version of the statute, which permitted a claimant “to select a competent physician of his choosing to administer medical treatment,” an initial physician such as the claimant’s family doctor could make a preliminary diagnosis and then refer the claimant to someone more expert regarding that ailment; there was no legislative limit on the number of referrals that successive doctors could make as proper care for a claimant.

      <p>
       Workers’ Compensation Commission properly determined that an employee was capable of performing the substantial acts of her usual employment and that she was not permanently and totally disabled or entitled to benefits because the employee’s testimony that she was unable to perform the jobs offered to her upon her return to the employer, combined with her contention that she was unemployable, was insufficient to overcome the high burden of showing that the Commission’s decision was unsupported by substantial evidence, and she failed to provide any evidence or testimony that she was, in fact, unable to perform the job presented to her when she returned to the employer for a few hours. Smith v. Howard Indus., Inc., — So.3d —, 2018 Miss. App. LEXIS 647 (Miss. Ct. App. Dec. 18, 2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       Award of permanent partial disability benefits was upheld and the employer’s argument that the claimant did not document a job search for a year and a half after he was terminated and reached maximum medical improvement went to the weight of the evidence, not its sufficiency. Howard Indus. v. Hardaway, 191 So.3d 1257, 2015 Miss. App. LEXIS 465 (Miss. Ct. App. 2015), cert. denied, 202 So.3d 208, 2016 Miss. LEXIS 207 (Miss. 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       Employee was not entitled to any benefits in excess of those already paid by the employer because she did not establish any additional loss of industrial use in excess of her medical ratings, and she was currently employed within her restrictions and earning a higher wage than her pre-injury wage. Gaston v. Tyson Foods, Inc., 122 So.3d 797, 2013 Miss. App. LEXIS 603 (Miss. Ct. App. 2013).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where there was conflicting medical evidence regarding a claimant’s lumbar condition and her need for lumbar spine injury, an appellate court could not say that the Workers’ Compensation Commission’s decision to deny benefits was arbitrary and capricious. Washington v. Woodland Vill. Nursing Home, 25 So.3d 341, 2009 Miss. App. LEXIS 108 (Miss. Ct. App. 2009), cert. denied, 24 So.3d 1038, 2010 Miss. LEXIS 2 (Miss. 2010).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where an employee suffered a back injury while working, an administrative law judge’s (ALJ) finding that an elective back surgery, related treatment, and psychological care were non-compensable was upheld because, inter alia, (1) the ALJ was not required to defer to “treating” or patient-selected physicians, (2) substantial evidence supported the finding that the employee did not require surgery, and (3) there was evidence that the employee had underlying psychiatric problems stemming from childhood abuse unrelated to the work injury. Manning v. Sunbeam-Oster Household Prods., 979 So. 2d 736, 2008 Miss. App. LEXIS 230 (Miss. Ct. App. 2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       Mississippi Workers’ Compensation Commission correctly found that the employee was entitled to permanent partial disability benefits where his treating physician testified to a reasonable degree of medical certainty that there were no other caused of the employee’s blindness other than the trauma suffered as a result of the work-related accident. Metalloy Corp. v. Gathings, 990 So. 2d 191, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 593 (Miss. Ct. App. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       Denial of appellee’s workers’ compensation claim was not supported by substantial evidence; appellee contemporaneously and consistently reported her injury to three supervisors as well as doctors, she had no history of back trouble, the claim was not contradicted the fact that she used personal insurance to pay for her visits, and medical records corroborated the time, nature, and origin of injury. Waffle House, Inc. v. Allam, 976 So. 2d 919, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 466 (Miss. Ct. App. 2007), cert. denied, 977 So. 2d 343, 2008 Miss. LEXIS 75 (Miss. 2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Where several doctors opined that an employee’s repetitive act of reaching for a time clock 300 to 400 times per day aggravated a pre-existing condition, temporary total disability benefits were properly awarded due to Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c03s71-3-3ol1b" target="_self">71-3-3(b)</a></cite>. Casino Magic v. Nelson, 958 So. 2d 224, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 41 (Miss. Ct. App. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Employer’s claim that the employee was not entitled to benefits in a workers’ compensation action because she did not conduct a job search was inappropriate because a job search was not part of the employee’s burden of proof since loss of use of two major scheduled members automatically gave rise to permanent total disability and 450 weeks of benefits as set forth in Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c03s71-3-17ol1ac22" target="_self">71-3-17(a)(c)(22)</a></cite>. Union Camp Corp. v. Hall, 955 So. 2d 363, 2006 Miss. App. LEXIS 696 (Miss. Ct. App. 2006), cert. dismissed, 956 So. 2d 228, 2007 Miss. LEXIS 215 (Miss. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Where a claimant’s injury was not scheduled, the court determined on the facts that the claimant was not entitled to partial permanent disability benefits under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c03s71-3-3ol1i" target="_self">71-3-3(i)</a></cite> as the claimant failed to establish that he had sought similar work as a tire builder and the employer had refused to rehire or reinstate him. Havard v. Titan Tire Corp., 919 So. 2d 995, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 429 (Miss. Ct. App. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Medical testimony from the employee’s treating physicians supported the permanence of his disability as follows: (1) one physician testified that he had suffered a 20 percent permanent medical impairment to his entire body due to his neck injury’ (2) a second physician restricted him to medium duty based on clinical examinations, diagnostic tests, and his complaints of pain; (3) three years after the accident, the employee was further restricted to light duty; and (4) a third physician concluded that he would “never be able to return to duty without severe spasm.” The record was clear that he was unable to return to his work as a diesel mechanic due to his injury, and that he had also incurred a 50 percent reduction in his earning capacity given his pain, his age, and his occupational history. Bryan Foods, Inc. v. White, 913 So. 2d 1003, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 266 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 921 So. 2d 344, 2005 Miss. LEXIS 710 (Miss. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Employee was not entitled to permanent disability benefits where the Workers’ Compensation Commission found that the employee’s pre-existing condition, as shown by her 1993 and 1998 post-injury x-ray was aggravated by her May 25, 1998 work injury; however, as illustrated by her videotaped exploits, the temporary effects of that work injury had fully subsided and any subsequent disability was attributable to the preexisting disease or condition. Lee v. Singing River Hosp., 908 So. 2d 159, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 303 (Miss. Ct. App. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Mississippi Workers’ Compensation Commission properly found there was no medical evidence to support a claim for disability, either temporary or total, as a result of the employee’s four slip and falls in October and November of 1997, nor was there any testimony to connect the employee’s alleged injuries to the falls. One of his primary physicians, testified that the employee’s complaints were the same as his complaints in 1995 after an accident the employee had while working for a different employer, and although he had gone to the emergency room after two of the 1997 falls, he did not thereafter seek treatment, and it was not until October of 1998 that he saw his primary physician and complained of an on-the-job injury while working for the employer in the case at bar; the employee admitted that he recovered from his preexisting back injuries sufficiently to enable him to maintain gainful employment, and any subsequent disability the employee claimed was not compensable. Eubanks v. Prof'l Bldg. Servs., 909 So. 2d 1132, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 68 (Miss. Ct. App. 2005).

       Although the evidence conflicted, there was some evidence to suggest that the claimant had attempted to find subsequent employment, and because there was such evidence, the trial court’s decision to affirm the Mississippi Workers’ Compensation Commission’s ruling in awarding the claimant benefits was not clearly erroneous; despite conflicting evidence regarding the claimant’s notification of her injury and her possible motivations for asserting a claim, the administrative judge concluded that she had sustained a work-related injury and chose to disregard the employer’s assertions to the contrary.

       Although a claimant is not entitled to compensation when he or she receives his or her regular salary in lieu of compensation, sick pay, vacation pay, donations or gratuities are not salary in lieu of compensation; thus, a claimant should have been awarded benefits during the time he was on vacation and receiving vacation pay where he was totally disabled at the time he took his vacation leave.

   Section<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c03s71-3-17ol1a" target="_self">71-3-17(a)</a></cite> covers all cases of permanent total occupational disability, to the exclusion of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c03s71-3-17ol1c" target="_self">71-3-17(c)</a></cite> which by its title and its terms covers only permanent partial occupational disability (although it may be permanent, total loss of use of a specific member); where an employee suffers an injury covered by the schedule in §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c03s71-3-17ol1c" target="_self">71-3-17(c)</a></cite> and where that injury results in a permanent loss of wage earning capacity within §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c03s71-3-17ol1a" target="_self">71-3-17(a)</a></cite>, the latter section controls exclusively and the employee is not limited to the number of weeks of compensation prescribed in § 71-3-17(c)’s schedule.

      <p>
       When an injury occurs which is related to the body as a whole, scheduled member standards do not apply; thus, a claimant’s injury had to be treated as an injury to the body as a whole where the injury involved not only his arm, but also his upper shoulder and back. Jordan v. Hercules, Inc., 600 So. 2d 179, 1992 Miss. LEXIS 224 (Miss. 1992), but see Dulaney v. National Pizza Co., 733 So. 2d 301, 1998 Miss. App. LEXIS 990 (Miss. Ct. App. 1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       There was substantial evidence supporting a finding by the Workers’ Compensation Commission that a claimant’s impairment was a whole body injury rather than a schedule numbered injury only, where a physician identified the claimant’s malady as Meniere’s Syndrome, and he testified that Meniere’s Syndrome is “an inner ear dysfunction that appears to be lifelong in nature” and that it affected the entire body in that, in addition to a loss of hearing, it involved a balance dysfunction affecting the claimant’s activities of daily living, both occupationally and socially. Georgia-Pacific Corp. v. Gregory, 589 So. 2d 1250, 1991 Miss. LEXIS 763 (Miss. 1991).

       Generally, “medical” disability is the equivalent of functional disability and relates to actual physical impairment. “Industrial” disability is the functional or medical disability as it affects the claimant’s ability to perform the duties of employment.

       If claimant sustains compensable injury and receives medical treatment until discharged as cured, testimony of doctor discharging claimant may not be sufficient to rebut another doctor who examines claimant at later date and finds patient to remain in disability status, especially where claimant testifies to continued disability from injury, and thus employee with lower back injuries sustained at work was entitled to temporary total disability benefits, where testimony by employee and doctor who last saw him neither conflicted with other medical testimony nor was discredited.

       Although workers’ compensation claimant is not entitled to compensation benefits during week in which employer pays or causes to be paid to claimant under company benefit plan amount at least as much as worker’s compensation otherwise payable; however, employer is not entitled to credit for amount paid in excess of amount required to be paid as worker’s compensation, to be applied in reducing compensation payments payable after cessation of payments under benefit plan.

       If the claimant is paid his usual wages, although he does no work at all following an injury, it is a reasonable inference that the payment is in lieu of compensation and any further compensation should not be allowed.

       A finding by the Workers’ Compensation Commission that an injured manual laborer who was restricted by his doctor to lifting less than 40 pounds suffered only minimal industrial incapacity was not supported by substantial evidence where the decision was based largely on an alleged policy of the employer requiring workers to seek assistance when lifting more than 40 pounds, but the record contained no evidence of such a policy.

       A finding by the Workers’ Compensation Commission that a lumberyard worker had sustained only a 50 percent loss of wage-earning capacity, and therefore suffered only partial rather than total permanent disability, would be reversed where the evidence indicated that he had difficulty performing “make-work” tasks at his employer’s lumberyard after he returned to work and that his efforts to find other employment were unsuccessful, and the Commission’s finding was based on the conclusion that the employee should have been able to secure “some type of gainful employment” merely because he had a high school education.

       Where the deceased employee had been paid a total sum of $202.76 in wages, covering the 6-week period of his employment immediately prior to his death, the correct formula for determining the average weekly wage was to divide the total earnings of $202.76 by 6 weeks.

       Claimant did not suffer a loss of industrial use due to a work-related injury, and, therefore, was not entitled to permanent disability benefits because, although there was no dispute that the claimant suffered from bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome, the claimant was released to regular-duty work with no restrictions and found other, albeit part-time, employment.

       Finding by the administrative judge of permanent partial disability and loss of wage-earning capacity of 25 percent for the claimant’s 1996 back injury was supported by the evidence as this injury did not render the claimant permanently and totally disabled.

   Trial court did not err in affirming the decision of the Mississippi Workers’ Compensation Commission, which assigned a workers’ compensation claimant seeking permanent total benefits under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c03s71-3-17" target="_self">71-3-17</a></cite> a twenty percent loss of wage-earning capacity because the claimant did not demonstrate that he suffered a permanent total disability since he failed to show a complete loss of wage-earning capacity; the fact that the claimant was terminated from his employment did not entitle him to compensation payments because he admitted he did not contact the employer to keep it informed of his treatment, status, or any restrictions placed upon his employment, and the Commission found that the claimant could have returned to work with the employer in another suitable job, his job-search efforts were less than enthusiastic, and his job-search efforts were wasted since he pursued the same type of employment he had before his injury.

   Pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c03s71-3-17ol1c25" target="_self">71-3-17(c)(25)</a></cite>, substantial evidence supported the Mississippi Workers’ Compensation Commission’s (Commission) finding that the employee suffered a loss of wage-earning capacity and its calculation and apportioning of benefits awarded; the Commission properly considered the evidence as a whole, including the employee’s loss of access to the job market, her difficulty securing permanent employment and her continuing pain.

       Even though the employee failed to report a work-related injury to his treating physicians, the record showed he did report it to his supervisor and the employer’s nurse, the nurse having told him that there was no way he could have sustained such a neck injury at work. Further, the Mississippi Workers’ Compensation Commission had substantial evidence before it to support its findings based on: (1) the medical records, (2) the opinions of five competent physicians, and (3) the results of various medical tests and procedures. Thus, the Commission’s ruling that the employee could not return to work as a mechanic, and that he had incurred a 50 percent loss in his wage-earning capacity, was proper. Bryan Foods, Inc. v. White, 913 So. 2d 1003, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 266 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 921 So. 2d 344, 2005 Miss. LEXIS 710 (Miss. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Circuit Court reversed the prior ruling of a 14 percent loss of wage-earning capacity and found that the employee suffered a 30 percent loss of wage-earning capacity, and the employee appealed yet again to the appellate court. The administrative law judge based his finding of a 14 percent loss of wage-earning capacity on a consideration of the employee’s age, education, work history, and medical impairment, and the employee had been consistently employed since the injury in other positions at rates of pay not substantially different than what he had previously earned; thus, in finding a 30 percent loss of earning capacity, the circuit court applied an incorrect standard of review by reweighing the evidence presented and reversing the order of the Mississippi Workers’ Compensation Commission as to loss of wage-earning capacity. Richards v. Harrah's Entm't, Inc., 881 So. 2d 329, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 861 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       In determining whether there has been a loss of wage earning capacity, the Mississippi Workers’ Compensation Commission is to evaluate training, education, ability to work, failure to be hired elsewhere, pain, and other medical circumstances.

   Because the court found that it was unclear whether the calculation of loss of wage earning capacity in connection with Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c03s71-3-17ol1c25" target="_self">71-3-17(c)(25)</a></cite> was based on evidence, the court remanded for further fact-finding or for the adoption of some other figure that better represented the current evidence.

       Under subsection (c), the award was based solely on the degree of disability to the scheduled member and did not take into account the effect of that disability on the claimant’s actual ability to earn wages in her post-injury condition. Weatherspoon v. Croft Metals, Inc., 881 So. 2d 204, 2002 Miss. App. LEXIS 52 (Miss. Ct. App. 2002), rev'd, 853 So. 2d 776, 2003 Miss. LEXIS 197 (Miss. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       A claimant having only a partial impairment to a scheduled member may, through other considerations, establish that, for purposes of his wage earning capacity, the impairment has rendered him or her totally occupationally disabled; in such event, the claimant is entitled to compensation for complete disability under subsection (a). Alumax Extrusions Inc. v. Wright, 737 So. 2d 416, 1998 Miss. App. LEXIS 1114 (Miss. Ct. App. 1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       The extent of loss or impairment of earning capacity is a factual question for the commission to be determined on the basis of wage earning capacity in the same employment or otherwise, and an award could not be predicated upon a finding that a claimant had suffered a total and permanent loss of wage earning capacity in that she could no longer do the work of a nurse’s aid, where no showing was made that she had made an effort to obtain other employment.

      </p>
      <p>
       That disability may have been aggravated by the onset of disease, as to the nature of which medical experts are in disagreement, does not affect the right to compensation for loss of earning power resulting from the injury.

       After physical disability has been shown, it is for the commission to determine the extent of loss of wage-earning capacity. Hale v. General Box Mfg. Co., 235 Miss. 301, 108 So. 2d 844, 1959 Miss. LEXIS 430 (Miss. 1959).

       The fact that the employer had continued to pay claimant the same weekly wages that he had been receiving prior to his injury did not mean that the claimant had not sustained a permanent partial disability in his wage earning capacity. Harper Foundry & Machine Co. v. Harper, 232 Miss. 873, 100 So. 2d 779, 1958 Miss. LEXIS 342 (Miss. 1958).
      </p>
      <p>
       The statute does not test the earning capacity of a claimant by the comparative wages received by him before and after the injury, but benefits are figured on a percentage of the claimant’s average weekly wages at the time of the injury as compared to his wage earning capacity thereafter in the same employment or otherwise. Harper Foundry & Machine Co. v. Harper, 232 Miss. 873, 100 So. 2d 779, 1958 Miss. LEXIS 342 (Miss. 1958).
      </p>
      <p>
       In determining the loss of wage earning capacity, the statutory test is calculated by comparing actual earnings before the injury with the earning capacity after the injury. Russell v. Southeastern Utilities Service Co., 230 Miss. 272, 92 So. 2d 544, 1957 Miss. LEXIS 368 (Miss. 1957).
      </p>
      <p>
       In determining the loss of wage earning capacity by a claimant, the workmen’s compensation commission must make the best estimate of future impairment of earnings on the strength of both actual post-injury earnings and any other evidence of probative value on the issue of earning capacity, which is essentially a question of fact for the commission. Russell v. Southeastern Utilities Service Co., 230 Miss. 272, 92 So. 2d 544, 1957 Miss. LEXIS 368 (Miss. 1957).
      </p>
      <p>
       While earnings equal to preinjury earnings are strong evidence of nonimpairment of earning capacity, this is not conclusive, and may be rebutted by evidence independently showing or explaining away the post-injury earnings as an unreliable basis of estimating wage earning capacity. Russell v. Southeastern Utilities Service Co., 230 Miss. 272, 92 So. 2d 544, 1957 Miss. LEXIS 368 (Miss. 1957).

      </p>
      <p>
       Where a referee denied a claim for partial permanent disability because the claimant had higher weekly earnings after injury than before injury and where referee did not hear the evidence relating to increase in wage levels since the accident, or as to whether higher wage resulted from claimant’s enlarged experience or from sympathy of employer, or the result of enlarged experience of the claimant, the matter should be remanded for reconsideration.

       Decision of
   the Mississippi Workers’ Compensation Commission that a county
   rebutted the prima facie showing of permanent total disability was
   not supported by substantial evidence because the record failed to
   support a finding that an employee suffered only a permanent partial
   disability or no loss of wage-earning capacity; the medical testimony
   showed the employee had sustained permanent impairment. Harris v. Stone Cty. Bd. of Supervisors, — So.3d —, 2018 Miss. App. LEXIS 469 (Miss. Ct. App. Sept. 25, 2018).

   Employee did not suffer a permanent and total occupational disability because he continued to work at a service station earning $200 per week and his reduced earnings were limited in part by a heart attack that was not work related and by his inability to find transportation; the employee’s work injury was to his left foot, and the employee did not demonstrate under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c03s71-3-17ol1a" target="_self">71-3-17(a)</a></cite> that his injuries, when considered in the context of other relevant circumstances, rendered him totally occupationally disabled from any form of gainful employment.

       There was no dispute that the employee suffered some injury to her back while on duty with her employer, and there was no real issue as to whether the employee suffered from medical complaints that required substantial attention from treating physicians; however, the employee was unable to provide convincing evidence showing that her medical complaints were caused by the incident at work. Smith v. Grand Casino-Biloxi, 851 So. 2d 423, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 670 (Miss. Ct. App. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       An award of permanent partial disability benefits was proper where the claimant was medically certified to be 15 percent permanently disabled, but was able to perform work at his former job. The fact that a claimant has secured some form of employment does not, by itself, negate the claimant’s case for compensation; if, because of the subject injury, the claimant cannot secure employment at pre-injury pay, then the claimant may be entitled to disability payments. A claimant is not required to prove that he or she had actually been rejected, because of his or her disability, at jobs for which the claimant has stated he or she no longer considers himself or herself a qualified applicant. Thus, it was enough that the Workers’ Compensation Commission, affirmed by the circuit court, found that the claimant did sustain an injury leading to a disability which had diminished his wage-earning capacity, and that he had reasonably attempted to find employment. Georgia Pacific Corp. v. Taplin, 586 So. 2d 823, 1991 Miss. LEXIS 664 (Miss. 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       A claimant who suffered a 25 percent permanent impairment to the body was not entitled to an award of permanent partial disability benefits since she did not establish a loss of wage earning capacity attributable to the compensable injury, where the evidence showed that she experienced an overall increase of post-injury wages and she offered no proof to rebut the presumption of no loss of wage earning capacity by showing that the post-injury earnings were not reliable in determining wage earning capacity. International Paper Co. v. Kelley, 562 So. 2d 1298, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 274 (Miss. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       A claimant was improperly awarded permanent partial disability benefits for loss of wage earning capacity, even though her incapacity to return to her job in the pasting department of a luggage company or to engage in similar employment was supported by medical findings, where the claimant did not meet her burden of proving that she had attempted to secure a job in another or different trade after her disability had subsided, and where her physician had testified that she could return to any factory-type work, so long as the environmental conditions were “clean.” Sardis Luggage Co. v. Wilson, 374 So. 2d 826, 1979 Miss. LEXIS 2392 (Miss. 1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       The burden is upon the claimant not only to show loss of wage earning capacity but also to show the extent thereof, and the claimant who has established his injury and the loss of wage earning capacity but has failed to prove the extent thereof has provided no substantial evidence to support the findings of the commission that he was entitled to temporary total benefits for the full period allowed.

       Rebuttable presumption of no loss of wage-earning capacity arose because the worker’s post-injury wages were equal to or exceeded her pre-injury wages. Lovett v. Delta Reg'l Med.

       An injury to the back is not of the type scheduled in subsections (c)(1) through (24), so that proof of permanent diminished physical capacity, standing alone, does not entitle a claimant to compensation.

      </p>
      <p>
       Presumption of no loss of wage earning capacity, which arises where claimant’s post-injury earnings equal or exceed pre-injury earnings, was effectively rebutted, where claimant testified that his position was temporary and his pay higher than at time of injury because labor union required that one working in his position receive same pay as absent employee, and that upon return of that person he would be out of job; while statute has been construed by Court to mean that post-injury earnings equal to or in excess of pre-injury earnings are strong evidence of non-impairment of earning capacity, that presumption may be rebutted by evidence on part of claimant that post-injury earnings are unreliable due to: increase in general wage levels since time of accident, claimant’s own greater maturity and training, longer hours worked by claimant, payment of wages disproportionate to capacity out of sympathy to claimant, and temporary and unpredictable character of post-injury earnings, which is not exclusive list of reasons. General Electric Co. v. McKinnon, 507 So. 2d 363, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2504 (Miss. 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       Earnings equal to preinjury earnings create a presumption of earning capacity commensurate with actual post-injury earnings, but such presumption may be rebutted by evidence independently showing incapacity, or by evidence showing that post-injury earnings are not a reliable basis for estimating earning capacity, as for example, evidence of general wage increases since the injury, or evidence as to the temporary or unpredictable character of post-injury earnings.

      </p>
      <p>
       Post-injury earnings equal to or in excess of pre-injury earnings are strong evidence of non-impairment of earning capacity, but the presumption arising therefrom may be rebutted by evidence on part of the claimant that the post-injury earnings are unreliable due to increase in general wage levels, claimant’s own greater maturity and training, longer hours worked by claimant after accident, payment of wages disproportionate to capacity out of sympathy to complainant, and the temporary and unpredictable character of post-injury earnings.

       The workmen’s compensation commission was in error in predicating an award of permanent partial disability upon its finding that there had been a 10 percent medical disability to the claimant’s body as a whole, rather than upon a determination of the extent of loss or impairment of the claimant’s wage earning capacity resulting from a compensable injury to her lower back.

       Where there was a stipulation that the claimant suffered 25 percent partial permanent disability and that such rating of disability was to constitute basis for decision, this stipulation would not be construed to mean an agreement that 25 percent disability was to be taken as 25 percent disability in claimant’s earning capacity.

The undisputed testimony demonstrated that he earned half of his regular salary as a longhaul truck driver while driving short hauls or working in the loading and packing divisions, and that he had sought light duty work from both his employer and his union, but that none was offered; thus, an award of permanent partial disability benefits was proper.

       Despite a claimant’s increase in earnings, his earning capacity and his employability in the market place had been reduced due to Meniere’s Syndrome where the presumption of earning capacity commensurate with post-injury earnings was rebutted by the following factors: (1) Meniere’s Syndrome is a whole body disability; (2) it is lifelong in nature; (3) it affects the activities of daily living, both occupationally and socially; (4) the claimant’s daily bouts with vertigo would put him at a disadvantage in an industrial setting where there were machines in operation; (5) one of the claimant’s biggest fears was losing his balance and falling into one of the machines he was operating; and (6) there had been an increase in general wage levels for all employees in the claimant’s class since 1984.

       Where claimant has a disability which prevented him from performing some of the duties incidental to his occupation as a welder, and diminished his capacity for earning wages in that occupation, compensation could not be denied because, due to the generosity of his employer, he had suffered no loss of pay up to the time of the hearing.

   Reduction in the employee’s award of permanent-partial disability benefits was improper because she chose to demonstrate that she could not perform the substantial acts of her usual employment and thus, the fact that she did not seek employment with the employer or any other company was not conclusive of whether she was entitled to permanent-partial disability benefits for the industrial loss of use of her leg, Miss.

       Mississippi Workers’ Compensation Commission’s award of permanent partial disability benefits to the claimant due to the loss of use of his right upper extremity was upheld because the Commission’s finding that the claimant could no longer perform the substantial acts of his usual occupation was supported by substantial evidence, as the claimant testified that every job he had performed over the last eight years required lifting 50 pounds occasionally and according to his medical restrictions he was only capable of occasionally lifting 18.5 pounds. Mueller Indus. v. Waits, — So.3d —, 2019 Miss. App. LEXIS 142 (Miss. Ct. App. Apr. 9, 2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       The medical and vocational proof rebutted any presumption as to a claimant’s alleged total industrial loss of use to the right upper extremity because the claimant’s post-injury employment with the employer demonstrated that the claimant could perform some of the substantial acts of the claimant’s usual employment, a vocational expert testified about the job opportunities that were available to the claimant, and the claimant did not demonstrate an incapacity post-injury to earn the same wages as the claimant was earning pre-injury. Hathorn v. ESCO Corp., 224 So.3d 543, 2016 Miss. App. LEXIS 739 (Miss. Ct. App. 2016), cert. denied, 223 So.3d 785, 2017 Miss. LEXIS 307 (Miss. 2017).
      </p>
      <p>
       Mississippi Workers’ Compensation Commission did not err in awarding an employee temporary total disability benefits and permanent partial disability benefits because it considered all the necessary factors before finding that the employee was entitled to an industrial loss, and there was no error of law or unsupported fact; the Commission found that the employee had demonstrated a loss of industrial use in excess of her functional loss. Sanderson Farms, Inc. v. Jessie, 185 So.3d 397, 2015 Miss. App. LEXIS 373 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 178 So.3d 729, 2015 Miss. LEXIS 557 (Miss. 2015).

       Mississippi Workers’ Compensation Commission did not err in awarding an employee compensation for a fifty percent functional loss for industrial purposes of both upper extremities because substantial evidence supported its decision that the employee demonstrated a loss of industrial use in excess of her functional loss.

       In a workers’ compensation case, since it was uncontradicted that a benefits claimant was assigned a two percent impairment to her lower right extremity, she was entitled to receive permanent partial disability for the two percent impairment to a scheduled member, her right lower extremity, in accordance with this statute.

   Trial court erred in upholding a 100 percent industrial loss for an employee’s leg injury because the evidence did not support such a finding under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c03s71-3-17ol1c" target="_self">71-3-17(c)</a></cite>; the employee’s leg only had a 25 percent medical impairment, the employee continued to work in the field of law enforcement, and the employee earned $ 10,000 more a year in a new position than at the time of the injury.

       Claimant is entitled to benefits based on total loss of use of a scheduled member if it is shown that the person is no longer able to perform the customary acts of that person’s usual employment; the job held at the time of the claimant’s injury was not necessarily the usual employment, but rather, the usual employment was broader in scope than the job held at the time of injury, and included jobs in which the claimant had past experience, jobs requiring similar skills, or other jobs for which the worker was suited, such that there was substantial evidence to rebut a presumption of total occupational loss and deny the claimant’s sympathy wages argument.

   Workers’ compensation award based on diminished wage-earning capacity rather than a scheduled member injury to the arms under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c03s71-3-17ol1c" target="_self">71-3-17(c)</a></cite> was affirmed because there was substantial evidence supporting the factual conclusion that the symptoms of pain manifested themselves in the neck and shoulder area, the mere fact that the employee’s use of his upper extremities in certain ways acted as a triggering mechanism for the disabling pain he experienced in his neck, shoulders, and upper back did not transform his claim into a scheduled member injury, and there was no proof that the employee’s physical complaints related directly to his arms rather than his neck and shoulders. Arendale v. Balkamp, Inc., 879 So. 2d 448, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 892 (Miss. Ct. App. 2003), cert. denied, 878 So. 2d 66, 2004 Miss. LEXIS 887 (Miss. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Workers’ compensation statutes guaranteed a measure of compensation to an injured worker who suffered a permanent impairment to a scheduled member as the result of a work-related injury, and the claimant’s injury to both hands qualified as a scheduled member under the statute; moreover the measure of compensation guaranteed was in spite of the fact that the claimant appeared to have suffered no loss of wage-earning capacity. Ard v. Marshall Durbin Cos., 2001 Miss. App. LEXIS 540 (Miss. Ct. App. Dec. 18, 2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       The determination for permanent partial disability benefits for the industrial loss of the use of a scheduled member does not encompass an identification of wage earning capacity, but rather a determination of functional loss of use presented by medical evidence and the impact that the loss of function has on the worker’s ability to perform the normal and customary duties associated with the claimant’s usual employment; thus, evidence regarding a claimant’s post-injury wage earnings is not relevant to such a determination. McCarty Farms, Inc. v. Banks, 773 So. 2d 380, 2000 Miss. App. LEXIS 290 (Miss. Ct. App. 2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       The measure of compensation to an injured worker who suffers a permanent functional impairment to a scheduled member as the result of a work-related injury and the impact that the loss of function of the particular scheduled member has on the worker’s ability to perform the normal and customary duties associated with her usual employment, called the degree of industrial disability, is a question of fact to be determined from the evidence. Robinette v. Henry I. Siegal Co., 801 So. 2d 739, 2000 Miss. App. LEXIS 14 (Miss. Ct. App. 2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the claimant injured his foot, which was considered a scheduled member under the statute, his loss of wage earning capacity was irrelevant; therefore, it was immaterial whether he attempted to or failed to find employment after reaching maximum medical improvement. Cook v. President Casino, 740 So. 2d 963, 1999 Miss. App. LEXIS 325 (Miss. Ct. App. 1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       A claimant seeking compensation for an occupational disability to a scheduled member which exceeds the assigned partial functional impairment and yet falls short of 100% must establish under subsection (c) that the partial impairment has adversely impacted his or her wage earning capacity to an extent greater than the medical percentage of impairment. Alumax Extrusions Inc. v. Wright, 737 So. 2d 416, 1998 Miss. App. LEXIS 1114 (Miss. Ct. App. 1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a worker’s occupational disability from loss of use of a scheduled member exceeds functional or medical impairment, the law measures the worker’s compensation by the former. Walker Mfg. Co. v. Cantrell, 577 So. 2d 1243, 1991 Miss. LEXIS 190 (Miss. 1991).

   Even though a worker suffered injury only to the second and third fingers of his left hand, the Compensation Commission’s finding that the disability rating under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c03s71-3-17" target="_self">71-3-17</a></cite> was to the entire hand as opposed to a percentage of disability to the fingers only was not in error under the particular facts of the particular claim.

       Where the great weight of evidence indicated that a worker had sustained an injury to his shoulder with functional loss affecting only the right arm, compensation was properly limited to the schedule which includes the right arm; such an injury would not be related to the body as a whole.

       Where a claimant suffered a permanent partial disability of the right arm as a consequence of falling from a ladder and striking a concrete driveway with his shoulder, and there was no medical finding of fracture or tear and that portion of his disability attributable to the injury consisted only of a mild or subacute tenosymovitis, his injury was correctly related to his loss of use of the arm, a scheduled member rather than to a general physical disability.

      <p>
       Although the pupil of one of the claimant’s eyes, which was injured in an industrial accident, was almost twice as large as the other eye, the refusal of the commission to make an award for disfigurement did not constitute an abuse of its discretion, where it appeared that the claimant, as long as he continued to work for the employer, received the same wage as he had received before the injury.

       In a workmen’s compensation proceeding the estimates of two doctors as to the extent of the claimant’s loss of use of the left arm were mere estimates of medical disability, and it was for the commission to decide whether the claimant’s loss of use of the arm was a total loss of use or partial loss of use for wage-earning purposes.

       Where the loss of a scheduled member is less than total, claimant is entitled to compensation at a rate of 662/3% of his average weekly wage, subject to the maximum limitations for weekly benefits contained in the Workmen’s Compensation Act, for a period of time determined by multiplying the number of weeks compensation for such member by the percentage loss of that member.

       The formula of compensation for permanent partial disability, resulting from fractures in transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrae, which medical testimony indicated to be from 10 percent to 50 percent, is 662/3% of the difference between the claimant’s average weekly wages and his wage earning capacity thereafter, and not an apportionment of the percentage of permanent partial disability to the number of weeks allowed for total disability and payment of claimant’s regular compensation rate for the number of weeks thus determined, since such an injury comes within the “other cases” classification of this section [Code 1942, § 6998-09] and compensation benefits are limited to the sum of $8,600.

       Court of Appeals erred in reversing a decision by the Workers’ Compensation Commission that awarded the employee permanent-partial disability benefits because the case involved a permanent-partial disability to an employee’s leg, the Commission’s decision was consistent with the law governing benefits for a permanent-partial disability, and was supported by substantial evidence.

       Mississippi Workers’ Compensation Commission properly determined that an employee was only entitled to a two-percent industrial loss of use because the employee failed to prove she suffered a disability that amounted to an industrial loss of use greater than the medical impairment percentage she was assigned by her doctor, nothing in the doctor’s findings indicated that the employee’s injury had produced any physical work restrictions sufficient to support a finding that she had an industrial loss of use in excess of her permanent impairment rating, the employee was actually making a higher salary now than she was pre-injury, and the employee had not received any subsequent medical treatment or any prescription medicine related to her injury.

       The medical and vocational proof rebutted any presumption as to a claimant’s alleged total industrial loss of use to the right upper extremity because the claimant’s post-injury employment with the employer demonstrated that the claimant could perform some of the substantial acts of the claimant’s usual employment, a vocational expert testified about the job opportunities that were available to the claimant, and the claimant did not demonstrate an incapacity post-injury to earn the same wages as the claimant was earning pre-injury.

       Where an employee was injured while working, was terminated, and sought workers’ compensation benefits, it was not error to find that the employee was 20% permanently partially disabled, because, inter alia, (1) the ability to earn post-injury wages, even significantly diminished post-injury wages, defeated a claim of permanent total disability, and (2) the employee found employment meeting the “usual employment” standard based on a bus driver job.

       The claimant should have been assigned a permanent total disability rating and received 450 weeks of benefits where (1) although his second and third fingers were not seriously injured, his little finger was half amputated, his ring finger was shortened at the first joint, and even after several surgeries, he had no feeling or motion in his thumb and could not grip with it, (2) the claimant had constant pain in his left hand, attributable in large part to neuromas in his palm, ring finger, and thumb which caused him pain when he touched anything, and (3) the claimant was rendered permanently incapable of performing the only job he had ever been trained to do, i.e., trim carpenter.

       A road construction worker was properly determined to suffer from three permanent partial disabilities, rather than permanent total disability, notwithstanding his inability to return to his pre-injury job, where (1) the employer offered to rehire the worker as a flagman, (2) the worker was furnished with a vocational rehabilitation counselor who attempted to work with him to identify and pursue other employment opportunities, but he was uncooperative, missed two scheduled appointments with the counselor, and apparently never pursued any of the job positions identified by the counselor, and (3) there was no evidence that the worker independently pursued any other gainful employment for which he might have been suited, taking into account his diminished physical abilities.

      </p>
      <p>
       The decision of the Commission awarding permanent partial disability was upheld where there was substantial evidence in the record to support a determination that claimant failed to demonstrate that her industrial disabilities, as measured by her ability to perform her usual pre-injury employment, exceeded the functional impairment indicated by the expert medical evidence.

       The claimant was properly found to be permanently and totally disabled, rather than permanently and partially disabled, where (1) although she returned to work after she injured her wrist, she worked in constant pain, and (2) all attempts to find work or prospects of employment for the claimant were unsuccessful.

       When a claimant, having reached maximum medical recovery, reports back to his or her employer for work, and the employer refuses to reinstate or rehire the claimant, then it is prima facie that the claimant has met his or her burden of showing total disability; the burden then shifts to the employer to prove a partial disability or that the claimant has suffered no loss of wage earning capacity.

       The evidence supported a finding that an employee suffered a 100 percent industrial loss of use of his left leg, rather than only a 40 percent loss, even though the employee’s treating physician testified that the employee had a 40 percent permanent partial impairment of his left leg, where the physician also testified that the employee would be limited in activities such as standing for long periods, climbing ladders and stairs, and carrying heavy loads but that he could work in sedentary types of positions where he could sit to do the work, the employee was a 43-year-old man who dropped out of school during the 10th grade, from that time until the time of his injury he worked in construction, did carpentry work, and delivered furniture, at the time of the injury he was employed at a furniture company where he did not perform any one particular job but was moved around from job to job as needed, some of the jobs that he performed at the company included working in the sanding department, cutting out chest-of-drawer tops, and working in the mill, the employee testified that after his injury he could not do carpentry work and could not do any jobs which required him to stand but he could sand edges and use a table saw, and he testified that he continued to have problems with his leg every day, including swelling and pain.

       The evidence was sufficient to support a finding that a claimant suffered only a 5 percent permanent partial occupational disability by reason of a work-connected injury to his left hand, where the claimant failed to offer evidence that he had unsuccessfully attempted to perform his usual duties, and he failed to offer evidence that he was refused employment based upon the disability to his hand in that he made no search for work outside his prior employment, stating that his car had been repossessed and he was without transportation.

       Last injurious exposure rule was applicable where substantial evidence showed claimant’s injury resulted from 31 spent years working for the former employer, and any aggravation suffered with the subsequent employer, did not independently contribute to claimant’s final disability, as the undisputed facts showed claimant’s foot bothered claimant so severely while employed with the former employer, that claimant underwent two surgeries, and had incurred several periods of disability while with the former employer.

       Where one enjoys the functional ability to perform his work in spite of an existing congenital defect and suffers an injury which aggravates the said defect, thereafter causing a loss of his functional ability, then as long as the functional loss continues the injured party is eligible for compensation; when an injury causes loss of functional ability, it is compensable, even though such loss was due to aggravation of a preexisting congenital defect.

Hardaway v. Howard Indus., 211 So.3d 718, 2016 Miss. App. LEXIS 331 (Miss. Ct. App. 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       Circuit court properly dismissed the employees’ bad faith lawsuits against their employer and a workers’ compensation administrator where the employees had filed the lawsuits prior to obtaining a final judgment that they were entitled to the workers’ compensation benefits allegedly denied in bad faith. Hardaway v. Howard Indus., 211 So.3d 718, 2016 Miss. App. LEXIS 331 (Miss. Ct. App. 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       Workers’ Compensation Commission did not err in determining that the claimant was entitled to temporary partial disability benefits based on a difference between his pre-injury and actual post-injury wages despite the employer’s evidence of fluctuations in overtime hours. Howard Indus. v. Hardaway, 191 So.3d 1257, 2015 Miss. App. LEXIS 465 (Miss. Ct. App. 2015), cert. denied, 202 So.3d 208, 2016 Miss. LEXIS 207 (Miss. 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Employee was entitled to temporary disability benefits under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c03s71-3-21" target="_self">71-3-21</a></cite> for a certain period of time, and only for those periods within that time when the employee was, because of the injury, unable to work and earn full pay, and the case was remanded to reflect this fact; it was error to have awarded the employee a total amount of temporary benefits under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c03s71-3-17ol1b" target="_self">71-3-17(b)</a></cite>, with a credit to the employer for any compensation earned by the employee during that time, because this was not a total disability, and this calculation did not lead to the proper credit. Howard Indus. v. Robinson, 846 So. 2d 245, 2002 Miss. App. LEXIS 574 (Miss. Ct. App. 2002).
      </p>
      <p>
       The claimant was not entitled to temporary partial disability benefits for the period during which he received more compensation for his employment in a new position than in his previous jobs. City of Laurel v. Blackledge, 1999 Miss. App. LEXIS 333 (Miss. Ct. App. June 22, 1999), op. withdrawn, sub. op., 755 So. 2d 573, 2000 Miss. App. LEXIS 88 (Miss. Ct. App. 2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       Against the argument that having once found permanent partial disability, the commission should not thereafter make findings of temporary disability since such would prolong permanent payments on a subsequent finding of a new temporary disability, the commission properly awarded temporary disability after having found permanent partial disability where the evidence supported the award and the order allowed credit for benefits paid. Weaver Pants Co. v. Duncan, 231 So. 2d 489, 1970 Miss. LEXIS 1590 (Miss. 1970).
      </p>
      <p>
       To require a hearing each two weeks to determine whether temporary disability continues would not be reasonable. Komp Equipment Co. v. Clinton, 236 Miss. 560, 112 So. 2d 541, 1959 Miss. LEXIS 351 (Miss. 1959).
      </p>
      <p>
       The commission, in determining the period for which compensation for temporary disability should be allowed, following supreme court’s affirmance of an award made by an attorney-referee, should require payment from the making of the award to the date of its approval by the commission. Jackson Ready-Mix Concrete v. Young, 236 Miss. 550, 111 So. 2d 255, 1959 Miss. LEXIS 349 (Miss. 1959).
      </p>
      <p>
       Temporary disability is not conclusively presumed to continue until the appellate court’s affirmance of an award therefor, so as to require payments of compensation for the period of pendency of the appeal. Jackson Ready-Mix Concrete v. Young, 236 Miss. 550, 111 So. 2d 255, 1959 Miss. LEXIS 349 (Miss. 1959).

    Hernia.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      In all cases of claim for hernia, it shall be shown by a preponderance of the evidence:
     </p>
     <p>
      That the descent or protrusion of the hernia or rupture immediately followed as the result of sudden effort, severe strain, or the application of force to the abdominal wall;
     </p>
     <p>
      That there was severe pain in the region of the hernia or rupture;
     </p>
     <p>
      That there has been no descent or protrusion of the hernia or rupture prior to the accident for which compensation is claimed;
     </p>
     <p>
      That the physical distress resulting from the descent or protrusion of the hernia or rupture was noticed immediately by claimant, and communicated to his employer within a reasonable time; and
     </p>
     <p>
      That the physical distress following the descent or protrusion of the hernia or rupture was such as to require the attendance of a licensed physician or surgeon within five (5) days after the injury for which compensation is claimed. Postoperative hernias shall be considered as original hernias.
     </p>
     <p>
      In every case of hernia or rupture as above defined, it shall be the duty of the employer forthwith to provide the necessary and proper medical, surgical, and hospital care and attention to effectuate a cure by radical operation of said hernia or rupture, and to pay compensation under the provisions of paragraph (b) of Section 71-3-17, not exceeding, however, a period of twenty-six (26) weeks.
     </p>
     <p>
      In case the employee shall refuse to permit such operation, it shall be the duty of the employer to provide all necessary first aid, medical and hospital care and services, to supply the proper and necessary truss or other mechanical appliance to enable said employee to resume work, and shall further pay compensation under the provisions of paragraph (b) of Section 71-3-17, not exceeding, however, the period of thirteen (13) weeks.
     </p>
     <p>
      In case death results within a period of one (1) year, either from the hernia or rupture or from the radical operation thereof, compensation shall be paid the dependents as provided in other death cases under this chapter.

       This section [Code 1942, § 6998-12] applies only if the hernia results from an accidental injury that arose out of and in the course of the employee’s employment, but where an employee sustains internal injuries while on the job which require surgical entering into the abdomen which results in a postoperative hernia, this section has no application. Con-Plex, Inc. v. Clack, 207 So. 2d 83, 1968 Miss. LEXIS 1593 (Miss. 1968).

      <p>
       In a workmen’s compensation case, where judgment of circuit court and the award of commission merely adjudicated that the claimant should have all the benefits of the Workmen’s Compensation Law as related to hernia without awarding any definite fixed sum of money, on appeal the supreme court, upon affirmance of judgment, could not allow damages. J. & B. Mfg. Co. v. Cochran, 216 Miss. 336, 62 So. 2d 378, 1953 Miss. LEXIS 642 (Miss. 1953).

      <p>
       Under this section [Code 1942, § 6998-12], when, as a result of sudden effort or severe strain, or both, there is a severe strain in the hernial region, and the employee is rendered unable to work, if the pain is sufficient to require the services of a doctor within forty-eight hours, and if the occurrence is communicated to his employer within that time, the hernia is compensable. Lucedale Veneer Co. v. Rogers, 211 Miss. 613, 48 So. 2d 148, 1950 Miss. LEXIS 356 (Miss. 1950).

       Where the record showed that there had been a previous descent or protrusion of hernia before the accident in question, appellants failed to bring their claim within the requirements of this section [Code 1942, §
   Dependents of Flood v. NCO Open Mess, etc., 238 Miss. 207, 118 So. 2d 294, 1960 Miss. LEXIS 397 (Miss. 1960).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the evidence not only failed to prove that there had been no descent or protrusion of the hernia prior to the accident for which compensation was claimed, but, in fact, clearly showed to the contrary, the action of the commission in denying compensation to the claimant would be affirmed. Ray v. Wells-Lamont Glove Factory, 236 Miss. 154, 109 So. 2d 544, 1959 Miss. LEXIS 304 (Miss. 1959).
      </p>
      <p>
       While generally a pre-existing disease or infirmity does not disqualify a claim under the “arising out of employment” requirements of the Workmen’s Compensation Law if the employment aggravated, accelerated, or combined with the disease or infirmity to produce the death or disability for which compensation is sought, in hernia cases effect must be given to this section [Code 1942, § 6998-12]. Fagan v. Wells-Lamont, Inc., 228 Miss. 660, 89 So. 2d 632, 1956 Miss. LEXIS 560 (Miss. 1956).
      </p>
      <p>
       In view of this section [Code 1942, § 6998-12] claimant’s failure to prove that there had been no descent or protrusion of her incisional hernia prior to the accident for which compensation was claimed barred recovery benefits for the aggravation of a pre-existing hernia. Fagan v. Wells-Lamont, Inc., 228 Miss. 660, 89 So. 2d 632, 1956 Miss. LEXIS 560 (Miss. 1956).

       The provision of this section [Code 1942, § 6998-12] that a claimant must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that there has been no descent or protrusion of a hernia prior to the accident for which compensation is claimed is a statutory prerequisite to recovery for hernia claims.

      <p>
       A claimant for workmen’s compensation benefits who suffered a hernia while carrying heavy pipe and immediately went to see the company’s nurse, who advised him that she would send him to a doctor if it happened again, satisfied the statutory requirement that physical distress following the sudden protrusion of a hernia must require the attendance of a doctor within five days after the injury; the fact that he did not actually see a doctor within five days did not defeat the claim. Bechtel Constr. Co. v. Bartlett, 371 So. 2d 398, 1979 Miss. LEXIS 2065 (Miss. 1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where claimant was injured on June 10, 1964, did not see a doctor until 55 days later on August 4, 1964, did not quit work until 57 days after his injury, and was operated on for an inguinal hernia on August 7, 1964, the evidence was insufficient to establish that he “required” the attendance of a physician or surgeon within 5 days following his injury. Biloxi Motor Co. v. Barry, 192 So. 2d 403, 1966 Miss. LEXIS 1254 (Miss. 1966).

      <p>
       In the provision in this section [Code 1942, § 6998-12] which requires attendance of physician within five days after injury for which compensation is claimed, the word “require” means to want, to need, to call for, and this section does not require that injured employee in a hernia case be denied compensation because he was not actually attended by a licensed physician within the five-day period. Lindsey v. Ingalls Shipbuilding Corp., 219 Miss. 437, 68 So. 2d 872, 1954 Miss. LEXIS 351 (Miss. 1954).

Lindsey v. Ingalls Shipbuilding Corp., 219 Miss. 437, 68 So. 2d 872, 1954 Miss. LEXIS 351 (Miss. 1954).

       Where substantial evidence establishes a causal connection between claimant’s surgery for repair of a hernia and the physical discomforts and disabilities suffered since that time, a claimant is not necessarily limited to the specific award for hernia alone.

       One claiming compensation in addition to the statutory allowance for a hernia has the burden of showing that the injury caused additional disability resulting in a greater and more prolonged incapacity than the hernia.

    Compensation for death.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      If the injury causes death, the compensation shall be known as a death benefit and shall be payable in the amount and to or for the benefit of the persons following:
     </p>
     <p>
      An immediate lump-sum payment of One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00) to the surviving spouse, in addition to other compensation benefits.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reasonable funeral expenses not exceeding Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000.00) exclusive of other burial insurance or benefits.
     </p>
     <p>
      If there be a surviving spouse and no child of the deceased, to such surviving spouse thirty-five percent (35%) of the average wages of the deceased during widowhood or dependent widowhood and, if there be a surviving child or children of the deceased, the additional amount of ten percent (10%) of such wages for each such child. In case of the death or remarriage of such surviving spouse, any surviving child of the deceased employee shall have his compensation increased to fifteen percent (15%) of such wages, provided that the total amount payable shall in no case exceed sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66-2/3%) of such wages, subject to the maximum limitations as to weekly benefits as set up in this chapter. The commission may, in its discretion, require the appointment of a guardian for the purpose of receiving the compensation of a minor dependent. In the absence of such a requirement, the appointment of a guardian for such purposes shall not be necessary, provided that if no legal guardian be appointed, payment to the natural guardian shall be sufficient.
     </p>
     <p>
      If there be a surviving child or children of the deceased but no surviving spouse, then for the support of each such child twenty-five percent (25%) of the wages of the deceased, provided that the aggregate shall in no case exceed sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66-2/3%) of such wages, subject to the maximum limitations as to weekly benefits as set up in this chapter.
     </p>
     <p>
      If there be no surviving spouse or child, or if the amount payable to a surviving spouse and to children shall be less in the aggregate than sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66-2/3%) of the average wages of the deceased, subject to the maximum limitations as to weekly benefits as set up in this chapter, then for the support of grandchildren or brothers and sisters, if dependent upon the deceased at the time of the injury, fifteen percent (15%) of such wages for the support of each such person; and for the support of each parent or grandparent of the deceased, if dependent upon him at the time of injury, fifteen percent (15%) of such wages during such dependency.

      The total weekly compensation payments to any or all beneficiaries in death cases shall not exceed the weekly benefits as set up in this chapter and shall in no case be paid for a longer period than four hundred fifty (450) weeks or for a greater amount than the multiple of four hundred fifty (450) weeks times sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66-2/3%) of the average weekly wage for the state.

       Laws of 1988, ch. 446, § 6, provides as follows:
      </p>
      <p>
       “SECTION 6. This act shall take effect and be in force from and after July 1, 1988; provided, however, the increase in benefits allowed under this act shall apply only to claims arising on or after July 1, 1988.
      </p>
      <p>
       “For claims arising prior to July 1, 1988, the following provisions of
   Section 71-3-25 (as it appeared prior to the amendment in 1988 and reenactment in 1990) shall apply:
      </p>
      <p>
       “If the injury causes death, the compensation shall be known as a death benefit and shall be payable in the amount and to or for the benefit of the persons following:
      </p>
      <p>
       “(a) An immediate lump sum payment of two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) to the surviving spouse, in addition to other compensation benefits.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(b) Reasonable funeral expenses not exceeding two thousand dollars ($2,000.00) exclusive of other burial insurance or benefits.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(c) If there be a surviving spouse and no child of the deceased, to such surviving spouse thirty-five percent (35%) of the average wages of the deceased during widowhood or dependent widowhood and, if there be a surviving child or children of the deceased, the additional amount of ten percent (10%) of such wages for each such child. In case of the death or remarriage of such surviving spouse, any surviving child of the deceased employee shall have his compensation increased to fifteen percent (15%) of such wages, provided that the total amount payable shall in no case exceed sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66-2/3%) of such wages, subject to the maximum limitations as to weekly benefits as set up in this chapter. The commission may, in its discretion, require the appointment of a guardian for the purpose of receiving the compensation of a minor dependent. In the absence of such a requirement, the appointment of a guardian for such purposes shall not be necessary, provided that if no legal guardian be appointed, payment to the natural guardian shall be sufficient.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(d) If there be a surviving child or children of the deceased but no surviving spouse, then for the support of each such child twenty-five percent (25%) of the wages of the deceased, provided that the aggregate shall in no case exceed sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66-2/3%) of such wages, subject to the maximum limitations as to weekly benefits as set up in this chapter.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(e) If there be no surviving spouse or child, or if the amount payable to a surviving spouse and to children shall be less in the aggregate than sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66-2/3%) of the average wages of the deceased, subject to the maximum limitations as to weekly benefits as set up in this chapter, then for the support of grandchildren or brothers and sisters, if dependent upon the deceased at the time of the injury, fifteen percent (15%) of such wages for the support of each such person; and for the support of each parent or grandparent of the deceased, if dependent upon him at the time of injury, fifteen percent (15%) of such wages during such dependency. But in no case shall the aggregate amount payable under this subsection exceed the difference between sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66-2/3%) of such wages and the amount payable as hereinbefore provided to surviving spouse and for the support of surviving child or children, subject to the maximum limitations as to weekly benefits as set up in this chapter.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(f) The total weekly compensation payments to any or all beneficiaries in death cases shall not exceed the weekly benefits as set up in this chapter and shall in no case be paid for a longer period than four hundred fifty (450) weeks or a greater amount than fifty-six thousand seven hundred dollars ($56,700.00) until June 30, 1985; as to claims arising on and after July 1, 1985, such payments shall not exceed fifty-nine thousand eight hundred fifty dollars ($59,850.00); and as to claims arising on and after July 1, 1986, such payments shall not exceed sixty-three thousand dollars ($63,000.00).
      </p>
      <p>
       “(g) All questions of dependency shall be determined as of the time of the injury. A surviving spouse, child or children shall be presumed to be wholly dependent. All other dependents shall be considered on the basis of total or partial dependence as the facts may warrant.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Laws of 2012, ch. 522, §§ 10 and 11, provide:
      </p>
      <p>
       “SECTION 10. The Workers’ Compensation Commission shall promulgate a written statement specifying the changes made to the Workers’ Compensation Law by this act to every employer in this state subject to the Workers’ Compensation Law.
   Within ten (10) days of receipt of this written statement from the Commission, every employer shall post the Commission’s statement in a conspicuous place or places in and about his place or places of business and adjacent to the Notice of Coverage as required by
   Section 71-3-81.
      </p>
      <p>
       “SECTION 11. This act shall take effect and be in force from and after July 1, 2012, and shall apply to injuries occurring on or after July 1, 2012.”

   Since a claim for disability is separate and distinct from a claim for death benefits, the 1960 amendment to subsection (9) of Code 1942, § 6998-02 [now subsection (i) of Code 1972, §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c03s71-3-3" target="_self">71-3-3</a></cite>], requiring that incapacity and the extent thereof be supported by medical findings, did not eliminate the presumption of causal connection between the employment and death occurring while the employee is engaged in the duties of his employment, particularly since the 1960 amendment did not affect subsection (3) of Code 1942, § 6998-02 [now subsection (c) of Code 1972, §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c03s71-3-3" target="_self">71-3-3</a></cite>].

       Legislature did not purpose and intend to provide greater benefits for permanent partial disability than for death or permanent total disability, and the court in construing the Workmen’s Compensation Law should give effect to the legislative purpose and policy although such construction may go beyond the letter of the law.

       A finding that the second wife of a deceased employee, as well as her children by a former marriage, were entitled to share in the death benefits resulting from the employee’s death, was affirmed where there was evidence showing that the stepchildren were dependent upon the decedent for support, and that the wife and children were not living apart from the decedent without justifiable excuse.

       The words “surviving wife” as used in the Workmen’s Compensation Law mean widow entitled to compensation, and where the wife of deceased has entered into marriage with another long prior to death of deceased, and lived with another man and was supported by him, each illegitimate child of deceased was entitled to compensation.

       Where a man and woman lived together for three years and a child was born, but they did not hold themselves out as husband and wife, and both later separated and each of them contracted a ceremonial marriage, this was insufficient evidence to substantiate a common law marriage and the man’s ceremonial marriage was valid, and the widow was entitled to compensation upon the death of her husband.

       Workers’ Compensation Commission’s decision that the child was not a dependent of the decedent and thus not entitled to an award of death benefits was supported by substantial evidence; because of the child’s age (26-years old) and marital status (married), an award of death benefits to her would not be proper unless she was wholly dependent on the decedent, and given the myriad income sources available to and used by the child, the appellate court could hardly view the receipt of such income as sporadic or insubstantial. Descendants of Gilmer v. Nolen Sistrunk Trucking, Inc., 892 So. 2d 825, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 867 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004), cert. denied, 893 So. 2d 1061, 2005 Miss. LEXIS 80 (Miss. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Workers’ Compensation Commission’s decision that the decedent’s grandchildren were not dependents and thus not entitled to death benefits was supported by substantial evidence, because there was no indication in the record that the grandchildren knew the decedent was providing support to them, much less that they expected his support in the future Descendants of Gilmer v. Nolen Sistrunk Trucking, Inc., 892 So. 2d 825, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 867 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004), cert. denied, 893 So. 2d 1061, 2005 Miss. LEXIS 80 (Miss. 2005).

       A married daughter, living apart from her husband and with the deceased at the time of his death, who was over the age of 18 years, not wholly dependent upon the deceased, and not incapable of self-support by reasons of mental or physical disability, was precluded from the allowance of any benefits for the death of her father.

       Where there was evidence showing that the stepchildren were dependent upon decedent for support, and that the wife and stepchildren were not living apart from decedent without justifiable excuse, a finding that the second wife of a deceased employee, as well as her children by a former marriage, were entitled to share in the death benefits was affirmed.

       Even though a child qualifies as a dependent as of the time of injury because he is then under 18 years of age, he ceases to be a child within the meaning of the Workmen’s Compensation Law when he reaches the age of 18 years unless he is incapable of self-support by reason of mental or physical disability.

      <p>
       Since one of the primary purposes of the Workmen’s Compensation Law is to relieve society of the burden of supporting helpless children in orphanages and public almshouses, it would be inconsistent with the primary purpose of that law to allow children over the age of 18 years, who are physically and mentally able to support themselves, to receive compensation and deplete the award to the detriment of younger children who, because of age, are unable to support themselves.

       The time of employee’s death is the critical date in determining whether his daughter was dependent upon him under the Workmen’s Compensation Law. Accordingly, where a daughter of deceased employee was under 18 at the time of his death and married a month after his death and was supported by her husband afterwards, the compensation to the daughter would not be terminated as of the date of her marriage.

       The term “dependent” must be liberally interpreted, and includes those partially dependent as well as those wholly dependent, and one is dependent if he relies upon the employee, in whole or in part, for his support.

       The legislature in drafting the Workmen’s Compensation Law was well aware of the various kinds of compensation statutes, yet it failed to provide for any method of computing a reduced percentage of benefits for partial dependents, and the supreme court will not assume that the legislature intended to do so. Bradshaw v. Rudder, 227 Miss. 143, 85 So. 2d 778, 1956 Miss. LEXIS 665 (Miss. 1956).
      </p>
      <p>
       The 1950 amendment to Code 1942, § 6998-07, providing for a minimum weekly compensation of $10.00 “except in partial dependency cases,” permits the payment to a dependent under this section [Code 1942, § 6998-13] of an amount less than the minimum, (a) where his statutory compensation is less than that amount, and (b) where such dependent is partially and not wholly dependent on the deceased employee; if he is wholly dependent, then the $10.00 applies.

      </p>

       The words in the latter part of this section [Code 1942, § 6998-13], that “all other dependents shall be considered on the basis of total or partial dependency as the facts may warrant,” was intended to mean that such dependents shall be considered for the purpose of determining whether they are dependent on the basis of total or partial dependency as the facts may warrant, and the court should not insert after the verb “considered” the phrase “for the purpose of determining the amount of the award.” and it was held that where surviving parents of deceased 18-year-old son were found to be partially dependent, they were entitled to 15% of his average weekly wage as provided by this section and not a percentage thereof estimated from the percentage of dependency.

       Where a claim is doubtful, disputed, and not readily collectible, and the proposed amount of a compromise settlement is fair and reasonable, and it is for the best interest of the claimants that a settlement with commutation and a lump sum payment be accepted, such a compromise will be authorized by the court.

    Determination of wages.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Except as otherwise specifically provided, the basis for compensation under this chapter shall be the average weekly wages earned by the employee at the time of the injury, such wages to be determined from the earnings of the injured employee in the employment in which he was working at the time of the injury during the period of fifty-two (52) weeks immediately preceding the date of the injury divided by fifty-two (52); but if the injured employee lost more than seven (7) days during such period, although not in the same week, then the earnings for the remainder of such fifty-two (52) weeks shall be divided by the number of weeks remaining after the time so lost has been deducted. When the employment prior to the injury extended over a period of less than fifty-two (52) weeks, the method of dividing the earnings during that period by the number of weeks and parts thereof during which the employee earned wages shall be followed, provided that results just and fair to both parties will thereby be obtained. Where, by reason of the shortness of time during which the employee has been in the employment of his employer, it is impracticable to compute the average weekly wages by the above method of computation, regard shall be had to the average weekly amount which, during the first fifty-two (52) weeks prior to the injury or death, was being earned by a person in the same grade, employed at the same or similar work in the community. Wherever allowances of any character are made to an employee in lieu of wages or specified as part of the wage contract, they shall be deemed a part of his earnings.

       Workers’ Compensation Commission erred in computing an employee’s disability benefits because such wages were statutorily required to be based on “actual earnings before injury with the earning capacity after injury,” the parties stipulated that the employee’s average weekly wage was $645.40, which included regular overtime, such that the employee was entitled to $191.33 per week for 450 weeks rather than the $132.40 arrived at by the Commission, which failed to use the employee’s overtime in calculating his pre-injury hourly wage. Nixon v. Howard Indus., 249 So.3d 1088, 2018 Miss. App. LEXIS 298 (Miss. Ct. App. 2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Workers’ Compensation Commission did not err in calculating a claimant’s average weekly wage because Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c03s71-3-31" target="_self">71-3-31</a></cite> did not literally apply given the claimant’s unique work schedule while employed in the oil field industry; the claimant worked in a two-week block of time, comprised of a seven-days-on, seven-days-off, twelve-hours-a-day work schedule. Mixon v. Greywolf Drilling Co., LP, 62 So.3d 414, 2010 Miss. App. LEXIS 671 (Miss. Ct. App. 2010).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Nothing prevented the inclusion of all wages from the same employer in determining average weekly wage for an injured employer, and whether the other position in which a claimant was not engaged at the moment of injury was one in which the claimant should be considered as being contemporaneously employed needs to be determined as a matter of fact; the combined total of the employee’s wages had to reflect the earnings from the same employer for the 52-week period prior to injury and were subject to Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c03s71-3-31" target="_self">71-3-31</a></cite>. Piney Woods Country Life Sch. v. Young, 946 So. 2d 805, 2006 Miss. App. LEXIS 569 (Miss. Ct.

      </p>
      <p>
       The claimant’s injury as a result of a 1981 accident was not to be compensated at his average weekly wage in 1981, the time of his accident, but at his average weekly wage in 1993, the date he was declared permanently disabled where (1) he underwent two spinal surgeries to correct damage done as a result of his accident in 1981, (2) he returned to work after the first surgery and continued to work up until 1993, a period of over 11 years, (3) between the 1981 accident and the ultimate end of his employment in 1993, he received promotions and salary increases for his service to his employer, and (4) during this time, his condition gradually and progressively deteriorated to the point that in 1993 he was declared permanently disabled and unable to continue working for his employer. J. H. Moon & Sons Inc. v. Johnson, 1999 Miss. App. LEXIS 12 (Miss. Ct. App. Jan. 26, 1999), aff'd, 753 So. 2d 445, 1999 Miss. LEXIS 383 (Miss. 1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where claimant suffered a single injury in 1981 and the injury gradually worsened and progressed to a permanent injury which manifested itself as a total disability in July 1993, the rate of compensation should be based on Johnson’s salary and/or wages for July 1993. J. H. Moon & Sons, Inc. v. Johnson, 753 So. 2d 445, 1999 Miss. LEXIS 383 (Miss. 1999).

       Worker who originally intends to return to work full time after birth of child but who only returns to work part time due to complications arising from birth should have worker’s compensation benefits computed on basis of pay as part-time employee.

       Where there was error in determining a worker’s average weekly wage, the claim would be remanded to correct the inherent error in the amount of disability compensation awarded. Singer Co. v. Smith, 362 So. 2d 590, 1978 Miss. LEXIS 2086 (Miss. 1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       A claim for worker’s compensation was not barred by the statute of limitations where it was virtually impossible for the claimant to have known at the time of the apparently minor accident, then noncompensable, that it would develop into a compensable injury; being a latent injury case, the average weekly wage was properly determined from the date of the resultant disabling injury and not from the date of the accident. Pepsi Cola Bottling Co. v. Long, 362 So. 2d 182, 1978 Miss. LEXIS 2078 (Miss. 1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       While the basis of the claimant’s weekly wage was not dogmatically stated, it was sufficient to enable the commission, in conjunction with the provisions of this section [Code 1942, § 6998-16], to justify the determination of a fair and just wage and award of benefits on that basis. White Top & Safeway Cab Co. v. Wright, 251 Miss. 830, 171 So. 2d 510, 1965 Miss. LEXIS 908 (Miss. 1965).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the finding of the workmen’s compensation commission was favorable to claimant as to his average weekly wage, and was not manifestly wrong under conflicting evidence, the finding was sustained. Prince v. Nicholson, 229 Miss. 718, 91 So. 2d 734, 1957 Miss. LEXIS 318 (Miss. 1957).

       In determining the average weekly wage of an employee, who had been employed on an 8-hour, 5-day-week basis, was not paid when he did not work, and during the 52 weeks immediately prior to his death had lost 66 days, the proper procedure was to divide the 66 days lost by five, the work week, which would equal 13.2 weeks lost in the 52-week period, subtract 13.2 from 52, and divide the total earning for the period by 38.8.

       Measure of preinjury earnings of workman’s compensation claimant hired as temporary material handler who is injured after working only 4 days is wage rate for temporary handlers, not rate for permanent handlers where finding that, but for injury, claimant would have been promoted to permanent handler would be speculative.

      <p>
       For purposes of computing workmen’s compensation benefits for a volunteer fireman who had suffered a 25 per cent partial disability of his whole body as a result of an injury sustained in the course of fighting a fire, his average weekly wage would be determined by dividing his total wage of $35.00 by nine, the number of weeks or parts thereof that he had worked, and not by combining his wages as a volunteer fireman with those of his regular employment nor by reference to the average weekly wages for a full-time fireman in the surrounding area.

       Where a claimant began to work 4 weeks preceding the date of injury and had worked 3 days the 1st week, 2 days during the 2nd week and 3 days during each of the next 2 weeks, and her total earnings amounted to $51.28, she should have been awarded compensation in amount of $10 per week rather than an award based on an average weekly wage of $25.

       Where a claimant began work in the middle of a work week, and received his injury on the second day of the next work week, so as to be prevented from working 40 hours during the second work week, it was proper to determine claimant’s compensation upon the basis of the average weekly wage of other employees in the same grade, and doing the same work, as claimant.

       Employer’s receipt-of-payment acknowledgment form, which had to be submitted daily by a worker and included a disclaimer that the worker had not sustained any work-related injuries on that day, did not violate public policy requiring a claim of a work-related injury be submitted within thirty days after the injury. Furthermore, the employer presented evidence that payment was not contingent upon the employee signing the receipt-of-payment acknowledgment form. Barnes v. LFI Fort Pierce, Inc., 238 So.3d 7, 2018 Miss. App. LEXIS 52 (Miss. Ct. App. 2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       Continued payment of an injured employee’s salary constituted payments made in lieu of workers’ compensation benefits, and these payments thus tolled the statute of limitations for workers’ compensation claims, because the employee could not have continued to “earn” his wages while he was absent from work for more than sixteen weeks. Parchman v. Amwood Prods., 988 So. 2d 346, 2008 Miss. LEXIS 303 (Miss. 2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the claimant received benefits for about three weeks after her accident, the statute of limitations applied, rather than that in subsection (1) of this section. Taylor v. Salvation Army-Pascagoula Corps, 744 So. 2d 825, 1999 Miss. App. LEXIS 260 (Miss. Ct. App. 1999).

       Under Mississippi law, carrier which provided workers’ compensation insurance both to claimant’s employer and claimant’s alleged borrowing employer had no legitimate or arguable reason to initially deny benefits, and thus was liable for bad faith denial, notwithstanding its arguments that it had independent legitimate reasons, including dispute over whether each insured was claimant’s employer, not to pay under either policy; such reasons were irrelevant given that statutory requirements were met such that carrier had obligation to promptly pay benefits regardless of which of its insureds was claimant’s employer. Rogers v. Hartford Accident & Indem. Co., 133 F.3d 309, 1998 U.S. App. LEXIS 442 (5th Cir. Miss. 1998).

       Claim decided adversely to asbestosis claimant under the Longshoremen’s and Harbor Workers’ Compensation Act was res judicata on claim under Mississippi Workers’ Compensation, as every factual issue under the Mississippi Act, including the issue of notice to the employer, was litigated and decided adversely to claimant in the Longshoremen’s Act proceedings.

       Fact that claimant for disability benefits does not report injury until 4 days after it occurs neither proves that disability must have been caused by something other than injury in course of employment nor bars claim as untimely, notwithstanding employer’s policy requiring that workers report injuries immediately.

       The law looks with disfavor on strained and technical interpretations of statutes regarding notice of injury, and even in cases where no timely notice was given, the tendency is to temper the literal harshness of statutory bars by the recognition of various excuses and permitting waivers and exceptions.

   Employer’s continued payment of an injured employee’s wages although he performed little or no work constituted payment of wages in lieu of workers’ compensation benefits, thereby waiving the requirement of a formal claim and tolling the statute of limitations, Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c03s71-3-35ol11" target="_self">71-3-35(1)</a></cite>. Ladner v. Zachry Constr., 130 So.3d 1085, 2014 Miss. LEXIS 66 (Miss. 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       Workers’ compensation claim was time-barred because there was substantial evidence to support the Mississippi Workers’ Compensation Commission’s finding that the statute of limitations began to run when an orthopedic surgeon, on referral from the claimants’ primary-care physician, diagnosed the claimant with carpal tunnel syndrome as the claimant’s injury then became reasonably apparent and was more clearly found to be work related. Brown v. Ill. Tool Works, Inc., 135 So.3d 160, 2013 Miss. App. LEXIS 486 (Miss. Ct. App. 2013), cert. denied, 136 So.3d 437, 2014 Miss. LEXIS 188 (Miss. 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       Employee’s workers’ compensation claim was barred because she was aware of the existence and appreciated the extent and nature of her injury as a result of the 1999 fall immediately post-injury; even if she did not fully recognize the nature, seriousness, and probable compensable character of her injury in 1999, she did so at the latest on May 18, 2004, when a doctor diagnosed her with a brain stem contusion. Therefore, her petition to controvert filed on August 2, 2006, was time-barred by the two-year statute of limitations. Murray v. Ingalls Shipbuilding/NGSS, 35 So.3d 561, 2010 Miss. App. LEXIS 249 (Miss. Ct. App. 2010).

       <p>
   Trial court properly upheld the denial of a claim for workers’ compensation benefits because the employee failed to file a workers’ compensation claim within two years of being diagnosed with carpal tunnel syndrome; the employee’s claim was thus barred by the two-year statute of limitations, Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c03s71-3-35ol11" target="_self">71-3-35(1)</a></cite> Shipp v. Thomas &amp; Betts &amp; Ace Am. Ins. Co., 13 So.3d 332, 2009 Miss. App. LEXIS 43 (Miss. Ct.

       Employee first sought treatment for allergies she alleged were related to her workplace two years after she testified that her respiratory problems had started; the appellate court noted that it was obvious that the employee suffered for years, and she was hospitalized eight times in three years, but the claim was not filed until more than three years after she knew her illnesses were related to the work place, so it was time-barred. Cooper v. Miss. Dep't of Rehab. Servs., 937 So. 2d 51, 2006 Miss. App. LEXIS 643 (Miss. Ct. App. 2006).
      </p>

       <p>
   Two-year statute of limitations began to run in October 1995, when employee retired due to his gradually worsening hearing loss, rather than in 1998, when a specialist confirmed that his hearing had deteriorated even further. The employee had reasonably discovered the nature, seriousness, and probable compensable nature of his injury at the time of his retirement, and the record was also clear that he became aware of the cause of his hearing loss as early as 1993; his injury was not a “latent injury, and his claim filed in November 1999, was barred by the two-year limitation period set forth in Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c03s71-3-35" target="_self">71-3-35</a></cite>. Boykin v. Sanderson Farms, Inc., 910 So. 2d 52, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 51 (Miss. Ct. App. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Because there was no finding as to when an employee knew or should have known that the employee’s carpal tunnel syndrome was a compensable injury, it was unclear whether the claim was barred under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c03s71-3-35" target="_self">71-3-35</a></cite>; the matter was remanded for further findings of fact on this issue. Howard Indus. v.

   Worker’s claim for workers’ compensation benefits was barred by the two-year statute of limitation contained in Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c03s71-3-35" target="_self">71-3-35</a></cite> where the worker did not lose any work as a result of the injury, did not receive either disability income benefits or nonburial death benefits, and did not file her claim for benefits within two years of the injury. Jordan v. Pace Head Start, 852 So. 2d 28, 2002 Miss. App. LEXIS 256 (Miss. Ct. App. 2002).
      </p>
      <p>
       Substantial evidence supported the commission’s determination that the claimant invoked her right to disability benefits within two years after she discovered or reasonably should have discovered the work related nature of her carpal tunnel syndrome. Lucas v. Angelica Uniform Group, 733 So. 2d 285, 1998 Miss. App. LEXIS 810 (Miss. Ct. App. 1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Workers’ Compensation statute of limitations begins to run when the claimant is or reasonably should be aware of having sustained a compensable injury, but the statute is deemed not to have begun to run if the claimant’s reasonably diligent efforts to obtain treatment yield no medical confirmation of a compensable injury. Thus, the statute of limitations could not be invoked by an employer, even though the claimant did not file a motion to controvert until over 2 years after the accident, where the claimant clearly knew that he had been injured in an accident, but he did not discover the compensable nature of his injuries until over a year after the accident because his physicians remained unaware of the compensable nature of his injuries until that time. Georgia Pacific Corp. v. Taplin, 586 So. 2d 823, 1991 Miss. LEXIS 664 (Miss. 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       The two-year statute of limitations on an employee’s claim for workmen’s compensation benefits began to run when he left his employment on a four-month sick leave in 1973, where he knew or should have known the nature, seriousness and disabling character of hypertension, from which he had suffered for several years, and where his testimony established that he had actual knowledge of his disability and that it had been caused by a work-connected aggravation of hypertension. Quaker Oats Co. v. Miller, 370 So. 2d 1363, 1979 Miss. LEXIS 2049 (Miss. 1979).

       A defendant who has successfully defended an action for personal injuries resulting from a beating the plaintiff received from defendant’s foreman, on the ground that the relationship of employer-employee existed between defendant and plaintiff, cannot thereafter challenge the applicability of the Workmen’s Compensation Law to the plaintiff’s claim; provided claim for benefits is timely filed within the time extended by Code 1942, § 6998-18(c) beginning with the date of the order dismissing plaintiff’s appeal. Seal v. Industrial Electric, Inc., 395 F.2d 214, 1968 U.S. App. LEXIS 6987 (5th Cir. Miss. 1968).

       Notice is not required until there is a disability where the injury is progressive and cannot with reasonable certainty be recognized at first as compensable. Pope Co. v. Wells, 230 Miss. 199, 92 So. 2d 370, 1957 Miss. LEXIS 359 (Miss. 1957).

       Where a claimant on October 15, 1954, who, while in the course and scope of his employment, became exposed to cement dust, which aggravated an existing chronic eczema, continued his employment until March 14, 1955, when he was found to be totally disabled, and then immediately gave notice to his employer, the employer was not prejudiced by the failure of the claimant to give an earlier notice.

       Under Mississippi law, when employer has knowledge of workers’ compensation claimant’s injury, formal notice to employer of occurrence of injury is not needed to trigger carrier’s obligation to provide benefits, and this knowledge is imputed to carrier without any formal notification to carrier. Rogers v. Hartford Accident & Indem. Co., 133 F.3d 309, 1998 U.S. App. LEXIS 442 (5th Cir. Miss. 1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the employer had knowledge of an employee’s bulge or herniated disc, although not necessarily knowledge that the injury was work connected, and the employer did not show that it was prejudiced by the employee’s failure to notify the employer, the employer had adequate notice. Central Electric & Machinery Co. v. Shelton, 220 So. 2d 320, 1969 Miss. LEXIS 1454 (Miss. 1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where employers’ foreman knew of the claimant’s injury on the day that it occurred, there was no evidence that the employer was prejudiced by the late filing of the claim, and the commission found that neither the employee nor his wife knew that his injury was compensable until they consulted an attorney, there was no error in awarding compensation. Walker Mfg. Co. v. Pickens, 206 So. 2d 639, 1968 Miss. LEXIS 1583 (Miss. 1968).
      </p>
      <p>
       In view of the fact that the claim was filed with the commission within about two months after the date of injury and the evidence supported a finding that, although the claimant did not inform his foreman as to the circumstances attendant upon it, he had given notice to the foreman within several days after the occurrence of his injury, the commission was warranted in concluding that no prejudice had resulted and that an award should be made. Davis v. Clark-Burt Roofing Co., 238 Miss. 464, 119 So. 2d 926, 1960 Miss. LEXIS 429 (Miss. 1960).
      </p>
      <p>
       Knowledge of accident by superintendent of part of mill in which injured employee worked is sufficient notice to the employer, where no representative has been designated by the employer to whom notice of injury should be given. Teague v. Graning Hardwood Mfg. Co., 238 Miss. 48, 117 So. 2d 342, 1960 Miss. LEXIS 375 (Miss. 1960).
      </p>
      <p>
       Failure to notify employer of injury does not preclude compensation where employer knew of accident a few minutes after it happened and conducted an investigation. Bush v. Dependents of Byrd, 234 Miss. 782, 108 So. 2d 211, 1959 Miss. LEXIS 555 (Miss. 1959).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a record showed that the claimant had notified one of his superiors of his injury, the employer’s contention that the claimant had failed to give notice of his injury as required by this section [Code 1942, § 6998-18] was rejected. Houston Contracting Co. v. Reed, 231 Miss. 213, 95 So. 2d 231, 1957 Miss. LEXIS 507 (Miss. 1957).

       Where the claimant, who on September 28th, 1953, sustained injury arising out of the course of her employment, had notified the floor supervisor of her injury, but received no disability payments, the claimant being ignorant of the fact she was entitled thereto, a claim for compensation filed on September 21, 1955, was timely. Pascagoula Crab Co. v. Holbrooks, 230 Miss. 833, 94 So. 2d 233, 1957 Miss. LEXIS 429 (Miss. 1957).
      </p>

       Where it was undisputed that within a few days after both heart attacks suffered by the claimant he was visited in the hospital by his coworkers, including his foreman, and further that he was treated in the first aid station maintained by the employer for the benefit of injured employees and was transported by the employer’s ambulance to the hospital and from the hospital home, the employer had knowledge of the claimant’s injury and of the fact that it was suffered in the course of his employment and related to his work, and was not prejudiced by the claimant’s failure to give notice. Ingalls Shipbuilding Corp. v. Dickerson, 230 Miss. 110, 92 So. 2d 354, 1957 Miss. LEXIS 350 (Miss. 1957).
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that there was an existence of a close personal and family relationship between the injured employee and his foreman was not in itself a sufficient circumstance to render nugatory notice received by such foreman. Port Gibson Veneer & Box Co. v. Brown, 226 Miss. 127, 83 So. 2d 757, 1955 Miss. LEXIS 616 (Miss. 1955).

      </p>
      <p>
       Where an employee suffered a heart attack while at work and his foreman drove him to a hospital, and there was no showing whatsoever that the employer was prejudiced by failure of a claimant to give notice in the manner contemplated by the statute, the employer cannot complain that he had received no actual notice of the claim nor could the employer argue that the claim was barred by this section [Code 1942, § 6998-18].

       Because the claimants did not apply for workers’ compensation benefits within two years of their injuries, their claims were time-barred by the statute of limitations, in that the statute of limitations was not tolled and the employer was not estopped from asserting the statute of limitations as a defense.

Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c03s71-3-35ol11" target="_self">71-3-35(1)</a></cite> and that the employee’s salary failed to constitute wages in lieu of compensation; because nothing in the record showed that the employee’s physicians restricted him from working, and the employer insisted that it did not pay the employee his wages in recognition of a compensable disability, but rather in return for work he performed. Ladner v. Zachry Constr. &amp; Zurich Am. Ins. Co., 130 So.3d 1121, 2013 Miss. App. LEXIS 257 (Miss. Ct. App. 2013), rev'd, 130 So.3d 1085, 2014 Miss. LEXIS 66 (Miss. 2014).

       Two-year statute of limitations will not begin to run until by reasonable care and diligence it is discoverable and apparent that a compensable injury has been sustained; the statute is not deemed to have begun running if the claimant’s reasonably diligent efforts to obtain treatment yield no medical confirmation of compensable injury. Mississippi law does not penalize workers when they, with their physicians’ assistance, cannot confirm that their injuries are compensable. Miss. State Univ. v. Panuska, 20 So.3d 717, 2009 Miss.

   Claimant’s application for workers’ compensation benefits was properly dismissed as untimely under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c03s71-3-35ol11" target="_self">71-3-35(1)</a></cite> because there was no evidence that the employer paid the claimant wages in lieu of benefits to toll the two-year limitations period and there was no evidence that the employer thought that the claimant had a work-related injury.

   Claimant’s petition to controvert, which was filed in June 2005 for an August 1994 work-related injury to his hips, was time-barred under the two-year statute of limitations, Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c03s71-3-35ol11" target="_self">71-3-35(1)</a></cite>, because the injury was not latent and because the claimant reasonably should have known that he had a compensable injury from the diagnosis of avascular necrosis in 1996.

       Where an employer voluntarily paid for an employee’s work-related medical expenses for two years, the two-year statute of limitations barred the employee’s petition to controvert because the employee failed to show that the statute of limitations was tolled based on arguments regarding the employer’s voluntary payment of medical benefits, wages in lieu of compensation, a latent or progressive injury, and equitable estoppel.

Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c03s71-3-35" target="_self">71-3-35</a></cite> because the claim was barred by the statute of limitations since the employee received no benefits of any kind within the two-year period following his injury; he chose to use his wife’s medical insurance to pay for his treatment.

       Record supported the Mississippi Workers’ Compensation Commission’s finding that an employee had filed her claim for workers’ compensation benefits more than two years after she became aware that she was allergic to tobacco smoke and had experienced adverse effects from exposure to tobacco smoke in the workplace; the appellate court reversed the second trial court’s order overturning the Commission’s decision denying the employee’s claim for benefits.

       Differences in the numbers on the two B-31 Forms were mere corrections of the amount actually paid, and no additional benefits were furnished to the claimant after his settlement; the filing of a B-31 Form containing errors as to the amount of the benefits paid was sufficient to begin the running of the statute of limitations and the filing of a corrected form did not interrupt the limitations period, even if it was without notice to the claimant.

       The defendant city would not be equitably estopped from asserting the two-year time bar on the basis that city officials allegedly represented to the claimant that the city would file his claim with the Workers’ Compensation Commission on his behalf; reliance on such a statement to sink into inactivity for a period of two years could not be deemed reasonable or justifiable.

       Issues of material fact existed as to whether employer had workers’ compensation coverage, whether employer misled employee’s survivors into believing no coverage existed, and whether survivors relied on any misleading statements, precluding summary judgment as to whether statute of limitations on workers’ compensation claim should be tolled based on alleged misrepresentations by employer.

       Even if an employer had misrepresented to a claimant that he had no insurance, the employer and its insurance carrier would not be estopped from pleading the 2-year statute of limitations where the evidence established that the claimant was aware of the falsity of that representation and did not rely on it, and was aware of her rights before the expiration of the limitation period.

       A claim for worker’s compensation was not barred by the statute of limitations where it was virtually impossible for the claimant to have known at the time of the apparently minor accident, then noncompensable, that it would develop into a compensable injury; being a latent injury case, the average weekly wage was properly determined from the date of the resultant disabling injury and not from the date of the accident.

       Where claimant knew or had reason to believe that she had sustained a spider bite, but there was nothing in the record to indicate that she, as a reasonable person, should have recognized the nature, seriousness, and probable compensable character of the injury, the statute of limitations did not begin to run until by reasonable care and diligence it was discoverable and apparent that a compensable injury had been sustained. Struthers Wells--Gulfport, Inc. v. Bradford, 304 So. 2d 645, 1974 Miss. LEXIS 1465 (Miss. 1974).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where latent injuries are involved, the time for filing a compensation claim under the two-year statute commences to run when it becomes reasonably discoverable that the claimant has sustained a compensable injury and disability, or, in other words, the claim period runs from the time a compensable injury becomes reasonably apparent.

       Where a garage foreman was burned by a supposed hot welding spark falling into his ear, and none of the several doctors who treated him discovered that the source of his dizziness and other physical problems which followed the injury was a piece of slag which had become embedded in the middle ear, a workmen’s compensation claim filed within two years after the relationship between the disability and the apparently minor accident became known was timely, even though the claim was filed more than two years after the accident.

       Because the claimants did not apply for workers’ compensation benefits within two years of their injuries, their claims were time-barred by the statute of limitations. Moreover, the statute of limitations was not tolled because the sick and vacation pay which the claimants received were not wages in lieu of compensation. McInturff v. Yellow Ry. Corp., — So.3d —, 2019 Miss. App. LEXIS 169 (Miss. Ct. App. Apr. 23, 2019).

       Claimant’s untimely filed workers’ compensation claim was not saved by her employer’s filing of a Form B-52 Notice of Controversion; a Form B-52 was not an application for benefits, and therefore, contrary to the claimant’s assertion, it did not toll the statute of limitations. McKinney v. Univ. of Mississippi Med. Ctr., 110 So.3d 332, 2013 Miss. App. LEXIS 80 (Miss. Ct. App. 2013).

    Payment of compensation.

     </h3>
     <ol>
      <li id="t71c03s71-3-37ol11">
       Compensation under this chapter shall be paid periodically, promptly, in the usual manner, and directly to the person entitled thereto, without an award except where liability to pay compensation is controverted by the employer.
      </li>
      <li id="t71c03s71-3-37ol12">
       The first installment of compensation shall become due on the fourteenth (14th) day after the employer has notice, as provided in Section 71-3-35, of the injury or death, on which date all compensation then due shall be paid. Thereafter, compensation shall be paid in installments, every fourteen (14) days, except where the commission determines that payment in installments should be made at some other period.
      </li>
      <li id="t71c03s71-3-37ol13">
       Upon making the first payment and upon suspension of payment for any cause, the employer shall immediately notify the commission in accordance with a form prescribed by the commission that payment of compensation has begun or has been suspended, as the case may be. No suspension in payments of compensation shall be made for refusing to submit to medical or surgical treatment until the reasonableness of such request or refusal has been determined by the commission, and a written order suspending payment issued.
      </li>
      <li id="t71c03s71-3-37ol14">
       If the employer controverts the right to compensation he shall file with the commission, on or before the fourteenth (14th) day after he has knowledge of the alleged injury or death, a notice in accordance with a form prescribed by the commission, stating that the right to compensation is controverted, the name of the claimant, the name of the employer, the date of the alleged injury or death, and the grounds upon which the right to compensation is controverted. Failure to file this notice shall not prevent the employer raising any defense where claim is subsequently filed by the employee, nor shall the filing of the notice preclude the employer raising any additional defense.
      </li>
      <li id="t71c03s71-3-37ol15">
       If any installment of compensation payable without an award is not paid within fourteen (14) days after it becomes due, as provided in subsection (2) of this section, there shall be added to such unpaid installment an amount equal to ten percent (10%) thereof, which shall be paid at the same time as, but in addition to, such installment unless notice is filed under subsection (4) of this section, or unless such nonpayment is excused by the commission after a showing by the employer that owing to conditions over which he had no control such installment could not be paid within the period prescribed for the payment.
      </li>
      <li id="t71c03s71-3-37ol16">
       If any installment payable under the terms of an award is not paid within fourteen (14) days after it becomes due, there shall be added to such unpaid installment an amount equal to twenty percent (20%) thereof, which shall be paid at the same time as, but in addition to, such compensation unless review of the compensation order making such award is had.
      </li>
      <li id="t71c03s71-3-37ol17">
       Within thirty (30) days after the final payment of compensation has been made, the employer shall send to the commission a notice in accordance with a form prescribed by the commission, stating that such final payment has been made, the total amount of compensation paid, the name of the employee and of any other person to whom compensation has been paid, the date of the injury or death, and the date to which compensation has been paid. If the employer fails so to notify the commission within such time, the commission may assess against such employer a civil penalty in an amount not exceeding One Hundred Dollars ($100.00). No case shall be closed nor any penalty be assessed without notice to all parties interested and without giving to all such parties an opportunity to be heard.
      </li>
      <li id="t71c03s71-3-37ol18">
       The commission (a) may upon its own initiative at any time in a case in which payments are being made without an award, and (b) shall in any case where right to compensation is controverted or where payments of compensation have been stopped or suspended, upon receipt of notice from any person entitled to compensation or from the employer that the right to compensation is controverted or that payments of compensation have been stopped or suspended, make such investigations, cause such medical examinations to be made, hold such hearings, and take such further action as it considers will properly protect the rights of all parties.
      </li>
      <li id="t71c03s71-3-37ol19">
       Whenever the commission deems it advisable, it may require any self-insurer to make a deposit with the State Treasurer to secure prompt and convenient payment of such compensation; and payments therefrom upon any awards shall be made upon order of the commission.
      </li>
      <li id="t71c03s71-3-37ol110">
       Whenever the commission determines that it is for the best interests of a person entitled to compensation, the liability of the employer for compensation, or any part thereof as determined by the commission, may be discharged by the payment of a lump sum equal to the present value of future compensation payments commuted, computed at four percent (4%) true discount compounded annually. The probability of the death of the injured employee or other person entitled to compensation shall be determined in accordance with validated actuarial tables or factors as the commission finds equitable and consistent with the purposes of the Workers’ Compensation Law, and the probability of the remarriage of the surviving spouse or other person entitled to compensation may be determined in accordance with rules adopted by the commission which shall apply validated actuarial tables or factors as the commission finds equitable and consistent with the purposes of the Workers’ Compensation Law. The probability of the happening of any other contingency affecting the amount or duration of the compensation shall be disregarded. The commission shall be the sole judge as to whether or not a lump-sum payment shall be to the best interest of the injured worker or his dependents.
      </li>
      <li id="t71c03s71-3-37ol111">
       If the employer has made advance payments of compensation, he shall be entitled to be reimbursed out of any unpaid installment or installments of compensation due.
      </li>
      <li id="t71c03s71-3-37ol112">
       An injured employee or, in case of death, his dependents or personal representative shall give receipts for payment of compensation to the employer paying the same; and whenever required, such employer shall produce the same for inspection by the commission.
      </li>
      <li id="t71c03s71-3-37ol113">
       Whenever a dispute arises between two (2) or more parties as to which party is liable for the payment of workers’ compensation benefits to an injured employee and there is no genuine issue of material fact as to the employee’s employment, his average weekly wage, the occurrence of an injury, the extent of the injury, and the fact that the injury arose out of and in the course of the employment, the commission may require the disputing parties involved to pay benefits immediately to the employee and to share equally in the payment of those benefits until it is determined which party is solely liable, at which time the liable party must reimburse all other parties for the benefits they have paid to the employee with interest at the legal rate.

       Where an employee asserted an action against a worker’s compensation insurer because of the insurer’s intentional bad-faith refusal to pay worker’s compensation when due, Mississippi law applied because, inter alia, an insurer’s intentional bad-faith refusal to pay worker’s compensation timely is an independent tort committed by the insurer outside of the scope of the worker’s employment and it is legally distinct from and independent of any claims arising under the Mississippi Workers’ Compensation Act, and Mississippi had the most significant relationship to the intentional tort suit. Williams v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 741 F.3d 617, 2014 U.S. App. LEXIS 1726 (5th Cir. Miss. 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Employer was a contractor, not a subcontractor, of the three timber owners, as neither of the three companies had already contracted for the performance of the work done by the employer; neither company was the employee’s statutory employer under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c03s71-3-7" target="_self">71-3-7</a></cite> and had no statutory responsibility to insure the employee; assuming the Mississippi Workers’ Compensation Commission (Commission) was empowered under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c03s71-3-37ol113" target="_self">71-3-37(13)</a></cite> to determine whether another company was contractually bound, the Commission was entitled to accept the testimony that the company never agreed to provide workers’ compensation coverage for the employer, but instead, required the employer to have its own workers’ compensation insurance. Miss. Loggers Self Insured Fund, Inc. v. Andy Kaiser Logging, 992 So. 2d 649, 2008 Miss. App. LEXIS 286 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 997 So. 2d 924, 2008 Miss. LEXIS 537 (Miss. 2008).

   In a case for contribution, a fire department correctly argued that the case to apportion the responsibility for workers’ compensation benefits should have been brought, if at all, before the Mississippi Workers’ Compensation Commission pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c03s71-3-37ol113" target="_self">71-3-37(13)</a></cite>. Travelers Prop. &amp; Cas. Co. v. City of Greenwood Fire Dep't, 441 F.

      </p>
      <p>
       Employee’s workers’ compensation claim for injuries in 1992 and 1995 was barred as the employee had filed a B-31 form shortly after each injury that allowed the employer to close the claim one year after the form had been filed. Hancock v. Miss. Forestry Comm'n, 878 So. 2d 1058, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 694 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Differences in the numbers on the two B-31s Forms were mere corrections of the amount actually paid, and that no additional benefits were furnished to the claimant after his settlement; the filing of a B-31 Form containing errors as to the amount of the benefits paid was sufficient to begin the running of the statute of limitations and the filing of a corrected form did not interrupt the limitations period, even if it was without notice to the claimant. McCrimon v. Red Arrow Car Wash, 859 So. 2d 395, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 908 (Miss. Ct. App. 2003).

       Under Mississippi law, the duty of workers’ compensation carrier to pay benefits is owed by carrier to injured claimant. Rogers v. Hartford Accident & Indem. Co., 133 F.3d 309, 1998 U.S. App. LEXIS 442 (5th Cir. Miss. 1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       Under Mississippi law, when workers’ compensation carrier knows of insured’s employee’s injury, and insured does not controvert the injury, carrier has duty to begin paying benefits directly to injured claimant.

       An employer’s purchase of a $5,000 policy on the life of an employee did not release him from liability to the widow and dependents of the employee for benefits they were entitled to under the Workmen’s Compensation Law following the death of the employee in the course of employment.

      <p>
       Where an award to the dependent mother of the deceased employee was ordered by the commission in instalments, from which she did not appeal and there was nothing in the commission record to show error in the commission not computing the award for lump sum payment, it was error in the circuit court to hear evidence dehors and to order an award to the mother in lump sum. Stephens v. Moore, 214 Miss. 760, 59 So. 2d 346, 1952 Miss. LEXIS 519 (Miss.), modified, 215 Miss. 3, 60 So. 2d 391, 1952 Miss. LEXIS 530 (Miss. 1952).

       This section [Code 1942, § 6998-19] has reference to advance payments of compensation made by the employer to render temporary assistance to an employee or his dependent pending the termination of the claim for compensation, for which advance payments the employer would be entitled to be entirely reimbursed by the employee, since there is no reason why deductions from the payment when allowed shall be borne equally by the attorney and the client, the attorney receiving no benefit from such advance payments. American Sur. Co. v. Boykin, 212 Miss. 310, 54 So. 2d 398, 1951 Miss. LEXIS 453 (Miss. 1951).

American Sur. Co. v. Boykin, 212 Miss. 310, 54 So. 2d 398, 1951 Miss. LEXIS 453 (Miss. 1951).

       In computing compensation benefits to a widow, the probability of remarriage before the expiration of the 450 weeks during which the widow is entitled to compensation must be taken into account. United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co. v. Smith, 211 Miss. 573, 52 So. 2d 351, 1951 Miss. LEXIS 389 (Miss. 1951).

      <p>
       Where a man and woman lived together for three years and a child was born, but they did not hold themselves out as husband and wife, and both later separated and each of them contracted a ceremonial marriage, this was insufficient evidence to substantiate a common law marriage and the man’s ceremonial marriage was valid, and the widow was entitled to compensation upon the death of her husband. United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co. v. Smith, 211 Miss. 573, 52 So. 2d 351, 1951 Miss. LEXIS 389 (Miss. 1951).

       A claimant who, having requested and received payment of a lump settlement under subsection (j) of this section [Code 1942, § 6998-19], calculated upon the basis of permanent and total disability resulting as a consequence of an injury involving herniated intervertebral discs, and having, throughout the years which had elapsed since the injury, repeatedly and steadfastly refused to undergo a surgical procedure known as a laminectomy which would, in medical opinion, substantially reduce her disability below the total disability upon the basis of which she had received payment, and which in all probability would enable her to return to work, was not thereafter estopped to demand additional medical payments from the employer-carrier for the surgery she had previously declined, in the absence of a showing of fraud.

       While an injured workman will be denied compensation for incapacity which may be removed or modified by an operation of a simple character, not involving serious suffering or danger, where the operation is of a serious character, involves serious suffering or danger, or is doubtful of success, an injured employee’s refusal to submit to such an operation is not unreasonable, and the right to compensation is not precluded by such refusal.

       Where the claims manager for a carrier discontinued compensation to claimant and paid nothing for more than 3 months without notice to or authority from the commission, the claimant is not only entitled to the payments during this period but, in addition thereto, he is entitled to a penalty of 10 percent on these unpaid payments.

       Penalties on compensation installments to date of attorney-referee’s order denying compensation will not be allowed on removal by the supreme court where it does not appear that penalties were requested before the attorney-referee, the commission, in the circuit court, and denial thereof was not assigned error or argued in supreme court.

       Workers’ Compensation Commission erred in determining that an employee’s petition to controvert was timely because his employer and its workers’ compensation insurer complied with the statutory requirements by twice mailing the employee a Form B-31, providing him an opportunity to sign the Form, and informing him of the time limitations, and upon his failure to sign and return the Form, they provided him with notice, via certified mail, that an unsigned Form had been filed with the Commission. Leggett & Platt v. Brinkley, 150 So.3d 106, 2014 Miss. App. LEXIS 576 (Miss. Ct. App. 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where an insurance carrier on June 16, 1977, wrote to the claimant in care of his attorney, enclosing a copy of the Final Report and Settlement Receipt and asking him to note that the form had been received in the Workmen’s Compensation Commission offices on June 9th, 1977, the one-year statute of limitations begun to run on June 16, 1977, and, therefore, the claimant’s application for benefits filed with the Commission on June 16, 1978, was timely.

      <p>
       Where a workmen’s compensation insurance carrier mailed the final report and settlement receipt form to the claimant and the workmen’s compensation commission with the notation “original hereof this date mailed to commission” it was not sufficiently established that the claimant was given notice that the form had actually been filed with the commission so as to close the claim for compensation benefits and set in motion the one year statute of limitations within which the claimant would be required to have the matter reviewed by the commission, because of an alleged mistake in a determination of fact. McLemore v. Jackson Tile Mfg. Co., 252 So. 2d 781, 1971 Miss. LEXIS 1199 (Miss. 1971).

       Where claimant, injured on Jan. 15, 1960, signed final settlement report filed on Feb. 18, 1960, and filed claim for same injury on Mar. 20, 1961, and subsequently on Oct. 31, 1962 amended his claim to include injuries occurring on May 1, 1960, question of whether amendment related back to date of filing original claim so as to take it out of a 1-year and 2-year limitations periods depended upon whether later injury was a new injury or further disability for previous injury, and this was a question of fact to be determined by commission. Yazoo Mfg. Co. v. Schaffer, 254 Miss. 35, 179 So. 2d 784, 1965 Miss. LEXIS 921 (Miss. 1965).
      </p>
      <p>
       Workman who signs final report and settlement receipt had notice that his employer was claiming that the payments set out in the report and receipt form were final payments, and the filing of the form complied with the requirement of subsection (g) of this section [Code 1942, § 6998-19], and consequently a claim filed with the commission more than a year later was barred by the limitation period set out in Code 1942, § 6998-27.

      <p>
       As against a claimant who had refused to sign the final report and settlement receipt submitted to him, the one-year limitation period provided for in Code 1942, § 6998-27 did not begin to run until he had received notice that the employer had filed with the workmen’s compensation commission a final report and settlement receipt, properly filled out.

       The limitations period provided for in Code 1942, § 6998-27 must be considered in connection with subsection (g) of this section [Code 1942, § 6998-19], providing that no case shall be closed without notice to all parties interested and without giving to all such parties an opportunity to be heard.

      <p>
       Before the statute of limitation provided by Code 1942, § 6998-27 begins to run there must be a compliance with the provisions of subsection (g) of Code 1942, § 6998-19. Shainberg's Black & White Store v. Prothro, 238 Miss. 444, 118 So. 2d 862, 1960 Miss. LEXIS 425 (Miss. 1960).
      </p>
      <p>
       Oral notice given to claimant by insurance carrier’s adjuster that the carrier considered the claim to be barred by the statute of limitations was not sufficient compliance with the notice requirement of subsection (g) of this section [Code 1942, § 6998-19].

      <p>
       Where the requirements of subsection (g) of Code 1942, § 6998-19 had been fully complied with by the employer and its insurance carrier, the workmen’s compensation commission was without jurisdiction of a claim for compensation made more than 3 years after the closing of the case.

      <p>
       Adequate notice to claimant of the closing of his case is given by sending him a copy of a report on a form prescribed by the commission entitled Final Report and Settlement Receipt, notwithstanding error therein as to the period for which compensation had been paid and as to the date on which he was pronounced able to work.

      <p>
       Code 1942, § 6998-27, which provides that the commission may, at any time prior to one year after the date of the last payment of compensation, review a compensation case, does not apply until there has been compliance with the mandatory provisions of subsection (g) of this section [Code 1942, § 6998-19].

      </p>
      <p>
       It was not the intent of the legislature to require that there be a formal hearing by the commission in order to close employee’s claim of voluntary payments, and the fact that no such hearing was held did not render statute inapplicable which limited period of commencement of suit for additional compensation to within one year after receipt of final payment.

       Successful settlement agreement with employer and co-employees on tort claim does not per se bar recovery of workers’ compensation benefits, and such benefits were granted where liability carrier of employer, which was not same as employer’s workers’ compensation carrier, entered into settlement agreement with claimants to “buy its way out of a possible action at common-law,” where settlement agreement entered into was in effect waiver of employer’s right to defend common-law action on basis of exclusiveness of worker’s compensation remedy.

   Imprisonment of a claimant who is already receiving permanent partial workers’ compensation disability payments does not preclude the claimant from receiving those payments during the period of incarceration since permanent disability benefits are based upon a claimant’s permanent loss of capacity to earn wages “at the time of injury”; moreover, the Workers’ Compensation Act is silent as to what happens when a claimant who is entitled to permanent disability benefits is subsequently incarcerated, and §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c03s71-3-43" target="_self">71-3-43</a></cite> seems to be an intent to protect the benefits for the injured party and implies that any deviation from payment to the claimant must be done by legislative act.

   Creditor, apparently relying on Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c03s71-3-45" target="_self">71-3-45</a></cite>, contended that he held a statutory lien against debtor, and, in this context, asserted that debtor should have filed a complaint to avoid his statutory lien while the bankruptcy case was being administered. The problem with his reasoning was five-fold, to-wit: (1) debtor disputed that the creditor was entitled to compensation under the Worker’s Compensation Act, (2) there was never an adjudication in the state court worker’s compensation proceeding that the creditor was entitled to a claim against debtor in any amount; as such, there was no determination that the creditor was entitled to compensation under the provisions of the Worker’s Compensation Act, and, because of this, he did not have a lien against any assets owned by debtor, (3) even if there had been an adjudication that the creditor was entitled to compensation in a liquidated amount which, in effect, would have been a judgment in his favor, debtor owned no unencumbered, non-exempt assets to which the judgment lien could attach, (4) because the creditor had not filed a complaint objecting to the dischargeability of his debt or objecting to debtor’s bankruptcy discharge in general, the creditor’s claim inevitably was going to be discharged as a result of debtor’s Chapter 7 filing, and (5) because there was no lien of any description in favor of the creditor against debtor during the time that this bankruptcy case was being administered, there was no reason whatsoever for debtor to file a motion or a complaint to avoid the lien.

       There was substantial evidence to support the decision of the Mississippi Workers’ Compensation Commission to affirm the administrative law judge’s (AJ) decision to deny an employee disability benefits because the AJ, acting under the authority of the Commission, was entitled to rely on his personal experience in making reasonable inferences and in his determination to deny benefits. Sterling v. Eaton Corp., 109 So.3d 1096, 2013 Miss. App. LEXIS 130 (Miss. Ct. App. 2013).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   In answering a certified question, the supreme court held that an award under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c03s71-3-47" target="_self">71-3-47</a></cite> referred to a final decision to grant or deny a specific amount of compensation. Thus, the employee’s bad-faith claim against his employer was not time-barred as the administrative law judge’s (ALJ) order had not yet determined the amount of compensation due; the order indicated that a final determination on the amount of compensation due the employee remained pending before the ALJ. Because the employee had substantial rights that remained undetermined and were specifically reserved for later action, the order was interlocutory, and the statute of limitations did not commence at that time. Bullock v. AIU Ins. Co., 995 So. 2d 717, 2008 Miss. LEXIS 595 (Miss. 2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       No procedural invalidity existed where a commissioner wrote the factual summary for the administrative law judge as the judge wrote the fact-findings and legal conclusions, and the commissioner who wrote the summary recused herself from the appeal. Kitchens v. Jerry Vowell Logging, 874 So. 2d 456, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 486 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       An administrative law judge, as affirmed by the Workers’ Compensation Commission and the circuit court, erred as a matter of law when he specifically stated that a hearing on an injured employee’s motion to consider the need for additional medical treatment at the employer’s expense under General Rule 9 was limited to whether the employee was suffering from improper medical treatment or lack of medical treatment, and then proceeded to make findings on maximum medical recovery and apportionment; an administrative law judge may not announce a limited purpose of a hearing, require the litigants to argue under limitation, and then decide the whole of the case including the time of maximum recovery apportionment and compensation. Monroe v. Broadwater Beach Hotel, 593 So. 2d 26, 1992 Miss. LEXIS 11 (Miss. 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       While the Administrative Judge is generally, within the Workers’ Compensation Commission, the individual who conducts the hearing and hears the live testimony, the Commission itself is, in law, the finder of the facts, and on judicial review, the Commission’s findings and decisions are subject to the normal deferential standards, notwithstanding the Administrative Judge’s actions. Walker Mfg. Co. v. Cantrell, 577 So. 2d 1243, 1991 Miss. LEXIS 190 (Miss. 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       Injured worker’s action for bad faith in payment of workers’ compensation benefits may not proceed in federal court prior to final adjudication of underlying claim in accordance with state administrative procedures.

       Decision that claimant is entitled to compensation for temporary disability is not res judicata on issue of continuing disability. International Paper Co. v. Wilson, 243 Miss. 659, 139 So. 2d 644, 1962 Miss. LEXIS 391 (Miss. 1962).

   Administrative law judge did not err in dismissing an employee’s workers’ compensation claim due to the employee’s failure to move for reinstatement within one year under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c03s71-3-47" target="_self">71-3-47</a></cite>; under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c03s71-3-47" target="_self">71-3-47</a></cite>, the Mississippi Workers’ Compensation Commission could establish the “practice and procedure” for the “adjudication of all claims.” Edwards v. Wal-Mart, 930 So. 2d 1273, 2006 Miss. App. LEXIS 271 (Miss. Ct. App. 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       Claim of entitlement to worker’s compensation benefits is matter within exclusive original jurisdiction of Mississippi Workers’ Compensation Commission, and until petition before Commission is ruled upon, claimant’s entitlement to tort damages cannot be determined by federal or state court. Dial v. Hartford Acci. & Indem. Co., 863 F.2d 15, 1989 U.S. App. LEXIS 191 (5th Cir. Miss. 1989).
      </p>
      <p>
       Jurisdiction was vested in the Workmen’s Compensation Commission upon the claimant’s filing her original two motions to contravert, and jurisdiction remained vested in the commission throughout the hearings conducted by an administrative judge and through the time when he issued his order, since jurisdiction of workmen’s compensation claims is vested totally completely and exclusively in the commission and such jurisdiction cannot pass back and forth from the commission to an administrative judge inasmuch as an administrative judge is merely a facility of the commission. Day-Brite Lighting Div., Emerson Electric Co. v. Cummings, 419 So. 2d 211, 1982 Miss. LEXIS 2140 (Miss. 1982).
      </p>
      <p>
       The commission has full power and authority to determine all questions relating to claims for compensation, including the authority to make such investigations as it deems necessary; it has specific authority to order medical examinations; and comprehensive judicial review of the commission’s action is provided for. Everitt v. Lovitt, 192 So. 2d 422, 1966 Miss. LEXIS 1257 (Miss. 1966).
      </p>

       The workmen’s compensation commission is without jurisdiction to order the reformation of an insurance policy with a view to bringing a claimant within its coverage. Herrin v. Alan Wetzel Lumber Co., 244 Miss. 673, 145 So. 2d 690, 1962 Miss. LEXIS 494 (Miss. 1962).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the fact of injury was sharply disputed and the evidence going thereto was in conflict, the issue was one for the commission. Davis v. Clark-Burt Roofing Co., 238 Miss. 464, 119 So. 2d 926, 1960 Miss. LEXIS 429 (Miss. 1960).
      </p>
      <p>
       The commission is the trier of the facts and had the right, and was under a duty, to evaluate the testimony of lay and medical witnesses and to base its findings upon the evidence as a whole. Mississippi Products, Inc. v. Skipworth, 238 Miss. 312, 118 So. 2d 345, 1960 Miss. LEXIS 407 (Miss. 1960).

       Reopening of case to hearing of further evidence is within the commission’s discretion. Druey v. Ingalls Shipbuilding Corp., 237 Miss. 277, 114 So. 2d 772, 1959 Miss. LEXIS 465 (Miss. 1959).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the compensation carrier of a prime contractor had erroneously paid certain compensation payments to an injured employee of the subcontracting partnership, the commission, upon determining that the partnership, together with the compensation carrier of one of the members of the partnership, were liable for such benefits, erred in directing the partner’s carrier to make duplicate compensation and medical expense payments to the employee; but correctly determined that it had no power to direct the partner’s carrier to reimburse the prime contractor’s carrier for payments erroneously made. United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co. v. Collins, 231 Miss. 319, 95 So. 2d 456, 1957 Miss. LEXIS 516, 1957 Miss. LEXIS 517 (Miss. 1957).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a claimant failed to appear at a commission hearing, after being given due notice, and the commission entered an order five days thereafter suspending the claimant’s compensation payments, the workmen’s compensation commission did not err in considering claimant’s motion to reopen, filed within seven days after the entry of the order suspending payment but more than seven days after the date set for the hearing, since the commission could construe the motion as being timely and not inconsistent with a commission rule providing that if a justifiable excuse is presented for failure to attend the scheduled hearing within seven days after the date set therefor, a motion to reopen would be heard at the commission’s discretion. Walker v. International Paper Co., 230 Miss. 95, 92 So. 2d 445, 1957 Miss. LEXIS 349 (Miss. 1957).
      </p>
      <p>
       Adoption as correct of the facts stated by the attorney-referee in his opinion and findings did not preclude the workmen’s compensation commission from considering the facts stated by the attorney-referee, as well as other facts appearing in evidence and from the record as a whole, in determining whether or not there was a causal connection between the claimant’s heart attacks and his work, and from determining, under conflicting evidence, that the claimant’s injury was compensable, contra to the attorney-referee’s findings. Ingalls Shipbuilding Corp. v. Dickerson, 230 Miss. 110, 92 So. 2d 354, 1957 Miss. LEXIS 350 (Miss. 1957).

       A conflict in medical testimony, as to whether an accidental burn suffered by the claimant while engaged in his duties, together with the resultant anticipated treatment thereof, was causally related to and precipitated the claimant’s heart attack, only made an issue of fact to be decided by the attorney-referee and the commission.

       The attorney-referee did not err in closing the hearing upon motion, where the claimant had failed to appear at a date set for a recessed hearing, in the absence of claimant’s showing that witnesses he desired had been subpoenaed or could be produced as witnesses, or that any effort had been made to produce them, and there was no showing made as to what such witnesses would testify, if present.

       The Workers’ Compensation Commission, within legal limits, is the sole judge of the weight and sufficiency of the evidence. Evidence which is not contradicted by positive testimony or circumstances, and which is not inherently improbable, incredible, or unreasonable, cannot, as a matter of law, be arbitrarily or capriciously discredited, disregarded or rejected, even though the witness is a party or is interested; unless uncontradicted evidence is shown to be untrustworthy, it is to be taken as conclusive and binding on the triers of fact.

       The statutes presuppose generally a full hearing on the merits and a claim should not be dismissed until all evidence pertinent to the issues has been heard, and where testimony of doctors was vital to claimant’s case, the commission should not have arbitrarily dismissed claim without hearing this testimony.

       Where the evidence as to whether employee was injured in accident arising out of and in course of his employment was conflicting, but the great weight of the evidence was against employee’s contentions, the court would not disturb the finding by the commission that the employee was not injured in the course of employment.

       Since a claim for disability is separate and distinct from a claim for death benefits, the 1960 amendment to subsection (9) of Code 1942, § 6998-02, requiring that incapacity be proved by medical findings, did not eliminate from the application of the Workmen’s Compensation Law of the presumption of causal connection between the employment and death occurring while the employee is engaged in the duties of his employment.

   Employee’s claim that her former employer acted in bad faith in denying workers’ compensation benefits under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c03s71-3-7" target="_self">71-3-7</a></cite>, which benefits the employee later received via a settlement, failed because the employer had arguable reasons for its decision where an investigation into whether the employee’s alleged sexual relationship with her manager ever occurred or was cause of the employee’s mental health problems was inconclusive; that the employer failed to offer a medical expert under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c03s71-3-47" target="_self">71-3-47</a></cite> to refute the opinions of the employee’s experts at the workers’ compensation hearing was inconsequential because even without medical testimony, the employer’s arguable reasons for denying the employee’s claim were solid, and medical testimony would not have made this any less of a “he said, she said” dispute. Hood v. Sears Roebuck &amp; Co., 532 F. Supp. 2d 795, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 46216 (S.D. Miss. 2005), aff'd, 247 Fed. Appx. 531, 2007 U.S. App. LEXIS 21978 (5th Cir. Miss. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       Workers’ Compensation Commission erred in holding that the claimant was not permanently disabled because the Commission improperly relied on the opinions of nontreating doctors, who had not examined the claimant in two years, and the opinion of a vocation rehabilitation consultant that stated there was the “possibility” that the claimant could perform sedentary jobs, which was speculative and not supported by the facts in evidence that showed the claimant’s treating physician never stated that the claimant could perform sedentary jobs but rather he insisted that she was permanently disabled and rejected such jobs. Recovery in a compensation case must be based on probabilities, rather than predicated only upon a possibility, and the claimant was not required to go against her treating physician’s medical advice and seek employment. Stewart v. Singing River Hosp. Sys., 928 So. 2d 176, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 535 (Miss. Ct. App. 2005), cert. denied, 929 So. 2d 923, 2006 Miss. LEXIS 242 (Miss. 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       A doctor’s inability to pinpoint the exact physical cause of an employee’s disability did not alone defeat the employee’s claim for compensation, given the beneficent purpose of the Workers’ Compensation Act, where there was uncontradicted testimony that the employee was injured while performing his job and that he was totally and permanently disabled. Trest v. B.C. Rogers Processors, Inc., 592 So. 2d 110, 1991 Miss. LEXIS 981 (Miss. 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       Certainty is not a requisite in deciding a workers’ compensation case, but, rather, the reviewing court considers reasonable medical probabilities. In other words, medical findings sufficient to show a compensable disability are not required to be precise, complete and unequivocal. Georgia-Pacific Corp. v. Gregory, 589 So. 2d 1250, 1991 Miss. LEXIS 763 (Miss. 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       Compensation may be allowed for disabling pain in the absence of positive medical testimony as to any physical cause whatever. When the patient complains of pain, the doctor usually takes the fact of pain for granted and the absence of physical findings to account for the pain will not necessarily bar compensation. In such cases, evidence of an accident followed by disabling pain and the absence of evidence as to the cause of the pain from objective medical findings may be sufficient as a basis for compensation, in the absence of circumstances tending to show malingering or indicating that the claimant’s testimony as to pain is inherently improbable, incredible, unreasonable or untrustworthy. However, there is a great potential for abuse in claims which are based predominantly upon pain reported by the patient, particularly in circumstances where the patient’s testimony or statement to the physician is the sole evidence of its continued presence. In these cases, it would be prudent to obtain additional medical evidence to either support or dispute the claim. Morris v. Lansdell's Frame Co., 547 So. 2d 782, 1989 Miss. LEXIS 336 (Miss. 1989).

       In a case where it was alleged that exposure to toxic chemicals at his workplace precipitated claimant’s lung cancer and ultimate death, a toxicologist qualified as an expert to give an opinion regarding the causal relationship between the decedent’s workplace and his fatal condition, and his expert testimony provided a reasonable basis for concluding that exposure to chemicals at the workplace was a substantial factor in bringing about death of claimant.

       In heart attack cases, where the claimant lives, no presumption of causal relation arises out of the fact that employee was engaged in his usual duties at his place of employment at the time of the onset of the attack; the claimant has the burden of proving that heart attack was causally related to his employment; and the evidence with respect to causal relation must include medical testimony supportive thereof.

       The evidence was sufficient to support a finding by the Workers’ Compensation Commission that noise at an employee’s work site was a contributing, precipitating, or aggravating factor in the production of Meniere’s Syndrome, even though the etiology of Meniere’s Syndrome is largely unknown, where there was substantial evidence that exposure to high intensity noise for a period of years at the work site contributed to, aggravated or accelerated the employee’s condition, and this evidence was not controverted by any direct medical evidence.

       There was substantial evidence supporting a finding by the Workers’ Compensation Commission that a claimant’s impairment was a whole body injury rather than a schedule numbered injury only, where a physician identified the claimant’s malady as Meniere’s Syndrome, and he testified that Meniere’s Syndrome is “an inner ear dysfunction that appears to be lifelong in nature” and that it affected the entire body in that, in addition to a loss of hearing, it involved a balance dysfunction affecting the claimant’s activities of daily living, both occupationally and socially.

       The evidence supported a finding that an employee suffered a 100 percent industrial loss of use of his left leg, rather than only a 40 percent loss, even though the employee’s treating physician testified that the employee had a 40 percent permanent partial impairment of his left leg, where the physician also testified that the employee would be limited in activities such as standing for long periods, climbing ladders and stairs, and carrying heavy loads but that he could work in sedentary types of positions where he could sit to do the work, the employee was a 43-year-old man who dropped out of school during the 10th grade, from that time until the time of his injury he worked in construction, did carpentry work, and delivered furniture, at the time of the injury he was employed at a furniture company where he did not perform any one particular job but was moved around from job to job as needed, some of the jobs that he performed at the company included working in the sanding department, cutting out chest-of-drawer tops, and working in the mill, the employee testified that after his injury he could not do carpentry work and could not do any jobs which required him to stand but he could sand edges and use a table saw, and he testified that he continued to have problems with his leg every day, including swelling and pain.

       The evidence was sufficient to support a finding of July 8, 1988, as the date of an employee’s maximum medical recovery from a leg injury, where the employee’s treating physician had initially indicated that the employee had reached maximum medical recovery on August 27, 1987 when he was originally released to return to work, but the physician subsequently stated that the employee did not reach maximum medical recovery until July 8, 1988 because the employee continued to suffer from swelling and pain following the August release and the physician continued reassessment and treatment in the hope that the employee’s condition would improve.

       The Workers’ Compensation Commission’s findings that a truck driver sustained a compensable injury and that the repeated trauma of his work aggravated a pre-existing non-work-related condition were supported by substantial evidence where the worker’s treating physician and the physician for the employer who conducted a physical examination required by the Department of Transportation had released the worker to return to work following treatment for a non-work-related back injury and the treating physician testified that the worker had a “chronically sore joint in the back that was apparently being aggravated by the nature of his work as a long-distance truck driver.” Miller Transporters, Inc. v. Guthrie, 554 So. 2d 917, 1989 Miss. LEXIS 495 (Miss. 1989).

       In a case where it was alleged that exposure to toxic chemicals at his workplace caused claimant’s lung cancer and ultimate death, a prima facie case of compensability was established by toxicologist’s testimony that within a 90-95 percent probability, bronchio-alveolar carcinoma, is caused by exposure to chemicals; death certificate listing claimant’s cause of death as bronchio-alveolar carcinoma; lay testimony of claimant establishing his daily exposure to chemicals, a weight loss, shortness of breath, and operation for removal of lung lesions; and lay testimony of claimant’s wife as to the absorption of chemicals on claimant’s clothes, on the onset of symptoms described by claimant, and his ultimate death.

       Workmen’s compensation commission’s finding that there was no causal connection between claimant’s disability and the injury which occurred in the course of her employment was supported by substantial evidence, including physicians’ testimony fairly demonstrating that neither the injury nor the operation was the probable cause of the disabling pain and further showing that a preexisting disease, revealed by a pelvic examination, was the probable cause of the pain.

       In an action under Workmen’s Compensation Law to recover death benefits for a member of a drilling crew whose body was found near the ditch he had been digging, evidence that decedent had complained of pains in chest while moving heavy planks prior to digging a ditch was sufficient to sustain a finding that death resulted from accidental injury arising out of and in the course of employment, despite the fact that there was medical testimony that decedent died of a heart attack.

       The evidence was sufficient to support a finding that a claimant suffered only a 5 percent permanent partial occupational disability by reason of a work-connected injury to his left hand, where the claimant failed to offer evidence that he had unsuccessfully attempted to perform his usual duties, and he failed to offer evidence that he was refused employment based upon the disability to his hand in that he made no search for work outside his prior employment, stating that his car had been repossessed and he was without transportation.

       A claimant who suffered a 25 percent permanent impairment to the body was not entitled to an award of permanent partial disability benefits since she did not establish a loss of wage earning capacity attributable to the compensable injury, where the evidence showed that she experienced an overall increase of post-injury wages and she offered no proof to rebut the presumption of no loss of wage earning capacity by showing that the post-injury earnings were not reliable in determining wage earning capacity.

       Decision of Workmen’s Compensation Commission awarding benefits on basis of alleged back injury will be reversed on judicial review on basis of lack of sufficient evidence where only testimony regarding injury is that of claimant and those claimant informed, initial medical consultation for injury is almost full year after injury, and claimant’s conduct after injury is so inconsistent with that of employee injured in course of employment as to cause loss of credibility.

       A finding that a claimant was not entitled to permanent disability benefits because his disability, which arose from slippage in the spine, was attributable entirely to preexisting spondylolisthesis was not supported by substantial evidence where there was conflicting medical testimony from 2 treating physicians as to the cause of the claimant’s permanent disability and neither physician could determine how and when the slippage actually occurred, since close questions of compensability should be resolved in favor of the claimant, and the Workers’ Compensation Act should be liberally construed to carry out its remedial purpose.

       A circuit court judgment affirming the Workers’ Compensation Commission’s denial of benefits to a deceased employee’s children was not supported by substantial evidence and would be reversed where the onset of the employee’s death occurred at her place of employment and the employer failed to rebut the presumption that the employee’s work activities did not cause or contribute to the condition from which she died; the unrebutted “found dead” legal presumption prevailed, satisfying the causal connection between the employee’s work duties and the condition which resulted in her death.

       When a claimant, having reached maximum medical recovery, reports back to his or her employer for work, and the employer refuses to reinstate or rehire the claimant, then it is prima facie that the claimant has met his or her burden of showing total disability; the burden then shifts to the employer to prove a partial disability or that the claimant has suffered no loss of wage earning capacity.

       Since there is no statutory requirement as to a cross-appeal, the Commission is free to adopt whatever rule it deems feasible on cross-appeals by a party, and, having apparently promulgated none thus far, was clearly within its authority in considering the cross-appeal of a claimant, even though filed considerably more than 20 days following the decision of the administrative law judge.

       In case of default by the employer in the payment of any compensation due under an award for the period of thirty (30) days after payment is due and payable or, where the employer has failed to secure the payment of compensation to his employees as required, where there is such default in payment for a period of ten (10) days after same is due, any party in interest may file with the county clerk for the county in which the injury occurred or the county in which the employer has his principal place of business a certified copy of the decision of the commission awarding compensation or ending, diminishing or increasing compensation previously awarded, from which no appeal has been taken within the time allowed therefor or, if an appeal has been taken by an employer who has not complied with the provisions of Section 71-3-75, where he fails to deposit with the commission the amount of the award as security for its payment within ten (10) days after same is due and payable, and thereupon judgment must be entered in the circuit court by the clerk of such county in conformity therewith immediately upon the filing of such decision. If the payment in default be an installment, the commission may declare the entire award due and judgment may be entered in accordance with the provisions of this section. Such judgment shall be entered in the same manner, have the same effect, and be subject to the same proceedings as though rendered in a suit duly heard and determined by the circuit court, except that no appeal may be taken therefrom. The court shall vacate or modify such judgment to conform to any later award or decision of the commission upon presentation of a certified copy of such award or decision. The award may be so compromised by the commission as in its discretion may best serve the interest of the persons entitled to receive the compensation or benefits. Neither the commission nor any party in interest shall be required to pay any fee to any public officer for filing or recording any paper or instrument or for issuing a transcript of any judgment executed in pursuance of this section.

       Where a claimant, appealing from the decision of the workmen’s compensation commission to the circuit court, successfully contended that he was entitled to recover the 20 per cent penalty as provided for in Code 1942, § 6998-19(f), but was unsuccessful as to his contention that the entire award should have been judged to be due and payable as provided in this section [Code 1942, § 6998-25], the court was authorized under Code 1942, § 1593, to apportion the cost between the parties.

    Court review of compensation award.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The final award of the commission shall be conclusive and binding unless either party to the controversy shall, within thirty (30) days from the date of its filing in the office of the commission and notification to the parties, appeal therefrom to the Supreme Court.
     </p>
     <p>
      Such appeal may be taken by filing notice of appeal with the commission, whereupon the commission shall under its certificate transmit to the Supreme Court all documents and papers on file in the matter, together with a transcript of the evidence, the findings, and award, which shall thereupon become the record of the cause. Appeals shall be considered only upon the record as made before the commission. The Supreme Court shall always be deemed open for hearing of such appeals. The Supreme Court shall review all questions of law and of fact. If no prejudicial error be found, the matter shall be affirmed and remanded to the commission for enforcement. If prejudicial error be found, the same shall be reversed and the Supreme Court shall enter such judgment or award as the commission should have entered. An appeal from the commission to the Supreme Court shall not act as a supersedeas unless the court shall so direct, and then upon such terms as such court shall direct.
     </p>
     <p>
      No controversy shall be heard by the commission or an award of compensation made therein while the same matter is pending either before a federal court or in any court in this state.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any award of compensation made by the Supreme Court shall bear the same interest and penalties as do other judgments awarded in circuit court.

   Appellate court had jurisdiction of a workers’ compensation appeal despite an administrative judge’s failure to decide an employer’s motion to reconsider because (1) the Mississippi Workers’ Compensation Commission’s (Commission) ruling was reviewable under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c03s71-3-51" target="_self">71-3-51</a></cite>, as the Commission had jurisdiction once a claim was filed, and (2) there were no more remedies to exhaust once the Commission ruled. Hamilton v. Southwire Co., 191 So.3d 1275, 2016 Miss. App. LEXIS 264 (Miss. Ct. App. 2016).

      <p>
       <p>
   Court of appeals erred in reversing an order granting an employer’s motion for summary judgment in a widow’s action alleging bad faith for failing to timely pay workers’ compensation benefits because the Mississippi Workers’ Compensation Commission’s final judgment affirming an administrative law judge’s order awarding the widow benefits marked the end of its involvement in the case, and since the widow’s suit was filed more than three years later, it was time-barred under the general three-year statute of limitations, Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.15.html#t15c01s15-1-49" target="_blank">15-1-49</a></cite>; the plain language of Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c03s71-3-51" target="_self">71-3-51</a></cite> provided that “the final award of the Commission shall be conclusive and binding unless either party shall appeal,” and since no party appealed the Commission’s decision, the “unless” qualifier was irrelevant, and according to the statute’s very specific, unambiguous language, the Commission’s award was “final” and “conclusive and binding.” Harper v. Cal-Maine Foods, Inc., 43 So.3d 401, 2010 Miss. LEXIS 307 (Miss. 2010).
      </p>

       <p>
   Trial court erred in granting the employer’s motion for summary judgment on the basis that the complaint was time-barred; under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c03s71-3-51" target="_self">71-3-51</a></cite>, the Legislature intended to postpone the conclusiveness and finality of the order until expiration of the thirty days allowed for appeal, and the wife’s claim was filed within three years of the judgment. Harper v. Cal-Maine Foods, Inc., 43 So.3d 457, 2009 Miss. App. LEXIS 371 (Miss. Ct. App. 2009), rev'd, 43 So.3d 401, 2010 Miss. LEXIS 307 (Miss. 2010).

       Thirty-day period for appeal commenced on the date of the Workers’ Compensation Commission order. Tinnon v. C. Hager & Sons Hinge Mfg. Co., 795 So. 2d 594, 2001 Miss. App. LEXIS 350 (Miss. Ct. App. 2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       The court properly dismissed an appeal where the notice of appeal was not filed until 33 days after the Workers’ Compensation Commission’s order, notwithstanding that the appellant did not receive notice of the commission’s order until she received it in the mail four days after it was issued. Triplett v. Farm Fresh Catfish Co., 737 So. 2d 438, 1999 Miss. App. LEXIS 135 (Miss. Ct. App. 1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       Standard of review in workers’ compensation cases is limited and substantial evidence test is used. Inman v. Coca-Cola/Dr. Pepper Bottling Co., 678 So. 2d 992, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 420 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Workers’ Compensation Commission is trier and finder of facts in compensation claim; Supreme Court will reverse Commission’s order only if it finds that order clearly erroneous and contrary to overwhelming weight of evidence. Inman v. Coca-Cola/Dr. Pepper Bottling Co., 678 So. 2d 992, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 420 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Substantial evidence supported finding by Workers’ Compensation Commission that claimant’s transfer to Memphis, Tennessee was permanent and, thus, Mississippi court did not have jurisdiction to determine his claim for workers’ compensation benefits arising out of accident in Tennessee. Inman v. Coca-Cola/Dr. Pepper Bottling Co., 678 So. 2d 992, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 420 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       By statute, only final orders of the Workers’ Compensation Commission are appealable. Blankenship v. Delta Pride Catfish, 676 So. 2d 914, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 319 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where Workers’ Compensation Commission, on review of a decision of its hearing officer, enters order remanding case to administrative judge for further proceedings or testimony, the order is interlocutory only and is not appealable. Blankenship v. Delta Pride Catfish, 676 So. 2d 914, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 319 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Order is interlocutory, and not appealable, when substantial rights of the parties involved in action remain undetermined and when cause is retained for further action. Blankenship v. Delta Pride Catfish, 676 So. 2d 914, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 319 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Workers’ Compensation Commission’s order was final for purposes of appeal because it determined all matters among the parties and nothing had been retained by Commission or remanded to administrative law judge for further consideration. Blankenship v. Delta Pride Catfish, 676 So. 2d 914, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 319 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Appeals from state administrative agency hearings are controlled by statute and will only be allowed after entry of a final order; thus, an appeal from a circuit court’s order remanding the case to the Mississippi Employment Security Commission’s Board of Review for a hearing de novo was not properly before the Supreme Court, since the order was interlocutory in nature. Wilson v. Mississippi Employment Sec. Comm'n, 643 So. 2d 538, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 568 (Miss. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no statute authorizing an appeal from anything other than a final order of the Workers’ Compensation Commission, and therefore a circuit court may not grant an appeal from an interlocutory order of the Commission. Thus, judgments of circuit courts emanating from appeals from interlocutory orders of the Commission were nullities. Bickham v. Department of Mental Health, 592 So. 2d 96, 1991 Miss. LEXIS 978 (Miss. 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       While the Administrative Judge is generally, within the Workers’ Compensation Commission, the individual who conducts the hearing and hears the live testimony, the Commission itself is, in law, the finder of the facts, and on judicial review, the Commission’s findings and decisions are subject to the normal deferential standards, notwithstanding the Administrative Judge’s actions. Walker Mfg. Co. v. Cantrell, 577 So. 2d 1243, 1991 Miss. LEXIS 190 (Miss. 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       If a decision of the Workers’ Compensation Commission is based on substantial evidence, the circuit court and the Supreme Court are bound by the finding of fact made by the Commission. International Paper Co. v. Kelley, 562 So. 2d 1298, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 274 (Miss. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       The review of the decisions of the Workers’ Compensation Commission is like the review of any other administrative body which sits as a trier of fact. If the decision of the Commission is based upon substantial evidence and there is no error of law, the decision will be affirmed on appeal. Thus, if there is a quantum of credible evidence which supports the decision of the Commission, no court will reverse the decision. The Supreme Court will not determine where the preponderance of the evidence lies when the evidence is conflicting, the assumption being that the Commission, as the trier of facts, has previously determined which evidence is credible and which is not. This is not to say that the reviewing court will merely “rubber stamp” the Commission’s actions; where no evidence or only a scintilla of evidence supports a Workers’ Compensation Commission decision, the Supreme Court would not hesitate to reverse. Metal Trims Industries, Inc. v. Stovall, 562 So. 2d 1293, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 277 (Miss. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       In order to preserve point for review by Supreme Court, point must be presented not only to Workers’ Compensation Commission but also to Circuit Court by assignment of error there; failing to do so results in waiver of issue. Sawyer v. Head, 510 So. 2d 472, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2427 (Miss. 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       An appeal from Workers’ Compensation Commission interlocutory order was granted by Supreme Court to avoid expense and delay. Sonford Products Corp. v. Freels, 495 So. 2d 468, 1986 Miss. LEXIS 2658 (Miss. 1986), overruled,

       Principal of liberal construction in favor of award of benefits to workmen’s compensation claimant does not allow court reviewing denial of claim to bridge gaps in failure of medical testimony or to find causal connections to employment where none exists.

   Under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c03s71-3-51" target="_self">71-3-51</a></cite>, the appellate court had the duty to review the facts contained in the record and to determine whether or not those facts substantiated the order of the Workers' Compensation Commission.

   All questions of law and fact are reviewable by the circuit judge in reviewing a compensation case under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c03s71-3-51" target="_self">71-3-51</a></cite>, but unless prejudicial error is found or the verdict is against the overwhelming weight of the credible evidence, the commission’s order is to be affirmed. Strickland v. M.H. McMath Gin, Inc., 457 So. 2d 925, 1984 Miss. LEXIS 1929 (Miss. 1984).
      </p>
      <p>
       An order of the Workman’s Compensation Commission remanding a claim to the administrative judge for further hearing was an interlocutory order and therefore not appealable to the circuit court. Southern Natural Resources, Inc. v. Polk, 388 So. 2d 494, 1980 Miss. LEXIS 2113 (Miss. 1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Workmen’s Compensation Commission is the trier of facts and judge of the credibility of witnesses and a finding by it, supported by substantial evidence, is not to be disturbed on appeal. Shippers Express v. Chapman, 364 So. 2d 1097, 1978 Miss. LEXIS 2235 (Miss. 1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although this section [Code 1942, § 6998-26] provides for an appeal to the circuit court of the county in which the injury occurred, the circuit court of the county of claimants’ residence has jurisdiction to hear the appeal despite the fact that the injury occurred elsewhere. Leake County Cooperative v. Dependents of Barrett, 226 So. 2d 608, 1969 Miss. LEXIS 1306, 1969 Miss. LEXIS 1307 (Miss. 1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       The commission has full power and authority to determine all questions relating to claims for compensation, including the authority to make such investigations as it deems necessary; it has specific authority to order medical examinations; and comprehensive judicial review of the commission’s action is provided for. Everitt v. Lovitt, 192 So. 2d 422, 1966 Miss. LEXIS 1257 (Miss. 1966).
      </p>
      <p>
       Since order rejecting compensation claim was not final until it reached the supreme court, this section [Code 1942, § 6998-26] was applicable to a case which was pending in the supreme court at a time it was discovered that the applicant was not suffering from a disease, which formed the basis for the rejection of his claim for compensation. Pryor v. Woodall Industries, Inc., 250 Miss. 672, 167 So. 2d 920, 1964 Miss. LEXIS 486 (Miss. 1964).
      </p>
      <p>
       While there is a division of authority as to whether or not the statute of limitations is tolled by the appeal, in view of the provisions of this section [Code 1942, § 6998-26], which must be read and considered in conjunction with Code 1942, § 6998-27, an applicant is entitled to file his application for a review of his compensation claim with the workmen’s compensation commission within one year after the judgment of the supreme court finally rejects his claim. Pryor v. Woodall Industries, Inc., 250 Miss. 672, 167 So. 2d 920, 1964 Miss. LEXIS 486 (Miss. 1964).
      </p>
      <p>
       The legal effect of the evidence and the conclusion drawn by the commission from the facts, as distinguished from its findings of evidentiary facts, is a question of law reviewable by the courts, especially where the facts are undisputed or overwhelmingly established. Central Electric Power Asso. v. Hicks, 236 Miss. 378, 110 So. 2d 351, 112 So. 2d 230, 1959 Miss. LEXIS 330 (Miss. 1959); M. T. Reed Constr. Co. v. Garrett, 249 Miss. 892, 164 So. 2d 476, 1964 Miss.

       Judicial review of findings of the commission extends to a determination of whether they are clearly erroneous; and a finding is erroneous where, although there is some slight evidence to support it, the court on the entire evidence is left with a definite conviction that a mistake has been made in the findings of fact and in applying the Workmen’s Compensation Law. Central Electric Power Asso. v. Hicks, 236 Miss. 378, 110 So. 2d 351, 112 So. 2d 230, 1959 Miss. LEXIS 330 (Miss. 1959).
      </p>
      <p>
       The commission’s findings are to be reviewed on the whole record, and not merely on the evidence tending to support them. Central Electric Power Asso. v. Hicks, 236 Miss. 378, 110 So. 2d 351, 112 So. 2d 230, 1959 Miss. LEXIS 330 (Miss. 1959).
      </p>
      <p>
       The application by the commission of the legislative standards is an appropriate question for judicial decision. Central Electric Power Asso. v. Hicks, 236 Miss. 378, 110 So. 2d 351, 112 So. 2d 230, 1959 Miss. LEXIS 330 (Miss. 1959).
      </p>
      <p>
       This provision does not authorize a review de novo, but clearly states an intent that the reviewing court shall examine the record to determine whether the policies and purposes of the Workmen’s Compensation Law are being carried out in the particular case, and whether the law is receiving a broad and liberal construction without over-emphasis on technicalities. Central Electric Power Asso. v. Hicks, 236 Miss. 378, 110 So. 2d 351, 112 So. 2d 230, 1959 Miss. LEXIS 330 (Miss. 1959).

       Where facts are undisputed, the matter for decision is one of law, reviewable by the courts. Wilson v. International Paper Co., 235 Miss. 153, 108 So. 2d 554, 1959 Miss. LEXIS 413 (Miss. 1959).

       The language in this section [Code 1942, § 6998-26], to the effect that the final award of the commission shall be conclusive and binding unless either party shall appeal within 30 days, evinces a legislative intent to postpone the conclusiveness and finality of the order until the expiration of the 30 days allowed for appeal. T. C. Fuller Plywood Co. v. Moffett, 231 Miss. 382, 95 So. 2d 475, 1957 Miss. LEXIS 523 (Miss. 1957).

       Under this section [Code 1942, § 6998-26] either party is given the right to appeal within 30 days, and the fact that one party gives his notice of appeal one day before the other does not destroy the right of the other to appeal from the order of the workmen’s compensation commission.

       Where the employer and its insurer did not preserve their right of appeal by an appeal or cross-appeal from the commission to the circuit court, their cross-appeal to the supreme court cannot be considered.

       Where the attorney-referee and commission had adjudicated liability for compensation benefits as to the insured member of a partnership and his insurance carrier, the failure to adjudicate the liability of the uninsured partner, who was also liable for payment of the compensation, gave the insurance carrier an appealable interest in the correctness of the commission’s order; hence, the order of the commission was modified so as to adjudicate the liability for payment and compensation against the uninsured partner, in addition to the insured partner’s carrier. United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co. v. Collins, 231 Miss. 319, 95 So. 2d 456, 1957 Miss. LEXIS 516, 1957 Miss. LEXIS 517 (Miss. 1957).

       Although the original award did not allow an immediate lump sum payment, nor reasonable funeral expenses, nor compensation payments to the deceased prior to his death, where there had been no appeal by the claimants from the decision by the attorney-referee or the commission, their cross appeals could not be considered by the supreme court upon an appeal by the employer and his compensation carrier. Dixie Pine Products Co. v. Dependents of Bryant, 228 Miss. 595, 89 So. 2d 589, 1956 Miss. LEXIS 551 (Miss. 1956).
      </p>
      <p>
       The right of appeal from the final award of the workmen’s compensation commission is not limited to an aggrieved party or a party against whom an award or judgment has been rendered, but is conferred upon either party to the controversy. An employer of an unsuccessful claimant was a party to controversy and as such was entitled to appeal from an adverse finding by the commission. Phillips v. T. H.

      <p>
       Where there are rival claimants to an award and each is seeking to be recognized as the “widow” of the decedent, if an appeal is taken by either of the claimants or by the employer and the insurance carrier, such an appeal has the effect of bringing the entire case before the appellate court for review. Hill v. United Timber & Lumber Co., 68 So. 2d 420 (Miss. 1953).

       When a circuit court reviews findings and conclusions of the Mississippi Workers’ Compensation Commission, it sits as an intermediate court of appeals and reviews all questions of law and fact. When a decision of the Commission is before the circuit court on intermediate appeal, that court may not tamper with the findings of fact, where the findings are supported by a sufficient weight of evidence. Univ. of S. Miss. v. Gillis, 872 So. 2d 60, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 1193 (Miss. Ct. App. 2003), cert. denied, 873 So. 2d 1032, 2004 Miss. LEXIS 479 (Miss. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although an appeal from a workers’ compensation award must be filed to the circuit court of the county in which the injury occurred, such requirement is a matter of venue, rather than jurisdiction, and, therefore, the appropriate remedy when an appeal is filed with the wrong circuit court is a transfer of venue, rather than a dismissal. Underwood v. McRae's, 811 So. 2d 400, 2001 Miss. App. LEXIS 62 (Miss. Ct. App. 2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       Function of circuit court and Supreme Court, on appeal from rulings of Workers’ Compensation Commission, is to determine whether there exists quantum of credible evidence which supports decision, and not to determine where preponderance of evidence lies when evidence is conflicting, given that it is presumed that Commission, as trier of fact, has previously determined which evidence is credible and which is not. Hale v. Ruleville Health Care Ctr., 687 So. 2d 1221, 1997 Miss. LEXIS 34 (Miss. 1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       Certainty is not a requisite in deciding a workers’ compensation case, but, rather, the reviewing court considers reasonable medical probabilities. In other words, medical findings sufficient to show a compensable disability are not required to be precise, complete and unequivocal. Georgia-Pacific Corp. v. Gregory, 589 So. 2d 1250, 1991 Miss. LEXIS 763 (Miss. 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       Deadline for claimant to file cross-appeal to appeal which has been timely filed by employer is in no sense jurisdictional and Circuit Court has greater latitude in enforcement of time limitations with respect to cross-appeals than in case of direct appeals. South Cent. Bell Tel. Co. v. Aden, 474 So. 2d 584, 1985 Miss. LEXIS 2197 (Miss. 1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       In an action regarding the denial of workmen’s compensation death benefits the circuit court improperly dismissed a petition for appeal, where a motion requesting a review of the evidence by the commission which was filed within the statutory period for appealing the commission’s order tolled the time for appeal until the commission entered its order on the motion; the error was harmless, however where the circuit court heard the appeal under the commission’s order overruling the motion for review. Johnston v. Hattiesburg Clinic, P.A., 423 So. 2d 114, 1982 Miss. LEXIS 2281 (Miss. 1982).
      </p>
      <p>
       Workmen’s Compensation Commission is the trier of facts, as well as the judge of credibility of the witnesses, and the finding of the commission supported by substantial evidence should be affirmed by the circuit court; all questions of law and fact are reviewable by the circuit court judge, but he may not pass on the weight of the evidence where it is sufficient to support the commission’s order. Roberts v. Junior Food Mart, 308 So. 2d 232, 1975 Miss. LEXIS 1855 (Miss. 1975).
      </p>
      <p>
       Circuit courts, as intermediate courts of appeal in workmen’s compensation cases, are governed by the same rules and endowed with the same powers applicable to courts of appeal under appellate tradition, and the circuit court did not abuse its discretion by dismissing an appeal where the appellant failed to file briefs and prosecute until 96 days after the return day, in violation of the court’s rule. Gulf Coast Drilling & Exploration Co. v. Permenter, 214 So. 2d 601, 1968 Miss. LEXIS 1319 (Miss. 1968).
      </p>
      <p>
       When the compensation commission’s judgment is clearly erroneous and prejudicial on a question of law or fact, the circuit court on appeal should enter such judgment as the commission should have entered. Scott v. Brookhaven Well Service, 246 Miss. 456, 150 So. 2d 508, 1963 Miss. LEXIS 464 (Miss. 1963).
      </p>
      <p>
       On review the test is whether the order of the workmen’s compensation commission is supported by substantial evidence, and where the order is so supported, it is error for the circuit court to reverse the commission’s order because in its opinion the claimant has failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that he is entitled to compensation. Babcock & Wilcox Co. v. McClain, 149 So. 2d 523 (Miss. 1963).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a finding of the attorney-referee in favor of claimants is affirmed by the commission and supported by substantial evidence, the award may not be removed on appeal to the circuit court. Gaines v. McCormick, 238 Miss. 535, 117 So. 2d 467, 1960 Miss. LEXIS 435 (Miss. 1960).
      </p>
      <p>
       The circuit court is an appellate court which must consider appeals on the record as made before the trial court, and therefore the motion of the insurance carrier to include, as a part of the record in the appeal then pending before a circuit court, a report of the doctor who performed an operation on the claimant after the hearing before the commission was properly overruled. Federated Mut. Implement & Hardware Ins. Co. v. Spencer, 219 Miss. 68, 67 So. 2d 878, 1953 Miss. LEXIS 370 (Miss. 1953).

       This section [Code 1942, § 6998-26], which allows court review of all questions of law and fact, enables the court on appeal to reverse the order of the compensation commission in a case where the court finds that such order was based upon findings of fact which were contrary to the weight of the evidence or upon an erroneous interpretation of the applicable provisions of the statute.

       An order of the circuit court which reversed a finding of the industrial commission, and which was later affirmed by the supreme court, became the law of the case and established that there was not sufficient evidence to support an award for a permanent partial disability and was controlling upon a retrial following remand, so that in the absence of additional testimony, it would be the court’s determination that the claimant had not established a permanent partial disability for which an award could be made. Consumer Discount Store v. Warren, 221 So. 2d 112, 1969 Miss. LEXIS 1493, 1969 Miss. LEXIS 1494 (Miss. 1969).

       Where the Workers’ Compensation Commission had issued no final order, the circuit court was without jurisdiction to hear an employer’s appeal of the Commission’s order dismissing the employer’s appeal of an ALJ’s decision granting the employee’s motion to compel medical benefits.

       Where, from a reading of a judgment of the circuit court which reversed the decision of workmen’s compensation commission, it was clear that the court was of the opinion that there was prejudicial error in the record, the failure of the circuit court to incorporate in its judgment a formal recital that there was a prejudicial error did not invalidate the judgment of the circuit court. Hill v. United Timber & Lumber Co., 68 So. 2d 420 (Miss. 1953).

       The amendment of the Workmen’s Compensation Law placing awards of compensation made by judgment of circuit court in the same category as other judgments of circuit court and providing that, upon affirmance thereof, such judgments shall bear the same interest and penalties as to other judgment of circuit court, is plain and unambiguous and cannot be interpreted as placing such judgments awarding compensation in a more favored or different class than other judgments of circuit court.

       Decisions of the Mississippi Workers’ Compensation Commission on issues of fact will not be overturned if they are supported by substantial evidence.

      </p>
      <p>
       The substantial evidence rule to support the finding of an order of the workmen’s compensation commission does not mean a small part of the total evidence, nor does the rule prevent an appellate court from examining the whole evidence to the end that the compensation law may be applied in a just and reasonable manner.

       Substantial evidence existed that a workers’ compensation claimant sustained his injury while at work, notwithstanding confusion as to the date of the injury, because the Workers Compensation Commission found that: (1) the worker’s testimony was credible; (2) his educational level contributed to the confusion of dates; and (3) he was a dependable, faithful employee, as well as a credible witness.

       Circuit Court reversed the prior ruling of a 14 percent loss of wage earning capacity and found that the employee had suffered a 30 percent loss of wage-earning capacity, and the employee appealed yet again to the appellate court. The administrative law judge based his finding of a 14 percent loss of wage-earning capacity on a consideration of the employee’s age, education, work history, and medical impairment, and the employee had been consistently employed since the injury in other positions at rates of pay not substantially less than what he had previously earned; thus, in finding a 30 percent loss of earning capacity, the circuit court applied an incorrect standard of review by reweighing the evidence presented and reversing the order of the Mississippi Workers’ Compensation Commission as to loss of wage-earning capacity.

       A finding by the Workers’ Compensation Commission that a lumberyard worker had sustained only a 50 percent loss of wage-earning capacity, and therefore suffered only partial rather than total permanent disability, would be reversed where the evidence indicated that he had difficulty performing “make-work” tasks at his employer’s lumberyard after he returned to work and that his efforts to find other employment were unsuccessful, and the Commission’s finding was based on the conclusion that the employee should have been able to secure “some type of gainful employment” merely because he had a high school education.

       A finding that a claimant was not entitled to permanent disability benefits because his disability, which arose from slippage in the spine, was attributable entirely to preexisting spondylolisthesis was not supported by substantial evidence where there was conflicting medical testimony from 2 treating physicians as to the cause of the claimant’s permanent disability and neither physician could determine how and when the slippage actually occurred, since close questions of compensability should be resolved in favor of the claimant, and the Workers’ Compensation Act should be liberally construed to carry out its remedial purpose. McNeese v. Cooper Tire & Rubber Co., 627 So. 2d 321, 1993 Miss. LEXIS 444 (Miss. 1993).

      <p>
       An administrative law judge, as affirmed by the Workers’ Compensation Commission and the circuit court, erred as a matter of law when he specifically stated that a hearing on an injured employee’s motion to consider the need for additional medical treatment at the employer’s expense under General Rule 9 was limited to whether the employee was suffering from improper medical treatment or lack of medical treatment, and then proceeded to make findings on maximum medical recovery and apportionment; an administrative law judge may not announce a limited purpose of a hearing, require the litigants to argue under limitation, and then decide the whole of the case including the time of maximum recovery apportionment and compensation. Monroe v. Broadwater Beach Hotel, 593 So. 2d 26, 1992 Miss. LEXIS 11 (Miss. 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       The evidence was insufficient to support a finding by the Workers’ Compensation Commission that a claimant’s back injury was work related where no doctor testified that the claimant received this injury on the job, no fellow worker corroborated the claimant’s assertion that his injury occurred while on the job, and the claimant never reported any work related injury to his employer. Bechtel Corp. v. Phillips, 591 So. 2d 814, 1991 Miss. LEXIS 838 (Miss. 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       Decision of Workmen’s Compensation Commission awarding benefits on basis of alleged back injury will be reversed on judicial review on basis of lack of sufficient evidence where only testimony regarding injury is that of claimant and those claimant informed, initial medical consultation for injury is almost full year after injury, and claimant’s conduct after injury is so inconsistent with that of employee injured in course of employment as to cause loss of credibility. Hudson v. Keystone Seneca Wire Cloth Co., 482 So. 2d 226, 1986 Miss. LEXIS 2334 (Miss. 1986).

       A heart attack suffered by an employee while in the discharge of administrative duties was held by the supreme court to be compensable, notwithstanding the commission’s contrary conclusion. Russell v. Sohio Southern Pipe Lines, Inc., 236 Miss. 722, 112 So. 2d 357, 1959 Miss. LEXIS 369 (Miss. 1959).

      <p>
       Where a truck driver accidentally lacerated his leg on June 26, 1954, causing considerable bleeding which continued to some extent even after medical attention, and following his release by the doctor to return to work, on July 5, 1954, the employee reported to work on July 9, 1954, while suffering from dizzy spells, and died on July 16th, 1954, as result of bleeding to death from a massive gastrointestinal hemorrhage and malignant hypertension, the attorney-referee’s finding that death was not related to the injury of June 26th, the workmen’s compensation commission’s order affirming the finding, as well as the circuit court’s affirming order, was not supported by substantial evidence and would be reversed. Williams v. Vicksburg Wholesale Poultry Co., 233 Miss. 384, 102 So. 2d 378, 1958 Miss. LEXIS 395 (Miss. 1958).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a doctor, who had examined the injured employee approximately four months prior to the time of the hearing, estimated the employee’s disability at 15 percent but stated that he had not seen the claimant since that time, whereas a doctor who had examined the claimant on the day of the hearing stated that claimant’s disability to the body as a whole was 50 to 75 percent, and that the leg was from 90 to 100 percent disabled so far as manual labor was concerned, the circuit court properly reversed the order of the workmen’s compensation commission awarding to the injured claimant permanent partial benefits for only a 15 percent loss of use of his leg. A. De Weese Lumber Co. v. Poole, 231 Miss. 83, 94 So. 2d 791, 1957 Miss. LEXIS 491 (Miss. 1957).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where both the claimant and a doctor who had last examined him on October, 6, 1955, testified at a hearing beginning on September, 1955 and concluding in November, 1955, that the claimant was suffering from a temporary total disability resulting from injury received in his employment, the circuit court properly reversed the workmen’s compensation board’s order denying claimant compensation benefits after June 5, 1955, which was based upon the opinion of a doctor who had last examined claimant on May 5, 1955, that claimant would be able to return to work within another month. Masonite Corp. v. Fields, 229 Miss. 524, 91 So. 2d 282, 1956 Miss. LEXIS 635 (Miss. 1956).

       Statutory damages in an amount of 5 percent were not allowable where the circuit court failed to enter a money judgment in favor of the claimant, but the claimant was entitled to 6 percent interest on the installments of compensation from their due dates until paid.

       Upon the affirmance of an award of workmen’s compensation payments to the deceased employee’s parents, who were found to be partially dependent upon the employee, claimants’ motion for five percent statutory damages, and six percent interest on all installments which then had become due and remained unpaid, was sustained, as was their motion for attorneys’ fees in the amount of one third of the award.

       Where the supreme court reversed the trial court’s overturning of the workmen’s compensation board’s order allowing an employee compensation for a 50 percent loss of wage earning capacity, the 5 percent damages under Code 1942, § 1971, were not allowable.

       Where wages of decedent were shown and the commission awarded benefits to the claimants, so that amount of the award could be determined by simple mathematic calculation, the claimants were entitled to an allowance of damages of 5 percent.

       The judgment of circuit court, in awarding workmen’s compensation in certain amount per week for number of weeks, is not so definite and certain as to constitute a money judgment of which 5 percent damages can be calculated except as to the weekly installments which have already accrued and remained unpaid to the date of the entry of the judgment of affirmance.

       Mississippi Workers’ Compensation Commission did not abuse its discretion by declining to reopen a claimant’s case based on evidence that could have been produced at the original hearing as the evidence submitted in support of the motion to reopen did not disprove the finding of the original decision that the claimant deviated from the course and scope of the claimant’s employment to engage in a road rage incident with a motorist. Huey v. RGIS Inventory Specialists & Fid. & Guar. Ins. Co., — So.3d —, 2018 Miss. App. LEXIS 196 (Miss. Ct. App. Apr. 24, 2018), cert. denied, 258 So.3d 286, 2018 Miss. LEXIS 522 (Miss. 2018).

   Mississippi Workers’ Compensation Commission’s ruling that there was no mistake in determination of fact about an employee’s work-related injury under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c03s71-3-53" target="_self">71-3-53</a></cite> was supported by substantial evidence, which included doctor’s reports stating that the employee would probably need back surgery in the future as a result of her pre-existing condition.

   Where an employer voluntarily paid for an employee’s work-related medical expenses for two years and the employee subsequently filed a petition to controvert, the employee’s argument under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c03s71-3-53" target="_self">71-3-53</a></cite> was improper because a review and change of compensation was not at issue since the Mississippi Workers’ Compensation Commission never ordered any form of compensation in the employee’s case.

       Workers’ Compensation Commission had continuing jurisdiction to review a compensation case, issue a new compensation order which could terminate, continue, reinstate, increase, or decrease such compensation, or award compensation. Walls v. Franklin Corp., 797 So. 2d 973, 2001 Miss. LEXIS 264 (Miss. 2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Workers’ Compensation Commission did not abuse its discretion and was not clearly erroneous in its decision not to reopen a case where (1) it had substantial evidence before it to make an informed decision, and (2) although the claimant asserted that 23 of his medical reports were not made available to the commissioner for her consideration in approving a settlement, he did not state what information was contained in these reports and did not show how those reports could have changed the outcome of the settlement had they been included in the commission’s portfolio of information. J. R. Logging v. Halford, 765 So. 2d 580, 2000 Miss. App. LEXIS 215 (Miss. Ct. App. 2000).
      </p>

       Previous adjudication by Circuit Court judge denying workmens’ compensation benefit is res judicata to second proceeding on claim except to extent that case may be reopened for change of condition or because of mistake in determination of fact; reopening because of mistake in determination of fact may be made on basis of newly discovered evidence or evidence which for whatever good reason was not previously reflected in record and could include evidence to establish essential causal connection between initial injury and contemporaneous or resulting physical or mental disability; in order for reopening to be granted on basis of change in condition, there must be evidence presented to support finding indicating previous mistake in determination of fact so as to establish causal connection between initial injury and claimant’s present condition.

      <p>
       In a workmen’s compensation case arising out of a compromise settlement for a lump-sum payment made by an injured worker, the trial court properly reinstated an order of the administrative judge to reopen the cause with further proceedings to determine benefits where the employee, who possessed a fourth-grade education and was unable to read or write except to sign his name, had never been informed of the full extent of his disability, had not been represented by counsel during the settlement negotiations, had not been told the full amount of disability benefits to which he was entitled, and, generally, had been taken unfair advantage of by the carrier.

       Assuming that a change in the claimant’s ability to get or hold employment may be considered to be a change of conditions within the meaning of this section, the claimant did not satisfy her burden of proof where her evidence did not establish that she had been refused employment because of her disability.

       An application to reopen under this section may not be used as a substitute for the right of appeal, and the commission did not abuse its discretion in refusing to reopen a case on the ground that there had been no award for permanent disability even though the record showed a 15% permanent partial disability had been established by the medical evidence.

       Workers’ Compensation Commission properly denied an employee’s request to re-open her claim four months after it was settled through mediation because the employee did not make any arguments in support of a change in circumstance regarding her injuries or a mistake in determination of fact regarding her settlement and nothing in the record indicated the administrative judge forced the employee into mediation or erred in accepting the settlement agreement provided by the employee and the employer.

       Workers’ Compensation Commission erred in granting an employer’s motion to reopen and in vacating its prior order approving the parties’ settlement because, while the employee died after signing the settlement and before it was approved by the Commission, there was no dispute that there was a meeting of the minds prior to his death and the employer did not show how the employee’s death after the settlement was signed by the parties and submitted to the Commission, had any bearing on the issue of whether the mistake of fact (the Commission’s assumption that the employee was still alive when it approved the settlement) related to a valid reason for setting aside the settlement.

       Reversal of Workers’ Compensation Commission’s denial of a former employer’s motion to discharge its obligation to pay a former worker’s asthma related medical expenses was errer because the employer failed to show that its medical expert based his conclusion that the asthma was not caused by the worker’s employment on evidence that was not available to the employer at the original compensation determination.

       Mississippi Worker’s Compensation Commission did not err in failing to reopen a claim because there was no merit to the claimant’s assertion that there was a mistake in a determination of fact regarding the Commission not having the claimant’s address or the claimant failing to pursue the claim for workers’ compensation benefits.

      <p>
       Workers’ Compensation Commission’s denial of an employee’s right to reopen his previously settled workers’ compensation claims was supported by substantial evidence because the settlement seemed fair and reasonable, and his termination soon after reaching the settlement did not constitute a mistake of fact that would have warranted reopening, as there was no proof that the employee had a reasonable expectation of continued employment at the time that he entered the settlement.

   While the decision to reopen a case is within the discretion of the Workers’ Compensation Commission, the Commission abused its discretion when it failed to even consider the applicability of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c03s71-3-53" target="_self">71-3-53</a></cite> when it decided not to reopen a case.

      </p>
      <p>
       The Workers’ Compensation Commission had the power and authority to reopen a claim despite the fact that the claimant had accepted a lump-sum settlement and had signed a full release. Litigants and attorneys on both sides have a duty to fully inform the Commission in such settlements and where they fail to do so or where the Commission makes a “mistake of fact” that is detrimental to either party, there is the granted authority to deal with the mistake or the wrong. Thus, where the true facts regarding the extent of the claimant’s medical recovery were not known to the Commission at the time the initial settlement was approved, the Commission had every right to believe that it had made a mistake of fact about the claimant’s medical condition when it approved her lump-sum settlement, and therefore the Commission was justified in reopening the claim and in making a subsequent award of permanent total disability.

       Jurisdiction was vested in the Workmen’s Compensation Commission upon the claimant’s filing her original two motions to controvert, and jurisdiction remained vested in the commission throughout the hearings conducted by an administrative judge and through the time when he issued his order, since jurisdiction of workmen’s compensation claims is vested totally completely and exclusively in the commission and such jurisdiction cannot pass back and forth from the commission to an administrative judge inasmuch as an administrative judge is merely a facility of the commission.

       In view of the attorney referee’s finding that an examination and the written narrative report of the examining physician upset the previous medical findings, there was an abuse of discretion in the referee’s refusal to allow the employer and its insurer to cross-examine the claimant about a false medical history given to the physician and to introduce other testimony relative to such history.

       Claimant filed as motion to reopen within the one-year statute of limitations because, as there was an appeal from a final judgment of the Mississippi Workers’ Compensation Commission, the claim was not finally rejected, and the statute of limitations did not begin to run, until a final mandate was issued from the appeals process.

       Workers’ Compensation Commission erred in denying a worker’s request to reopen her case as untimely because, while almost a decade had passed since the worker received her final disability payment, the one-year statutory period had not yet been “triggered” where the worker filed her motion to reopen prior to one year after her final compensation payment and the Commission never considered whether the worker established by a preponderance of the evidence that her conditions had changed.

       A finding by the Workers’ Compensation Commission that there had been a change in conditions warranting the reopening of a case was supported by substantial evidence where the employee testified that his condition had worsened and that additional medical treatment and diagnostic procedures were necessary, the additional treatment and procedures established for the first time a definitive diagnosis of Meniere’s Syndrome, the original award of a 5 percent permanent partial disability was made for loss of hearing only, the diagnosis of Meniere’s Syndrome was perceived by the Commission to involve more than a simple loss of hearing, and the new order specifically cited a new finding of impairment to the body as a whole with concomitant loss of wage earning capacity.

   One-year limitations period established by §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c03s71-3-53" target="_self">71-3-53</a></cite> is measured by reference to claimant’s execution and filing of Form B-31, entitled “Report of Payment and Settlement Receipt,” and operates to bar cause of action to recover additional compensation after limitations period has expired. Street v. South Carolina Ins. Co., 698 F. Supp. 662, 1988 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12517 (S.D. Miss. 1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       The one-year period of limitation provided by this section [Code 1942, § 6998-27] does not begin to run until notice is given to the claimant by the filing of a form B-31 with the commission on behalf of the employer. Empire Home Builders v. Guthrie, 187 So. 2d 17, 1966 Miss. LEXIS 1336 (Miss. 1966).
      </p>
      <p>
       The filing of Form B-31 with the workmen’s compensation commissioner did not start the running of the one-year statute of limitations as to an employee who received no notice of such filing, either from the employer or the commission, and notwithstanding that Form B-5-11 was filed on behalf of employee more than one year after date of accident, the claim should have been considered on its merits. Nichols v. American Creosoting Co., 245 Miss. 414, 146 So. 2d 76, 1962 Miss. LEXIS 561 (Miss. 1962).
      </p>
      <p>
       The limitations period provided for in this section [Code 1942, § 6998-27] must be considered in connection with subsection (g) of Code 1942, § 6998-19, providing that no case shall be closed without notice to all parties interested and without giving to all such parties an opportunity to be heard. International Paper Co. v. Evans, 244 Miss. 49, 140 So. 2d 271, 1962 Miss. LEXIS 422 (Miss. 1962).
      </p>
      <p>
       As against a claimant who had refused to sign the final report and settlement receipt submitted to him, the one-year limitation period provided for in this section [Code 1942, § 6998-27] did not begin to run until he had received notice that the employer had filed with the workmen’s compensation commission a final report and settlement receipt, properly filled out. International Paper Co. v. Evans, 244 Miss. 49, 140 So. 2d 271, 1962 Miss. LEXIS 422 (Miss. 1962).
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if a final report and settlement receipt, which was not signed by the claimant, was valid, act of carrier in sending claimant to a doctor for an examination constituted a voluntary reopening of the case, and since no final form closing the case had been filed up to the time the claim had been made, the claim was not barred by limitations. Shainberg's Black & White Store v. Prothro, 238 Miss. 444, 118 So. 2d 862, 1960 Miss. LEXIS 425 (Miss. 1960).
      </p>
      <p>
       Filing by an insurance carrier of a statement, indicating that a final report previously filed was considered ineffective, tolled the statute of limitations. Graeber Bros., Inc. v. Taylor, 237 Miss. 691, 115 So. 2d 735, 1960 Miss. LEXIS 502 (Miss. 1960).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the requirements of subsection (g) of Code 1942, § 6998-19 had been fully complied with by the employer and its insurance carrier, the workmen’s compensation commission was without jurisdiction of a claim for compensation made more than 3 years after the closing of the case. Carter v. Wrecking Corp. of America, 234 Miss. 559, 107 So. 2d 116, 1958 Miss. LEXIS 529 (Miss. 1958).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a claimant had been paid some medical expenses and compensation benefits and, together with the carrier, had executed a form under which the claim was closed, a claim for additional medical benefits filed nearly four years later was barred by the statute of limitations. Trehern v. Grafe Auto Co., 232 Miss. 854, 100 So. 2d 786, 1958 Miss. LEXIS 339 (Miss. 1958).
      </p>
      <p>
       Before the statute of limitations provided by this section [Code 1942, § 6998-27] begins to run, there must be a compliance with the mandatory provision of Code 1942, § 6998-19(g). James F. O'Neil, Inc. v. Livings, 232 Miss. 118, 98 So. 2d 148, 1957 Miss. LEXIS 451 (Miss. 1957); Shainberg's Black & White Store v. Prothro, 238 Miss. 444, 118 So. 2d 862, 1960 Miss. LEXIS 425 (Miss. 1960).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section [Code 1942, § 6998-27] does not apply unless there has been a compliance with Code 1942, § 6998-19(g), which provides that within 30 days after final payment of compensation has been made, employer shall send to the commission a notice stating that final payment has been made, the full amount of compensation paid, the name of the employee and of any other person to whom compensation has been paid, the date of the injury or death, and the date to which the compensation has been paid.

      <p>
       It was not the intent of the legislature to require that there be a formal hearing by the commission in order to close employee’s claim of voluntary payments, and the fact that no such hearing was held did not render statute which limited period of commencement of suit for additional compensation to within one year after receipt of final payment inapplicable.

       Employee’s motion to reinstate a workers’ compensation claim on the docket was properly denied where the motion was barred by the one-year statute of limitations; after the employee’s claim was dismissed for failure to comply with the procedural rules, the employee waited far more than one year to file the completed pre-hearing statement.

       In an action regarding the denial of workmen’s compensation death benefits the circuit court improperly dismissed a petition for appeal, where a motion requesting a review of the evidence by the commission which was filed within the statutory period for appealing the commission’s order tolled the time for appeal until the commission entered its order on the motion; the error was harmless, however where the circuit court heard the appeal under the commission’s order overruling the motion for review.

      <p>
       While there is a division of authority as to whether or not the statute of limitations is tolled by the appeal, in view of the provisions of Code 1942, § 6998-26, which must be read and considered in conjunction with this section [Code 1942, § 6998-27], an applicant is entitled to file his application for a review of his compensation claim with the workmen’s compensation commission within one year after the judgment of the supreme court finally rejects his claim.

       In proceeding for death benefits, where it was shown that the employee was murdered by a jilted suitor and that the only connection between her employment and the cause of her death was that she was on duty at the time she was shot and was merely informing the slayer of the rules of the telephone company which prohibited visitors in the operating room at the exchange, the commission did not abuse its discretion in refusing to open the case on the grounds of newly discovered evidence, which in general terms alleged that the employee’s slayer was insane, particularly since such evidence would not change the result.

       When a workers’ compensation claim is dismissed because the claimant fails to file a prehearing statement, the claimant has one year from the day that the order of dismissal becomes final in which to move to reopen. Therefore, it was proper to deny a claimant’s motion to reopen a workers’ compensation case because it was untimely filed more than 20 months after the dismissal became final. Gaillard v. N.

       Code 1942, §§ 6998-24 and 6998-28 do not require formal procedure or formal orders, and failure to accompany an order with a finding of fact is not fatal to its validity. Rivers Constr. Co. v. Dubose, 241 Miss. 527, 130 So. 2d 865, 1961 Miss. LEXIS 371 (Miss. 1961).

       Mississippi Workers’ Compensation Commission did not commit any reversible error by quashing a subpoena issued to a doctor and by failing to record and transcribe the hearing on the issue because the only “hearings” on the employee’s subpoena were a telephonic conference with the administrative judge and oral argument on his petition for review by the full Commission; no testimony or other evidence was received during either “hearing.” Wright v.

      </p>
      <p>
       Compensation may be allowed for disabling pain in the absence of positive medical testimony as to any physical cause whatever. When the patient complains of pain, the doctor usually takes the fact of pain for granted and the absence of physical findings to account for the pain will not necessarily bar compensation. In such cases, evidence of an accident followed by disabling pain and the absence of evidence as to the cause of the pain from objective medical findings may be sufficient as a basis for compensation, in the absence of circumstances tending to show malingering or indicating that the claimant’s testimony as to pain is inherently improbable, incredible, unreasonable or untrustworthy. However, there is a great potential for abuse in claims which are based predominantly upon pain reported by the patient, particularly in circumstances where the patient’s testimony or statement to the physician is the sole evidence of its continued presence. In these cases, it would be prudent to obtain additional medical evidence to either support or dispute the claim. Morris v. Lansdell's Frame Co., 547 So. 2d 782, 1989 Miss. LEXIS 336 (Miss. 1989).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Workers’ Compensation Commission, within legal limits, is the sole judge of the weight and sufficiency of the evidence. Evidence which is not contradicted by positive testimony or circumstances, and which is not inherently improbable, incredible, or unreasonable, cannot, as a matter of law, be arbitrarily or capriciously discredited, disregarded or rejected, even though the witness is a party or is interested; unless uncontradicted evidence is shown to be untrustworthy, it is to be taken as conclusive and binding on the triers of fact.

       The Supreme Court, under its inherent rule-making power, would supplement a previous order of the Workmen’s Compensation Commission authorizing the admission of written medical reports and would provide prospective guidelines and safeguards for their use, to insure protection of the adversary system and the principle of non-admission of hearsay evidence under common law directives.

      </p>
      <p>
       Inasmuch as under this section the Commission is not bound by common law or statutory rules of evidence, the admission of an affidavit of claimant’s doctor was improper but harmless error, where the affidavit changed nothing which was in the doctor’s deposition already in evidence but merely restated his interpretation of claimant’s condition, the employer made no effort to impeach the affidavit or to recross-examine the physician, and the doctor had earlier been cross-examined.

       Although the patient-physician communication privilege rule of evidence is not abolished by the Workmen’s Compensation Law except insofar as it is specifically provided under Code 1942, § 6998-08, there is, however, under Code 1942, § 6998-28, a grant of authority to the workmen’s compensation commission to relax, in its discretion, the traditional common law and statutory rules of evidence in order to obtain a full development of the facts concerning each claim; and, in the instant case the attorney referee did not abuse his discretion in refusing to relax the patient-physician communication privilege in order to let in testimony concerning the claimant’s alleged pre-existing injury.

       A claimant who rests his case without introducing medical testimony, in reliance on the employer’s notice of intention to call the attending physician, is entitled, where the employer did not do so, to have the case reopened for the purpose of introducing such testimony.

       An administrative law judge, as affirmed by the Workers’ Compensation Commission and the circuit court, erred as a matter of law when he specifically stated that a hearing on an injured employee’s motion to consider the need for additional medical treatment at the employer’s expense under General Rule 9 was limited to whether the employee was suffering from improper medical treatment or lack of medical treatment, and then proceeded to make findings on maximum medical recovery and apportionment; an administrative law judge may not announce a limited purpose of a hearing, require the litigants to argue under limitation, and then decide the whole of the case including the time of maximum recovery apportionment and compensation.

       There is no support in the Mississippi Workers’ Compensation Act, or in the case law, for the proposition that an employer which itself is free of any wrongdoing can be held liable on an alter-ego theory for its workers’ compensation carrier’s bad faith failure to pay benefits; the law, in fact, is to the contrary.

       Because the claimant’s counsel was not obligated to do anything further under the Mississippi Workers’ Compensation Commission’s procedural rules once the claimant’s motion to reinstate his claim was timely filed, imposing the $500 sanction for unreasonable delay was inappropriate because there was no breach of an affirmative duty on the part of counsel in not requesting a hearing on the motion to reinstate.

       Mississippi Workers’ Compensation Commission erred by imposing sanctions on an employee’s attorney for the subpoena that the attorney served on a doctor and his deposition questioning of the doctor because the possible financial bias of the doctor and his compensation in the litigation were relevant matters the attorney sought to explore by subpoena and deposition; no rules or reported cases clearly prohibited the conduct for which the Commission imposed sanctions.

       Errors occurred when the administrative law judge acted contrary to his ruling at a hearing in which he found that an employee accident report was inadmissible because of discovery violations and when the Mississippi Workers’ Compensation Commission chose to disregard the administrative hearing officer’s decision as to the enforcement of its own procedural rules; however, the employee could not complain that the Commission’s consideration of the employee accident report caused surprise or contend that trial by ambush would have occurred if the administrative hearing officer had allowed the report to be introduced at the hearing because she knew the document existed and what it contained. Thus, although the administrative law judge erred when he reopened the record to admit the employee accident report, the error did not rise to the level of denying the employee due process.

        In no instance shall the amount recovered by an attorney for an appearance before the commission exceed twenty-five percent (25%) of the total award of compensation. Such limitations, however, shall not be construed as applying to a fee awarded for additional services by any superior court. Legal services rendered where no motion to controvert has been filed by either employer or employee shall be considered as consultation, and that factor shall be taken into consideration in awarding a fee. Attorneys may not recover attorney’s fees based upon benefits voluntarily paid to an injured employee for temporary or permanent disability. Any settlement negotiated by an attorney shall not be considered a voluntary payment. In all instances, fees shall be awarded on the basis of fairness to both attorney and client. Although exceptions may be made in the interest of justice, it shall be deemed conducive to the best interest of all concerned for the commission to approve contracts for attorney’s fees voluntarily entered into between attorney and client, within the limitations hereinabove set out.
       </p>
       <p>
        When an award of compensation becomes final and an attorney’s fee is outstanding, a partial lump-sum settlement sufficient to cover the attorney’s fee approved therein by the commission shall be made immediately, from payments last to become due, and the deductions allowed by the law shall be borne equally by the attorney and the client.

       The statutory language that the claimant’s attorney was to receive his fee from the payments last to become due could only be met by providing all remaining payments to him, and there was no implied statutory limit that no more than 25 percent of any single periodic payment can be taken from the claimant for such purpose. City of Picayune v. Bennett, 724 So. 2d 1078, 1998 Miss. App. LEXIS 1020 (Miss. Ct. App. 1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       Supreme Court would not address workers’ compensation claimants’ argument that salary cap on claimants’ attorney fees was unconstitutional, where claimants offered no authority or evidence to support claim. Warren v. Mississippi Workers' Compensation Comm'n, 700 So. 2d 608, 1997 Miss. LEXIS 496 (Miss. 1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       On affirmance of award made by a circuit court, allowance of attorney’s fee, of interest on each installment from its due date, and of statutory damages of five percent on the total of installments due and unpaid from the date of the circuit court’s judgment to the date of affirmance by the supreme court, held proper. Central Electric Power Asso. v. Hicks, 236 Miss. 378, 110 So. 2d 351, 112 So. 2d 230, 1959 Miss. LEXIS 330 (Miss. 1959).

       The court cannot vary the contract of the parties as to the compensation of an attorney for services. Shivers v. Biloxi-Gulfport Daily Herald, 236 Miss. 303, 110 So. 2d 359, 1959 Miss. LEXIS 320 (Miss. 1959).
      </p>
      <p>
       The workmen’s compensation commission has the power to order a partial commutation of the weekly compensation payment allowed to the dependent of the injured person who died as a result of an accident arising out of and in the course of his employment for the purpose of paying attorney’s fees. American Sur. Co. v. Boykin, 212 Miss. 310, 54 So. 2d 398, 1951 Miss. LEXIS 453 (Miss. 1951).
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (j) of Code 1942, § 6998-19, fully authorized the commission, if it thought it was for the best interests of the person entitled to compensation, to commute any part of the future compensation payments into a lump sum, either for the use of the employee’s dependent or, as the case may be, for the purpose of paying the attorney’s fee. American Sur. Co. v. Boykin, 212 Miss. 310, 54 So. 2d 398, 1951 Miss. LEXIS 453 (Miss. 1951).
      </p>
      <p>
       The provision of subsection (c) of this section [Code 1942, § 6998-32] has no reference to subsection (k) in § 13, ch. 354, Laws of 1948, as amended by Laws, 1950, ch. 412 (Code 1942, § 6998-19), which provides that if an employer has made advance payments of compensation he shall be entitled to be reimbursed out of any unpaid instalment or installments of compensation due. American Sur. Co. v. Boykin, 212 Miss. 310, 54 So. 2d 398, 1951 Miss. LEXIS 453 (Miss. 1951).

       The supreme court would allow the claimant’s counsel one third of the compensation recovered. Davis v. Clark-Burt Roofing Co., 238 Miss. 464, 119 So. 2d 926, 1960 Miss. LEXIS 429 (Miss. 1960).
      </p>
      <p>
       Amounts paid before the controversy arose are to be excluded from the basis upon which the attorney’s percentage is calculated. Mullins & Parker v. Rucker, 237 Miss. 330, 115 So. 2d 535, 1959 Miss. LEXIS 474 (Miss. 1959).
      </p>

       Fees for all services of a claimant’s attorney in workmen’s compensation cases should not exceed 331/3 percent of the sum recovered. Prince v. Nicholson, 229 Miss. 718, 91 So. 2d 734, 1957 Miss. LEXIS 318 (Miss. 1957).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where an insurer of an employer made contracts subject to the workmen’s compensation statute, the insurer could not object that the statute was unconstitutional in authorizing an immediate award for claimant’s attorney of 25 percent of amount of compensation which would be paid if permanent partial disability should run for the full period, holding that such lump sum allowance for the attorney was properly based on assumption that the disability would continue for the full 450-week period. Jim Nix Cafeteria v. Burton, 226 Miss. 206, 84 So. 2d 164, 1955 Miss. LEXIS 625 (Miss. 1955).

       On joint motion of the parties, and on motion of claimant’s attorney, the supreme court would remand to the workmen’s compensation commission for its consideration and approval of the proposed negotiated settlement, and for the allowance of attorneys’ fee to the claimant’s attorney in an amount not to exceed 331/3 percent of any and all compensation recovered on behalf of claimant. Kelly v. Greif Bros. Cooperage Corp., 251 Miss. 34, 167 So. 2d 814, 1964 Miss. LEXIS 324 (Miss. 1964).
      </p>
      <p>
       The supreme court would sustain motion of claimant’s attorney for the allowance of attorney’s fee of 331/3 percent of the amount of the recovery with the understanding that such fee would cover all services rendered in all courts and before the workmen’s compensation commission. Smith v. Crown Rigs, Inc., 245 Miss. 311, 148 So. 2d 195, 1963 Miss. LEXIS 521 (Miss. 1963).
      </p>
      <p>
       Basis of attorney’s fee to one obtaining reversal of denial of death benefits held to be benefits which accrued prior to the entry of an order or allowance, plus value of future benefits, but excluding the lump sum of $100 provided by statute, and funeral expenses. Goodnite v. Farm Equipment Co., 234 Miss. 342, 103 So. 2d 391, 1958 Miss. LEXIS 563 (Miss. 1958).
      </p>
      <p>
       Upon the affirmance of an award of workmen’s compensation payments to the deceased employee’s parents, who were found to be partially dependent upon the employee, claimant’s motion for five percent statutory damages, and six percent interest on all installments which then had become due and remained unpaid, was sustained, as was their motion for attorneys’ fees in the amount of one third of the award. Mid-State Paving Co. v. Farthing, 233 Miss. 333, 101 So. 2d 850, 1958 Miss. LEXIS 386 (Miss. 1958).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the commission had allowed claimant’s attorneys a fee of 25 percent of all the compensation payments awarded, the supreme court approved a contract allowing an additional fee equal to eight and one third percent of the amount of the award upon claimant’s motion following an affirmance of the commission’s award. Kahne v. Robinson, 232 Miss. 670, 100 So. 2d 132, 100 So. 2d 585, 1958 Miss. LEXIS 315, 1958 Miss. LEXIS 316 (Miss. 1958).
      </p>
      <p>
       Motion by claimant’s counsel for an increase in fees was allowed so as to total 331/3 percent of the amount recovered for all services rendered where counsel had a written contract under which they were entitled to 25 percent of the amount recovered without an appeal, and 331/3 percent of the amount recovered in case of appeal, which contract had been approved by the commission. Nicholas Co. v. Dodson, 232 Miss. 569, 99 So. 2d 666, 1958 Miss. LEXIS 304 (Miss. 1958).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the record disclosed that claimant’s attorneys had been allowed a fee of 25 percent for services rendered to claimant before the attorney-referee, the commission and the circuit court, upon motion, additional attorneys’ fees were allowed in an amount which when added to the 25 percent would equal a total fee of 331/3 percent of the amount recovered, for all services. B. C. Rogers & Sons v. Reeves, 232 Miss. 309, 98 So. 2d 875, 1957 Miss. LEXIS 477 (Miss. 1957).
      </p>
      <p>
       A claimant who was awarded only permanent partial disability benefits, whereas he was entitled to recover temporary total disability benefits until such time as he should recover from an operation and attain maximum recovery, was, upon motion, entitled to an allowance of additional attorney’s fees in an amount not to exceed 331/3 percent of the amount of compensation awarded. Houston Contracting Co. v. Reed, 231 Miss. 213, 95 So. 2d 231, 1957 Miss. LEXIS 507 (Miss. 1957).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where claimant’s attorneys had agreed to represent claimant before the workmen’s compensation commission for a fee in the sum of 25 percent of the total amount of a compensation awarded, and after successfully representing claimant before the commission, the attorneys successfully represented him in the circuit court and supreme court, the attorneys were entitled to a fee which, when added to the 25 percent contracted for, would not exceed the total fee for all services in the case of 331/3 percent of the total recovery that might be had under the award. Jackson Ready-Mix Concrete v. Young, 230 Miss. 644, 93 So. 2d 645, 1957 Miss. LEXIS 405 (Miss. 1957).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a motion filed by a claimant and his attorney asking the supreme court to approve a contract between them, by which the attorney would receive 50 percent of the amount recovered by the claimant, disclosed that the attorney had performed an unusual amount of legal work in a case, the contract was approved so as to allow the attorney a fee of only 331/3 percent of the total amount recovered by the claimant. Mandle v. Kelly, 229 Miss. 327, 92 So. 2d 246, 1957 Miss. LEXIS 303 (Miss. 1957).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where an award to a widow for death benefits was affirmed by the supreme court, the attorney was entitled, as full compensation for all services rendered, to a fee in a sum equal to 331/3 percent of all death benefits which accrued prior to the entry of an order, plus a sum of money equal to a partial lump sum settlement of 331/3 percent of the present value of all future death benefits, such partial lump sum settlement to be determined and computed as provided by Code 1942, § 6998-19(j) and to be deducted from payments last to become due the claimants. Prentiss Truck & Tractor Co. v. Spencer, 228 Miss. 66, 87 So. 2d 272, 88 So. 2d 99, 1956 Miss. LEXIS 486, 1956 Miss. LEXIS 487 (Miss. 1956).
      </p>
      <p>
       Limitation of 25 percent for attorneys fees is not applicable for additional services rendered before superior courts. Sunnyland Contracting Co. v. Davis, 221 Miss. 744, 74 So. 2d 858, 1954 Miss. LEXIS 587 (Miss.), modified, 221 Miss. 744, 75 So. 2d 923, 1954 Miss. LEXIS 589 (Miss. 1954).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where attorneys for claimants of death benefits successfully prosecuted claim before workmen’s compensation commission, the circuit court, and the supreme court, they were entitled to a fee of 331/3 percent of the amount recovered, notwithstanding a contract for a fee of 50 percent. Sunnyland Contracting Co. v. Davis, 221 Miss. 744, 74 So. 2d 858, 1954 Miss. LEXIS 587 (Miss.), modified, 221 Miss. 744, 75 So. 2d 923, 1954 Miss. LEXIS 589 (Miss. 1954).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a workmen’s compensation proceeding the amount of attorney’s fee which amounted to 40 percent of the total compensation award paid to the claimant is fair and just for legal services rendered by the attorney in respect of claim before the commission and for the additional services rendered by the attorney on two appeals. Hill v. United Timber & Lumber Co., 68 So. 2d 420 (Miss. 1953).

      <p>
       Where claimant died during the pending of a suggestion of error before the supreme court, the attorney’s fee is to be figured upon the amount accrued and due at claimant’s death, rather than the full amount of the award in the supreme court’s decision. Oden Constr. Co. v. Tyler, 247 Miss. 21, 153 So. 2d 294, 1963 Miss. LEXIS 278 (Miss. 1963).

       Because the claimants did not apply for workers’ compensation benefits within two years of their injuries, their claims were time-barred by the statute of limitations. Moreover, the employer was not estopped from asserting the statute of limitations as a defense in that the employer did not fail to timely file notice of the claimants’ injury under the reporting statute. McInturff v. Yellow Ry. Corp., — So.3d —, 2019 Miss. App. LEXIS 169 (Miss. Ct. App. Apr. 23, 2019).

Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c03s71-3-35ol11" target="_self">71-3-35(1)</a></cite>, as a defense because the employer failed to comply with the notice requirements of Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c03s71-3-67ol11" target="_self">71-3-67(1)</a></cite>, and the employee testified that he did not file a claim for workers’ compensation because he was under the impression that the employer had filed it for him.

       Worker had missed five days of work due to a work-related injury; therefore, the employer was required to file a notice of injury report, and by not filing the notice, the employer could not rely on the statute of limitations as a defense.

       The circuit court erred in awarding the claimant a penalty under subd (4) of this section where the court, and not the commission, awarded compensation, and the case was remanded to the commission to determine the propriety of awarding the penalty.

       Doctrines of quasi-estoppel and equitable estoppel did not bar a company from denying that a worker was an independent contractor because the worker failed to articulate how he relied to his detriment on any representation by the company to show that it took inconsistent positions and that the company benefitted from any inconsistent position; the company’s failure to file a timely notice of the worker’s injury did not estop it from raising the exclusive remedy provision as a defense.

    Compensation for injuries where third parties are liable.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The acceptance of compensation benefits from or the making of a claim for compensation against an employer or insurer for the injury or death of an employee shall not affect the right of the employee or his dependents to sue any other party at law for such injury or death, but the employer or his insurer shall be entitled to reasonable notice and opportunity to join in any such action or may intervene therein. If such employer or insurer join in such action, they shall be entitled to repayment of the amount paid by them as compensation and medical expenses from the net proceeds of such action (after deducting the reasonable costs of collection) as hereinafter provided.
     </p>
     <p>
      The commencement of an action by an employee or his dependents (or legal representative) against a third party for damages by reason of the injury, or the adjustment of any such claim, shall not affect the right of the injured employee or his dependents (or legal representative) to recover compensation, but any amount recovered by the injured employee or his dependents (or legal representative) from a third party shall be applied as follows: reasonable costs of collection as approved and allowed by the court in which such action is pending, or by the commission of this state in case of settlement without suit, shall be deducted; the remainder, or so much thereof as is necessary, shall be used to discharge the legal liability of the employer or insurer; and any excess shall belong to the injured employee or his dependents. The employee or his dependents bringing suit against the third party must notify the employer or carrier within fifteen (15) days of the filing of such suit.
     </p>
     <p>
      An employer or compensation insurer who shall have paid compensation benefits under this chapter for the injury or death of the employee shall have the right to maintain an action at law against any other party responsible for such injury or death, in the name of such injured employee or his beneficiaries, or in the name of such employer or insurer, or any or all of them. If reasonable notice and opportunity to be represented in such action by counsel shall have been given to the compensation beneficiary, all claims of such compensation beneficiary shall be determined in such action, as well as the claim of the employer or insurer. If recovery shall be had against such other party, by suit or otherwise, the compensation beneficiary shall be entitled to any amount recovered over and above the amount that the employer and insurer shall have paid or are liable for in compensation or other benefits, after deducting the reasonable costs of collection.
     </p>
     <p>
      In case of settlement of any action before the trial thereof, such settlement shall be subject to the approval of the court wherein such action is pending, and settlement before an action is brought shall be subject to the approval of the commission. Distribution of the portion belonging to the dependents shall be made among such dependents in the manner provided in this chapter.
     </p>
     <p>
      In case of liability of the employer or insurer to make payment to the state treasury under the second injury fund provisions, if the injury or death creates a legal liability against a third party, the employer or insurer shall have a right of action against such third party for reimbursement of any sum so paid into the state treasury, which right may be enforced in the action heretofore provided or by an independent action.

   Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c03s71-3-71" target="_self">71-3-71</a></cite> gives a carrier the right to intervene in a related lawsuit and also prevents a covered employee from gaining a double recovery if the employee receives benefits from a third party; however, the ability of a workers’ compensation carrier to recover insurance proceeds has been limited by case law. Miss. Ins. Guar. v. Blakeney, 51 So.3d 208, 2009 Miss. App. LEXIS 870 (Miss. Ct. App. 2009), rev'd, 54 So.3d 203, 2011 Miss. LEXIS 28 (Miss. 2011).

   Where statute containing “benefits coordination” provision allowing employers to decrease workers compensation benefits to disabled employees who are eligible to receive wage loss compensation from other employer-funded sources did not specify whether provisions applied to workers injured prior to its effective date, and to nullify state Supreme Court decision holding that provision applied to such workers, state legislature passed into law statute requiring employers to pay to disabled employees workers compensation benefits that had been withheld in reliance on coordination statute, statute did not violate contract clause by substantially impairing obligation of employment contracts entered into after collective bargaining between employers and employees, nor did it, as result of retroactive payment provision, violate due process clause, since retroactive payment provision was rational means of meeting legitimate legislative purpose of correcting state court decision.

   Because Mississippi Insurance Guaranty Association (MIGA) stepped into the shoes of an insolvent carrier and was bound by the rights, duties, and obligations of the insolvent insurer, it was not entitled to a credit for collection costs under that the insured received from her employer’s uninsured motorist coverage; such recovery was explicitly forbidden under Miss.

       There is no question for the jury to decide with reference to reimbursement of a compensation insurer who intervenes in a personal injury action brought by the compensation beneficiary of amounts paid the plaintiff beneficiary, for it is a matter of law and mandatory on the court alone to provide in its judgment for the distribution of any verdict rendered in strict accordance with this section [Code 1942, § 6998-36], and to grant an instruction which submitted the question of insurer’s right to reimbursement constituted error.

       When recovery is had by a compensation beneficiary from a third-party wrongdoer, the balance of the proceeds remaining after the payment of collection costs shall be used to discharge all the liability of the employer or insurer including that to accrue in the future as well as that already paid or accrued, and where the liability of the employer or insurer is not ascertainable at the time of recovery, the net proceeds of such recovery remaining after payment of collection costs and the reimbursement of the employer or insurer to that date, shall be paid over to the compensation beneficiary, whereupon the employer and insurer are authorized to suspend payment of such compensation benefits as they may be liable for under any provision of the Workmen’s Compensation Law until such suspended benefits equal the amount of a third-party recovery. The employer or insurer’s subrogation rights also extend to any possible death benefits arising in the case. Richardson v.

       In a third-party action brought by an injured employee, it was wrong and an abuse of discretion on the part of the trial judge to allow an attorney’s fee of one third of a manifestly worthless judgment and to provide for the full payment of the fee before the insurance carrier or the injured employee received anything.

       The words “amount recovered” as used in this section [Code 1942, § 6998-36] were intended by the legislature to mean any amount collected, and it was not the legislature’s intention that the attorney representing the injured employee in a third-party action should under any circumstances have the entire amount recovered and that neither the insurance carrier nor the employee should receive anything; and a judgment of the lower court which provided that the employee’s attorneys were entitled to reasonable fees in an amount stated, which sum was to be payable from the first proceeds collected on the judgment, that after payment of the attorney’s fees any further “recovery under said judgment” should be used to discharge the legal liability of the insurance carrier under the Workmen’s Compensation Law, and that if there were “any excess recovered under said judgment” the same should be paid to the injured employee was amended on appeal to allow the attorneys only one-third of any partial payment made on the judgment with the remainder first to be paid to the insurance carrier in reimbursement and the balance thereafter to be paid to the employee.

       If an employee who has previously lost, or lost the use of, one (1) hand, one (1) arm, one (1) foot, one (1) leg, or one (1) eye, becomes permanently and totally incapacitated through the loss, or loss of use, of another member or organ, the employer shall be liable only for the compensation payable for such second injury. In addition to such compensation and after the completion of the payment therefor, the employee shall be paid the remainder of the compensation that would be due for permanent total incapacity, out of a special fund known as the “Second Injury Trust Fund,” and created for such purpose in the following manner:
       <p>
        In every case of compensable death of an employee under this chapter, the employer or, if insured, his insurance carrier shall pay to the commission the sum of Three Hundred Dollars ($300.00) except in cases where there is no dependency, then there shall be paid to the commission the sum of Five Hundred Dollars ($500.00) to be deposited with the State Treasurer for the benefit of said fund. A suspension of said payments of Three Hundred Dollars ($300.00) per death shall be made when the total amount of all such payments, together with the accumulated interest thereon, equals or exceeds Three Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($350,000.00), and no further contributions to said fund shall be made except in cases where there is no dependency. Whenever, thereafter, the amount of such sum shall be reduced below One Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($150,000.00) by reason of payments made pursuant to this section, then such contributions of Three Hundred Dollars ($300.00) per death shall be resumed forthwith and shall continue until such sum, together with accumulated interest thereon, shall again amount to Three Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($350,000.00); and the commission shall direct the distribution thereof.

       Insurance of liability:— An employer liable under this chapter to pay compensation shall insure payment of such compensation by a carrier authorized to insure such liability in this state unless such employer shall be exempted from doing so by the commission.
      </li>
      <li id="t71c03s71-3-75ol12">
       Exemption from insuring:— An employer desiring to be exempt from insuring its liability for compensation shall make application to the commission, showing its financial ability to pay such compensation and agreeing as a condition for the granting of the exemption to faithfully report all injuries under compensation according to law and the requirement of the commission, and to comply with the provisions of this chapter and the rules of the commission pertaining to the administration thereof; whereupon the commission by written order may make such exemption. The commission may from time to time require further statement of financial ability of such employer to pay compensation and may, upon ten (10) days’ notice in writing, for financial reasons or for failure of the employer to faithfully discharge its obligations according to the agreements contained in its application for exemption, revoke the order granting such exemption, in which case such employer shall immediately insure its liability as otherwise required under this chapter. As a condition for the granting of an exemption, the commission shall have authority to require the employer to furnish such security as the commission may consider sufficient to insure payment of all claims of such employer under compensation. State agencies qualified as self-insured status shall not be required to furnish any security to insure or guarantee payment of claims or expenses and shall not be required to establish and maintain reserves for claims incurred but not reported and expenses associated therewith, as a condition for the granting or continuation of an exemption as herein provided. Where the security is in the form of a bond or other personal guaranty, the commission may, at any time either before or after the entry of an award upon at least ten (10) days’ notice and opportunity to be heard, require the sureties to pay the amount of the award, the same to be enforced in like manner as the award itself may be enforced. Where an employer procures an exemption as herein provided and thereafter enters into any form of agreement for insurance coverage with an insurance company or interinsurer not licensed to operate in this state, its conduct shall automatically operate as a revocation of such exemption. An order exempting an employer from insuring its liability for compensation shall be null and void if the application contains a financial statement which is false in any material respect. The commission shall revoke the self-insurance permit if the employer is found to have directly or indirectly induced an employee to forego his right to workers’ compensation benefits.

A self-insured group under this section shall be comprised of employer members of the same bona fide trade association or trade group. Such trade association or trade group shall be domiciled in the State of Mississippi, shall have been in existence for five (5) or more consecutive years as of the date of application for an approved group and shall not be comprised solely of employer members who are affiliates of a person possessing controlling interest in such affiliates.

No such policy shall be subject to nonrenewal, or cancelled by the insurer within the policy period, until a notice in writing shall be given to the commission and to the insured, fixing the date on which it is proposed to cancel it or declaring that the company does not intend to renew the policy upon expiration date. Notice to the insured shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail. Notice to the commission shall be provided in such manner and on such form as the commission may prescribe or direct. No such cancellation or nonrenewal shall be effective until thirty (30) days after the service of such notice on the insured and the provision of notice to the commission, unless the employer has obtained other insurance coverage, in which case such policy shall be deemed cancelled as of the effective date of such other insurance, whether or not such notice has been given. The notice requirements of this section shall not apply when a replacement policy form providing the same or substantially similar coverage is issued by the same insurer, or when transfer of an insured to a licensed affiliate providing the same or substantially similar coverage occurs. Whenever a replacement policy form providing the same or substantially similar coverage is issued by the same insurer, or when a transfer of an insured to a licensed affiliate of the insurer providing the same or substantially similar coverage occurs, documents signed by the insured are applicable to the replacement policy and to coverage being transferred, and remain valid and enforceable.
       <p>
        The insured may also cancel such a policy on the day that the insured either (a) returns the policy to the agent, or (b) signs and delivers to the agent a “lost policy release.” If the insured desires to cancel a policy before the policy has become effective, he may cancel the policy by written notice of cancellation to the agent or company without return of the policy or a release.
       </p>
       <p>
        Whenever a replacement policy form providing the same or substantially similar coverage is issued by the same insurer, or by a licensed affiliate insurer, such insurer shall mail or deliver to the policyholder, at least thirty (30) days in advance of the effective date of renewal, written notice of any terms or conditions that are less favorable to the policyholder.
       </p>
       <p>
        A transferring insurer shall notify the Mississippi Insurance Department and the Mississippi Workers’ Compensation Commission at least forty-five (45) days in advance of notifying a policyholder that its personal or commercial lines insurance policies will be transferred to another licensed insurer within the same insurance group or same holding company. The notice shall include the name of insurer transferring the personal or commercial lines policies and the name and financial rating of the insurer receiving the transferred personal or commercial lines policies.
       </p>
       <p>
        A transferring insurer shall provide the policyholder written notice of the policy transfer at least thirty (30) days prior to expiration of the policy term and shall include the financial rating of the insurer receiving the transferred policy. Such notice must be provided to the policyholder with the notice of renewal premium at least thirty (30) days before the effective date of the transfer.

       In any case where the employer is not a self-insurer, in order that the liability for compensation imposed by this chapter may be most effectively discharged by the employer and in order that the administration of this chapter in respect of such liability may be facilitated, the commission shall by regulation provide for the discharge, by the carrier or carriers for such employer, of such obligations and duties of the employer in respect of such liability imposed by this chapter upon the employer as it considers proper in order to effectuate the provisions of this chapter. For such purpose (a) notice to or knowledge of an employer of the occurrence of the injury shall be notice to or knowledge of the carrier or carriers; (b) jurisdiction of the employer by the commission or any court under this chapter shall be jurisdiction of the carrier or carriers; and (c) any requirement by the commission or any court under any compensation order, finding, or decision shall be binding upon the carrier or carriers in the same manner and to the same extent as upon the employer.

         “Affiliate transfer” is when an insurer transfers, at renewal or policy expiration, its personal or commercial lines insurance policies to an affiliated licensed insurer that is a member of the same insurance group or same holding company as the transferring insurer. The issuance of a replacement policy form providing the same or substantially similar coverage issued by the same insurer, or the transfer of personal or commercial insurance policies to a licensed affiliate insurer that will issue the same or substantially similar policy, are considered a renewal and will not be treated as a cancellation or nonrenewal. The affiliate transfer must be to a licensed affiliate insurer that has been determined by the commissioner to have the same or better financial strength as the transferring insurer. The policy transfer must be selected on a nondiscriminatory basis.

       Statute does not apply to situations in which a policy expires for failure to pay a premium in a timely manner. Amfed Nat'l Ins. Co. v. NTC Transp., Inc., 196 So.3d 947, 2016 Miss. LEXIS 318 (Miss. 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       It was error to affirm an order granting an employer summary judgment because the employer failed to establish that it had coverage in effect at the time of an employee’s injury; the statute was inapplicable because the insurer did not cancel the employer’s policy or intend to renew the policy. Amfed Nat'l Ins. Co. v. NTC Transp., Inc., 196 So.3d 947, 2016 Miss. LEXIS 318 (Miss. 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no support in the Mississippi Workers’ Compensation Act, or in the case law, for the proposition that an employer which itself is free of any wrongdoing can be held liable on an alter-ego theory for its workers’ compensation carrier’s bad faith failure to pay benefits; the law, in fact, is to the contrary. Toney v. Lowery Woodyards, 278 F. Supp. 2d 786, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14180 (S.D. Miss. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       Under Mississippi law, carrier which provided workers’ compensation insurance both to claimant’s employer and claimant’s alleged borrowing employer had no legitimate or arguable reason to initially deny benefits, and thus was liable for bad faith denial, notwithstanding its arguments that it had independent legitimate reasons, including dispute over whether each insured was claimant’s employer, not to pay under either policy; such reasons were irrelevant given that statutory requirements were met such that carrier had obligation to promptly pay benefits regardless of which of its insureds was claimant’s employer. Rogers v. Hartford Accident & Indem. Co., 133 F.3d 309, 1998 U.S. App. LEXIS 442 (5th Cir. Miss. 1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       Under Mississippi law, when employer has knowledge of workers’ compensation claimant’s injury, formal notice to employer of occurrence of injury is not needed to trigger carrier’s obligation to provide benefits, and this knowledge is imputed to carrier without any formal notification to carrier. Rogers v. Hartford Accident & Indem. Co., 133 F.3d 309, 1998 U.S. App. LEXIS 442 (5th Cir. Miss. 1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       The provisions of this section [Code 1942, § 6998-39] with reference to the force and effect of insurance provided for under the Workmen’s Compensation Law has no application to a case where the supreme court had held that the employers, at the time of claimant’s injury, were not under the Workmen's Compensation Law. Eaton v. Joe N. Miles & Sons, 238 Miss. 605, 119 So. 2d 359, 1960 Miss. LEXIS 444 (Miss. 1960).

       The applicable provisions of the Workmen’s Compensation Law are automatically written into insurance policy by operation of the law. National Surety Corp. v. Kemp, 217 Miss. 537, 65 So. 2d 840, 1953 Miss. LEXIS 463 (Miss. 1953).

       In view of the common-law rule, which was not changed by the Workmen’s Compensation Law, that partners are jointly and severally liable for partnership obligations, and the provisions of this section [Code 1942, § 6998-39], a carrier which had written a compensation policy for one of the partners in the partnership was liable for compensation benefits to the partnership employee. United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co. v. Collins, 231 Miss. 319, 95 So. 2d 456, 1957 Miss. LEXIS 516, 1957 Miss. LEXIS 517 (Miss. 1957).
      </p>
      <p>
       Since a compensation policy secured in his own behalf by one of the members of a partnership doing subcontracting work covered the compensation rights of injured partnership employee, the secondary liability of the prime contractor and its carrier did not take effect as a direct obligation, upon the ground that the partnership failed to secure coverage of its employees. United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co. v. Collins, 231 Miss. 319, 95 So. 2d 456, 1957 Miss. LEXIS 516, 1957 Miss. LEXIS 517 (Miss. 1957).

Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c03s71-3-77ol11b" target="_self">71-3-77 (1)(b)</a></cite>; under this section, a workers’ compensation insurer must give the insured 30 days notice of intent to cancel a policy unless the insured signs and delivers a lost policy release.

       An insurer achieved an effective policy cancellation, notwithstanding that the notice of cancellation was not sent by registered mail as required by the statute, where the employer obtained other insurance coverage with another insurance carrier through its alter ego.

Arender v. National Sales, Inc., 193 So. 2d 579, 1966 Miss. LEXIS 1289, 1967 Miss. LEXIS 1552 (Miss. 1966).

       Workers’ Compensation Act applied to an employer because it had at least five employees at the time of a workers’ injury; there was no evidence that any of the employer’s officers had elected to opt out of coverage in writing, and thus, they acted as employees and counted as employees for coverage purposes.

       Where an insured had formed a partnership upon the advice of the insurer’s agent in order to obtain assigned risk workmen’s compensation insurance, and he had informed the agent of a prior heart attack as his reason for requiring risk insurance, and the policy issued named the insured as an active partner and imposed an 8 percent surcharge on account of the risk, the failure of the insurer through its agent, to notify the insured that it would not write the assigned risk policy, instead issuing a policy purporting to comply with the explicit requirements of the application, changing the position of the insured to his detriment, and where the insurer continued to accept premiums and surcharges, the insurer was estopped from pleading that the insured was ineligible to recover benefits when he suffered a heart attack 5 years after the policy was issued, notwithstanding the absence of a partnership indorsement on the policy.

       Res judicata did not bar enforcing a workers’ compensation judgment against a corporate employer’s president, despite not being a named party in the suit awarding compensation, because (1) the president was statutorily liable for the employer’s failure to secure compensation and compensate the employee, and (2) the judgment was tantamount to a judgment against the president as the president controlled the prior suit and was the employer’s alter ego, nor did this violate due process, as the president’s interests were aligned with the employer.

The governor shall appoint the members of the commission, by and with the consent of the Mississippi State Senate, one (1) for a term of two (2) years, one (1) for a term of four (4) years, and one (1) for a term of six (6) years. Upon the expiration of each term as above set forth, the governor shall appoint a successor for a term of six (6) years, and thereafter the term of office of each commissioner shall be for six (6) years. One (1) member shall be a person who by reason of his previous vocation or affiliation can be classed as a representative of employers, and one (1) member shall be a person who by reason of his previous vocation or affiliation can be classed as a representative of employees. One (1) member shall be an attorney at law of recognized ability with at least five (5) years’ active practice in Mississippi prior to his appointment. The governor shall designate the chairman of the commission, whose term of chairman shall run concurrently with his appointment as a commissioner.
       <p>
        The chairman shall be the administrative head of the commission and shall have the final authority in all matters relating to assignment of cases for hearing and trial and the administrative work of the commission and its employees, except in the promulgation of rules and regulations wherein the commission shall act as a body, and in the trial and determination of cases as otherwise provided.

       <p>
        Upon the expiration of the term of a commissioner, he shall continue to serve until his successor has been appointed. Because cumulative experience is conspicuously essential to the proper administration of a workmen’s compensation law, it is declared to be in the public interest to continue workmen’s compensation commissioners in office as long as efficiency is demonstrated. A commissioner may be removed for cause prior to the expiration of his term, but shall be furnished a written copy of the charges against him and shall be accorded a public hearing.

The authority of the commission and its duly authorized representatives to investigate and determine claims for compensation shall include the right to enter the premises where an injury occurred, to ascertain its causes and circumstances.

       The office of the commission shall be situated in the City of Jackson, but hearings may be held at such places as it may deem most convenient for the proper and speedy performance of its duties.

       Language in appropriation bills, which appropriate money to the Workers’ Compensation Commission for salaries, wages, and benefits and directs that they be expended “in compliance with the policies established by the State Personnel Board and conditions placed on such expenditures,” reflects legislative intent that the Workers’ Compensation Commission abide by the personnel rules and regulations of the State Personnel Board rather than its own rules.

       There was substantial evidence to support the decision of the Mississippi Workers’ Compensation Commission to affirm the administrative law judge’s (AJ) decision to deny an employee disability benefits because the AJ, acting under the authority of the Commission, was entitled to rely on his personal experience in making reasonable inferences and in his determination to deny benefits.

       An administrative law judge, as affirmed by the Workers’ Compensation Commission and the circuit court, erred as a matter of law when he specifically stated that a hearing on an injured employee’s motion to consider the need for additional medical treatment at the employer’s expense under General Rule 9 was limited to whether the employee was suffering from improper medical treatment or lack of medical treatment, and then proceeded to make findings on maximum medical recovery and apportionment; an administrative law judge may not announce a limited purpose of a hearing, require the litigants to argue under limitation, and then decide the whole of the case including the time of maximum recovery apportionment and compensation.

This amount may be assessed as a specific amount or as a percentage of gross claims for compensation and medical supplies and services paid by the insurance carriers and self-insurers as the commission may direct, and shall be such amount as shall be reasonably necessary to defray the necessary expense of such administration.

   An employee who was not hired in Mississippi, did no work in that state, nor was injured therein cannot claim the benefits of the Mississippi Workmen’s Compensation Law, for either hiring or regular employment in the state is essential to recovery under this section [Code 1942, § 6998-55]. L. &amp; A. Constr. Co. v. McCharen, 198 So. 2d 240, 1967 Miss. LEXIS 1256 (Miss.), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">389 U.S. 945</cite>, <cite class="s_court">88 S. Ct. 310</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">19 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 301, 1967 U.S. LEXIS 428 (U.S. 1967).
      </p>
      <p>
       It is not essential that the accident occurs in Mississippi in order to allow the Mississippi Workmen’s Compensation Law to operate. Burnham Van Service, Inc. v. Dependents of Moore, 250 Miss. 165, 164 So. 2d 733, 1964 Miss. LEXIS 453 (Miss. 1964).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Mississippi Workmen’s Compensation Law was adopted in the exercise of the state’s police power to provide for the welfare of its citizens and others performing labor within its borders, and the subject matter is one upon which the state is competent to legislate. Mandle v. Kelly, 229 Miss. 327, 92 So. 2d 246, 1957 Miss. LEXIS 303 (Miss. 1957).
      </p>

       The full faith and credit clause does not go so far as to require a state to withhold the application of its workmen’s compensation laws because they conflict with the workmen’s compensation laws of another state.

       Since the exemption in subsection (c) of this section [Code 1942, § 6998-55] was not applicable where an employee, employed in Georgia, sustained a disability while operating his employer’s truck upon Mississippi highways and had received extensive medical treatment within the state for which payment had not been received, the Mississippi Workmen’s Compensation Law applied, notwithstanding the Georgia employer’s contention that the application of the Law would violate the full faith and credit clause of the United States Constitution, would constitute an interference with, or impairment of, the right to contract, and would interfere with interstate commerce. Mandle v. Kelly, 229 Miss. 327, 92 So. 2d 246, 1957 Miss. LEXIS 303 (Miss. 1957).
      </p>
      <p>
       The exemption provided in subsection (c) of this section [Code 1942, § 6998-55] was inapplicable where an employee, employed in Georgia, was injured while temporarily in Mississippi doing work for his employer, and the Georgia Workmen’s Compensation Act was silent as to the extra-territorial provisions of the workmen’s compensation of other states, and there was no provision for exempting from its application employees and employers when the employee had been hired and was regularly employed outside of Georgia, and such employee was injured while temporarily within Georgia doing work for his employer. Mandle v. Kelly, 229 Miss. 327, 92 So. 2d 246, 1957 Miss. LEXIS 303 (Miss. 1957).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where, under the law of Georgia where its contract was made, the workmen’s compensation carrier was not obligated to pay to any person any benefit under any compensation law except the Georgia act, the liability of the carrier could not be extended by application of the Mississippi Workmen’s Compensation Law contrary to the express terms of the policy, since to do so would violate the due process clause of the United States Constitution. Mandle v. Kelly, 229 Miss. 327, 92 So. 2d 246, 1957 Miss. LEXIS 303 (Miss. 1957).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where an employee who was hired in Louisiana sustained injuries in Mississippi, compensation was properly awarded under the Workmen’s Compensation Law despite the fact that Louisiana’s workmen’s compensation law was given an extra-territorial effect by the courts of that state and it was purported to be an exclusive remedy, where it was not shown that employee would have an available remedy for his injury. La Dew v. La Borde, 216 Miss. 598, 63 So. 2d 56, 1953 Miss. LEXIS 674 (Miss. 1953).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the Workmen’s Compensation Law provides that employee regularly employed outside of the state, receiving injury when in state temporarily, shall be exempt if covered under the law of the state of hiring and is covered by that state under extra-territorial provisions, this provision did not exempt an employee hired in Louisiana where it was not shown that the compensation act would be given extra-territorial recognition by Louisiana.

       Notwithstanding that the employment contract was accepted by the employer in another state and that the fatal injury was sustained by the employee while out of the state, the Mississippi Workmen’s Compensation Law applied where it was shown that the employee truck driver was a Mississippi resident, the employment contract was initiated in Mississippi, and that the employee’s base of operations was in Burnham Van Service, Inc. v.

       An employee hired and regularly employed in Mississippi is entitled to compensation under the Mississippi Workmen’s Compensation Law for injuries received while temporarily working in another state for his Mississippi employer.

       An employer and his insurer are estopped to deny coverage of an employee temporarily working out of the state for more than six months, where the employer agreed to continue coverage but failed to give the commission notice of extension, and reinsurance obtained by the insurer was in effect at the employee’s death. Dependents of Dawson v. Delta Western Exploration Co., 245 Miss. 335, 147 So. 2d 485, 1962 Miss. LEXIS 556 (Miss. 1962).

Houston Contracting Co. v. Reed, 231 Miss. 213, 95 So. 2d 231, 1957 Miss. LEXIS 507 (Miss. 1957).

Winborn v. R. B. Tyler Co., 231 Miss. 166, 94 So. 2d 340, 1957 Miss. LEXIS 501 (Miss. 1957).

       Mississippi Workers’ Compensation Commission lacked jurisdiction when a claimant, who was living in Mississippi, was injured in an automobile accident in Texas while working as a truck driver for a company located in Texas because the claimant was not temporarily working outside of Mississippi. The claimant’s departure from Mississippi was caused by a permanent assignment in Texas, and the claimant’s only contact with Mississippi consisted of communications with the company when the claimant was in Mississippi and seeking employment. Stewart v. Dynamic Envtl. Servs., LLC, 245 So.3d 543, 2018 Miss. App. LEXIS 31 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, — So.3d —, 2018 Miss. LEXIS 289 (Miss. 2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       In considering the application of subsection (b) of this section [Code 1942, § 6998-55], the question is not whether the departure from Mississippi was temporary or permanent but whether the assignment or transfer elsewhere was temporary or permanent, i. e., the determinative fact is whether the assignment or transfer elsewhere was permanent, not whether claimant had any reasonable expectation of returning to Mississippi in his employment with the employer. Winborn v. R. B. Tyler Co., 231 Miss. 166, 94 So. 2d 340, 1957 Miss. LEXIS 501 (Miss. 1957).

   Facts were undeveloped, precluding the courts from determining whether plaintiff’s claims, as alleged in its complaint, could be pursued only under the Mississippi Tort Claims Act, as ordered by the trial court, and plaintiff could not pursue a cause of action as contemplated by Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c03s71-3-151" target="_self">71-3-151</a></cite> et seq, or otherwise.

     <p>
      The purpose of Sections 71-3-151 through 71-3-181 is to provide a mechanism for the payment of the covered claims under the Workers’ Compensation Law, to avoid excessive delay in payment and to avoid financial loss to claimants because of the insolvency of a self-insurer, to assist in the detection and prevention of self-insurer insolvencies, and to provide associations to assess the cost of such protection among self-insurers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Sections 71-3-151 through 71-3-181 shall apply to all employers who are self-insurers under the provisions of Section 71-3-75, Mississippi Code of 1972.

The assessments of each individual self-insurer and each group self-insurer shall be two percent (2%) of the gross paid compensation and medical supplies and services of said member self-insurer during each period of six (6) months. Said two percent (2%) assessment shall be collected by the commission at the same time as and pursuant to the procedures adopted by the commission pursuant to Section 71-3-99, Mississippi Code of 1972. If the obligations of the individual association incurred on or after July 1, 2004, for covered claims arising before July 1, 2004, plus necessary expenses of the individual association incurred on or after July 1, 2004, in evaluating, adjusting, defending or settling such covered claims, exceed the total amount of funds held by the individual association on July 1, 2004, then and to that extent all individual employers and groups of employers who were self-insurers on the dates that the covered claims arose shall be liable for a special assessment in the amount of such deficiency. This special assessment shall be collected by the commission in accordance with the procedures adopted by the commission under Section 71-3-99. All obligations for covered claims arising on or after July 1, 2004, shall be the sole obligation of the association to which the self-insurer in default belongs. The two percent (2%) assessment on each individual self-insurer and on each group self-insurer shall be collected by the commission until the sum of Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000.00) is accumulated by the individual association and the sum of One Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) is accumulated by the group association. At that time the assessments shall be suspended. However, any employer that becomes authorized under Section 71-3-75 to be a member self-insurer after July 1, 1996, is not entitled to have the two percent (2%) assessment suspended until such member self-insurer has contributed to the guaranty fund to which it belongs for the first four (4) years such employer is a member self-insurer regardless of the amount in the guaranty fund of the association to which it belongs. The two percent (2%) assessment shall be reinstituted for all member self-insurers of the individual association at any time that the guaranty fund balance of the individual association reaches One Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($1,500,000.00) and such assessment shall continue until such time as the balance is Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000.00). The two percent (2%) assessment shall be reinstituted for all member self-insurers of the group association at any time that the guaranty fund balance of the group association reaches Seven Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($750,000.00) and such assessment shall continue until such time as the balance is One Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00). If the maximum assessment, together with the other assets of an association, does not provide in any one (1) year an amount sufficient to make all necessary payments, the funds available in such association shall be paid as directed by the commission and any unpaid portion shall be paid as soon thereafter as funds in such association become available. When the guaranty fund balance of the group association reaches One Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00), the commission may waive the need for bonding requirements for self-funded pools.

       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       Workers’ Compensation Group Self-Insurer Guaranty Association (GGA) had the authority to assess the Mississippi Manufacturers Association Workers’ Compensation Group because the assessment was levied within three years of its withdrawal from the GGA; therefore, the assessment was consistent with the GGA’s plan of operation and was a valid exercise of the Workers’ Compensation Commission’s regulatory authority under the Workers’ Compensation Self-insurer Guaranty Association Law. Miss. Mfrs. Ass'n Workers' Comp. Grp. v. Miss. Workers' Comp. Group Self-Insurer Guar. Ass'n, — So.3d —, 2019 Miss. App. LEXIS 45 (Miss. Ct. App. Jan. 29, 2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       Plain language of the statute prohibited the assessment imposed upon the Mississippi Manufacturers Association Workers’ Compensation Group because there was nothing to show that the Workers’ Compensation Group Self-Insurer Guaranty Association’s (GGA) fund balance ever declined to $ 750,000; because the statute prohibited the assessment, the GGA’s plan of operation could not provide authority for the assessment. Miss. Mfrs. Ass'n Workers' Comp. Grp. v. Miss. Workers' Comp. Group Self-Insurer Guar. Ass'n, — So.3d —, 2019 Miss. App. LEXIS 45 (Miss. Ct. App. Jan. 29, 2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       Once assessments “shall be suspended” by operation of the statute, the assessments may be reinstituted only in accordance with the statute; that is, under the statute, the Workers’ Compensation Group Self-Insurer Guaranty Association lacks authority to reinstitute assessments unless the fund balance actually declines to $750,000. Miss. Mfrs. Ass'n Workers' Comp. Grp. v. Miss. Workers' Comp. Group Self-Insurer Guar. Ass'n, — So.3d —, 2019 Miss. App. LEXIS 45 (Miss. Ct. App. Jan. 29, 2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       Mississippi Workers’ Compensation Commission has authority to regulate self-insurers and their guaranty associations and to administer the provisions of the statute; however, the Commission cannot exercise its authority in a manner contrary to the terms of an applicable statute; although the Commission approved the Workers’ Compensation Group Self-Insurer Guaranty Association’s plan of operation, that provision is invalid to the extent that it is contrary to the plain language of the statute. Miss. Mfrs. Ass'n Workers' Comp. Grp. v. Miss. Workers' Comp. Group Self-Insurer Guar. Ass'n, — So.3d —, 2019 Miss. App. LEXIS 45 (Miss. Ct. App. Jan. 29, 2019).

    Examination of association members; powers and duties of the board of directors; detection and prevention of insolvency of members of association.

     </h3>
     <p>
      To aid in the detection and prevention of individual self-insurer insolvencies and group self-insurer insolvencies:
     </p>
     <p>
      The board of directors of an association may, upon majority vote, request that the commission order an examination of any of its member self-insurers and group self-insurers which the board in good faith believes may be in a financial condition hazardous to the potential claimants or the public. Upon making any such request to the commission, such board of directors shall recommend for commission approval persons to perform the examination. The examination shall commence within thirty (30) days following the commission’s approval of such request for examination. The commission may request a board of directors to recommend for commission approval, and a board of directors can request the commission to approve, alternative persons to complete an examination if it is believed the examination is not being performed in a timely and efficient manner. The cost of such examination shall be paid by the association requesting such examination, and examination reports shall be forwarded to the commission and treated as are other examination reports. In no event shall reports of such examination be released to the board of directors of such association prior to release to the public, but this shall not preclude the commission from complying with paragraph (b) of this section. The commission shall notify the board of directors of such association when the examination is completed. Each request for an examination by an association shall be kept on file by the commission, but it shall not be open to public inspection prior to the release of an examination report to the public.
     </p>
     <p>
      It shall be the duty of the commission to report to the board of directors of an association when it has reasonable cause to believe that any member self-insurer or group self-insurer examined or being examined at the request of the board of directors of such association may be insolvent or in a financial condition hazardous to potential claimants or the public.
     </p>
     <p>
      The board of directors of an association may, upon majority vote, make reports and recommendations to the commission upon any matter germane to the solvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of any of its member self-insurer s and group self-insurers. Such reports and recommendations shall not be considered public documents.
     </p>
     <p>
      The board of directors of an association may, upon majority vote, make recommendations to the commission for the detection and prevention of member self-insurer insolvencies and group self-insurer insolvencies.
     </p>
     <p>
      The board of directors of an association shall, at the conclusion of any insolvency, bankruptcy case or default where such association was obligated to pay covered claims, prepare a report on the history and causes of such insolvency and bankruptcy, based on the information available to such association, and submit such report to the commission.

     </h3>
     <p>
      If an association assumes any obligations of an individual self-insurer or group self-insurer under this chapter, and payments of such obligations exceed the assets of such association, such association shall within not less than sixty (60) days thereafter submit for approval by the commission a plan for special assessment of each individual self-insurer and group self-insurer who may be responsible for payment of such obligations in excess of the assets of such association. Such plan for special assessment shall also include the expenses of such association related to the processing of obligations covered by the special assessment plan. Failure to comply with a commission-approved special assessment plan of an association shall create a cause of action in favor of such association against any noncompliant member self-insurer and any noncompliant group self-insurer for recovery of payments and expenses by such association for which the noncompliant member self-insurer or noncompliant group self-insurer should have been obligated. It shall be presumed that all obligations paid by an association pursuant to a commission-approved special assessment plan, including, but not limited to, expenses associated with processing such obligations, are reasonable, necessary and otherwise in compliance with the requirements of this chapter. There shall be added to any recovery under this section expenses of litigation of such association related to such cause of action, interest at the rate of eight percent (8%) per annum beginning on the date of such noncompliance and a ten percent (10%) penalty.

       Economic insecurity due to involuntary unemployment is the menace and evil that the legislature attempted to overcome and conquer when it enacted the Mississippi Employment Sec. Com. v. B. C. Rogers & Sons, Inc., 193 So. 2d 564, 1967 Miss. LEXIS 1549 (Miss. 1967).

    Public policy.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      As a guide to the interpretation and application of this chapter, the public policy of this state is declared to be as follows: Economic insecurity due to unemployment is a serious menace to the health, morals, and welfare of the people of this state. Involuntary unemployment is therefore a subject of general interest and concern which requires appropriate action by the legislature to prevent its spread and to lighten its burden, which now so often falls with crushing force upon the unemployed worker and his family. The achievement of social security requires protection against this greatest hazard of our economic life. This can be provided by encouraging employers to provide more stable employment and by the systematic accumulation of funds during periods of employment to provide benefits for periods of unemployment, thus maintaining purchasing power and limiting the serious social consequences of poor relief assistance. The legislature, therefore, declares that in its considered judgment the public good and the general welfare of the citizens of this state require the enactment of this measure, under the police powers of the state, for the compulsory setting aside of unemployment reserves to be used for the benefit of persons unemployed through no fault of their own.

   An unemployment compensation claimant was not entitled to benefits since excessive garnishments upon his wages constituted “misconduct” connected with his work under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c05s71-5-513ol1A2" target="_self">71-5-513(A)(2)</a></cite>, in accordance with the public policy stated in §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c05s71-5-3" target="_self">71-5-3</a></cite>, the implementation of which is accomplished through contributions of all covered employers into the state employment fund pursuant to §§

       A claimant who voluntarily left her employment as a cook in a restaurant was entitled to benefits where her work hours had been reduced by her employer approximately 50 percent, below the cost of hiring an individual to care for her children while she worked.

      </p>

       An employee was not entitled to unemployment compensation benefits where he admitted that he had quit because in his opinion the volume of his employer’s work had not been sufficient for his satisfaction.

       The unemployment compensation law provides for a trust fund, to be withheld from the state treasury, and hence does not violate or come within the state constitution governing the passage and duration of appropriation laws.

       Section 71-5-513(A)(4), which disqualifies an unemployed worker from receiving unemployment compensation benefits when the unemployment is “due to a stoppage of work which exists because of a labor dispute,” only applies to the period that the employee is out because of a stoppage of work due to a labor dispute in which the employee chose to leave the job; it has no application to the period beginning when the employee returns to work in good faith only to find that the employer has replaced him or her solely because of the labor dispute, since the employee is then out of work because of something over which he or she has no control.

      </p>
      <p>
       The voluntary retirement of an employee who remained available for suitable work disqualified her for unemployment benefits, even though the retirement was induced by the fact that the retirement benefits far exceeded her earnings from the 2 hours per week that she was permitted to work, where the employee had worked 2 to 4 hours per week for several years, and though she was told that her hours might be cut back, she was never told that they were going to be cut; since there was no change in the employee’s employment status, there was no evidence that any good cause factor played a role in her decision to relinquish her employment.

      </p>
      <p>
       In an action by an employer against the Mississippi Employment Security Commission (now Department of Employment Security) challenging a ruling that employees were entitled to unemployment benefits as the result of an unjustified lockout by the employer, the circuit court erred in reversing the decision of the Commission where there was substantial evidence to support the finding that the lockout was occasioned solely by the employer and was without justification and that the employees were ready and willing to continue working.

      </p>
      <p>
       The benefits of the unemployment compensation law are for the use of persons unemployed through no fault of their own; to be eligible for benefits under the law, the unemployment must be involuntary.

    Suspension under federal conditions [Repealed effective July 1, 2023].

     </h3>
     <p>
      The Legislature finds and declares that the existence and continued operation of a federal tax upon employers, against which some portion of the contributions required under this chapter may be credited, will protect Mississippi employers from undue disadvantages in their competition with employers in other states. If at any time, upon a formal complaint to the Governor, he shall find that Title IX of the Social Security Act has been amended or repealed by Congress or has been held unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of the United States, and that, as a result thereof, the provisions of this chapter requiring Mississippi employers to pay contributions will subject them to a serious competitive disadvantage in relation to employers in other states, he shall publish such findings and proclaim that the operation of the provisions of this chapter requiring the payment of contributions and benefits shall be suspended for a period of not more than six (6) months. The Department of Employment Security shall thereupon requisition from the Unemployment Trust Fund all monies therein standing to its credit, and shall deposit such monies, together with any other monies in the Unemployment Compensation Fund, as a special fund in any banks or public depositories in this state in which general funds of the state may be deposited.
     </p>
     <p>
      In all other cases, and unless the Governor shall issue such proclamation, this chapter shall remain in full force and effect.

      If at any time the provisions of this chapter requiring the payment of contributions and benefits shall be held invalid under the Constitution of this state by the Supreme Court of this state or invalid under the United States Constitution by the Supreme Court of the United States, the department shall forthwith requisition from the unemployment trust fund all monies therein standing to the credit of the department, and shall deposit such monies, together with any other monies in the unemployment compensation fund, in any banks or public depositories in this state in which general funds of the state may be deposited. If within six (6) months after the date of such decision the Legislature of this state enacts a new unemployment compensation law, such monies shall be paid into the unemployment compensation fund established thereunder. If within such six-month period the Legislature of this state has not enacted a new unemployment compensation law, the department shall, under regulations prescribed by it, refund, without interest, to each employer by whom contributions have been paid, his pro rata share of the total contributions paid under this chapter. Any interest or earnings of the fund shall be available to the department to pay for the costs of making such refunds. The provisions of this chapter, so far as necessary to the execution by the department of the duties prescribed in this section and to the performance of such other acts as are incidental to the termination of its duties under this chapter, shall remain in full force and effect until the completion thereof.

   A laid off employee was improperly denied unemployment compensation for the two week period following his receipt of a lump sum vacation payment since, pursuant to this section, no wages were payable to the employee, in that he had performed no services for his former employer during the two weeks; the vacation pay flowed from services rendered prior to termination of his employment. Further, an administrative rule which provided that pay received after separation from an employer was considered to be “wages,” was inconsistent with the legislative definition of “unemployment,” and exceeded the powers granted the Commission by §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c05s71-5-115" target="_self">71-5-115</a></cite>.

       Contributions levied by the Mississippi Employment Security Commission (now Department of Employments Security) constitute an excise tax, and the statute authorizing the levying of the same is to be construed liberally in favor of the taxpayer and strictly against the taxing power, and all doubts are to be resolved in favor of the taxpayer.

      <p>
       In view of the language used in paragraphs, h, i, and n, under this section [Code 1942, § 7440], it is clear from the whole contract that the service which is to be performed for wages in the ordinary sense was to be under a contract of hire, and that if the compensation was to be paid in salaries or commissions it was likewise to be payable for the services rendered under a contract of hire. Texas Co. v. Wheeless, 185 Miss. 799, 187 So. 880, 1939 Miss. LEXIS 151 (Miss. 1939).

       A contract between an oil company and a distributor or consignee of its petroleum products at wholesale was not a “contract for hire” within the purview of the statute, so as to render such oil company liable for contributions under the statute as an employer of such distributor and the latter’s employees, where all of the provisions of the contract were such as would be implied by law, in the absence of express stipulations, in any agreement whereby one sells the goods of another as a consignee, factor, commission merchant, or otherwise on commission, and the contract did not show the existence of the relationship of master and servant, and particularly in view of the fact that most of the distributors of petroleum products were of a class of capitalists and investors engaged in other businesses, whom the statute was not designed to help. Texas Co. v. Wheeless, 185 Miss. 799, 187 So. 880, 1939 Miss. LEXIS 151 (Miss. 1939).

       Claimant was obligated to repay an overpayment of unemployment compensation benefits because the claimant voluntarily relocated to another state but was paid benefits for two weeks following the departure. Jackson v. Miss. Dep't of Empl. Sec., 134 So.3d 379, 2014 Miss. App. LEXIS 124 (Miss. Ct. App. 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       Mississippi Department of Employment Security was not entitled to use collection actions to recover unemployment benefits paid where there was no nondisclosure or fraud in the case of an employee who was later disqualified for misconduct; even if voluntary repayment was allowed, the language of the notice to the employee did not suggest that it was voluntary in nature. Acy v. Miss. Empl. Sec. Comm'n, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 54 (Miss. Ct. App. Feb. 6, 2007), sub. op., op. withdrawn, 960 So. 2d 592, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 469 (Miss. Ct. App. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>

   Employee admitted she voluntarily left her job in Mississippi to pursue educational opportunities. Thus, pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c05s71-5-513" target="_self">71-5-513</a></cite> A(1)(a) she was not entitled to unemployment benefits, and under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c05s71-5-19ol14" target="_self">71-5-19(4)</a></cite>, she was obligated to repay said benefits that she was not entitled to. Westbrook v. Miss. Empl. Sec. Comm'n, 910 So. 2d 1135, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 203 (Miss. Ct. App. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Although Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c05s71-5-19ol14" target="_self">71-5-19(4)</a></cite> clearly gave the Mississippi Employment Security Commission (MESC) (now Department of Employment Security) the right to seek full repayment and there was not a requirement of any fraudulent intent in order to do so, the MESC’s decision to seek full repayment of unemployment benefits was arbitrary and capricious, because the claimant’s failure to testify did not amount to fraud. Miss. Empl. Sec. Comm'n v. Jones, 826 So. 2d 77, 2002 Miss. LEXIS 284 (Miss. 2002).
      </p>
      <p>
       As there was no fraud committed by former employee in seeking unemployment benefits, the Mississippi Employment Security Commission (now Department of Employment Security) could not pursue active collection measures against the employee for benefits that were paid but later revoked. Caraway v. Miss. Empl. Sec. Comm'n, 826 So. 2d 100, 2002 Miss. App. LEXIS 483 (Miss. Ct. App. 2002).
      </p>

   Unemployment benefits paid to company employees during a strike could not be recouped by the Mississippi Employment Security Commission (now Department of Employment Security) as a result of a monetary settlement of unfair labor practice charges before the National Labor Relations Board, since §§<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c05s71-5-19ol14" target="_self">71-5-19(4)</a></cite> and<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c05s71-5-517" target="_self">71-5-517</a></cite> provided no basis, implicit or explicit, for recoupment of the benefits where there was no evidence of wrongdoing or misrepresentation by the employees. Jones v. Mississippi Employment Sec. Comm'n, 648 So. 2d 1138, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 14 (Miss. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       Findings by Board of Review of Employment Security Commission (now Department of Employment Security) that claimant was overpaid because of error in initial evaluation of claim was determination of fact which should not be reversed by circuit court since it was supported by substantial evidence, but question whether overpayment could be collected was not passed upon by referee or Board, and thus court should not pass upon questions of law not determined by administrative agencies. Mississippi Employment Sec. Com. v. Sellers, 505 So. 2d 281, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2480 (Miss. 1987).

    Special employment security administration fund [Repealed effective July 1, 2023].
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      There is created in the State Treasury a special fund, to be known as the “Special Employment Security Administration Fund,” into which shall be deposited or transferred all interest, penalties and damages collected on and after July 1, 1982, pursuant to Sections 71-5-363 through 71-5-379 and all interest and penalties required to be deposited into the fund pursuant to Section 71-5-19(4)(b). Interest, penalties and damages collected on delinquent payments deposited during any calendar quarter in the clearing account in the Unemployment Trust Fund shall, as soon as practicable after the close of such calendar quarter, be transferred to the Special Employment Security Administration Fund. All monies in this fund shall be deposited, administered and disbursed in the same manner and under the same conditions and requirements as is provided by law for other special funds in the State Treasury. The State Treasurer shall be liable on his official bond for the faithful performance of his duties in connection with the Special Employment Security Administration Fund under this chapter. Those monies may be expended for any programs for which the department has administrative responsibility but shall not be expended or made available for expenditure in any manner which would permit their substitution for (or permit a corresponding reduction in) federal funds which would, in the absence of those monies, be available to finance expenditures for the administration of the state unemployment compensation and employment service laws or any other laws directing the administration of any programs for which the department has the administrative responsibility. Nothing in this section shall prevent those monies in this fund from being used as a revolving fund to cover expenditures necessary and proper under the law for which federal funds have been duly requested but not yet received, subject to the charging of such expenditures against such funds when necessary. The monies in this fund may be used by the department for the payment of costs of administration of the employment security laws of this state which are found not to be or not to have been properly and validly chargeable against funds obtained from federal sources. All monies in this Special Employment Security Administration Fund shall be continuously available to the department for expenditure in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, and shall not lapse at any time. The monies in this fund are specifically made available to replace, as contemplated by Section 71-5-113, expenditures from the Employment Security Administration Fund established by Section 71-5-111, which have been found, because of any action or contingency, to have been lost or improperly expended.
     </p>
     <p>
      The department, whenever it is of the opinion that the money in the Special Employment Security Administration Fund is more than ample to pay for all foreseeable needs for which such special fund is set up, may, by written order, order the transfer therefrom to the Unemployment Compensation Fund of such amount of money in the Special Employment Security Administration Fund as it deems proper, and the same shall thereupon be immediately transferred to the Unemployment Compensation Fund.

   A laid off employee was improperly denied unemployment compensation for the two week period following his receipt of a lump sum vacation payment; pursuant to §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c05s71-5-11ol1O1" target="_self">71-5-11(O)(1)</a></cite>, which provides in part that an individual is deemed unemployed in any week during which he performs no services, no wages were payable to the employee, in that he had performed no services for his former employer during the two weeks; the vacation pay flowed from services rendered prior to termination of his employment. Further, an administrative rule which provided that pay received after separation from an employer was considered to be “wages,” was inconsistent with the legislative definition of “unemployment,” and exceeded the powers granted the Commission by this section.

   Award of unemployment benefits to the employee was inappropriate because the employee’s failure to attend a hearing was fatal to the employee’s appeal from the denial of unemployment benefits.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Subject to other provisions of this chapter, the executive director is authorized to appoint, fix the compensation, and prescribe the duties and powers of such officers, accountants, attorneys, experts and other persons as may be necessary in the performance of department duties; however, all personnel who were former members of the Armed Forces of the United States of America shall be given credit regardless of rate, rank or commission. All positions shall be filled by persons selected and appointed on a nonpartisan merit basis, in accordance with Section 25-9-101 et seq., that provides for a state service personnel system. The executive director shall not employ any person who is an officer or committee member of any political party organization. The executive director may delegate to any such person so appointed such power and authority as he deems reasonable and proper for the effective administration of this chapter, and may in his discretion bond any person handling monies or signing checks hereunder. The veteran status of an individual shall be considered and preference given in accordance with the provisions of the State Personnel Board.
     </p>
     <p>
      The department and its employees are exempt from Sections 25-15-101 and 25-15-103.
     </p>
     <p>
      The department may use federal granted funds to provide such group health, life, accident and hospitalization insurance for its employees as may be agreed upon by the department and the federal granting authorities.
     </p>
     <p>
      The department shall adopt a “layoff formula” to be used wherever it is determined that, because of reduced workload, budget reductions or in order to effect a more economical operation, a reduction in force shall occur in any group.
     </p>
     <p>
      In establishing this formula, the department shall give effect to the principle of seniority and shall provide that seniority points may be added for disabled veterans and veterans, with due regard to the efficiency of the service. Any such layoff formula shall be implemented according to the policies, rules and regulations of the State Personnel Board.

       The statute [Code 1942, § 7411] only confers confidentiality which bans publication or opening of records “to public inspection;” subpoena-compelled availability of such records in defense of a claim made for a beneficiary of the Act is not expressly covered and should not be implied to bar access to facts relevant to the issues raised by a back pay claim before the NLRB.

       The Mississippi employment security provision, requiring each employing unit to keep work records but providing that information thus obtained be held confidential and not published or opened to public inspection, did not create an absolute privilege prohibiting the commission manager from disclosing, in a federal civil rights suit against an employer, the information contained in commission records, and an order of the federal district court requiring the manager to produce such records would afford the manager complete protection from prosecution for the violation of the Mississippi prohibition against publication of the information.

   The potential harm from disclosure of any employment security commission records subject to a privilege must be weighed against the benefits of such disclosure, and in the case of charges of racial discrimination in employment and in handling job applications and referrals, the value of disclosure outweighed the possible side effects of such disclosure. Carr v. Monroe Mfg. Co., 431 F.2d 384, 1970 U.S. App. LEXIS 7660 (5th Cir. Miss. 1970), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">400 U.S. 1000</cite>, <cite class="s_court">91 S. Ct. 456</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">27 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 451, 1971 U.S. LEXIS 3560 (U.S. 1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Although denying the employment security commission’s request that it be allowed to place tape on application cards over the names of all applicants referred to the corporation defendant except the named plaintiffs and of all employers except the corporate defendant to whom referrals were made, the district court property ordered extensive protective devices to assure that neither the original records nor copies would reach any nonparty, and that the parties and their counsel would use the records only for purposes of the instant litigation. Carr v. Monroe Mfg. Co., 431 F.2d 384, 1970 U.S. App. LEXIS 7660 (5th Cir. Miss. 1970), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">400 U.S. 1000</cite>, <cite class="s_court">91 S. Ct. 456</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">27 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 451, 1971 U.S. LEXIS 3560 (U.S. 1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   In a case against an individual employer and the state employment security commission charging, respectively, racial discrimination in employment and in handling job applications and referrals, discovery was properly granted as to certain employment security commission records, including the application cards of all those referred to the corporate defendant. Carr v. Monroe Mfg. Co., 431 F.2d 384, 1970 U.S. App. LEXIS 7660 (5th Cir. Miss. 1970), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">400 U.S. 1000</cite>, <cite class="s_court">91 S.

       Former employee’s defamation claim against his former co-worker was properly dismissed on summary judgment because the co-worker enjoyed an absolute privilege for her statement, made during a Mississippi Employment Security Commission hearing.

       An employee failed to prove that statements made by his employer to the Mississippi Employment Security Commission were false or maliciously made, and therefore the statements maintained their privileged status and could not be the basis for a libel or slander suit, where the employee’s only evidence was his allegation that his employer defamed him by stating that he was fired for a “bad attitude” and his testimony at trial that the employer’s contention that he was insubordinate was false.

      In any case where an employing unit or any officer, member or agent thereof, or any other person having possession of the records thereof, shall fail or refuse upon demand by the department or its duly appointed agents to produce or permit the examination or copying of any book, paper, account, record or other data pertaining to payrolls or employment or ownership of interests or stock in any employing unit, or bearing upon the correctness of any report, or for the purpose of making a report as required by this chapter where none has been made, then and in that event the department or its duly authorized agents may, by the issuance of a subpoena, require the attendance of such employing unit or any officer, member or agent thereof, or any other person having possession of the records thereof, and take testimony with respect to any such matter and may require any such person to produce any books or records specified in such subpoena. The department or its authorized agents at any such hearing shall have power to administer oaths to any such person or persons. When any person called as a witness by a subpoena signed by the department or its agents and served upon him by the sheriff of a county of which such person is a resident, or wherein is located the principal office of such employing unit or wherein such records are located or kept, shall fail to obey such subpoena to appear before the department or its authorized agent, or shall refuse to testify or to answer any questions or to produce any book, record, paper or other data when required to do so, such failure or refusal shall be reported to the Attorney General, who shall thereupon institute proceedings by the filing of a petition in the name of the State of Mississippi, on the relation of the department, in the circuit court or other court of competent jurisdiction of the county where such witness resides, or wherein such records are located or kept, to compel the obedience of such witness. Such petition shall set forth the facts and circumstances of the demand for and refusal or failure to permit the examination or copying of such records, or the failure or refusal of such witness to testify in answer to such subpoena or to produce the records so required by such subpoena. Such court, upon the filing and docketing of such petition, shall thereupon promptly issue an order to the defendants named in the petition to produce forthwith in such court, or at a place in such county designated in such order for the examination or copying by the department or its duly appointed agents, the records, books or documents so described, and to testify concerning matters described in such petition. Unless such defendants to such petition shall appear in the court upon a day specified in such order, which day shall be not more than ten (10) days after the date of issuance of such order, and offer, under oath, good and sufficient reasons why such examination or copying should not be permitted, or why such subpoena should not be obeyed, such court shall thereupon deliver to the department or its agents, for examination or copying, the records, books and documents so described in the petition and so produced in such court, and shall order the defendants to appear in answer to the subpoena of the department or its agents, and to testify concerning matters inquired about by the department. Any employing unit or any officer, member or agent thereof, or any other person having possession of the records thereof, who shall willfully disobey such order of the court after the same shall have been served upon him shall be guilty of indirect contempt of such court from which such order shall have issued, and may be adjudged in contempt of the court and punished therefor as provided by law.

         The “cost rate criterion” (CRC) is defined as follows: Beginning with January 1974, the benefits paid for the twelve-month period ending December 1974 are summed and divided by the total wages for the twelve-month period ending on June 30, 1975. Similar ratios are computed by subtracting the earliest month’s benefit payments and adding the benefits of the next month in the sequence and dividing each sum of twelve (12) months’ benefits by the total wages for the twelve-month period ending on the June 30 which is nearest to the final month of the period used to compute the numerator. If December is the final month of the period used to compute the numerator, then the twelve-month period ending the following June 30 will be used for the denominator. Benefits and total wages used in the computation of the cost rate criterion shall exclude all benefits and total wages applicable to state agencies, political subdivisions, reimbursable nonprofit corporations, and tax-exempt PSE employment.

The general experience rate shall be determined in the following manner: The department shall determine annually, for the thirty-six (36) consecutive calendar-month period ending on the computation date, the amount of benefits which were not charged to the record of any employer and of benefits which were ineffectively charged to the employer’s experience-rating record. For the purposes of this item 3, the term “ineffectively charged benefits” shall include:

          c. The total of the amounts of benefits charged or chargeable to the experience-rating record of any employer who has discontinued his business or whose coverage has been terminated within such period; provided, that solely for the purposes of determining the amounts of ineffectively charged benefits as herein defined, a “benefit ratio” shall be computed for each ineligible employer, which shall be the quotient obtained by dividing the total benefits charged to his experience-rating record throughout the period ending on the computation date, during which his experience-rating record has been chargeable with benefits, by his total taxable payroll for the same period on which all unemployment insurance contributions due have been paid on or before the September 30 immediately following the computation date; and provided further, that such benefit ratio shall be computed to the tenth of one percent (.1%) and any remainder shall be rounded to the next higher tenth.
         </p>
         <p>
          The ratio of the sum of these amounts (subsection (2)(b)(v)3a, b and c) to the taxable wages paid during the same period divided by all eligible employers whose benefit ratio did not exceed five and four-tenths percent (5.4%), computed to the next higher tenth of one percent (.1%), shall be the general experience rate; however, the general experience rate for rate year 2014 shall be two tenths of one percent (.2%) and to that will be added the employer’s individual experience rate for the total unemployment insurance rate.
         </p>
         <p>
          4. a. Except as otherwise provided in this item 4, the general experience rate shall be adjusted by use of the size of fund index factor. This factor may be positive or negative, and shall be determined as follows: From the target SOFI, as defined in subsection (1)(k) of this section, subtract the simple average of the current and preceding years’ exposure criterions divided by the cost rate criterion, as defined in subsection (1)(j) of this section. The result is then multiplied by the product of the CRC, as defined in subsection (1)(j) of this section, and total wages for the twelve-month period ending June 30 divided by the taxable wages for the twelve-month period ending June 30. This is the percentage positive or negative added to the general experience rate. The sum of the general experience rate and the trust fund adjustment factor shall be multiplied by fifty percent (50%) and this product shall be computed to one (1) decimal place, and rounded to the next higher tenth.
         </p>
         <p>
          b. Notwithstanding the minimum rate provisions as set forth in subsection (1) (l) of this section, the general experience rate of all employers shall be reduced by seven one hundredths of one percent (.07%) for calendar year 2013 only.
         </p>
         <p>
          5. The general experience rate shall be zero percent (0%) unless the general experience ratio for any tax year as computed and adjusted on the basis of the trust fund adjustment factor and reduced by fifty percent (50%) is an amount equal to or greater than two-tenths of one percent (.2%), then the general experience rate shall be the computed general experience ratio and adjusted on the basis of the trust fund adjustment factor and reduced by fifty percent (50%); however, in no case shall the sum of the general experience plus the individual experience unemployment insurance rate exceed five and four-tenths percent (5.4%). For rate years subsequent to 2014, Mississippi Workforce Enhancement Training contribution rate, and/or State Workforce Investment contribution rate, and/or Mississippi Works contribution rate, when in effect, shall be added to the unemployment contribution rate, regardless of whether the addition of this contribution rate causes the total contribution rate for the employer to exceed five and four-tenths percent (5.4%).
         </p>
         <p>
          6. The department shall include in its annual rate notice to employers a brief explanation of the elements of the general experience rate, and shall include in its regular publications an annual analysis of benefits not charged to the record of any employer, and of the benefit experience of employers by industry group whose benefit ratio exceeds four percent (4%), and of any other factors which may affect the size of the general experience rate.

       § 71-5-357.
    Regulations governing nonprofit organizations [Repealed effective July 1, 2023].
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Benefits paid to employees of nonprofit organizations shall be financed in accordance with the provisions of this section. For the purpose of this section, a nonprofit organization is an organization (or group of organizations) described in Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 which is exempt from income tax under Section 501(a) of such code (26 USCS Section 501).
     </p>
     <p>
      Any nonprofit organization which, under Section 71-5-11, subsection H(3), is or becomes subject to this chapter shall pay contributions under the provisions of Sections 71-5-351 through 71-5-355 unless it elects, in accordance with this paragraph, to pay to the department for the unemployment fund an amount equal to the amount of regular benefits and one-half (1/2) of the extended benefits paid, that is attributable to service in the employ of such nonprofit organization, to individuals for weeks of unemployment which begin during the effective period of such election.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any nonprofit organization which becomes subject to this chapter may elect to become liable for payments in lieu of contributions for a period of not less than twelve (12) months, beginning with the date on which such subjectivity begins, by filing a written notice of its election with the department not later than thirty (30) days immediately following the date of the determination of such subjectivity.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any nonprofit organization which makes an election in accordance with subparagraph (i) of this paragraph will continue to be liable for payments in lieu of contributions unless it files with the department a written termination notice not later than thirty (30) days prior to the beginning of the tax year for which such termination shall first be effective.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any nonprofit organization which has been paying contributions under this chapter may change to a reimbursable basis by filing with the department, not later than thirty (30) days prior to the beginning of any tax year, a written notice of election to become liable for payments in lieu of contributions. Such election shall not be terminable by the organization for that and the next tax year.
     </p>
     <p>
      The department may for good cause extend the period within which a notice of election or a notice of termination must be filed, and may permit an election to be retroactive.
     </p>
     <p>
      The department, in accordance with such regulations as it may prescribe, shall notify each nonprofit organization of any determination which it may make of its status as an employer, of the effective date of any election which it makes and of any termination of such election. Such determinations shall be subject to reconsideration, appeal and review in accordance with the provisions of Sections 71-5-351 through 71-5-355.
     </p>
     <p>
      Payments in lieu of contributions shall be made in accordance with the provisions of subparagraph (i) of this paragraph.
     </p>
     <p>
      At the end of each calendar quarter, or at the end of any other period as determined by the department, the department shall bill each nonprofit organization (or group of such organizations) which has elected to make payments in lieu of contributions, for an amount equal to the full amount of regular benefits plus one-half (1/2) of the amount of extended benefits paid during such quarter or other prescribed period that is attributable to service in the employ of such organization.
     </p>
     <p>
      Payment of any bill rendered under subparagraph (i) of this paragraph shall be made not later than forty-five (45) days after such bill was delivered to the nonprofit organization, unless there has been an application for review and redetermination in accordance with subparagraph (v) of this paragraph.
     </p>
     <p>
      1. All of the enforcement procedures for the collection of delinquent contributions contained in Sections 71-5-363 through 71-5-383 shall be applicable in all respects for the collection of delinquent payments due by nonprofit organizations who have elected to become liable for payments in lieu of contributions.
     </p>

      2. If any nonprofit organization is delinquent in making payments in lieu of contributions, the department may terminate such organization’s election to make payments in lieu of contributions as of the beginning of the next tax year, and such termination shall be effective for the balance of such tax year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Payments made by any nonprofit organization under the provisions of this paragraph shall not be deducted or deductible, in whole or in part, from the remuneration of individuals in the employ of the organization.
     </p>
     <p>
      Payments due by employers who elect to reimburse the fund in lieu of contributions as provided in this paragraph may not be noncharged under any condition. The reimbursement must be on a dollar-for-dollar basis (One Dollar ($1.00) reimbursement for each dollar paid in benefits) in every case, so that the trust fund shall be reimbursed in full, such reimbursement to include, but not be limited to, benefits or payments erroneously or incorrectly paid, or paid as a result of a determination of eligibility which is subsequently reversed, or paid as a result of claimant fraud. However, political subdivisions who are reimbursing employers may elect to pay to the fund an amount equal to five-tenths percent (.5%) through December 31, 2010, and shall pay twenty-five one-hundredths percent (.25%) thereafter of the taxable wages paid during the calendar year with respect to employment, and those employers who so elect shall be relieved of liability for reimbursement of benefits paid under the same conditions that benefits are not charged to the experience-rating record of a contributing employer as provided in Section 71-5-355(2)(b)(ii) other than Clause 5 thereof. Benefits paid in such circumstances for which reimbursing employers are relieved of liability for reimbursement shall not be considered attributable to service in the employment of such reimbursing employer.
     </p>
     <p>
      The amount due specified in any bill from the department shall be conclusive on the organization unless, not later than fifteen (15) days after the bill was delivered to it, the organization files an application for redetermination by the department, setting forth the grounds for such application or appeal. The department shall promptly review and reconsider the amount due specified in the bill and shall thereafter issue a redetermination in any case in which such application for redetermination has been filed. Any such redetermination shall be conclusive on the organization unless, not later than fifteen (15) days after the redetermination was delivered to it, the organization files an appeal to the Circuit Court of the First Judicial District of Hinds County, Mississippi, in accordance with the provisions of law with respect to review of civil causes by certiorari.
     </p>
     <p>
      Past-due payments of amounts in lieu of contributions shall be subject to the same interest and penalties that, pursuant to Section 71-5-363, apply to past-due contributions.
     </p>
     <p>
      Each employer that is liable for payments in lieu of contributions shall pay to the department for the fund the amount of regular benefits plus the amount of one-half (1/2) of extended benefits paid are attributable to service in the employ of such employer. If benefits paid to an individual are based on wages paid by more than one (1) employer and one or more of such employers are liable for payments in lieu of contributions, the amount payable to the fund by each employer that is liable for such payments shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of subparagraph (i) or subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph.
     </p>
     <p>
      If benefits paid to an individual are based on wages paid by one or more employers that are liable for payment in lieu of contributions and on wages paid by one or more employers who are liable for contributions, the amount of benefits payable by each employer that is liable for payments in lieu of contributions shall be an amount which bears the same ratio to the total benefits paid to the individual as the total base period wages paid to the individual by such employer bear to the total base period wages paid to the individual by all of his base period employers.
     </p>
     <p>
      If benefits paid to an individual are based on wages paid by two (2) or more employers that are liable for payments in lieu of contributions, the amount of benefits payable by each such employer shall be an amount which bears the same ratio to the total benefits paid to the individual as the total base period wages paid to the individual by such employer bear to the total base period wages paid to the individual by all of his base period employers.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the discretion of the department, any nonprofit organization that elects to become liable for payments in lieu of contributions shall be required to execute and file with the department a surety bond approved by the department, or it may elect instead to deposit with the department money or securities. The amount of such bond or deposit shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph.
     </p>
     <p>
      The amount of the bond or deposit required by paragraph (d) shall be equal to two and seven-tenths percent (2.7%) thereafter to December 31, 2010, and one and thirty-five one-hundredths percent (1.35%) thereafter, of the organization’s taxable wages paid for employment as defined in Section 71-5-11, subsection I(4), for the four (4) calendar quarters immediately preceding the effective date of the election, the renewal date in the case of a bond, or the biennial anniversary of the effective date of election in the case of a deposit of money or securities, whichever date shall be most recent and applicable. If the nonprofit organization did not pay wages in each of such four (4) calendar quarters, the amount of the bond or deposit shall be as determined by the department.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any bond deposited under paragraph (d) shall be in force for a period of not less than two (2) tax years and shall be renewed with the approval of the department at such times as the department may prescribe, but not less frequently than at intervals of two (2) years as long as the organization continues to be liable for payments in lieu of contributions. The department shall require adjustments to be made in a previously filed bond as it deems appropriate. If the bond is to be increased, the adjusted bond shall be filed by the organization within thirty (30) days of the date notice of the required adjustment was delivered to it. Failure by any organization covered by such bond to pay the full amount of payments in lieu of contributions when due, together with any applicable interest and penalties provided in paragraph (b)(v) of this section, shall render the surety liable on the bond to the extent of the bond, as though the surety was such organization.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any deposit of money or securities in accordance with paragraph (d) shall be retained by the department in an escrow account until liability under the election is terminated, at which time it shall be returned to the organization, less any deductions as hereinafter provided. The department may deduct from the money deposited under paragraph (d) by a nonprofit organization, or sell the securities it has so deposited, to the extent necessary to satisfy any due and unpaid payments in lieu of contributions and any applicable interest and penalties provided for in paragraph (b)(v) of this section. The department shall require the organization, within thirty (30) days following any deduction from a money deposit or sale of deposited securities under the provisions hereof, to deposit sufficient additional money or securities to make whole the organization’s deposit at the prior level. Any cash remaining from the sale of such securities shall be a part of the organization’s escrow account. The department may, at any time, review the adequacy of the deposit made by any organization. If, as a result of such review, it determines that an adjustment is necessary, it shall require the organization to make additional deposit within thirty (30) days of notice of its determination or shall return to it such portion of the deposit as it no longer considers necessary, whichever action is appropriate. Disposition of income from securities held in escrow shall be governed by the applicable provisions of the state law.
     </p>
     <p>
      If any nonprofit organization fails to file a bond or make a deposit, or to file a bond in an increased amount, or to increase or make whole the amount of a previously made deposit as provided under this subparagraph, the department may terminate such organization’s election to make payments in lieu of contributions, and such termination shall continue for not less than the four (4) consecutive calendar-quarter periods beginning with the quarter in which such termination becomes effective; however, the department may extend for good cause the applicable filing, deposit or adjustment period by not more than thirty (30) days.
     </p>
     <p>
      Group account shall be established according to regulations prescribed by the department.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any employer which elects to make payments in lieu of contributions into the Unemployment Compensation Fund as provided in this paragraph shall not be liable to make such payments with respect to the benefits paid to any individual whose base period wages include wages for previously uncovered services as defined in Section 71-5-511(e) to the extent that the Unemployment Compensation Fund is reimbursed for such benefits pursuant to Section 121 of Public Law 94-566.

     <p>
      If any employer fails to make and file any report as and when required by the terms and provisions of this chapter or by any rule or regulation of the commission for the purpose of determining the amount of contributions due by him under this chapter, or if any report which has been filed is deemed by the executive director to be incorrect or insufficient, and such employer, after having been given notice by the executive director to file such report, or a corrected or sufficient report, as the case may be, shall fail to file such report within fifteen (15) days after the date of such notice, the executive director may (a) determine the amount of contributions due from such employer on the basis of such information as may be readily available to him, which said determination shall be prima facie correct, (b) assess such employer with the amount of contribution so determined, to which amount may be added and assessed by the executive director in his discretion, as damages, an amount equal to ten percent (10%) of said amount, and (c) immediately give notice to such employer of such determination, assessment, and damages, if any, added and assessed, demanding payment of same together with interest, as herein provided, on the amount of contributions from the date when same were due and payable. Such determination and assessment by the executive director shall be final at the expiration of fifteen (15) days from the date of such notice thereof demanding payment, unless:
     </p>
     <p>
      Such employer shall have filed with the department a written protest and petition for a hearing, specifying his objections thereto. Upon receipt of such petition within the fifteen (15) days allowed, the department shall fix the time and place for a hearing and shall notify the petitioner thereof. At any hearing held before the department as herein provided, evidence may be offered to support such determination and assessment or to prove that it is incorrect, and the commission shall have all the power provided in Sections 71-5-137 and 71-5-139. Immediately after such hearing a final decision in the matter shall be made by the commission, and any contributions or deficiencies in contributions found and determined by the commission to be due shall be assessed and paid, together with interest, within fifteen (15) days after notice of such final decision and assessment, and demand for payment thereof by the department shall have been sent to such employer.
     </p>
     <p>
      The department, in its discretion, determines on the basis of information submitted by the employer that such assessment should be amended and adjusted to reflect the correct amount of taxes.

    Collection by warrant.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      If an employer shall file a report in proper form and in proper amount, but shall fail to pay the amount of contributions shown to be due thereby at the time of such filing, or if an employer shall fail to pay any assessment as provided and made under Section 71-5-365 within fifteen (15) days after such assessment has become final as herein provided, the department may issue a warrant under its official seal, directed to the sheriff of any county of the state, commanding him to levy upon and sell the real and personal property of such employer as has defaulted in the payment of such contributions or assessments, which may be found within his county, for the payment of the amount thereof, together with interest, damages, if any, assessed for failure to make and file a report or a corrected or sufficient report, and an additional sum not exceeding one hundred percent (100%) of the amount of the unpaid contributions due, in the discretion of the department, as damages for failure to pay, if not already assessed under Section 71-5-365 and the costs of executing the warrant and to return such warrant to the department, and to pay to it the money collected by virtue thereof on the date specified therein. The department shall cause to be delivered to the clerk of the circuit court a copy of such warrant issued to the sheriff. Such clerk shall enter in the judgment roll, in the column for judgment debtors, the name of the employer mentioned in the warrant and, in appropriate columns, the amount of contributions, interest and damages for which the warrant is issued, a notation that the lien covers all previous, current and future periods for the life of the lien, and the date when such copy is filed. Thereupon the amount of such warrant so filed and entered shall become a lien upon the title to and interest in all real and personal property, including choses in action against negotiable instruments not past due, of the employer against whom the warrant is issued in the same manner as a judgment duly enrolled in the office of such clerk. Any such liens shall cover all contributions, interest and damages owed to the department from previous, current and future periods until the expiration of such lien or until the amount of the lien is fully satisfied. Such judgment shall not be a lien upon the property of the employer for a period of more than seven (7) years from the date of filing of the notice of the tax lien for failure to pay contributions, damages and interest unless action be brought thereon before the expiration of such time or unless the department refiles such notice of tax lien before the expiration of such time. The judgment shall be a lien upon the property of the employer for a period of seven (7) years from the date of refiling such notice of tax lien unless action be brought thereon before the expiration of such time or unless the department refiles such notice of tax lien before the expiration of such time. There shall be no limit upon the number of times the department may refile notices of tax liens. The sheriff shall proceed upon the warrant in the same manner and with like effect as that provided by law in respect to executions issued against property upon judgments or in attachment proceedings of a court of record, and the remedies by garnishment shall apply; and for his services in executing the warrant the sheriff shall be entitled to the same fees, which he may collect in the same manner.
     </p>
     <p>
      The department may elect to issue the warrant directly to the circuit clerk of any county of this state for enrollment upon the judgment rolls of the county. In such case, the clerk shall enter in the judgment roll, in the column for judgment debtors, the name of the employer mentioned in the warrant and, in appropriate columns, the amount of contributions, interest and damages for which the warrant is issued, a notation that the lien covers all previous, current and future periods for the life of the lien, and the date when such warrant is filed. The lien shall have the same effect and remedies as that provided by law in respect to executions issued against property upon judgments or in attachment proceedings of a court of record, and the remedies by garnishment shall apply.
     </p>
     <p>
      All warrants issued by the department for the collection of any unemployment tax or for an overpayment of benefits imposed by statute and collected by the department shall be used to levy on salaries, compensation or other monies due the delinquent employer or claimant. No such warrant shall be issued until after the delinquent employer or claimant has exhausted all appeal rights associated with the debt. The warrants shall be served by mail or by delivery by an agent of the department on the person or entity responsible or liable for the payment of the monies due the delinquent employer or claimant. Once served, the employer or other person owing compensation due the delinquent employer or claimant shall pay the monies over to the department in complete or partial satisfaction of the liability. An answer shall be made within thirty (30) days after service of the warrant in the form and manner determined satisfactory by the department. Failure to pay the money over to the department as required by this section shall result in the served party being personally liable for the full amount of the monies owed and the levy and collection process may be issued against the party in the same manner as other debts owed to the department. Except as otherwise provided by this section, the answer, the amount payable under the warrant and the obligation of the payor to continue payment shall be governed by the garnishment laws of this state but shall be payable to the department.

      <p>
       The 2000 amendment, in the first paragraph, rewrote the second sentence, inserted “a notation that the lien covers all previous, current and future periods for the life of the lien” in the third sentence, and inserted the present fifth through eighth sentences; added the present second paragraph; and made other minor changes.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 2013 amendment deleted the former last paragraph which read: “On the suggestion of the commission, in writing, that any person is indebted to an employer named in any warrant which has been entered on the judgment roll in the office of the circuit clerk of any county, or has property of such employer in his hands, or knows of some other person who is so indebted, or who has effects or property of such employer in his hands, it shall be the duty of the clerk of the circuit court of such county to issue a writ of garnishment directed to the sheriff or proper officer, commanding him to summon such person as garnishee to appear at a term of the circuit court of the county, or a term of the county court, as in cases provided by law for garnishment upon the judgments of such court, to answer accordingly. The circuit court or county court, as the case may be, shall assume full jurisdiction over the subject matter and the parties, and all the provisions of law with respect to garnishment proceedings instituted in the circuit court under Sections 11-35-1 through 11-35-61 of the Mississippi Code of 1972, shall be applicable as far as possible thereto”; added the last paragraph; and substituted “department” for “commission” throughout the section.

     <p>
      The contributions required by this chapter shall be a lien upon the property of any employer subject to its provisions who shall sell out his business or stock of goods, or who shall quit business, or whose property used or acquired in the business shall be sold under voluntary conveyance or under foreclosure, execution, attachment, distraint, or other judicial proceedings. Such employer shall, within ten (10) days before the happening of any of the above contingencies, be required to file such reports as the commission shall prescribe and to pay the contributions required by this chapter with respect to wages payable for employment up to the date of the happening of such contingency. The purchaser or successor in business shall withhold sufficient of the purchase money to cover the amount of contributions due and unpaid, until such time as such employer shall produce a receipt from the commission showing that the contributions have been paid or a certificate that no contributions are due. If such purchaser or successor shall fail to withhold purchase money as above provided, and the contributions shall not be paid within the ten (10) days specified above, such purchaser or successor shall be personally liable for the payment of the contributions accrued and unpaid on account of the operation of the business by the former owner.

     <p>
      The department shall be the treasurer and custodian of the fund, and shall administer such fund in accordance with the directions of the department, and shall issue its warrants upon it in accordance with such regulations as the department shall prescribe. The department shall maintain within the fund three (3) separate accounts: (a) a clearing account, (b) an unemployment trust fund account, and (c) a benefit payment account. All monies payable to the fund, upon receipt thereof by the department, shall be immediately deposited in the clearing account. Refunds payable pursuant to Section 71-5-383 may be paid from the clearing account by the department. Transfers pursuant to Section 71-5-114 of all interest, penalties and damages collected shall be made to the Special Employment Security Administration Fund as soon as practicable after the end of each calendar quarter. Workforce Enhancement Training contributions, State Workforce Investment contributions and Mississippi Works contributions shall be deposited into the Workforce Investment and Training Holding Account as described in this section. All other monies in the clearing account shall be immediately deposited with the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States of America to the Unemployment Trust Fund account for the State of Mississippi, established and maintained pursuant to Section 904 of the Social Security Act, as amended, any provisions of law in this state relating to the deposit, administration, release or disbursement of monies in the possession or custody of this state to the contrary notwithstanding. The benefit account shall consist of all monies requisitioned from this state’s account in the Unemployment Trust Fund. Except as herein otherwise provided, monies in the clearing and benefit accounts may be deposited by the department, in any bank or public depository in which general funds of the state may be deposited, but no public deposit insurance charge or premium shall be paid out of the fund. The department shall be liable for the faithful performance of its duties in connection with the Unemployment Compensation Fund under this chapter. A Workforce Investment and Training Holding Account shall be established by and maintained under the control of the Mississippi Department of Employment Security. Contributions collected pursuant to the provisions in this chapter for the Workforce Enhancement Training Fund, State Workforce Investment Fund and the Mississippi Works Fund shall be transferred from the clearing account into the Workforce Investment and Training Holding Account on the same schedule and under the same conditions as funds transferred to the Unemployment Compensation Fund. Such funds shall remain on deposit in the holding account for a period of thirty (30) days. After such period, Workforce Enhancement Training contributions shall be transferred to the appropriate Mississippi Community College Board Treasury Account by the department. The State Workforce Investment contributions shall be transferred to the State Workforce Investment Board bank account established by the department, and the department shall have the authority to deposit and disburse funds from the State Workforce Investment Board bank account as directed by the State Workforce Investment Board. The Mississippi Works contributions shall be transferred to the Mississippi Department of Employment Security Treasury Account for the Mississippi Works Fund. Such transfers shall occur within fifteen (15) days after the funds have resided in the Workforce Investment and Training Holding Account for thirty (30) days. One (1) such transfer shall be made monthly, but the department, in its discretion, may make additional transfers in any month. In the event such funds transferred are subsequently determined to be erroneously paid or collected, or if deposit of such funds is denied or rejected by the banking institution for any reason, or deposits are unable to clear drawer’s account for any reason, the funds must be reimbursed by the recipient of such funds within thirty (30) days of mailing of notice by the department demanding such refund, unless funds are available in the Workforce Investment and Training Holding Account. In that event such amounts shall be immediately withdrawn from the Workforce Investment and Training Holding Account by the department and re-deposited into the clearing account.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The provisions of Sections 71-5-451 through 71-5-459, to the extent that they relate to the unemployment trust fund, shall be operative only so long as such unemployment trust fund continues to exist and so long as the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States of America continues to maintain for this state a separate book account of all funds deposited therein by this state for benefit purposes and of money credited pursuant to Section 903 of the Social Security Act, as amended, together with this state’s proportionate share of the earnings of such unemployment trust fund, from which no other state is permitted to make withdrawals. If and when such unemployment trust fund ceases to exist or such separate book account is no longer maintained, all moneys, properties, or securities therein belonging to the unemployment compensation fund of this state shall be transferred to the treasurer of the unemployment compensation fund, who shall hold, invest, transfer, sell, deposit, and release such moneys, properties, or securities in a manner approved by the commission, in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, provided that such moneys shall be invested in the following readily marketable classes of securities: bonds or other interest bearing obligations of the United States of America, the State of Mississippi, and of any county; consolidated school district, supervisors district road bonds, and municipal bonds of counties, cities, and towns of Mississippi; federal land bank bonds and home owners loan corporation bonds; Yazoo and Mississippi Delta Levee District bonds; Mississippi Levee District bonds; municipal bonds of cities with a population of one hundred thousand (100,000) and over located in the states of Louisiana, Texas, Arkansas, Alabama, Georgia, Florida, and Tennessee; and provided further that such investment shall at all times be so made that all the assets of the fund shall always be readily convertible into cash when needed for the payment of benefits. The treasurer shall dispose of securities or other properties belonging to the unemployment compensation fund only under direction of the commission.

     <p>
      On or before June 15 of each year, the total wages reported on contribution reports for the preceding calendar year shall be divided by the average monthly number of insured workers (determined by dividing the total insured workers reported on contribution reports pursuant to the regulations of the department for the preceding year by twelve (12)). The average annual wage thus obtained shall be divided by fifty-two (52) and the average weekly wage thus determined rounded to the nearest cent. Sixty percent (60%) of this amount, rounded to the nearest dollar, shall constitute the maximum “weekly benefit amount” paid to any individual whose benefit year commences on or after July 1 of such year and prior to July 1 of the next following year; provided however, that the maximum weekly benefit amount shall not exceed Two Hundred Ten Dollars ($210.00) for any benefit year that begins on or after July 1, 2002, and shall not exceed Two Hundred Thirty Dollars ($230.00) for any benefit year that begins on or after July 1, 2008, and shall not exceed Two Hundred Thirty-five Dollars ($235.00) for any benefit year that begins on or after July 1, 2009. The minimum weekly benefit amount for the individual shall be Thirty Dollars ($30.00). If an individual’s weekly benefit amount would compute to less than the said minimum, then such individual would be entitled to no benefits.

      An individual’s weekly benefit amount, as determined at the beginning of his benefit year, shall constitute his weekly benefit amount throughout such benefit year.

      The Mississippi Department of Employment Security, with the assistance of the United States Department of Labor, is directed to generate actuarially sound models for computation of weekly benefit amounts. Such models shall include scenarios for increasing the weekly benefit amounts at each increment from the minimum to the maximum amount and the impact such increments would have on the Unemployment Compensation Fund. Such report shall be provided to the Mississippi Legislature on or before December 31, 2008.

     </p>
     <p>
      (i) Subsequent to December 31, 1977, benefits shall not be payable on the basis of services performed by an alien, unless such alien is an individual who was lawfully admitted for permanent residence at the time such services were performed, was lawfully present for purposes of performing such services, or was permanently residing in the United States under color of law at the time such services were performed (including an alien who was lawfully present in the United States as a result of the application of the provisions of Section 203(a)(7) or Section 212(d)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act).
     </p>
     <p>
      Any data or information required of individuals applying for benefits to determine whether benefits are not payable to them because of their alien status shall be uniformly required from all applicants for benefits.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the case of an individual whose application for benefits would otherwise be approved, no determination that benefits to such individual are not payable because of his alien status shall be made, except upon a preponderance of the evidence.
     </p>

       A conclusion that a claimant was unable and unavailable for work was not supported by the evidence where (1) the appeals referee did not find that the claimant’s injury actually prevented her from working, but denied her claim because she had “failed to submit medical documentation to show that she has been released for full time work,” (2) the only testimony at the hearing was by the claimant, and (3) the only evidence contrary to her positive assertions that she was able and available to work was her physician’ release which placed certain restrictions on her return to work and her failure to produce a complete release.

Any benefits previously paid for weeks of unemployment with respect to which back pay awards, or other such compensation, are made shall constitute an overpayment and such amounts shall be deducted from the award by the employer prior to payment to the employee, and shall be transmitted promptly to the department by the employer for application against the overpayment and credit to the claimant’s maximum benefit amount and prompt deposit into the fund; however, the removal of any charges made against the employer as a result of such previously paid benefits shall be applied to the calendar year and the calendar quarter in which the overpayment is transmitted to the department, and no attempt shall be made to relate such a credit to the period to which the award applies. Any amount of overpayment so deducted by the employer and not transmitted to the department shall be subject to the same procedures for collection as is provided for contributions by Sections 71-5-363 through 71-5-381. Any amount of overpayment not deducted by the employer shall be established as an overpayment against the claimant and collected as provided above. It is the purpose of this paragraph to assure equity in the situations to which it applies, and it shall be construed accordingly.
       <p>
        B. Notwithstanding any other provision in this chapter, no otherwise eligible individual shall be denied benefits for any week because he is in training with the approval of the department; nor shall such individual be denied benefits with respect to any week in which he is in training with the approval of the department by reason of the application of provisions in Section 71-5-511, subsection (c), relating to availability for work, or the provisions of subsection A(3) of this section, relating to failure to apply for, or a refusal to accept, suitable work.
       </p>
       <p>
        C. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, no otherwise eligible individual shall be denied benefits for any week because he or she is in training approved under Section 236(a)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974, nor shall such individual be denied benefits by reason of leaving work to enter such training, provided the work left is not suitable employment, or because of the application to any such week in training of provisions in this law (or any applicable federal unemployment compensation law), relating to availability for work, active search for work or refusal to accept work.
       </p>
       <p>
        For purposes of this section, the term “suitable employment” means with respect to an individual, work of a substantially equal or higher skill level than the individual’s past adversely affected employment (as defined for purposes of the Trade Act of 1974), and wages for such work at not less than eighty percent (80%) of the individual’s average weekly wage as determined for the purposes of the Trade Act of 1974.
       </p>
       <p>
        D. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, no otherwise eligible individual shall be denied benefits for any week in which they are engaged in the Self-Employment Assistance Program established in Section 71-5-545 by reason of the application of Section 71-5-511(c), relating to availability for work, or the provisions of subsection A(3) of this section, relating to failure to apply for, or a refusal to accept, suitable work.
       </p>
       <p>
        E. Any individual who is receiving benefits may participate in an approved training program under the Mississippi Employment Security Law to gain skills that may lead to employment while continuing to receive benefits. Authorization for participation of a recipient of unemployment benefits in such a program must be granted by the department and continuation of participation must be certified weekly by the participant recipient. While participating in such program approved by the department, availability and work search requirements will be waived. No individual will be allowed to participate in this program for more than twelve (12) weeks in any benefit year. Such participation shall not be considered employment for any purposes and shall not accrue benefits or wage credits. Participation in this training program shall meet the definition set forth in the U.S. Fair Labor Standards Act.

      <p>
       The voluntary retirement of an employee who remained available for suitable work disqualified her for unemployment benefits, even though the retirement was induced by the fact that the retirement benefits far exceeded her earnings from the 2 hours per week that she was permitted to work, where the employee had worked 2 to 4 hours per week for several years, and though she was told that her hours might be cut back, she was never told that they were going to be cut; since there was no change in the employee’s employment status, there was no evidence that any good cause factor played a role in her decision to relinquish her employment. Mississippi Employment Sec. Com. v. Gaines, 580 So. 2d 1230, 1991 Miss. LEXIS 313 (Miss. 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where an employee’s hours have been drastically reduced to a point that there is no continued employment in any real sense, the employee may be eligible for benefits, and the fact that such an employee chooses retirement rather than resignation as a matter of effectuating a termination of employment may be considered but is not controlling on the issue of whether that termination was with or without good cause. The question is in all instances whether there was a “good cause” factor but for which there would have been no relinquishment of employment. Although the availability of retirement benefits in excess of salary is not such a “good cause” factor, that availability does not negate the possibility that some other good cause factor existed. To the extent that there is prima facie evidence of some other good cause factor, the burden is upon the employer to negate it as a “but for” cause of quitting. Mississippi Employment Sec. Com. v. Gaines, 580 So. 2d 1230, 1991 Miss. LEXIS 313 (Miss. 1991).

       An employee was offered “suitable” employment, such that his refusal to work amounted to a voluntary termination of work and rendered him ineligible for unemployment compensation benefits, where he was originally hired to collect some old accounts, he was offered a position as a sales person when most of the collection problems had been resolved, and he declined the work due to the slightly increased hours of the new position.

       Long-distance telephone operators who declined offers to transfer to neighboring towns when their office was closed were improperly granted unemployment insurance where the distance to be traveled did not render the available work unsuitable and where few such jobs were available in the city in which they had been working; thus, the operators had unreasonably restricted the terms and conditions under which they would accept employment and were not “available for work.” South Cent.

       A refusal by a labor union member to accept an offer of employment at the prevailing wage is not for good cause, so as to entitle him to unemployment compensation, because by accepting employment at less than the rate he would lose union status, where resignation from the union was not a condition of employment.

      <p>
       A finding that the employment offered to an unemployment compensation claimant was at not less than the prevailing wage is supported by evidence that the wage at the place of employment was that paid when the job was started, although less than the scale to which claimant’s labor union had subsequently increased its rate.

       After the Mississippi Department of Employment Security (MDES) initially disqualified a former employee from unemployment benefits due to allegedly being discharged from employment for misconduct, it was not error for the Board of Review of the MDES to reverse that decision because the employer did not meet its burden to show the employee was discharged for misconduct, when the employer did not appear at a de novo hearing, as the employer had adequate notice of that hearing. Over The Rainbow Daycare v. Miss. Dep't of Empl. Sec., 188 So.3d 1249, 2016 Miss. App. LEXIS 161 (Miss. Ct. App. 2016).

      <p>
       Employee was improperly denied unemployment benefits because her conduct did not amount to insubordination, her actions did not violate the employee handbook, her single incident of disrespectful behavior was not misconduct where there was no constant and continual direct order to do anything, and she was never warned that she would be fired.

       Employee sought unemployment benefits after she was terminated from her employment with a city.

       Terminated employee was insubordinate in taking unauthorized pictures at work and refusing to listen to his supervisors as to the proper use of the heavy equipment that the employee operated.

      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Clear and convincing evidence, in the testimony of the employee’s supervisors and coworkers, existed to show that a terminated employee’s conduct in operating heavy equipment in an unsafe manner warranted disqualification of unemployment benefits under Miss.

      <p>
       There was substantial evidence to indicate that the employee violated the employer’s policy prohibiting possession of a Zip drive on company premises. Further, substantial evidence was presented that the employee had knowledge that such action constituted a violation of company policy; therefore, the Mississippi Employment Security Commission Board of Review’s decision to deny unemployment benefits was not arbitrary or capricious, as the employee’s actions constituted misconduct connected with his work.

   Credible evidence supported the Mississippi Employment Security Commission’s decision that the claimant was disqualified from receiving unemployment benefits because her actions in refusing to comply with company policy regarding working closing shifts constituted misconduct as defined in Miss.

       Unemployment compensation claimant’s failure to pass physical fitness test required to receive certification as police officer after his first year of employment was “misconduct” disqualifying him from receiving benefits; claimant’s actions were clearly in wanton disregard of employer’s interest, and claimant had ability to pass physical test within his personal control but evidence showed that he did not attempt to keep his physical fitness up to standards required to pass test.

       Court of appeals erred by reevaluating the evidence and substituting its judgment for that of the Mississippi Employment Security Commission (MESC) because the MESC’s decision that an employer did not prove misconduct was supported by substantial evidence; the evidence substantially supported the MESC’s conclusion that the employer did not prove that an employee falsified her time sheets, and it found evidence of the employee’s inefficient use of technology, not falsification of hours worked.

       Substantial evidence showed that a former employee committed misconduct sufficient to warrant a reversal of an award of unemployment benefits because the owner of the employee’s former employer and the employee’s former sales manager testified, contrary to the employee’s testimony, that the employee refused to retake a State of Mississippi mandatory licensing exam after the employee had failed a previous exam and that the employee continued to improperly complete paperwork and sales contracts after being warned to correct the employee’s errors.

   Board of Review of the Mississippi Department of Employment Security did not err in denying the employee benefits where she repeatedly acted in disregard of company policy, Miss.

       Regardless of whether the residuum rule was applied or not, there was substantial, credible, corroborated evidence of a claimant’s multiple acts of insubordination constituting “misconduct” contained in summaries of personnel records based on personal knowledge which were a proper basis for denying unemployment benefits to the claimant; that testimony revealed that many of the relevant records were based on the personal knowledge of the preparer of the individual complaints against the claimant pursuant to Miss. R. Evid. 803(6) and comment. McClinton v. Miss. Dep't of Empl. Sec., 949 So. 2d 805, 2006 Miss. App. LEXIS 766 (Miss. Ct. App. 2006).

   Because (1) the claimant had been trained regarding completion of his time reports; (2) the falsification policy regarding time reports was posted on the Internet for all employees to access through computers made available to them; (3) the claimant had been counseled by management regarding discrepancies for a previous incident; and (4) he had been suspended for three days because of other policy violations, the claimant’s repeated insertion of incongruent times on his time and overtime reports constituted falsification of records and was disqualifying misconduct within the meaning of Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c05s71-5-513ol1A1b" target="_self">71-5-513(A)(1)(b)</a></cite> and Mississippi case law.

       Finding that the employee had not engaged in misconduct while on the job in an action concerning the denial of unemployment benefits was inappropriate based on the record; even the employee’s testimony demonstrated that she did not return to work after November 21, 2003, and did not provide her employer with a promised doctor’s excuse.

       Employee’s application for unemployment benefits was properly denied where the record showed the employee left work on his lunch break without permission, did not inform his supervisor, and did not return for the rest of the day. The employee’s assertion of chest pains was not credible in light of other evidence, nor was his assertion that he was unable to inform his supervisor of the situation; the employee disregarded standards of behavior that his employer had the right to expect to have acted on where the employer had an established rule that notice in such circumstances was required.

       Employee’s absenteeism, combined with the failure to give notice to an employer of an absence despite being warned, provided substantial evidence for a finding of willful misconduct in a hearing to determine eligibility for unemployment benefits; the court rejected the employee’s argument regarding compliance with the literal language of the policy because the employee understood the requirement of reporting an absence of at least 30 minutes prior to the beginning of a shift, and, although some of the absences might have been excused under the Family and Medical Leave Act, the employee failed to bring this to the attention of a supervisor.

       Substantial evidence in the record supported a determination by the Mississippi Employment Security Commission that the employee’s persistent failure to perform easily-accomplished but nevertheless important duties of her job demonstrated carelessness and negligence of such degree, or recurrence thereof, as to manifest culpability showing an intentional disregard of the employer’s interest; such a finding required that the employee be disqualified from receiving unemployment compensation benefits.

   If an employer wishes to disqualify an employee for failing a federally-regulated drug test, pursuant to 49 U.S.C.S. § 31306, in which a split specimen was taken, it must produce clear and convincing evidence that the split specimen was reconfirmed positive or that the employee declined to discuss the result with a medical review officer pursuant to 49 C.F.R. § 40.33(c); doing so will satisfy the “misconduct” requirement of Miss.

       Because the Mississippi Department of Employment Security’s Board of Review supported its decision that a terminated employee was not disqualified from receiving unemployment benefits for misconduct with substantial evidence—the employee’s testimony that the employee had not intentionally lied to supervisors, that the employee brought home company information only to protect the information and to complete work, and that the employee’s personal internet use was neither unusual or concerning—the decision was neither arbitrary, nor capricious.

       Award of unemployment benefits to a former county employee was appropriate, when the county contended that the employee was ineligible for unemployment benefits because of alleged misconduct, because the Mississippi Department of Employment Security Board of Review did not act arbitrarily in finding that the county failed to meet its burden of proof by clear and convincing evidence and the administrative law judge’s interest in recent, rather than remote, complaints or warnings about the employee’s performance was not arbitrary or capricious.

       In an appeal from a decision of the Mississippi Employment Security Commission (MESC), and the circuit court’s affirmance thereon, the facts were: (1) the employee was warned in regard to an excessive number of sick days, early leaves and absences; (2) he received an unsatisfactory performance review because he had not been cooperative with campus security; (3) he was disruptive at a campus physical plant and he left work without permission; (3) he was placed on probation regarding his job performance; and finally, (4) he was arrested for robbery arrest and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. In its infinite wisdom, the appellate court concluded the employee was terminated, not because of the aforementioned performance issues (unrelated to his incarceration), but because of the events which surrounded his two day incarceration; in that respect, the poor fellow did not want his employer to know about his arrest, so he had his girlfriend call his employer and state that he would be absent for two days, and without the employee’s permission, the girlfriend told the employer that same was due his mother’s illness; his girlfriend lied, but he did not, the appellate court concluded his employer did not need to know the reason for said two day absence, and the denial of his application for unemployment benefits was reversed.

   Court erred in upholding an order denying a city employee’s claim for unemployment compensation benefits after the employee was terminated because the employee’s actions could not be classified as “misconduct” under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c05s71-5-513" target="_self">71-5-513</a></cite>A(1)(b). Record lacked sufficient evidence to support the conclusion that the employee’s failure to keep a park clean all day constituted carelessness and negligence of such degree, or recurrence thereof, as to manifest culpability.

Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c05s71-5-513ol1A" target="_self">71-5-513(A)</a></cite>, was conduct evincing such willful and wanton disregard of the employer’s interest as was found in deliberate violations or disregard of standards of behavior which the employer had the right to expect from his employee; failure in good performance as the result of inability or incapacity, or inadvertence and ordinary negligence in isolated incidents were not considered misconduct; the claimant should have been eligible for benefits.

   In order to establish a federal Department of Transportation-regulated employee’s ineligibility for state unemployment benefits because of a positive drug or alcohol test result pursuant to 49 U.S.C.S. § 31306, there must be clear and convincing evidence that the testing was conducted according to the federal guidelines; because no evidence was produced that the truck driver was informed of his right to request drug testing of the split specimen within 72 hours, misconduct for purposes of unemployment benefits as required by Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c05s71-5-513" target="_self">71-5-513</a></cite>A(1)(b) was not established and the Board of Review of the Mississippi Employment Security Commission’s decision denying the truck driver unemployment benefits was improper.

       Administrative decision that a day care center worker who left the center without permission after an argument with her supervisor over the care of a child was properly terminated for misconduct and was, therefore, ineligible to receive unemployment compensation benefits was supported by substantial evidence that the worker was asked not to leave because the center would then be understaffed and was told that if she did leave she would be considered as having quit.

       The uttering of vulgar obscenities by the claimant directed at her supervisor rose to the level of a disqualifying act of insubordination and misconduct where the utterings were the result of the claimant’s displeasure with her supervisor’s repeated orders to perform an authorized and reasonable task and the encounter even went so far as to briefly disrupt two of the employer’s production lines.

       A bank teller was not discharged for misconduct and, therefore, was entitled to unemployment compensation benefits where she was fired due to a $ 2,000 shortage in her cash drawer, but the bank believed the shortage to have been caused by an honest mistake and fired her not for dishonesty, but rather for negligent actions consistent with an alleged policy of the bank that tellers would be automatically terminated following any occurrence of a teller’s drawer being out of balance by more than $ 1,000.

       The circuit court did not err in sustaining the denial of unemployment compensation to the claimant on the basis of misconduct for failing to obey directives from his supervisors to avoid spending too much time in the work area of a particular married female employee; the directive was issued because of the expressed concerns of the employer with workplace violence coupled with two incidents involving the spouses of the claimant and the other employee, and the claimant failed to abide by the directives to avoid having contact with the other employee.

       A city firefighter who pled nolo contendere to a charge of sale of cocaine was guilty of misconduct connected with his employment so as to be disqualified from receiving unemployment compensation benefits. A firefighter is in a position requiring a great deal of responsibility, and he must be able to respond to emergency situations. A firefighter cannot violate the trust of citizens, and the city had no other choice but to fire the firefighter when he failed to clear his name. Regardless of the legal aspects of a plea of nolo contendere, it creates an implication of guilt, and the firefighter’s reputation was tainted. City of Corinth v. Cox, 565 So. 2d 1142, 1990 Miss.

      <p>
       An employee who was terminated for excessive absenteeism was not disqualified from receiving unemployment compensation benefits due to misconduct, where the employee was a good employee for 13 years, it was only after her work schedule changed that she began to have problems arising from child care and transportation difficulties, and her supervisor thwarted her attempts to alleviate her problems by refusing to change her lunch schedule to enable her to pick up her children from school.

       An employer failed to meet his burden of proving disqualifying misconduct, arising from a fight between 2 employees, by substantial, clear and convincing evidence, where the only eyewitness who testified at the hearing was the employee, and the employer offered a report prepared by a security officer, an unsigned summary of witness testimony without any proof of who prepared it, 3 handwritten statements of witnesses, and a list of safety rules which included a prohibition of fighting or provoking a fight, since uncorroborated hearsay testimony is insufficient to rise to the required level of substantial evidence.

   The fact that an employee has been involved in an isolated fight with a fellow employee at the workplace, standing alone, is not “misconduct” within the meaning of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c05s71-5-513ol1A1b" target="_self">71-5-513(A)(1)(b)</a></cite> so as to disqualify that person from receiving unemployment benefits should that person be discharged as a result of the fight.

      <p>
       <p>
   “Misconduct” imports conduct that reasonable and fair-minded external observers would consider a wanton disregard of the employer’s legitimate interests. Something more than mere negligence must be shown, though repeated neglect of an employer’s interests may rise to the dignity of misconduct. An employee’s refusal to expose himself or herself to unreasonable danger or risk of harm does not constitute misconduct. An employee does not surrender his or her right to regard his or her personal safety when he or she accepts employment. A worker undertaking a hazardous duty has a right to emerge from the employment a whole person, the same as a pencil pusher with an office job. An employer has no countervailing interest that the law ought to respect. An employee has the right to walk off the job without his or her conduct being regarded “misconduct” if a reasonably prudent person under the circumstances would believe that the danger was so grave that there existed a real danger of death or serious physical injury, and if the employee had no reasonable alternative. Where there exists such facts and circumstances, known to or reasonably available to the employer, the employee’s refusal of the assignment without more is not “misconduct” under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c05s71-5-513ol1A1b" target="_self">71-5-513(A)(1)(b)</a></cite>. Thus, an employee of a company specializing in servicing oil well problems was not guilty of misconduct within the meaning of the Mississippi Employment Security Act by refusing an assignment to correct a potential blowout on an oil drilling rig where the job involved substantial danger to life and limb and the employer gave the employee no option but to do what he reasonably considered extremely dangerous, even though the employee may have been negligent in refusing the job before inspecting the site.

       In an action by an employee seeking unemployment compensation benefits following her termination as a cashier from a supermarket, the employee was not guilty of misconduct, so as to be disqualified from receiving benefits, where she had refused to take a polygraph test conducted by an independent firm hired by her employer to question a number of its employees regarding suspected misconduct, she had signed an agreement to make restitution for certain items which she had allegedly consumed from the delicatessen in the market without paying for them, and where this consumption of small quantities of food without payment was neither willful nor intentional, notwithstanding that an employee’s deliberate embezzlement of funds entrusted to her care in the course of her employment would constitute misconduct.

Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c05s71-5-513ol1A1b" target="_self">71-5-513(A)(1)(b)</a></cite> was appropriate because he failed to timely seek review of the denial of his claim for unemployment benefits. The employee failed to show good cause for the late notice of appeal because he did not provide any evidence that his failure to receive notice of the claims examiner’s decision was due to an act beyond his control.

    Initial determination [Repealed effective July 1, 2023].

     </h3>
     <p>
      Upon the taking of a claim by the department, an initial determination thereon shall be made promptly and shall include a determination with respect to whether or not benefits are payable, the week with respect to which benefits shall commence, the weekly benefit amount payable and the maximum duration of benefits. In any case in which the payment or denial of benefits will be determined by the provisions of subsection A(4) of Section 71-5-513, the examiner shall promptly transmit all the evidence with respect to that subsection to the department, which, on the basis of evidence so submitted and such additional evidence as it may require, shall make an initial determination with respect thereto. An initial determination may for good cause be reconsidered. The claimant, his most recent employing unit and all employers whose experience-rating record would be charged with benefits pursuant to such determination shall be promptly notified of such initial determination or any amended initial determination and the reason therefor. Benefits shall be denied or, if the claimant is otherwise eligible, promptly paid in accordance with the initial determination or amended initial determination. The jurisdiction of the department over benefit claims which have not been appealed shall be continuous. The claimant or any party to the initial determination or amended initial determination may file an appeal from such initial determination or amended initial determination within fourteen (14) days after notification thereof, or after the date such notification was sent to his last known address.
     </p>
     <p>
      Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, benefits shall be paid promptly in accordance with a determination or redetermination, or the decision of an appeal tribunal, the Board of Review or a reviewing court upon the issuance of such determination, redetermination or decision in favor of the claimant (regardless of the pendency of the period to apply for reconsideration, file an appeal, or petition for judicial review, as the case may be, or the pendency of any such application, filing or petition), unless and until such determination, redetermination or decision has been modified or reversed by a subsequent redetermination or decision, in which event benefits shall be paid or denied in accordance with such modifying or reversing redetermination or decision. Any benefits finally determined to have been erroneously paid may be set up as an overpayment to the claimant and must be liquidated before any future benefits can be paid to the claimant. If, subsequent to such initial determination or amended initial determination, benefits with respect to any week for which a claim has been filed are denied for reasons other than matters included in the initial determination or amended initial determination, the claimant shall be promptly notified of the denial and the reason therefor and may appeal therefrom in accordance with the procedure herein described for appeals from initial determination or amended initial determination.

      <p>
       Mississippi Department of Employment Security was not entitled to use collection actions to recover unemployment benefits paid where there was no nondisclosure or fraud in the case of an employee who was later disqualified for misconduct; even if voluntary repayment was allowed, the language of the notice to the employee did not suggest that it was voluntary in nature. Acy v. Miss. Empl. Sec. Comm'n, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 54 (Miss. Ct. App. Feb. 6, 2007), sub. op., op. withdrawn, 960 So. 2d 592, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 469 (Miss. Ct. App. 2007).

      <p>
       <p>
   Refusal to extend a 14-day deadline imposed on a motion for reconsideration was error because an employment commission had the discretion to accept new evidence and make appropriate adjustments to a prior decision awarding unemployment benefits where an employee had subsequently confessed to a crime; the deadline was not under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c05s71-5-517" target="_self">71-5-517</a></cite>, but was stated in a letter to the employer. Herring Gas Co. v. Miss. Empl. Sec.

       A hearing officer of the Mississippi Employment Security Commission does not conduct a trial de novo. Instead, the hearing officer is to receive all the evidence accumulated by the examiner, and then on the basis of evidence so submitted and such additional evidence as it may acquire, render an appellate decision. It is of no legal consequence that a party does not appear at a hearing. Estate of Dulaney v. Miss. Empl. Sec. Comm'n, 805 So. 2d 643, 2002 Miss. App. LEXIS 50 (Miss. Ct. App. 2002).
      </p>
      <p>
       Once unemployment benefits commission received documents filed by the employee’s former employer stating that the employee had voluntarily quit his job, the commission had good cause to reconsider its initial determination awarding benefits, even though the documents were untimely filed. Caraway v. Miss. Empl. Sec. Comm'n, 826 So. 2d 100, 2002 Miss. App. LEXIS 483 (Miss. Ct. App. 2002).
      </p>
      <p>
       When there was no appeal from an initial determination, it was logical to assume that the Commission’s jurisdiction over that determination did not continue indefinitely. Maxwell v. Miss. Empl. Sec. Comm'n, 792 So. 2d 1031, 2001 Miss. App. LEXIS 332 (Miss. Ct. App. 2001).

   Unemployment benefits paid to company employees during a strike could not be recouped by the Mississippi Employment Security Commission as a result of a monetary settlement of unfair labor practice charges before the National Labor Relations Board, since §§<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c05s71-5-19ol14" target="_self">71-5-19(4)</a></cite> and<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c05s71-5-517" target="_self">71-5-517</a></cite> provided no basis, implicit or explicit, for recoupment of the benefits where there was no evidence of wrongdoing or misrepresentation by the employees.

      <p>
       <p>
   The Mississippi Employment Security Commission may not extend the statutory time limits for appeals absent a showing of some event not caused by a party which affected that party’s substantial rights; thus, the Commission’s practice of allowing an extra 3 days for delivery of the mail to be added to the 14-day time for appeal prescribed by §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c05s71-5-517" target="_self">71-5-517</a></cite> exceeded its statutory authority.

   Under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c05s71-5-517" target="_self">71-5-517</a></cite>, a party to the initial determination – claimant or employer – has 14 days from the time that the notification is mailed to appeal to the Board of Review; only if the notification is by means other than mail to the party’s last known address will the time begin to run upon notification of the claim.

       Inasmuch as a notification of disqualification was inadvertently mailed to claimant’s former address, even though he had previously notified the Employment Security Commission of his new address, the fourteen day time frame within which he had the right to appeal the decision did not begin to run from the date of mailing, but rather from the date on which the claimant actually received notification.

       Former employer waived the issue of the untimeliness of a claimant’s appeal from the initial determination because the employer did not raise the issue at the hearing before the administrative law judge, or in its appeal to the board of review, but, instead, the issue was first raised on appeal before the circuit court. Moreover, the administrative law judge’s determination that the appeal was to be heard on the merits was not an abuse of discretion. Woodland Vill. Nursing Ctr., LLC v. Miss. Dep't of Empl.

       Employee was not entitled to unemployment benefits because her appeal was not timely filed, and the record did not present any set of facts that would support a showing of good cause to excuse her untimely filing where, when asked why she did not file the appeal in a timely manner, the employee simply stated that she had other things going on and that she thought her claim would be denied anyway. Jackson v. Miss. Dep't of Empl. Sec., 121 So.3d 298, 2013 Miss. App. LEXIS 567 (Miss. Ct. App. 2013).

      <p>
       <p>
   Where claimant was awarded benefits by a Mississippi Department of Employment Security claims examiner, the employer filed an untimely appeal of the decision of the Mississippi Department of Employment Security outside the fourteen-day period set forth in Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c05s71-5-517" target="_self">71-5-517</a></cite>; the circuit court could only decide the case in its favor if the employer could show good cause for its untimely appeal. The employer failed to provide sufficient evidence to overcome the presumption that the letter mailed by the MDES was timely delivered; therefore, the circuit court erred by reversing the decision awarding benefits.

Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c05s71-5-517" target="_self">71-5-517</a></cite>, the administrative law judge did not err in concluding that the claimant had abandoned her appeal based upon her failure to appear and in denying the appeal.

      <p>
       Denial of unemployment benefits to the employee was appropriate because he failed to timely seek review of the denial of his claim for unemployment benefits. The employee failed to show good cause for the late notice of appeal because he did not provide any evidence that his failure to receive notice of the claims examiner’s decision was due to an act beyond his control.

       It was error to reverse a decision of the Mississippi Department of Economic Security Board of Review dismissing a claimant’s appeal from the decision of an administrative law judge because (1) the appeal was filed after the statutory deadline, and (2) the claimant showed no good cause for the delay. Miss. Dep't of Empl. Sec. v. Matthews, 203 So.3d 46, 2016 Miss. App. LEXIS 684 (Miss. Ct. App. 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because the Mississippi Employment Security Commission (MESC) was not a circuit, chancery or county court, the Mississippi Rules of Civil Procedure, and specifically Miss. R. Civ. P. 6, were not applicable to its administrative hearings or appeals. Miss. Empl. Sec. Comm'n v. Parker, 903 So. 2d 42, 2005 Miss. LEXIS 58 (Miss. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Employee timely filed her appeal to the Mississippi Employment Security Commission’s (MESC) office on June 4, 2002, and the appeals referee held a hearing on June 26, 2002. The appeals referee mailed the decision affirming the claim examiner’s decision to the employee on July 1, 2002, and the employee filed her notice of appeal to the MESC Board of Review on July 16, 2002; thus, the Mississippi Supreme Court, strictly construing the 14-day time period of Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c05s71-5-519" target="_self">71-5-519</a></cite>, held her appeal was untimely. Miss. Empl. Sec. Comm'n v. Parker, 903 So. 2d 42, 2005 Miss. LEXIS 58 (Miss. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Pursuant to Miss. R. Civ. P. 6(a) and 6(e), the claimant’s time to appeal her case to the Mississippi Employment Security Commission Board of Review began on July 2, 2002, the day after the appeals referee mailed her decision to the claimant, and ended July 19, 2002, which reflected the addition of an additional three days for the claimant to respond, as required by Rule 6(e); therefore, the claimant’s appeal was filed timely with the Board of Review. Miss. Empl. Sec. Comm'n v. Parker, 905 So. 2d 613, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 303 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Decision of the Appeals Referee became final and binding on the Board of Review as of December 28, 2001; the deadline for the employer to file an appeal was December 28, 2001, and the Board of Review did not receive the employer’s appeal until December 31, 2001, three days after the statutory period expired. Miss. Empl. Sec. Comm'n v. Marion County Sheriff's Dep't, 865 So. 2d 1153, 2004 Miss. LEXIS 183 (Miss. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Original circuit court’s reverse and remand was not concerned with the merits of the truck driver’s claim for unemployment benefits, but, rather, it was reversed on a procedural issue, namely, the timeliness of an appeal and remanded for a decision on the merits, and there was not a circuit court determination that the record was insufficient to decide whether the employer had produced enough evidence to support the discharge of its employee; thus, the Board of Review of the Mississippi Employment Security Commission’s decision to bar review of the truck driver’s appeal on timeliness grounds was indicative of the finality of the agency’s decision, and the circuit court held that it was error to do so and therefore, the circuit court’s reverse and remand on the issue of timeliness was not interlocutory in nature, and the employer should have appealed that decision. Southwood Door Co. v. Burton, 847 So. 2d 833, 2003 Miss. LEXIS 276 (Miss. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       An appeal by the employer city in an unemployment compensation case was untimely where it was not filed within 14 days of the referee’s decision, notwithstanding the assertion that notice of the decision was sent to the wrong address; the address to which the notice was sent was used by the city on numerous documents throughout the proceedings. City of Tupelo v. Mississippi Empl. Sec. Comm'n, 748 So. 2d 151, 1999 Miss. LEXIS 315 (Miss. 1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       Notice of an employer’s appeal of a referee’s decision was sufficient to satisfy the claimant’s minimum due process rights, where the Board of Review mailed a notice to the claimant but did not notify the claimant’s attorney of the appeal. Notifying the claimant only and not the attorney satisfies minimum due process requirements so long as such notice is “reasonably calculated” to apprise the claimant of necessary information. Booth v. Mississippi Employment Sec. Com., 588 So. 2d 422, 1991 Miss. LEXIS 653 (Miss. 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the Board of Review had remanded a cause to the referee for the taking of additional testimony but, without such testimony having been taken, the Board reversed the referee’s original decision, it was error for the Board to reconsider and render its decision without first having given notice to the employee.

       Record established that an applicant’s appeal of the denial of benefits was untimely where the appeal was stamped as received four days after the deadline, and the applicant’s assertion that the Mississippi Department of Employment Security’s records were unreliable was wholly unsupported by the record. Onyia v. Miss. Empl. Sec. Comm'n, 98 So.3d 1136, 2012 Miss. App. LEXIS 617 (Miss. Ct. App. 2012).

       The statute demands more than the act of mailing; it also requires the result of delivery. Holt v. Mississippi Empl. Sec. Comm'n, 724 So. 2d 466, 1998 Miss. App. LEXIS 1065 (Miss. Ct. App. 1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       The defendant commission is required to consider evidence offered by the claimant and to determine whether it overcomes the presumption of delivery of mail; however, where the only evidence presented is a denial of receipt, the presumption is not overcome.

       Pursuant to Miss. R. Civ. P. 6(a) and 6(e), the claimant’s time to appeal her case to the Mississippi Employment Security Commission Board of Review began on July 2, 2002, the day after the appeals referee mailed her decision to the claimant, and ended July 19, 2002, which reflected the addition of an additional three days for the claimant to respond, as required by Rule 6(e); therefore, the claimant’s appeal was filed timely with the Board of Review. Miss. Empl. Sec. Comm'n v. Parker, 905 So. 2d 613, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 303 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).

      <p>
       Notice of an employer’s appeal of a referee’s decision was sufficient to satisfy the claimant’s minimum due process rights, where the Board of Review mailed a notice to the claimant but did not notify the claimant’s attorney of the appeal. Notifying the claimant only and not the attorney satisfies minimum due process requirements so long as such notice is “reasonably calculated” to apprise the claimant of necessary information.

       Employer filed for appeal from the decision of the Board of Review of the Mississippi Employment Security Commission, more than two weeks after the statutory deadline and apparently, based on the circuit court’s decision to deny the Commission’s motion to dismiss, demonstrated the requisite “good cause” for the untimely filing. However, the appellate court was left to assume that fact since the transcripts were not to be found, and further review of the record revealed an absence of any evidence that might have supported a finding of good cause; thus, the employer’s failure to provide such evidence, when viewed under the present law and the appellate court’s standard of review, required reversal of the circuit court’s decision ordering a new hearing on behalf of the employer.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Within ten (10) days after the decision of the Board of Review has become final, any party aggrieved thereby may secure judicial review thereof by commencing an action, in the circuit court of the county in which the plaintiff resides, against the department for the review of such decision, in which action any other party to the proceeding before the Board of Review shall be made a defendant. In cases wherein the plaintiff is not a resident of the State of Mississippi, such action may be filed in the circuit court of the county in which the employer resides, the county in which the cause of action arose, or in the county of employment. In such action, a petition which need not be verified, but which shall state the grounds upon which a review is sought, shall be served upon the department or upon such person as the department may designate, and such service shall be deemed completed service on all parties; but there shall be left with the party so served as many copies of the petition as there are defendants, and the department shall forthwith mail one (1) such copy to each such defendant. With its answer, the department shall certify and file with said court all documents and papers and a transcript of all testimony taken in the matter, together with the Board of Review’s findings of fact and decision therein. The department may also, in its discretion, certify to such court questions of law involved in any decision. In any judicial proceedings under this section, the findings of the Board of Review as to the facts, if supported by evidence and in the absence of fraud, shall be conclusive, and the jurisdiction of the court shall be confined to questions of law. Such actions, and the questions so certified, shall be heard in a summary manner and shall be given precedence over all other civil cases. An appeal may be taken from the decision of the circuit court of the county in which the plaintiff resides to the Supreme Court of Mississippi, in the same manner, but not inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter, as is provided in civil cases. It shall not be necessary, in any judicial proceeding under this section, to enter exceptions to the rulings of the Board of Review, and no bond shall be required for entering such appeal. Upon the final determination of such judicial proceeding, the Board of Review shall enter an order in accordance with such determination. A petition for judicial review shall not act as a supersedeas or stay unless the Board of Review shall so order.

       Applicant was entitled to unemployment benefits upon termination from employment because substantial evidence was not presented below to support a finding that when filling out an employment application the applicant acted in such willful or wanton disregard of the employer’s interest that disqualification of unemployment benefits was warranted, as the applicant did not, when applying for a job, intentionally misrepresent whether the employee had ever previously filed a workers’ compensation claim or been injured on the job. Bedford Care Ctr. of Marion, LLC v. Nicholson, 218 So.3d 1176, 2017 Miss. App. LEXIS 38 (Miss. Ct. App. 2017).

   Record failed to support the conclusion of the Mississippi Department of Employment Security that a worker constituted an employee under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c05s71-5-11ol1J14" target="_self">71-5-11(J)(14)</a></cite> because the worker constituted an independent contractor; the worker set his own hours and received a commission, not an hourly wage, and the employer failed to exercise control, nor did it possess a right of control, over the details of the actual sales work at issue. College Network v. Miss. Dep't of Empl. Sec., 114 So.3d 740, 2013 Miss. App. LEXIS 179 (Miss. Ct. App. 2013).

   Benefits claimant was properly denied unemployment compensation because substantial evidence showed that he voluntarily left his job under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c05s71-5-513ol1A1a" target="_self">71-5-513(A)(1)(a)</a></cite> when he turned in his keys following a dispute over pay and a request for time off; moreover, he failed to show good cause for leaving due to this dispute because the job was not detrimental to his health, safety, morals, or physical fitness. Waldrup v. Miss. Empl. Sec. Comm'n, 951 So. 2d 597, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 140 (Miss. Ct. App. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       Appellate court affirmed the trial court’s ruling that the employee was terminated for misconduct and not entitled to unemployment benefits as the employee never disputed his three disciplinary write-ups when they occurred, and the employer’s policy allowed it to pay the employee for the full 40-hour work week if he was less than five minutes late. Thus, the evidence supported the finding that the employee’s actions constituted misconduct for having three write-ups in one year. Daniels v. Miss. Empl. Sec. Comm'n, 914 So. 2d 268, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 771 (Miss. Ct. App. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       In an appeal from a decision of the Mississippi Employment Security Commission (MESC), and the circuit court’s affirmance thereon, the facts were: (1) the employee was warned in regard to an excessive number of sick days, early leaves and absences; (2) he received an unsatisfactory performance review because he had not been cooperative with campus security; (3) he was disruptive at a campus physical plant and he left work without permission; (3) he was placed on probation regarding his job performance; and finally, (4) he was arrested for robbery and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. In its infinite wisdom, the appellate court concluded the employee was terminated, not because of the aforementioned performance issues (unrelated to his incarceration), but because of the events which surrounded his two day incarceration; in that respect, the poor fellow did not want his employer to know about his arrest, so he had his girlfriend call his employer and state that he would be absent for two days, and without the employee’s permission, the girlfriend told the employer that same was due his mother’s illness; his girlfriend lied, but he did not, the appellate court concluded his employer did not need to know the reason for said two day absence, and the denial of his application for unemployment benefits was reversed. Broome v. Miss. Empl. Sec. Comm'n, 921 So. 2d 360, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 397 (Miss. Ct. App. 2005), rev'd, 921 So. 2d 334, 2006 Miss. LEXIS 45 (Miss. 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       Pursuant to Miss. R. App. P. 2(a) and 4(a), the appellate court will not consider an appeal that is not timely filed. The former employee filed her notice of appeal regarding the denial of unemployment benefits roughly 42 days after the entry of the final judgment by the circuit court, and her appeal was subject to dismissal for that reason alone. Westbrook v. Miss. Empl. Sec. Comm'n, 910 So. 2d 1135, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 203 (Miss. Ct. App. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Employer filed for appeal from the decision of the Board of Review of the Mississippi Employment Security Commission, more than two weeks after the statutory deadline and apparently, based on the circuit court’s decision to deny the Commission’s motion to dismiss, demonstrated the requisite “good cause” for the untimely filing. However, the appellate court was left to assume that fact since the transcripts were not to be found, and further review of the record revealed an absence of any evidence that might have supported a finding of good cause; thus, the employer’s failure to provide such evidence, when viewed under the present law and the appellate court’s standard of review, required reversal of the circuit court’s decision ordering a new hearing on behalf of the employer. Miss. Empl. Sec. Comm'n v. Gilbert Home Health Agency, 909 So. 2d 1142, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 63 (Miss. Ct. App. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       There was substantial evidence to indicate that the employee violated the employer’s policy prohibiting possession of a Zip drive on company premises. Further, substantial evidence was presented that the employee had knowledge that such action constituted a violation of company policy; therefore, the Mississippi Employment Security Commission Board of Review’s decision to deny unemployment benefits was not arbitrary or capricious and was supported by substantial evidence. Howell v. Miss. Empl. Sec. Comm'n, 906 So. 2d 766, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 1145 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).

Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c05s71-5-531" target="_self">71-5-531</a></cite> because the fact that the Mississippi Employment Security Commission’s decision conflicted with the decisions of the claims examiner and the appeal’s referee did not, in and of itself, make the Commission’s decision arbitrary, capricious and not supported by substantial evidence and the applicable law. Credible evidence supported the Commission’s decision that the claimant was disqualified from receiving unemployment benefits because her actions in refusing to comply with company policy regarding working closing shifts constituted misconduct as defined in Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c05s71-5-513ol1A1b" target="_self">71-5-513(A)(1)(b)</a></cite>. Miss. Empl. Sec. Comm'n v. Noil, 878 So. 2d 1089, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 723 (Miss. Ct.

Gordon v. Miss. Empl. Sec. Comm'n, 864 So. 2d 1013, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 51 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).

   Former employee argued that he was not collaterally estopped from raising his wrongful-termination-based claims against his former employer because the Mississippi Employment Security Commission (MESC) found that he was terminated for misconduct, as he had been denied a fair opportunity to litigate his state claims because he was prohibited from calling witnesses; this issue should have been raised through a direct appeal of the MESC’s Board of Review decision under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c05s71-5-531" target="_self">71-5-531</a></cite>. Raiola v. Chevron U.S.A., Inc., 872 So. 2d 79, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 127 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).

      <p>
       Where a trial court reversed the Mississippi Employment Security Commission’s decision awarding unemployment benefits to a claimant, without giving a reason for doing so, the court’s action was by definition arbitrary and capricious and was reversed. Miss. Empl. Sec. Comm'n v. Penn's Fish House, Inc., 866 So. 2d 503, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 128 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Appellate court held that its task was to determine whether it was reasonable for the employee to believe he had been terminated; under the circumstances there was substantial evidence from which the appellate court could find that the employee believed he had been terminated due to the employer’s attendance policy and in light of his unexcused absences, so he was entitled to unemployment benefits. Miss. Empl. Sec. Comm'n v. Nordstrom, 858 So. 2d 904, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 1034 (Miss. Ct. App. 2003).

      <p>
       Administrative decision that a day care center worker who left the center without permission after an argument with her supervisor over the care of a child was properly terminated for misconduct and was, therefore, ineligible to receive unemployment compensation benefits was supported by substantial evidence that the worker was asked not to leave because the center would then be understaffed and was told that if she did leave she would be considered as having quit. Otto v. Miss. Empl. Sec. Comm'n, 839 So. 2d 547, 2002 Miss. App. LEXIS 866 (Miss. Ct. App. 2002).
      </p>
      <p>
       The trial court erred in reversing the decision of the Mississippi Employment Security Commission which allowed unemployment insurance benefits to an employee discharged from her position where the cause of her discharge had been her employer’s dissatisfaction with her work performance and some errors she had made in bookkeeping procedure but where there was no evidence to show that the employee had failed to perform the work to the best of her ability or had wilfully failed to follow any instructions given by her employer or that she had been guilty of any wilful or intentional neglect or any misappropriation of funds.

       Because the Mississippi Department of Employment Security’s Board of Review supported its decision that a terminated employee was not disqualified from receiving unemployment benefits for misconduct with substantial evidence—the employee’s testimony that the employee had not intentionally lied to supervisors, that the employee brought home company information only to protect the information and to complete work, and that the employee’s personal internet use was neither unusual or concerning—the decision was neither arbitrary, nor capricious. Columbus Light & Water Dep't v. Miss. Dep't of Empl. Sec., — So.3d —, 2019 Miss. App. LEXIS 105 (Miss. Ct. App. Mar. 19, 2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       Administrative law judge found that the employer failed to prove that the employee’s actions were misconduct, and the Board of Review’s decision was not made in a whimsical manner and the judgment was not arbitrary or capricious, and was instead supported by substantial evidence. Franklin Collection Serv. v. Miss. Dep't of Empl. Sec., 184 So.3d 330, 2016 Miss. App. LEXIS 19 (Miss. Ct. App. 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although company policy called for automatic termination, the employer offered no proof that the employee deliberately misrepresented a processing fee, and while the company had ample reason to terminate the employee, a termination for cause does not necessarily require that unemployment benefits be denied; the administrative law judge (ALJ) found that the cited reason for termination did not amount to the requisite misconduct to preclude benefits, the Board of Review adopted the findings of the ALJ, and the findings were supported by substantial evidence and were conclusive. Franklin Collection Serv. v. Miss. Dep't of Empl. Sec., 184 So.3d 330, 2016 Miss. App. LEXIS 19 (Miss. Ct. App. 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       Appellate court was precluded from taking any new evidence regarding the reliability of Mississippi Department of Employment Security’s records as there was no evidence of fraud in the findings made by a review board regarding the timeliness of an applicant’s appeal of the denial of benefits; rather, the evidence in the record established that the applicant’s appeal was in fact untimely. Onyia v. Miss. Empl. Sec. Comm'n, 98 So.3d 1136, 2012 Miss. App. LEXIS 617 (Miss. Ct. App. 2012).
      </p>

       Substantial evidence supported the decision to deny a former prison employee unemployment benefits based on misconduct where the warden testified that inmates had taken items out of the kitchen while she was the kitchen supervisor, she had possessed unauthorized computer games at work, possibly causing them to be used on the computer in the food supervisor’s office, she may have allowed an inmate into the kitchen who was not authorized to be in that location at that time, and she had brought unauthorized items into the correctional facility. Henry v. Miss. Dep't of Empl. Sec., 962 So. 2d 94, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 487 (Miss. Ct. App. 2007).

       <p>
   Where the school district failed to renew claimant’s contract as a physical education teacher and head basketball coach based on its dissatisfaction with the basketball program and the physical education program, the cited reasons did not amount to the requisite misconduct necessary to preclude claimant from receiving unemployment benefits; the circuit court’s decision affirming the award of unemployment benefits was supported by substantial evidence under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c05s71-5-531" target="_self">71-5-531</a></cite>. Greenwood Pub. Sch. Dist. v. Miss. Dep't of Empl. Sec., 962 So. 2d 684, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 113 (Miss.

      <p>
       <p>
   Finding that the employee had not engaged in misconduct while on the job in an action concerning the denial of unemployment benefits was inappropriate based on the record, which consisted of the employee’s testifying that she did not return to work after November 21, 2003, and that she did not provide her employer with a doctor’s excuse; the circuit court’s review should have been limited to questions of law as required by Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c05s71-5-531" target="_self">71-5-531</a></cite>. Bedford Care Ctr. v. Kirk, 935 So. 2d 1135, 2006 Miss. App. LEXIS 573 (Miss. Ct. App. 2006).

       While trial court’s decision to reverse the finding of the Mississippi Employment Security Commission (MESC) Board of Review that held that the employee had quit her job voluntarily as it was not supported by substantial evidence was affirmed, the trial court erred in making a factual determination as to whether the employee had quit or had been fired as the trial court sat as a court of appeals and its jurisdiction was confined to questions of law. Gilbreath v. Miss. Empl. Sec. Comm'n, 910 So. 2d 682, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 177 (Miss. Ct. App. 2005).

       Decision of the Board of Review for the Mississippi Employment Security Commission denying unemployment benefits was supported by substantial evidence, where the referee found the employee at a casino accepted a gratuity from a patron in the form of a “comp ticket,” which security guards were not allowed to give under the employer’s established policy; such conduct showed an intentional disregard of the employer’s interest.

       An employer failed to meet his burden of proving disqualifying misconduct, arising from a fight between 2 employees, by substantial, clear and convincing evidence, where the only eyewitness who testified at the hearing was the employee, and the employer offered a report prepared by a security officer, an unsigned summary of witness testimony without any proof of who prepared it, 3 handwritten statements of witnesses, and a list of safety rules which included a prohibition of fighting or provoking a fight, since uncorroborated hearsay testimony is insufficient to rise to the required level of substantial evidence. Mississippi Employment Sec. Com. v. McLane-Southern, Inc., 583 So. 2d 626, 1991 Miss. LEXIS 435 (Miss. 1991).

       Scope of review of both Supreme Court and Circuit Court is limited to findings of Board of Review, and order of Board of Review on facts is conclusive if supported by substantial evidence, absent fraud. Melody Manor, Inc. v. McLeod, 511 So. 2d 1383, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2706 (Miss. 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       Findings by Board of Review of Employment Security Commission that claimant was overpaid because of error in initial evaluation of claim was determination of fact which should not be reversed by circuit court since it was supported by substantial evidence, but question whether overpayment could be collected was not passed upon by referee or Board, and thus court should not pass upon questions of law not determined by administrative agencies. Mississippi Employment Sec. Com. v. Sellers, 505 So. 2d 281, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2480 (Miss. 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       The word “evidence” in the statute should be construed to mean substantial evidence; thus, a denial of unemployment compensation would be reversed where the only evidence supporting the decision was a hearsay letter alleging that the employee had refused an offer of work. Williams v. Mississippi Employment Sec. Com., 395 So. 2d 964, 1981 Miss. LEXIS 1965 (Miss. 1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       In an action by an employer against the Mississippi Employment Security Commission challenging a ruling that employees were entitled to unemployment benefits as the result of an unjustified lockout by the employer, the circuit court erred in reversing the decision of the Commission where there was substantial evidence to support the finding that the lockout was occasioned solely by the employer and was without justification and that the employees were ready and willing to continue working. Mississippi Employment Sec. Com. v. Georgia-Pacific Corp., 394 So. 2d 299, 1981 Miss. LEXIS 1897 (Miss. 1981).

      <p>
       An order of the board of review of the employment security commission as to facts, if supported by evidence and in the absence of fraud, is conclusive upon the trial court on review.

      </p>
      <p>
       Where evidence amply supported the finding of the commission that an employee who quit her job in a moment of pique during a brief misunderstanding with her employer had quit suitable employment voluntarily and was not entitled to benefits, the court was without statutory authority to enter a contrary judgment. Mississippi Employment Sec. Com. v. Rakestraw, 254 Miss. 56, 179 So. 2d 830, 1965 Miss. LEXIS 923 (Miss. 1965).

       Finding of board of review that claimant voluntarily left her employment because of pregnancy, held supported by substantial evidence. Mississippi Employment Sec. Com. v. Corley, 246 Miss. 43, 148 So. 2d 715, 1963 Miss. LEXIS 415 (Miss. 1963).
      </p>

   Findings of fact by the board of review under the unemployment compensation law, being amply supported, should have been taken as conclusive both by the trial court and the supreme court on review.

      <p>
       Circuit court properly affirmed the decision of the Board of Review of the Mississippi Department of Employment Security denying the former employee’s claim for unemployment benefits as the Board found that he was disqualified from receiving benefits based on his misconduct because it was evident that the employee’s racially charged comments amounted to an intentional disregard of the standards of behavior which his employer had the right to expect from him; and his conduct evidenced a complete disregard of his employer’s interest.

      </p>
      <p>
       Court of appeals erred by reevaluating the evidence and substituting its judgment for that of the Mississippi Employment Security Commission (MESC) because the MESC’s decision that an employer did not prove misconduct was supported by substantial evidence; the evidence substantially supported the MESC’s conclusion that the employer did not prove that an employee falsified her time sheets, and it found evidence of the employee’s inefficient use of technology, not falsification of hours worked.

   Substantial evidence under Miss. Code Ann.<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c05s71-5-531" target="_self">71-5-531</a></cite> supported the denial of unemployment benefits to a claimant as her actions constituted misconduct under Miss. Code Ann §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t71c05s71-5-513" target="_self">71-5-513</a></cite> as she was terminated for insubordination where: (1) she shut down her machine without supervisor approval and refused to sign the written warning detailing her actions; (2) she was loud and argumentative during the write-up and when she arrived to pick up her paycheck; and (3) she showed up to work two hours prior to the time she was instructed.

       Employee sought unemployment benefits after she was terminated from her employment with a city.

       Appellant had 20 days from the date of March 28, 2014 to appeal to the circuit court, but she filed her appeal on August 18, 2014, over four months late; the copy of the decision dated March 28, with the line stating “date mailed March 28,” and resent to appellant on July 29, was admissible evidence of mailing under the business-records hearsay exception, and as appellant offered no proof of good cause other than her own statement that she never received the March 28 decision, which was not enough, her appeal was properly dismissed as untimely.

       Where an attorney appealed the denial of unemployment benefits, it was error to find that the attorney’s appeal was untimely based on the failure to include a civil cover sheet, because the attorney demonstrated good cause for an extension of the filing deadline since the cover sheet requirement did not bar the otherwise timely notice of appeal.

   A public school teacher’s wearing of a head-wrap as an expression of her religious and cultural heritage as a member of the African Hebrew Israelites in violation of the school’s dress code was constitutionally protected religious and cultural expression, such that the Mississippi Employment Security Commission had no authority to deny her claim for unemployment compensation benefits after she was discharged for insubordination when she refused to discontinue wearing the head-wrap, even though there is no specific tenet of the African Hebrew Israelites mandating that women wear headdress, the teacher was not a regular participant in the organized activities of a particular church, synagogue or other religious body, she might have been “selective in wearing the traditional head-wrap” in that at times she did not wear it, and even though her conduct may have been misconduct had it not been constitutionally protected expression.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The Legislature finds that when illegal immigrants have been sheltered and harbored in this state and encouraged to reside in this state through the benefit of work without verifying immigration status, these practices impede and obstruct the enforcement of federal immigration law, undermine the security of our borders, and impermissibly restrict the privileges and immunities of the citizens of Mississippi. The Legislature further finds that illegal immigration is encouraged when public agencies within this state provide public benefits without verifying immigration status. The Legislature further finds that the Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution reserves to the states those powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution. Therefore, the Legislature declares that it is a compelling public interest of this state to discourage illegal immigration by requiring all agencies within this state to fully cooperate with federal immigration authorities in the enforcement of federal immigration laws. The Legislature also finds that other measures are necessary to ensure the integrity of various governmental programs and services.

       Pursuant to Section 1-1-109, the Joint Legislative Committee on Compilation, Revision and Publication of Legislation corrected an error in the first sentence of (8)(c)(i). Inserted the word “in” after the word “period” so that “during the period which the unauthorized employment occurred.” will read as “during the period in which the unauthorized employment occurred.” The Joint Committee ratified the correction at its August 5, 2008, meeting.

     <p>
      The State of Mississippi is a right to work state and the state’s right to work laws are founded on the basic principle that every individual has an inherent right to choose if they want to join a union or an employee organization, and this right to choose should not impact their employment. The State of Mississippi recognizes the importance and necessity of fostering economic development and job creation. Intimidation and coercion against any business, can make the state an unwelcoming and dangerous place for new business and job growth. Intimidation, extortion, and coercion are illegal and present a substantial risk to public safety and the well-being of the state’s citizens, workers and businesses; and certain limited and reasonable restrictions are deemed necessary to protect our citizens from these harms.

      Employers and employees alike benefit from consistent and established standards regulating fair employment practices. There are existing federal and state laws, which seek to protect individuals from discrimination in employment, while also providing appropriate due process to employers without limiting the employer’s ability to maintain a secure, safe and productive workplace, including, but not limited to, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Equal Pay Act and the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mississippi is a right-to-work state and is governed by the right-to-work laws. Such laws are premised on the belief of free choice whereby employees have a right to freely decide whether to join, be represented by, or financially support a union or employee organization. A labor neutrality agreement is used as a tool to pressure company ownership and management to agree to union demands before the union approaches or involves affected employees, which is unfair to the employer as well as the employee or potential employee. This state recognizes that these agreements have become increasingly common in recent years. As a result of this increase, the need to regulate the use of such agreements is necessary to ensure that both the employer and employee are treated in the fairest way possible.
