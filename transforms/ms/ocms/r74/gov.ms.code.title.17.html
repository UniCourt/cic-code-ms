       Despite its state agency status, a regional mental health commission was required to adhere to the municipal zoning ordinances of the city when selecting a regional mental health facility site. City of Hattiesburg v. Region XII Comm'n on Mental Health & Retardation, 654 So. 2d 516, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 224 (Miss. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       Sections 77-9-1 through 77-9-41 [Repealed], 77-1-23 [Repealed], 77-1-49, 77-9-257, and 77-9-265 [Repealed] vest in the Public Service Commission the authority to supervise and regulate common carrier railroads. While the line of authority between the local authorities and the Public Service Commission’s regulation of railroads is not specifically defined by statute, there is a legislative intent that the Public Service Commission has general jurisdiction over common carrier railroads with an official responsibility to the public to see that railroads are operated safely, efficiently, and for the public’s benefit. This responsibility which the Commission has to the entire state manifestly cannot be frustrated by any local ordinance or order, whether by a city or county. Hence, any reasonableness test of a zoning ordinance which applies to a railroad must take into account the obligation of the company to serve efficiently and economically all sections of the state dependent on it for services. [These sections have been repealed: 77-1-23, 77-9-1, 77-9-3, 77-9-9, 77-9-11, 77-9-13, 77-9-17 through 77-9-25, 77-9-41] Columbus & G. R. Co. v. Scales, 578 So. 2d 275, 1991 Miss. LEXIS 224 (Miss. 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       Nonconforming uses may be permitted to continue where the uses were lawfully established at the adoption of the zoning ordinance. However, depending on the ordinance provisions, the exemption granted to a pre-existing nonconforming use may be lost upon any change in the use, or abandonment. Barrett v. Hinds County, 545 So. 2d 734, 1989 Miss. LEXIS 292 (Miss. 1989).
      </p>
      <p>
       The procedural rules and regulations found in a city’s zoning ordinance are in aid of the city’s performance of its legislative zoning function, and it is the city which is vested with the final authority for determining whether its procedural requisites have been met or, if it pleases, waiving them, with 2 exceptions, one of which concerns those cases wherein the municipal zoning authorities may have said to have transgressed some important limitation or procedure imposed by state law, and the other appears where the procedural deficiencies may have said to contravened a citizen’s due process rights. Thrash v. Mayor & Comm'rs of Jackson, 498 So. 2d 801, 1986 Miss. LEXIS 2837 (Miss. 1986).

       After a city has adopted a comprehensive zoning ordinance, an amendment to such ordinance depends primarily upon a reevaluation of the change to the general welfare of the municipality as a whole. Blacklidge v. Gulfport, 223 So. 2d 530, 1969 Miss. LEXIS 1274 (Miss. 1969).
      </p>

       A zoning ordinance will not be set aside if its validity is fairly debatable but only if its invalidity is clear. Sanderson v. Hattiesburg, 249 Miss. 656, 163 So. 2d 739, 1964 Miss. LEXIS 423 (Miss. 1964).
      </p>
      <p>
       Refusal to rezone will be upheld if not wholly unreasonable or an abuse of discretion without any reasonably probable basis in the evidence. Sanderson v. Hattiesburg, 249 Miss. 656, 163 So. 2d 739, 1964 Miss. LEXIS 423 (Miss. 1964).

       1953 zoning ordinances enacted by the city of Tupelo were invalid where the minutes of the mayor and board of aldermen for the period in which the ordinance was enacted were not signed by the mayor and attested by the city clerk.

   Under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t17c01s17-1-3" target="_self">17-1-3</a></cite>, a county has the authority to regulate the construction of a building of residence within an unincorporated part of the county, notwithstanding the zoning classification of the land upon which the residence is to be constructed. Section<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t17c01s17-1-3" target="_self">17-1-3</a></cite> empowers a county to regulate a building of residence within the incorporated parts of that county irrespective to the land’s classification; thus, it applied to a builder who sought to build a single residence in a floodplain area, and within an unincorporated part of the county that was zoned as A-1 agricultural. Ladner v. Hancock County, 899 So. 2d 899, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 1064 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004), cert. denied, 898 So. 2d 679, 2005 Miss. LEXIS 270 (Miss. 2005).

      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   County board of supervisors lacked authority to seek removal of a horse riding arena from the owner’s agricultural land, as the arena was a “farm structure” which, under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t17c01s17-1-3" target="_self">17-1-3</a></cite>, was a use of right that required no permit. Hinds County Bd. of Supervisors v.

      </p>
      <p>
       In a very limited way, a common carrier railroad may be subject to local zoning regulations. Thus, a county board of supervisors had the statutory authority to adopt a zoning ordinance restricting use by a railroad of property owned by it when the ordinance was adopted. Columbus & G. R. Co. v. Scales, 578 So. 2d 275, 1991 Miss. LEXIS 224 (Miss. 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       The zoning statutes, as implemented by the ordinances of a city establishing a comprehensive plan for land use, empowered the city governing authorities to deny the request of landowners to construct two-family duplexes on lots smaller than the minimum provided for single family residences, in an area zoned for single family residences, provided the action was not unreasonable, arbitrary, capricious, nor an abuse of discretion. City of Jackson v. Ridgway, 258 So. 2d 439, 1972 Miss. LEXIS 1503 (Miss. 1972).
      </p>
      <p>
       The refusal of a city council to permit the purchasers of an undeveloped tract zoned A-1 residential, requiring a minimum of 16,000 square feet per lot and tract in a developed residential neighborhood, to allow construction of a duplex on a lot with an area of 9,000 square feet, or to permit the purchasers to subdivide their tract into 10 lots with an area of 9,000 square feet each, was neither unreasonable, arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, nor unlawful. City of Jackson v. Ridgway, 258 So. 2d 439, 1972 Miss. LEXIS 1503 (Miss. 1972).
      </p>
      <p>
       Under modern day conditions any plan for the development of land must reckon with the parking problem, particularly in heavily populated areas, so that off-street parking regulations come within the delegation of zoning power to the city, and the city has the power to make reasonable regulations to prevent street congestion. Yates v. Mayor & Comm'rs of Jackson, 244 So. 2d 724, 1971 Miss. LEXIS 1339 (Miss. 1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       In an action to enjoin the use of defendant’s house as a beauty parlor, allegedly in violation of a protective covenant, it was no defense that the plaintiffs had not exhausted their administrative remedies in that they had not followed their prior objection to the defendant’s successful application to the county board of supervisors for a use permit to its ultimate disposition, since the litigation arose from personal rights derived from a protective covenant, and a county board of supervisors is without authority, by the issuance of a use permit, to change or alter a solemn personal contract with regard to the use of land. Sullivan v. McCallum, 231 So. 2d 801, 1970 Miss. LEXIS 1612 (Miss. 1970).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a zoning ordinance prohibited the operation of a filling station in a local business zone, and the store proprietor’s application for a permit disclosed his knowledge that property was in such zone, an ordinance would not be invalidated merely because the valid zoning use map referred to in the ordinance had been filed away following the enactment of a later, and supposedly valid, zoning ordinance. Ballard v. Smith, 234 Miss. 531, 107 So. 2d 580, 1958 Miss. LEXIS 528 (Miss. 1958).
      </p>
      <p>
       Under city zoning ordinances providing for the continued use of property in the manner it was being used at the time of the ordinance, and also providing that such use might be extended throughout the building if no structural alterations were made, except as required by law, and defining structural alterations as any change in supporting members of a building, such as bearing walls, columns, beams or girders, the mayor and board of aldermen were not warranted in designating as a mere variation the proposed additions to a storehouse building, which would have resulted in the building being approximately one and seven-tenths times as large as the existing building. Mayor & Board of Aldermen v. White, 230 Miss. 698, 93 So. 2d 852, 1957 Miss. LEXIS 411 (Miss. 1957).
      </p>
      <p>
       The construction and maintenance of a warehouse for the reception of freight on railroad right-of-way, which had existed as such for more than 50 years prior to the adoption of an ordinance making most of such right-of-way a residential district, held to be a reasonable use of such right-of-way in facilitating the company’s principal business and no more objectionable than the operation of trains, and to be authorized by provision of ordinance excepting existing nonconforming uses; and, accordingly, action of city authorities in denying such use of the property was an unreasonable and arbitrary interpretation of the ordinance which tended to deprive the company of its property and use thereof in violation of both Federal and State Constitutions. Jones v. Hattiesburg, 207 Miss. 491, 42 So. 2d 717, 1949 Miss. LEXIS 357 (Miss. 1949).

       Where during the year and a half between the adoption of a comprehensive zoning ordinance and a rezoning ordinance, the streets and alleys in a tract had been closed, a branch of a national bank had been established and a large discount house had relocated in the vicinity, and the new store which had been constructed could become part of an all weather regional shopping mall if the tract were rezoned commercial, such changes considered together were sufficient to justify the rezoning of the tract from residential to commercial. Currie v. Ryan, 243 So. 2d 48, 1970 Miss. LEXIS 1395 (Miss. 1970).
      </p>

       Property owners were not entitled as a matter of law to a rezoning of their property from residential to commercial even if the record revealed a material change in circumstances since the Supreme Court ruled on a zoning case in 1966, which case involved the same property.

      <p>
       Upon evidence establishing the change and public need requirements of the rule that, absent mistake in the original zoning, reclassification may be had only where there has been change in the character of the neighborhood such an extent as to justify the rezoning, coupled with a public need for rezoning, the Supreme Court would defer to the judgment of the municipal zoning authorities in rezoning from single family residential use to a special use recreation district of a 50-acre tract of land located in a flood plain. Thrash v. Mayor & Comm'rs of Jackson, 498 So. 2d 801, 1986 Miss. LEXIS 2837 (Miss. 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       Agreement between shopping mall and members of a nearby residential area creating a buffer zone between their property and the proposed mall expansion site was private in nature and, under the evidence, was not basis of the rezoning decision, with the result that such decision did not approve any discriminatory protective covenant. Broadacres, Inc. v. Hattiesburg, 489 So. 2d 501, 1986 Miss. LEXIS 2473 (Miss. 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       Before property is reclassified from one zone to another, those seeking the change must prove by clear and convincing evidence either, (1) that there was a mistake in the original zoning, or (2) the character of the neighborhood has changed to such an extent as to justify rezoning and that public need exists for rezoning. Broadacres, Inc. v. Hattiesburg, 489 So. 2d 501, 1986 Miss. LEXIS 2473 (Miss. 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       Finding of city council that there was public need for, and a change in neighborhood justifying, rezoning from residential to commercial of a parcel into which a shopping mall wished to expand, was not arbitrary or capricious where in its determinative process the council looked at increased population growth, revitalization of the downtown central business district, increased commercial activity, comprehensive planning, change in economic character, deterioration, and buyer’s trend. Broadacres, Inc. v. Hattiesburg, 489 So. 2d 501, 1986 Miss. LEXIS 2473 (Miss. 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       Courts may not overturn city council’s denial of application to rezone 1.5 acre tract from single family residential to townhouse residential zone where city council decision has ample factual basis and council has followed applicable zoning law. Mayor & Comm'rs of Jackson v. Wheatley Place, Inc., 468 So. 2d 81, 1985 Miss. LEXIS 2068 (Miss. 1985).
      </p>

   Adoption by each municipality of a comprehensive zoning plan designed to bring about coordinated physical development of the community, consistent with its present and future needs, is contemplated by §§<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t17c01s17-1-11ol11" target="_self">17-1-11(1)</a></cite> and<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t17c01s17-1-3" target="_self">17-1-3</a></cite>, under which the comprehensive plan contemplates a dynamic community, recognizes the inevitability of change, and balances the community’s gross needs and the individual’s interest in using his property as he sees fit. Woodland Hills Conservation Asso. v. Jackson, 443 So. 2d 1173, 1983 Miss. LEXIS 3023 (Miss. 1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       While as a general rule zoning authorities may not impose conditions and limitations in an order rezoning property, a provision requiring that before a permit could be issued to construct buildings on certain property, adequate off-street parking must be provided for, did not invalidate the order. Yates v. Mayor & Comm'rs of Jackson, 244 So. 2d 724, 1971 Miss. LEXIS 1339 (Miss. 1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       The rezoning of a tract from residential to general commercial, was not arbitrary, capricious, discriminatory, illegal, or without substantial evidential basis, where the tract was bounded on two sides by property zoned commercial, on a third side by a highway, and on the fourth side by 20 acres of vacant property. Currie v. Ryan, 243 So. 2d 48, 1970 Miss. LEXIS 1395 (Miss. 1970).
      </p>
      <p>
       Refusal to rezone as commercial eight acres of property within a residential zone is justified when it is immediately across the street from a hospital and is bound on three sides by expensive homes, and bounding streets are not direct arteries and not of sufficient width to handle increased traffic.

       Applicants for a conditional use permit have the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that they have met the elements/factors essential to obtaining the permit. If the governing authority’s decision is founded upon substantial evidence, then it is binding upon an appellate court. Barnes v. Board of Supervisors, 553 So. 2d 508, 1989 Miss.

       Before any court will consider invalidation of the action of a municipal board for failure to comply with formalities, the opponents must demonstrate affirmatively that the formalities were not met. In other words, there is a rebuttable presumption that all formalities incident to such an action were complied with. Luter v. Hammon, 529 So. 2d 625, 1988 Miss. LEXIS 336 (Miss. 1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       Decision of city fathers in drawing and maintaining line past which commercial development would not be allowed was not arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable, where there was substantial evidence supporting both sides of rezoning application, thus making ultimate decision fairly debatable; same reasoning applied to denial of assertion that zoning restriction amounted to confiscatory taking in violation of due process of law under constitution because that issue is intertwined with review of whether zoning decision is arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable. Saunders v. Jackson, 511 So. 2d 902, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2614 (Miss. 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       Upon reviewing zoning cases the cause is not tried de novo but the circuit court acts as an appellate court, and in that capacity it must examine the record to determine whether council’s action was arbitrary, capricious, or confiscatory, and whether it is supported by substantial evidence.

       A zoning action taken by a mayor and board of aldermen was not ineffective as a result of its being labeled “resolution” instead of “ordinance.” Luter v. Hammon, 529 So. 2d 625, 1988 Miss. LEXIS 336 (Miss. 1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       The procedural rules and regulations found in a city’s zoning ordinance are in aid of the city’s performance of its legislative zoning function, and it is the city which is vested with the final authority for determining whether its procedural requisites have been met or, if it pleases, waiving them, with 2 exceptions, one of which concerns those cases wherein the municipal zoning authorities may have said to have transgressed some important limitation or procedure imposed by state law, and the other appears where the procedural deficiencies may have said to contravened a citizen’s due process rights. Thrash v. Mayor & Comm'rs of Jackson, 498 So. 2d 801, 1986 Miss. LEXIS 2837 (Miss. 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       After a city has adopted a comprehensive zoning ordinance, an amendment to such ordinance depends primarily upon a re-evaluation of the change to the general welfare of the municipality as a whole. Blacklidge v. Gulfport, 223 So. 2d 530, 1969 Miss. LEXIS 1274 (Miss. 1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       A zoning ordinance will not be set aside if its validity is fairly debatable but only if its invalidity is clear. Sanderson v. Hattiesburg, 249 Miss. 656, 163 So. 2d 739, 1964 Miss. LEXIS 423 (Miss. 1964).
      </p>
      <p>
       Refusal to rezone will be upheld if not wholly unreasonable or an abuse of discretion without any reasonably probable basis in the evidence. Sanderson v. Hattiesburg, 249 Miss. 656, 163 So. 2d 739, 1964 Miss. LEXIS 423 (Miss. 1964).

       1953 zoning ordinances enacted by the city of Tupelo were invalid where the minutes of the mayor and board of aldermen for the period in which the ordinance was enacted were not signed by the mayor and attested by the city clerk.

       Under modern day conditions any plan for the development of land must reckon with the parking problem, particularly in heavily populated areas, so that off-street parking regulations come within the delegation of zoning power to the city, and the city has the power to make reasonable regulations to prevent street congestion. Yates v. Mayor & Comm'rs of Jackson, 244 So. 2d 724, 1971 Miss. LEXIS 1339 (Miss. 1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       In an action to enjoin the use of defendant’s house as a beauty parlor, allegedly in violation of a protective covenant, it was no defense that the plaintiffs had not exhausted their administrative remedies in that they had not followed their prior objection to the defendant’s successful application to the county board of supervisors for a use permit to its ultimate disposition, since the litigation arose from personal rights derived from a protective covenant, and a county board of supervisors is without authority, by the issuance of a use permit, to change or alter a solemn personal contract with regard to the use of land. Sullivan v. McCallum, 231 So. 2d 801, 1970 Miss. LEXIS 1612 (Miss. 1970).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a zoning ordinance prohibited the operation of a filling station in a local business zone, and the store proprietor’s application for a permit disclosed his knowledge that property was in such zone, an ordinance would not be invalidated merely because the valid zoning use map referred to in the ordinance had been filed away following the enactment of a later, and supposedly valid, zoning ordinance. Ballard v. Smith, 234 Miss. 531, 107 So. 2d 580, 1958 Miss. LEXIS 528 (Miss. 1958).
      </p>
      <p>
       Under city zoning ordinances providing for the continued use of property in the manner it was being used at the time of the ordinance, and also providing that such use might be extended throughout the building if no structural alterations were made, except as required by law, and defining structural alterations as any change in supporting members of a building, such as bearing walls, columns, beams or girders, the mayor and board of aldermen were not warranted in designating as a mere variation the proposed additions to a storehouse building, which would have resulted in the building being approximately one and seven-tenths times as large as the existing building. Mayor & Board of Aldermen v. White, 230 Miss. 698, 93 So. 2d 852, 1957 Miss. LEXIS 411 (Miss. 1957).

       The construction and maintenance of a warehouse for the reception of freight on railroad right-of-way, which had existed as such for more than 50 years prior to the adoption of an ordinance making most of such right-of-way a residential district, held to be a reasonable use of such right-of-way in facilitating the company’s principal business and no more objectionable than the operation of trains, and to be authorized by provision of ordinance excepting existing nonconforming uses; and, accordingly, action of city authorities in denying such use of the property was an unreasonable and arbitrary interpretation of the ordinance which tended to deprive the company of its property and use thereof in violation of both Federal and State Constitutions.

       Where during the year and a half between the adoption of a comprehensive zoning ordinance and a rezoning ordinance, the streets and alleys in a tract had been closed, a branch of a national bank had been established and a large discount house had relocated in the vicinity, and the new store which had been constructed could become part of an all weather regional shopping mall if the tract were rezoned commercial, such changes considered together were sufficient to justify the rezoning of the tract from residential to commercial.

       The Supreme Court will not substitute its judgment for that of the municipal zoning authorities unless the rezoning decision clearly is arbitrary, capricious and wholly unreasonable. Thrash v. Mayor & Comm'rs of Jackson, 498 So. 2d 801, 1986 Miss. LEXIS 2837 (Miss. 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       Upon evidence establishing the change and public need requirements of the rule that, absent mistake in the original zoning, reclassification may be had only where there has been change in the character of the neighborhood such an extent as to justify the rezoning, coupled with a public need for rezoning, the Supreme Court would defer to the judgment of the municipal zoning authorities in rezoning from single family residential use to a special use recreation district of a 50-acre tract of land located in a flood plain. Thrash v. Mayor & Comm'rs of Jackson, 498 So. 2d 801, 1986 Miss. LEXIS 2837 (Miss. 1986).

       While as a general rule zoning authorities may not impose conditions and limitations in an order rezoning property, a provision requiring that before a permit could be issued to construct buildings on certain property, adequate off-street parking must be provided for, did not invalidate the order. Yates v. Mayor & Comm'rs of Jackson, 244 So. 2d 724, 1971 Miss. LEXIS 1339 (Miss. 1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       The rezoning of a tract from residential to general commercial, was not arbitrary, capricious, discriminatory, illegal, or without substantial evidential basis, where the tract was bounded on two sides by property zoned commercial, on a third side by a highway, and on the fourth side by 20 acres of vacant property. Currie v. Ryan, 243 So. 2d 48, 1970 Miss. LEXIS 1395 (Miss. 1970).
      </p>
      <p>
       Refusal to rezone as commercial eight acres of property within a residential zone is justified when it is immediately across the street from a hospital and is bound on three sides by expensive homes, and bounding streets are not direct arteries and not of sufficient width to handle increased traffic. Sanderson v. Hattiesburg, 249 Miss. 656, 163 So. 2d 739, 1964 Miss. LEXIS 423 (Miss. 1964).

       Decision of city fathers in drawing and maintaining line past which commercial development would not be allowed was not arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable, where there was substantial evidence supporting both sides of rezoning application, thus making ultimate decision fairly debatable; same reasoning applied to denial of assertion that zoning restriction amounted to confiscatory taking in violation of due process of law under constitution because that issue is intertwined with review of whether zoning decision is arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable. Saunders v. Jackson, 511 So. 2d 902, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2614 (Miss. 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       Zoning is a legislative matter and the courts will not interfere or substitute their judgment, but will limit their reviews to whether the zoning was reasonable, arbitrary, discretionary, confiscatory, or an abuse of discretion.

   Record revealed that the city’s comprehensive plan was not amended to comply with the rezoning of a portion of the neighborhood from RB property to R1A property, and at the hearing, the city admitted that the comprehensive plan was not amended to comply with the zoning change, however, the city maintained that it would amend the comprehensive plan if the zoning change was permitted; Miss.

      <p>
       Decision of a mayor and board of aldermen to re-zone a parcel of land was fairly debatable and supported by substantial evidence, so the decision to re-zone could not be arbitrary and capricious; the mayor and board adopted findings of fact in motion to re-zone, and with such findings of fact enumerated in the record, the court was not required to reverse the decision.

      </p>
      <p>
       Finding of city council that there was public need for, and a change in neighborhood justifying, rezoning from residential to commercial of a parcel into which a shopping mall wished to expand, was not arbitrary or capricious where in its determinative process the council looked at increased population growth, revitalization of the downtown central business district, increased commercial activity, comprehensive planning, change in economic character, deterioration, and buyer’s trend.

       In an action to enjoin the use of defendant’s house as a beauty parlor, allegedly in violation of a protective covenant, it was no defense that the plaintiffs had not exhausted their administrative remedies in that they had not followed their prior objection to the defendant’s successful application to the county board of supervisors for a use permit to its ultimate disposition, since the litigation arose from personal rights derived from a protective covenant, and a county board of supervisors is without authority, by the issuance of a use permit, to change or alter a solemn personal contract with regard to the use of land.

       Since Section 17-1-15 provides a procedure for establishing and amending zoning ordinances and regulations and a method of determining the will of the electorate by requiring fifteen days notice prior to a public hearing before the adoption of any zoning ordinance, a board of supervisors may not hold an election on a proposed county zoning ordinance under “Home Rule”.

       Section 17-1-15 requires only one public hearing before adopting an ordinance. However, if substantive changes are made to an ordinance following a public hearing, then another hearing should be held to give citizens a chance to voice their opinions on those changes.

   Record revealed that the city’s comprehensive plan was not amended to comply with the rezoning of a portion of the neighborhood from RB property to R1A property, and at the hearing, the city admitted that the comprehensive plan was not amended to comply with the zoning change, however, the city maintained that it would amend the comprehensive plan if the zoning change was permitted; Miss. Code Ann. §§<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t17c01s17-1-11" target="_self">17-1-11</a></cite>,<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t17c01s17-1-15" target="_self">17-1-15</a></cite>, and<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t17c01s17-1-17" target="_self">17-1-17</a></cite> contemplated necessary amendments to comprehensive plans and zoning ordinances, and the trial court did not err by finding that the rezoning was compatible with the comprehensive plan. Bridge v. Mayor &amp; Bd. of Aldermen of Oxford, 995 So. 2d 81, 2008 Miss. LEXIS 446 (Miss. 2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that a town initiated the rezoning of a parcel did not render it arbitrary and capricious as a governing authority of a municipality may amend, supplement, or change zoning ordinances provided that there is a properly noticed hearing. Town of Florence v. Sea Lands, Ltd., 759 So. 2d 1221, 2000 Miss. LEXIS 119 (Miss. 2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       A property owner’s claim of ownership under color of title by virtue of his adverse possession of the property after he purchased the property at a tax sale but before the redemption period had ended and he had the right of possession, was sufficient to apply the “doctrine of relation” back to the date of the tax sale purchase for the purpose of challenging a subsequent zoning ordinance by asserting a pre-existing nonconforming use. In the balancing of public benefit against private property losses, a landowner’s constitutional right under the due process clause prevails. Barrett v. Hinds County, 545 So. 2d 734, 1989 Miss. LEXIS 292 (Miss. 1989).
      </p>
      <p>
       Amendment of city zoning ordinance was improper where neither real estate developer nor city produced evidence to support amendment, because of firmly established rule that before zoning board reclassifies property from one zone to another, there must be proof either (1) that there was mistake in original zoning or (2) that character of neighborhood had changed to extent to justify reclassification, and that there was public need for rezoning. Board of Aldermen v. Conerly, 509 So. 2d 877, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2576 (Miss. 1987).

       A zoning map may be incorporated in a zoning ordinance by reference; and the statutes in force in 1946 did not provide for a method of verifying such a map. Ballard v. Smith, 234 Miss. 531, 107 So. 2d 580, 1958 Miss. LEXIS 528 (Miss. 1958).

       In a very limited way, a common carrier railroad may be subject to local zoning regulations. Thus, a county board of supervisors had the statutory authority to adopt a zoning ordinance restricting use by a railroad of property owned by it when the ordinance was adopted. Columbus & G. R. Co. v. Scales, 578 So. 2d 275, 1991 Miss. LEXIS 224 (Miss. 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       Local ordinance providing that annexed land shall automatically be zoned for single family residences was subject to notice and hearing requirements of this section, and failure to comply with statutory requirements meant that the classification was not binding on petitioners seeking to change the classification. Gatlin v. Laurel, 312 So. 2d 435, 1975 Miss. LEXIS 1642 (Miss. 1975).

       Order of Mayor and Board of Aldermen, reciting unauthorized alteration of Use District Map which was a part of a proposed zoning ordinance, and ordering deletion of the alteration and restoration of the map to its original condition, was not an amendment requiring a new publication.

       Where board of supervisors published a notice of hearing concerning a proposed plan of new zoning and subdivision regulations on March 7, and held the public hearing on March 20, the number of days elapsed totaled only 14, and the notice and hearing were inadequate as a matter of law, and as applied against plaintiff’s property, the zoning was void for statutory non-compliance. Pyramid Corp. v. De Soto County Bd. of Supervisors, 366 F. Supp. 1299, 1973 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11211 (N.D. Miss. 1973).

       Where there was an application for rezoning and the notice of a public hearing was silent as to the name of the municipality in which the hearing was to be held, and as to the place in such municipality where the hearing was to be held, the notice was fatally defective and the ordinance attempted to be adopted was void.

       Appellants failed to show that a 2006 rezoning of the subject property from residential to commercial was void as a matter of law. The record showed sufficient evidence of a change of conditions was presented to support the rezoning. Den Herder v. Madison Cty. Bd. of Supervisors, — So.3d —, 2018 Miss. App. LEXIS 588 (Miss. Ct. App. Nov. 27, 2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       The zoning decision of a local governing body, which appears to be fairly debatable, will not be disturbed on appeal, and will be set aside only if it clearly appears that the decision is arbitrary, capricious, discriminatory, illegal, or is not supported by substantial evidence. A city zoning board’s decision to allow a change in zoning for a piece of property from residential to commercial was fairly debatable where the board determined that the subject lot had absolutely no use for residential development and the city had a sincere interest in seeing a commercial establishment built on the site; the presentation of contradictory evidence only confirmed the fact that the issue was fairly debatable. Gillis v. City of McComb, 860 So. 2d 833, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 1141 (Miss. Ct. App. 2003).
      </p>

       The zoning decision of a local governing body which appears to be “fairly debatable” will not be disturbed on appeal, and will be set aside only if it clearly appears that the decision is arbitrary, capricious, discriminatory, illegal, or not supported by substantial evidence. City of Biloxi v. Hilbert, 597 So. 2d 1276, 1992 Miss. LEXIS 150 (Miss. 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       Owners of residential property located near property that was rezoned by the city had standing to appeal from a decision of the Circuit Court regarding the rezoning classification since the value of their property might be affected by the zoning of the subject property. Luter v. Oakhurst Associates, Ltd., 529 So. 2d 889, 1988 Miss. LEXIS 332 (Miss. 1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       A municipal taxpayer and owner of property rezoned by the city had standing to prosecute an appeal from the Circuit Court’s reversal of the city’s decision to rezone, and was a proper party appellant. Luter v. Hammon, 529 So. 2d 625, 1988 Miss. LEXIS 336 (Miss. 1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       Decision of city fathers in drawing and maintaining line past which commercial development would not be allowed was not arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable, where there was substantial evidence supporting both sides of rezoning application, thus making ultimate decision fairly debatable; same reasoning applied to denial of assertion that zoning restriction amounted to confiscatory taking in violation of due process of law under constitution because that issue is intertwined with review of whether zoning decision is arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable. Saunders v. Jackson, 511 So. 2d 902, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2614 (Miss. 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       Decision of local governing board, upon appeal, is presumed valid, and burden is upon person seeking to set it aside to show that it is arbitrary, capricious, and unreasonable, which will be found unless record contains specific finding by such board that one or both of criteria required for change have been met, and in addition thereto sufficient evidence to support such finding; to support, on appeal, reclassification of zones, record at minimum should contain map showing circumstances of area, changes in neighborhood, statistics showing public need, and such further matters of proof as necessary so that rational, informed judgment may be made as to what governing body considered, and when there is no proof of such in record, court must conclude there was neither change nor public need. Board of Aldermen v. Conerly, 509 So. 2d 877, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2576 (Miss. 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where original classification of annexed land under “automatic zoning” ordinance was not binding on neighboring landowners for failure to comply with this section and was merely temporary classification pending determination by city council of proper classification, there was no need to show material change in surroundings or prior mistake in order to reclassify land. Reclassification decision needed only to meet test of determining whether it was unreasonable, arbitrary, or an abuse of discretion. Gatlin v. Laurel, 312 So. 2d 435, 1975 Miss. LEXIS 1642 (Miss. 1975).
      </p>
      <p>
       Classification of property for zoning is a legislative rather than a judicial matter, and the courts generally will not interfere or substitute their own judgment for that of the municipality, although zoning is subject to judicial review as to whether it is reasonable, arbitrary, discriminatory, confiscatory, or an abuse of discretion. Ballard v. Smith, 234 Miss. 531, 107 So. 2d 580, 1958 Miss. LEXIS 528 (Miss. 1958).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although if timely attack had been made upon the zoning ordinance, the court would have had to hold it void since the municipal authorities failed to follow the statutory procedure, where the ordinance had been amended 32 times since taking effect in 1940, the population of the city had more than doubled, in that time, 7,100 permits, representing millions of dollars in expenditures, had been issued under the ordinance, and the appellants, who were attacking the ordinance, had obtained permits and licenses thereunder, the ordinance would be upheld. Walker v. Biloxi, 229 Miss. 890, 92 So. 2d 227, 1957 Miss. LEXIS 338 (Miss. 1957).
      </p>
      <p>
       Courts cannot interfere unless action of city commissioners in placing certain property in residential zone was unreasonable and arbitrary. City of Jackson v. McPherson, 158 Miss. 152, 130 So. 287, 1930 Miss. LEXIS 43 (Miss. 1930).

       Miss. Code Section 17-1-17 provides zoning ordinance amendments which are challenged by protest shall not become effective unless affirmatively approved by vote of “two-thirds (2/3) of all the members of the legislative body of such municipality or county”; this provision requires at least four members of county board of supervisors be present and that there are at least four affirmative votes in favor of amendment; had legislature intended otherwise, there would likely be statutory language to effect of “two-thirds of all members present and voting”, as is case with certain municipal veto override provisions, such as Miss.

      <p>
       The deadline for filing an appeal from the decision of the Mayor and Board of Aldermen under Section 17-1-17, is 10 days because, any party aggrieved by the decision of the governing authorities may appeal the decision to circuit court within 10 days under Section 11-51-75. Peeples, June 14, 1995, A.G. Op. #95-0359.

       Pursuant to Section 17-1-17, property separated by an interstate highway and two frontage roads would still be considered property “directly opposite” of the rezoned property. Haque, August 17, 1995, A.G. Op. #95-0560.

       If the governing authorities of a Town have adopted a comprehensive zoning ordinance in accordance with Section 17-1-1 et seq. and if an individual petitions the governing authorities to rezone specific property for the purpose of opening a child care facility in a residential area, then the governing authorities may in their discretion grant that individual a variance in accordance with Sections 17-1-15 and 17-1-17.

       In order to invoke the 2/3 majority requirement of the statute, signatures of 20 percent of owners of all properties affected (or those in the vicinity as defined in the statute) by the proposed amendment are required; applying the rule to a proposed amendment that would change uses allowed on properties throughout the zoning jurisdiction of the county, 20% of all such property owners or those in the statutorily defined vicinity would meet the protest requirements.
   Austin, Jr., Nov. 10, 2000, A.G. Op. #2000-0647.
      </p>
      <p>
       Each described area, whether it be the lots included in the proposed change, the lots immediately adjacent to the rear, or those directly opposite the subject parcel, is to be treated separately for the purposes of determining the 20 percent figure. Clark, Feb. 9, 2001, A.G. Op. #2001-0067.
      </p>
      <p>
       Owners of property directly adjacent to the front, rear, or side of the subject property, and within 160 feet of the subject property, have standing to protest the rezoning of the subject property; similarly, owners of property directly opposite the subject property, if separated by a street, and within 160 feet, may protest. Clark, Feb. 9, 2001, A.G. Op. #2001-0067.
      </p>
      <p>
       Adjoining streets are not to be considered in the calculation of the 160-foot measurement; the measurement of 160 feet begins from the street frontage of lots opposite the subject property.
   Clark, Feb. 9, 2001, A.G. Op. #2001-0067.
      </p>
      <p>
       A petition in protest of a rezoning must be signed by the owners of 20 percent of the total area of lots (in any one of the separate described areas) before the statute requires the governing authorities to approve the rezoning measure by a 2/3 supermajority; that is, the 20 percent figure should be calculated on the basis of the percentage of land owned by the protestors, whatever their number, within the area entitled to be included for purposes of the statute compared to the total amount of land included in that area.
   Clark, Feb. 9, 2001, A.G. Op. #2001-0067.
      </p>
      <p>
       The public hearing required by the statute is the venue for citizens to express their concerns regarding the adoption of a proposed zoning ordinance, and the governing authorities may take those concerns into consideration in adopting the ordinance; thus, such public hearing procedure applies to the zoning of an area newly annexed by a city. Mitchell, Mar. 2, 2001, A.G. Op. #01-0097.
      </p>
      <p>
       The super-majority provisions set forth in the statute do not apply to the initial adoption of zoning regulations and, therefore, do not apply to the zoning of an area newly annexed by a city. Mitchell, Mar. 2, 2001, A.G. Op. #01-0097.
      </p>
      <p>
       The mayor is not required to vote to achieve a two-thirds majority vote of all members of the board of mayor and commissioners in favor of a zoning change. Twiford, III, Apr. 5, 2002, A.G. Op. #02-0171.
      </p>
      <p>
       When there has been a protest that meets the statutory criteria, a proposed zoning amendment shall not become effective except by the affirmative vote of two-thirds of the remaining members. Cothran, Aug. 4, 2004, A.G. Op. 04-0347.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a case where a city is under a special charter that allows for four aldermen with the mayor voting only with a tie among the aldermen, and one alderman has resigned, when there has been a protest that meets the statutory criteria, should the mayor vote to break a two-two tie
   and make it a vote of three-two in favor of the proposed amendment, that would constitute a three-fifths vote of the legislative body and a proposed amendment would become effective. Cothran, Aug. 4, 2004, A.G. Op. 04-0347.

       Where a planning commission hearing meeting was not held due to severe weather, the county must comply with the notice provisions of Section 17-1-17 for a rescheduled meeting. Lewis,

       Enough citizens did not raise timely objections to a special exception to require a super-majority vote for a special exception by a city planning commission as one property owner filed two separate objections for the same property and another owner’s property was outside of the 160-foot radius requirement, which voided that owner’s objection. Trappey v. Newman, — So.3d —, 2019 Miss. App. LEXIS 10 (Miss. Ct. App. Jan. 8, 2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       A rezoning was not validly approved where all the residents, with the exception of one, within 160 feet of the lot proposed for rezoning, signed a petition opposing the rezoning and the petition was entered as an exhibit and only three of five aldermen voted to approve the rezoning request. Tippitt v. City of Hernando, 780 So. 2d 649, 2000 Miss. App. LEXIS 247 (Miss. Ct. App. 2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       Amendment of city zoning ordinance was improper where neither real estate developer nor city produced evidence to support amendment, where firmly established rule was that before zoning board reclassified property from one zone to another, there must be proof either (1) that there was mistake in original zoning or (2) that character of neighborhood had changed to extent to justify reclassification, and that there was public need for rezoning. Board of Aldermen v. Conerly, 509 So. 2d 877, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2576 (Miss. 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       The procedural rules and regulations found in a city’s zoning ordinance are in aid of the city’s performance of its legislative zoning function, and it is the city which is vested with the final authority for determining whether its procedural requisites have been met or, if it pleases, waiving them, with 2 exceptions, one of which concerns those cases wherein the municipal zoning authorities may have said to have transgressed some important limitation or procedure imposed by state law, and the other appears where the procedural deficiencies may have said to contravened a citizen’s due process rights. Thrash v. Mayor & Comm'rs of Jackson, 498 So. 2d 801, 1986 Miss. LEXIS 2837 (Miss. 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       The due process rights, if any, guaranteed to objectors of a rezoning proposal is reasonable advance notice of the substance of the rezoning proposal together with the opportunity to be heard at all critical stages of the process. Thrash v. Mayor & Comm'rs of Jackson, 498 So. 2d 801, 1986 Miss. LEXIS 2837 (Miss. 1986).

   In fairness to adjacent landowners city council is required to conduct hearing where after adjacent landowners requested public hearing before city council pursuant to §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t17c01s17-1-17" target="_self">17-1-17</a></cite>, council, in role of conducting hearing, summarily and without explanation rejected recommendation of zoning board by denying petition to rezone. Cutchens v. Bryant, 449 So. 2d 231, 1984 Miss. LEXIS 1700 (Miss. 1984).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Although a city council’s denial of a petition for rezoning was unsupported by the evidence, fairness to all parties required that the council conduct a hearing in order to consider both positions and render a proper decision so that reclassification of the property would be based upon evidence presented in an open hearing as provided by §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t17c01s17-1-17" target="_self">17-1-17</a></cite>, rather than by error or mistake. Cutchens v. Bryant, 449 So. 2d 231, 1984 Miss. LEXIS 1700 (Miss. 1984).
      </p>
      <p>
       A city council exceeded its lawful authority in zoning property as industrial where it did not give public notice of the hearing or make a finding of material change. Cowan v. Gulf City Fisheries, Inc., 379 So. 2d 524, 1980 Miss. LEXIS 1843 (Miss. 1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       If a city is going to rely on that provision of this section requiring more than a majority vote to rezone property, the burden is upon that city to affirmatively prove that twenty per cent or more of the protesting landowners fit within that class of landowners outlined in the statute and it must make a special finding to that effect in its order denying the rezoning. Tindall v. Louisville, 338 So. 2d 998, 1976 Miss. LEXIS 1643 (Miss. 1976).
      </p>
      <p>
       Ordinance made by municipality pursuant to last sentence of first paragraph of Code 1942, § 3594, which required that any person desiring to appeal a decision of the zoning board should give notice thereof to the director of the zoning department within 15 days from the date of the rendition of the board’s decision was a valid and reasonable exercise of municipal authority. City of Jackson v. McMurry, 288 So. 2d 23, 1974 Miss. LEXIS 1838 (Miss. 1974).
      </p>
      <p>
       Under the provision of Code 1942, § 3594 that “the governing authorities. . . may act upon the recommendation of the city engineer or advisory committee,” it is evident that a city may properly exercise its legislative function, where there is no appeal from the advisory committee, by simply adopting the recommendation of the committee, and it does not, by so doing, delegate its zoning authority because it is not bound by the recommendation of the advisory committee. City of Jackson v. McMurry, 288 So. 2d 23, 1974 Miss. LEXIS 1838 (Miss. 1974).
      </p>
      <p>
       A city council was not in error in holding that there was no need for public reclassification of the subject property where the proof was that, though surrounding territory was zoned commercial and industrial, it actually consisted largely of one-family dwellings. Presto Mfg. Co. v. Shelby, 244 So. 2d 8, 1971 Miss. LEXIS 1312 (Miss. 1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a statute permits amendment of a zoning ordinance by a two-thirds vote of the city council, an ordinance requiring a unanimous vote is ineffective. City of Jackson v. Freeman-Howie, Inc., 239 Miss. 84, 121 So. 2d 120, 1960 Miss. LEXIS 269 (Miss. 1960).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where it was shown that the plaintiff’s lots could no longer properly be utilized for residential purposes, some of the lots in that area of the city had been rezoned for commercial purposes, there was a distinct need of sleeping accommodations in the vicinity, and the result of the city council denying plaintiff’s petition to rezone his lots from residential to commercial in order that hotel courts might be erected practically deprived plaintiff of the use of the property, the action of the city council was manifestly arbitrary and capricious. City of Hattiesburg v. Pittman, 233 Miss. 544, 102 So. 2d 352, 1958 Miss. LEXIS 415 (Miss. 1958).

       Resident’s due process rights were violated when a city’s board of aldermen failed to notify him of the board meeting where it considered and denied his rezoning request because the resident was not given notice of the board’s meeting where his rezoning request was denied. McKee v. City of Starkville, 97 So.3d 97, 2012 Miss. App. LEXIS 480 (Miss. Ct. App. 2012).

   Surrounding property owners were estopped from challenging the 2001 adoption of a city’s zoning map because the owners did not challenge the zoning until seven years later and any alleged technical failings in the city’s notice under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t17c01s17-1-17" target="_self">17-1-17</a></cite> were insufficient to invalidate the official zoning map that had been relied upon by the city and its residents for many years. Riverside Traffic Sys. v. Bostwick, 78 So.3d 907, 2011 Miss. App. LEXIS 52 (Miss. Ct. App.), vacated, 78 So.3d 881, 2011 Miss. LEXIS 553 (Miss. 2011).

   Record revealed that the city’s comprehensive plan was not amended to comply with the rezoning of a portion of the neighborhood from RB property to R1A property, and at the hearing, the city admitted that the comprehensive plan was not amended to comply with the zoning change, however, the city maintained that it would amend the comprehensive plan if the zoning change was permitted; Miss. Code Ann. §§<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t17c01s17-1-11" target="_self">17-1-11</a></cite>,<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t17c01s17-1-15" target="_self">17-1-15</a></cite>, and<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t17c01s17-1-17" target="_self">17-1-17</a></cite> contemplated necessary amendments to comprehensive plans and zoning ordinances, and the trial court did not err by finding that the rezoning was compatible with the comprehensive plan. Bridge v. Mayor &amp; Bd. of Aldermen of Oxford, 995 So. 2d 81, 2008 Miss. LEXIS 446 (Miss. 2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       Notwithstanding that the statute required 15 days notice before zoning ordinances could be amended, the appellants could not challenge a city zoning ordinance on the basis that it was amended only 14 days after the 1976 comprehensive zoning ordinance was adopted as both the city and a yacht club within the city had relied upon the legality of the ordinance for over two decades. McKenzie v. City of Ocean Springs, 758 So. 2d 1028, 2000 Miss. App. LEXIS 74 (Miss. Ct. App. 2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       A building permit to construct a bulk oil and gas distribution plant was improperly revoked after the adoption of an urban renewal plan which prohibited such use, where the adoption of the plan did not ipso facto amend or change the zoning laws, to which all housing projects were subject, and where the housing authority failed to comply with the statutory provisions for effecting a change in the zoning laws. Key Petroleum, Inc. v. Housing Authority of Gulfport, 357 So. 2d 920, 1977 Miss. LEXIS 1917 (Miss. 1977).
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that a lot would be worth $45,000 if rezoned to permit the construction of a filling station, while as a residential lot it is only worth $11,000, is no justification for granting a petition seeking rezoning, for a variance should not be granted merely because it would be to the financial advantage of the owner. Westminster Presbyterian Church v. Jackson, 253 Miss. 495, 176 So. 2d 267, 1965 Miss. LEXIS 1008 (Miss. 1965).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section [Code 1942, § 3594] does not confer upon remonstrants power to veto a proposed amendment of a zoning ordinance, but vests it in the municipal authorities. City of Hattiesburg v. Mercer, 237 Miss. 423, 115 So. 2d 165, 1959 Miss. LEXIS 486 (Miss. 1959).
      </p>
      <p>
       Zoning authorities may properly refuse a variance to permit operation of a filling station on the ground that other stations are being operated on property similarly zoned, where a filling station at the location in question would materially add to traffic hazards.

       Burden of proof to support requested change in zoning ordinance is upon applicant, and requirements for reclassification must be shown by clear and convincing evidence. Board of Aldermen v. Conerly, 509 So. 2d 877, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2576 (Miss. 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       Before property is reclassified from one zone to another, those seeking the change must prove by clear and convincing evidence either, (1) that there was a mistake in the original zoning, or (2) the character of the neighborhood has changed to such an extent as to justify rezoning and that public need exists for rezoning. Broadacres, Inc. v. Hattiesburg, 489 So. 2d 501, 1986 Miss. LEXIS 2473 (Miss. 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       In order to have property rezoned, the applicant must establish by clear and convincing evidence that the character of the neighborhood has changed since the date of the last request for rezoning and that a public need exists for rezoning. City of Jackson v. Aldridge, 487 So. 2d 1345, 1986 Miss. LEXIS 2458 (Miss. 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       In order to justify rezoning of property from one classification to another, there must be proof either that there was a mistake in the original zoning, or that the character of the neighborhood has changed to such an extent as to justify reclassification. Purdy v. State, 287 So. 2d 436, 1973 Miss. LEXIS 1336 (Miss. 1973).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where four petitioners, seeking the rezoning of the four corners of an intersection from residential to commercial classification for the purpose of removing residence therefrom and erecting an automobile service station on each corner, failed to show a need for commercial activities within the area and failed to show substantial changes in the area since the original zoning, and where it was shown that commercial activities within the neighborhood would depreciate the use and value of the surrounding property as residential, the action of the city council in denying the petitions was neither arbitrary, capricious, confiscatory nor unreasonable, since the burden of proving a need for change in zoning rests squarely on those property owners requesting change. City of Jackson v. Husbands, 233 So. 2d 817, 1970 Miss. LEXIS 1683 (Miss. 1970).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where owner’s previous application to have property rezoned had been denied and no appeal was taken, the burden of proof was upon the owner to allege and prove on the hearing of a subsequent application a material change of circumstances, for otherwise the city council was correct in applying the doctrine of res judicata. Westminster Presbyterian Church v. Jackson, 253 Miss. 495, 176 So. 2d 267, 1965 Miss. LEXIS 1008 (Miss. 1965).

      </h4>
      <p>
       Developer’s lawsuit in federal district court against a County Board of Supervisors that denied the developer’s application for a zoning change was dismissed on the grounds of res judicata and collateral estoppel because the developer had unsuccessfully appealed the Board’s decision to the state court, and the developer could have raised his claims of due process violations in the state court proceeding. A&F Props., LLC v. Madison County Bd. of Supervisors, 414 F. Supp. 2d 618, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 40196 (S.D. Miss. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a property owner’s first application for a reclassification of residential zone A-1 property to residential A-3, providing for, among other uses, apartments, apartment hotels, and apartment buildings, with no restrictions as to height or area of ground per family unit, was disapproved, in hearing the owner’s second application for a reclassification to residential A-2 zone, providing for apartments or multiple dwellings with at least 2,000 square feet per family unit, the city was not required to apply the doctrine of res judicata which would require the owner to allege and prove a change of circumstances since the time of the denial of the first petition. Yates v. Mayor & Comm'rs of Jackson, 244 So. 2d 724, 1971 Miss. LEXIS 1339 (Miss. 1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       Generally when a change is sought and denied, a city must apply the doctrine of res judicata to the facts that then existed when considering a petition to rezone the same property to the same classification, but a city is not required to apply the doctrine of res judicata when the new petition seeks a lesser variance than did the former petition which was denied. Yates v. Mayor & Comm'rs of Jackson, 244 So. 2d 724, 1971 Miss. LEXIS 1339 (Miss. 1971).

       Circuit court erred in granting summary judgment for a city in a property owner’s action alleging that the city improperly rezoned her commercial property to residential because a genuine dispute of material facts existed, and the owner could meet an exception to the requirement of exhausting her administrative; if the city unconstitutionally rezoned the property, any attempt to rezone would be unnecessary, as any unconstitutional rezoning was void. Durr v. City of Picayune, 185 So.3d 1042, 2015 Miss. App. LEXIS 362 (Miss. Ct. App. 2015), cert. denied, 185 So.3d 385, 2016 Miss. LEXIS 89 (Miss. 2016).

      <p>
       The burden is upon the party invoking the two-thirds vote requirement to affirmatively prove that the owners of 20 percent or more of the area specified in this section have protested the rezoning; where that party fails to meet the burden, a majority vote by the board will be sufficient to require rezoning of the property. Fondren N. Renaissance v. Mayor of Jackson, 749 So. 2d 974, 1999 Miss. LEXIS 331 (Miss. 1999).

   A circuit court order remanding a rezoning case to the city council for a determination of the number and percentage of eligible property owners who protested the zoning change and ordering that a report of its findings and conclusions be filed with the court clerk to become part of the record was not intended to constitute a final judgment contemplated by §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.11.html#t11c51s11-51-75" target="_blank">11-51-75</a></cite>, but, rather, the circuit court, sitting as an appellate court, retained jurisdiction pending record expansion and supplementation. City of Biloxi v. Hilbert, 597 So. 2d 1276, 1992 Miss. LEXIS 150 (Miss. 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       The zoning decision of a local governing body which appears to be “fairly debatable” will not be disturbed on appeal, and will be set aside only if it clearly appears that the decision is arbitrary, capricious, discriminatory, illegal, or not supported by substantial evidence; neither the Supreme Court nor the circuit court should sit as a “super-zoning commission”; thus, the circuit court erred in overturning a city council’s decision that the character of a neighborhood had changed substantially and that a public need existed to justify rezoning where the decision of the city council was fairly debatable. City of Biloxi v. Hilbert, 597 So. 2d 1276, 1992 Miss. LEXIS 150 (Miss. 1992).

   The party relying on the 2/3 majority voting requirement of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t17c01s17-1-17" target="_self">17-1-17</a></cite> has the burden of proving that 20 percent or more of the protesting landowners fit within the class of landowners outlined in the statute, and this showing must be made before the local governing body and not for the first time on appeal; thus, the circuit court’s remand of a rezoning case to the city council for the purpose of applying the enhanced voting requirements of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t17c01s17-1-17" target="_self">17-1-17</a></cite> was unwarranted where the applicability of § 17-1-17 was not raised until the appeal was taken to the circuit court, and the circuit court erroneously placed upon the city council the burden of satisfying the requirements of § 17-1-17, as it was up to the protesting landowners to affirmatively show that they were within the statutory class who could validly object. City of Biloxi v. Hilbert, 597 So. 2d 1276, 1992 Miss. LEXIS 150 (Miss. 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       Decision of city fathers in drawing and maintaining line past which commercial development would not be allowed was not arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable, where there was substantial evidence supporting both sides of rezoning application, thus making ultimate decision fairly debatable; same reasoning applied to denial of assertion that zoning restriction amounted to confiscatory taking in violation of due process of law under constitution because that issue is intertwined with review of whether zoning decision is arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable. Saunders v. Jackson, 511 So. 2d 902, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2614 (Miss. 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       Decision of local governing board, upon appeal, is presumed valid, and burden is upon person seeking to set it aside to show that it is arbitrary, capricious, and unreasonable, which will be found unless record contains specific finding by such board that one or both of criteria required for change have been met, and in addition thereto sufficient evidence to support such finding; to support, on appeal, reclassification of zones, record at minimum should contain map showing circumstances of area, changes in neighborhood, statistics showing public need, and such further matters of proof as necessary so that rational, informed judgment may be made as to what governing body considered, and when there is no proof of such in record, court must conclude there was neither change nor public need. Board of Aldermen v. Conerly, 509 So. 2d 877, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2576 (Miss. 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Supreme Court will not substitute its judgment for that of the municipal zoning authorities unless the rezoning decision clearly is arbitrary, capricious and wholly unreasonable. Thrash v. Mayor & Comm'rs of Jackson, 498 So. 2d 801, 1986 Miss. LEXIS 2837 (Miss. 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       Upon evidence establishing the change and public need requirements of the rule that, absent mistake in the original zoning, reclassification may be had only where there has been change in the character of the neighborhood such an extent as to justify the rezoning, coupled with a public need for rezoning, the Supreme Court would defer to the judgment of the municipal zoning authorities in rezoning from single family residential use to a special use recreation district of a 50-acre tract of land located in a flood plain. Thrash v. Mayor & Comm'rs of Jackson, 498 So. 2d 801, 1986 Miss. LEXIS 2837 (Miss. 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       In zoning cases on appeal, the cause is not tried de novo, and where the record failed to show clear and uncontradicted evidence of change in the area sought to be rezoned between the last action of the city council in regard to its zoning classification and the present, and evidence as to public need for rezoning was inconclusive, the circuit court in ordering the property rezoned improperly substituted its judgment for that of the city council. City of Jackson v. Aldridge, 487 So. 2d 1345, 1986 Miss. LEXIS 2458 (Miss. 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       The refusal to rezone a piece of property from residential to commercial was an arbitrary and capricious action and was not supported by the evidence where the property was isolated between three commercial lots immediately to its south and north and the neighborhood was becoming largely commercial. Tindall v. Louisville, 338 So. 2d 998, 1976 Miss. LEXIS 1643 (Miss. 1976).
      </p>
      <p>
       An order of a county board of supervisors denying the request of a development company to rezone one tract in a neighborhood from residential to commercial, and another from residential to unlimited apartments, was not unreasonable, arbitrary, or capricious, in the absence of evidence showing a material change in the character of the neighborhood or some public need for businesses and multiple apartments in the neighborhood, and the circuit court, as the appellate reviewing authority, was in error in substituting its judgment for that of the governing authority of the county. Carnes v. Harrow Dev. Co., 244 So. 2d 27, 1971 Miss. LEXIS 1323 (Miss. 1971).

       Where ordinance designated property as residential property, and question was doubtful, court would not interfere by mandamus to compel issuance of building permit. City of Jackson v. McPherson, 158 Miss. 152, 130 So. 287, 1930 Miss. LEXIS 43 (Miss. 1930).

However, before taking such action, the parties named shall be made aware of the action and must agree in writing to the vacation or alteration.

      </h4>
      <p>
       Under Miss. Code Section 17-1-23, it is up to particular municipal department, and regulations or other laws under which it operates, as to whether department requires services of architect or engineer or some other professional before it issues subdivision permit. Kilpatrick, Jan 8, 1993, A.G. Op. #92-0964.
      </p>
      <p>
       A board of supervisors that approves a subdivision plat does not automatically assume any responsibilities concerning drainage structures in the subdivision, but the county does have a responsibility to drain water from county roads in a manner which does not cause damage to adjacent properties. Austin, Aug. 8, 1997, A.G. Op. #97-0404.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a property owner has obtained the written agreement of all affected parties, he may petition the board of supervisors for a change in the subdivision plat in which his property is located in accord with Section 17-1-23; otherwise, he should petition the chancery court pursuant to Section 19-27-31. Sherard, Feb. 9, 2001, A.G. Op. #2001-0041.
      </p>
      <p>
       The chancery clerk is required to confirm that the governing authorities have granted the petition for the alteration or vacation of the map or plat; this may be accomplished by the municipal governing authorities providing a copy of the resolution or minutes approving the vacating or alteration of the plat or map. Chamberlin, May 24, 2002, A.G. Op. #02-0289.
      </p>
      <p>
       Provided that the municipality has provided a copy of its minutes or resolution reflecting its approval of the alteration or vacation of the plat or map, the chancery clerk has no authority to inquire behind the minutes. Chamberlin, May 24, 2002, A.G. Op. #02-0289.
      </p>
      <p>
       When a city annexes property that includes a subdivision with roads that were never accepted by the county but are shown on a map or plat filed in the office of the chancery clerk, these undeveloped and unpaved roads are not automatically city streets. Gurley, Apr. 11, 2003, A.G. Op. #03-0079.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any infrastructure which is required for the development of a subdivision, such as water lines, sewer lines or other public utilities, should be treated in the same manner as streets and roads. A municipality may not “reimburse” developers for infrastructure which
   as a matter of course becomes municipal property without compensation as to do so would constitute a donation in violation of the Mississippi Constitution. Hammack, Feb. 17, 2004, A.G. Op. 03-0695.
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Determination of those persons that must be named in the petition to alter or vacate a map or plat presented to the board of supervisors and who must agree in writing to the alteration is a question of fact that must be made by the board of supervisors. Furthermore, any scrivener’s error which would require the alteration of a lot line, must follow the procedures set forth in this section or in the alternative, §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.19.html#t19c27s19-27-31" target="_blank">19-27-31</a></cite>.

   For the appellate court to determine that the plat had been altered through abandonment of the road and easements, when there had been no chancery court determination after proper notice under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.19.html#t19c27s19-27-31" target="_blank">19-27-31</a></cite>, would be to permit the developer to sidestep the procedure for plat alteration that had been prescribed by the Legislature, which the appellate court could not do; therefore, the developer remained enjoined from proceeding with the development of the condominium development until such time as it had secured leave to do so after proper plat alteration proceedings pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.19.html#t19c27s19-27-31" target="_blank">19-27-31</a></cite> or Miss.

       An alley was town property, notwithstanding that the proclamation of incorporation of the town did not provide a property description identical to that contained in the 1906 plat which designated the alley.

       The action of the mayor and board of aldermen of a city in giving preliminary approval to the plat of a subdivision, which did not include dedication by the owner of a portion of his property to allow widening of an existing street to a width of 50 feet, as provided for in the city’s subdivision requirements was not arbitrary, capricious, or discriminatory where the subdivision regulations of the city included authorization for the planning commission to vary the regulations. Taquino v. Ocean Springs, 253 So. 2d 854, 1971 Miss. LEXIS 1242 (Miss. 1971).

       Where the plat of a subdivision established beyond the limits of a city contained the certificate of the owners and the engineers saying that the designated streets were private ways and not dedicated to the public, and restrictive covenants were placed upon the property to the same effect, there was no implied dedication of a strip of land subsequently used for drains and a dam, and the only part of the strip that could be used as a public street was the part actually improved and maintained by the city after the city limits were extended to encompass this subdivision.

       In an action to prevent the obstruction of an alley, a showing that the owners of certain lands in 1905 made and recorded a revised map showing the alley in question, use of the map as an official map of the town, the sale of lots by the original owners and subsequent purchasers according to the map, the use of the map for the purpose of the assessment, the non-assessment of streets and avenues for taxes, the opening and paving of most of the streets and avenues shown on the map, as well as other evidence, demonstrated that the town had accepted the dedication of the alley, even though it had not formally done so by ordinance or resolution.

       No county, board of supervisors of a county, municipality or governing authority of a municipality is authorized to establish a mandatory, minimum living wage rate, minimum number of vacation or sick days, whether paid or unpaid, that would regulate how a private employer pays its employees. Each county, board of supervisors of a county, municipality or governing authority of a municipality shall be prohibited from establishing a mandatory, minimum living wage rate, minimum number of vacation or sick days, whether paid or unpaid, that would regulate how a private employer pays its employees.
      </li>
      <li id="t17c01s17-1-51ol12">
       The Legislature finds that the prohibitions of subsection (1) of this section are necessary to ensure an economic climate conducive to new business development and job growth in the State of Mississippi. We believe that inconsistent application of wage and benefit laws from city to city or county to county must be avoided. While not suggesting a state minimum wage or minimum benefit package, any debate and subsequent action on these matters should be assigned to the Mississippi Legislature as provided in Section 25-3-40, and not local counties or municipalities.
      </li>
      <li id="t17c01s17-1-51ol13">
       The Legislature further finds that wages and employee benefits comprise the most significant expense of operating a business. It also recognizes that neither potential employees or business patrons are likely to restrict themselves to employment opportunities or goods and services in any particular county or municipality. Consequently, local variations in legally required minimum wage rates or mandatory minimum number of vacation or sick leave days would threaten many businesses with a loss of employees to local governments which require a higher minimum wage rate and many other businesses with the loss of patrons to areas which allow for a lower wage rate and more or less vacation or sick days. The net effect of this situation would be detrimental to the business environment of the state and to the citizens, businesses and governments of the local jurisdictions as well as the local labor markets.
      </li>
      <li id="t17c01s17-1-51ol14">
       The Legislature concludes from these findings that, in order for a business to remain competitive and yet attract and retain the highest possible caliber of employees, and thereby remain sound, an enterprise must work in a uniform environment with respect to minimum wage rates, and mandatory minimum number of vacation or sick leave days. The net impact of local variations in mandated wages and mandatory minimum number of vacation or sick leave days would be economically unstable and create a decline and decrease in the standard of living for the citizens of the state. Consequently, decisions regarding minimum wage, living wage and other employee benefit policies must be made by the state as provided in Section 25-3-40, so that consistency in the wage market is preserved.

      </p>
      <p>
       If governing authorities of municipality find that city funds appropriated to Chamber of Commerce will be used for purpose of advertising and bringing into favorable notice opportunities, possibilities and resources of city, then city may appropriate funds to Chamber of Commerce for these purposes; whether funds appropriated to Chamber of Commerce for salary of employee are achieving proper purposes is factual question. McGee, Sept. 10, 1992, A.G. Op. #92-0694.
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
       Mississippi Contract Procurement Center exists primarily to assist businesses in getting contracts and does not engage in advertising resources of particular municipality and therefore statute does not provide authority for municipality to contribute funds to Mississippi Contract Procurement Center.

       If the governing authorities of a city find consistent with fact and spread upon the minutes that city funds appropriated to the Chamber of Commerce will be used for the purpose set forth in this section of advertising and bringing into favorable notice the opportunities, possibilities and resources of the city, then they may appropriate such funds to the Chamber of Commerce for these purposes; to ensure that funds appropriated to the Chamber of Commerce are used for the purposes of advertising, the city may reimburse the Chamber of Commerce after the expenditures are made and may require documentation that the funds were used for advertising. Mills, April 2, 1999, A.G. Op. #99-0156.

      <p>
       Provided the necessary factual determinations required by this section are made by the board of supervisors, and that determination is duly recorded in the minutes, the purchase of advertising signs, such as a marquee calling attention to an agri-center, and the purchase of a sign to be placed within the facility itself would be statutorily authorized. The purchase of a sign solely for the purpose of selling advertising to private individuals or companies would not be permitted, but sale of excess space on the sign is permissible.

       Trial court properly granted a county convention and visitors bureau summary judgment in a visitor’s action alleging that the bureau failed to maintain a civic center’s grassy area in a safe condition because the bureau’s operation of the civic center was a discretionary function to which immunity attached; by owning and using the civic center, the bureau engaged in a function the statute authorized but did not require.

      The governing authorities of any county and the governing authorities of any municipality, are each authorized, in their discretion, upon order duly adopted and entered upon their official minutes, to lend to or to enter into leases with other counties or municipalities for the use of county-owned or municipally owned equipment and operators of such equipment. Such equipment and operators may be lent or leased for such amount and in accordance with such terms and conditions as the governing authorities may prescribe; however, such equipment and operators may be used only in the performance of public projects of a county or municipality. The lending or lease agreements also may include an equipment operator’s fee equal to the average hourly salary that is paid to all operators of such county-owned or municipally owned equipment by the county or municipality that lends or leases the equipment. Proceeds from the lending or leasing of such equipment shall be deposited into the road and bridge fund of the county or the municipal general fund, as the case may be.

       Although the statute allows a county to lend or lease county equipment to another county or municipality, there is no authority for a sheriff or county to loan a county vehicle to a probation officer who is an employee of a state entity. Bryan, April 10, 1998, A.G. Op. #98-0177.
      </p>
      <p>
       Provided a municipality has complied with all the procedural requirements of Section 21-9-11, a county has the authority to lend equipment and operators to the municipality to perform demolition work. With specific statutory authority such as that found in this section, there would be no requirement to enter into an Interlocal Cooperation Agreement to perform the work. McWilliams, July 25, 2003, A.G. Op. 03-0372.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under the authority of this section counties are empowered to enter into an agreement whereby one county as the providing county will use its equipment and operators to maintain an isolated road in the other county and the recipient county will reimburse the providing county for expenses incurred.

    Bonus consideration, delay drilling rentals, term, and royalties; rights of lessees.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      No lease authorized by this chapter shall be made:
     </p>
     <p>
      For an original bonus consideration of less than One Dollar ($1.00) per acre,
     </p>
     <p>
      For a delay drilling rental of less than One Dollar ($1.00) per acre per annum,
     </p>
     <p>
      For a primary term of more than six years and as long thereafter as oil, gas or other mineral is being produced from the leased premises or as long thereafter as lessee shall conduct drilling, mining, producing or other operations and during the production of oil, gas, sulphur or other mineral resulting therefrom,
     </p>
     <p>
      For royalties of less than
     </p>
     <p>
      1. On oil, one-eighth (1/8) of that produced and saved from the leased premises;
     </p>
     <p>
      2. On gas, including casinghead gas or other gaseous substances, produced from the leased premises and sold or used off the premises or in the manufacture of gasoline or other products therefrom, the market value at the well of one-eighth (1/8) of the amount realized from such sale;
     </p>
     <p>
      3. On sulphur mined and marketed, the royalty shall be Fifty Cents (50¢) per long ton;
     </p>
     <p>
      4. On all other minerals mined and marketed one-tenth (1/10) either in kind or value at the well or mine at lessee’s election.
     </p>
     <p>
      Lessee shall have free use of oil, gas, coal, and water from the leased premises, except water from lessor’s wells, for all operations thereunder, and the royalty on oil, gas and coal shall be computed after deducting any so used. Where the interest to be leased by a county or municipality is less than the full and undivided fee simple estate, then the bonus consideration, delay drilling rental and royalties required by this section may be reduced in the proportion which the interest of the county or municipality bears to the whole and undivided fee. Any such oil, gas and mineral lease may provide that where the production from a well producing gas or gas with well distillate or condensate only, is not sold or used, lessee may pay as royalty an annual amount equal to the amount of the drilling delay rental, and if such payment is made, it will be considered that such well is producing for every purpose thereunder.

Said lease also may include such other general provisions as are customary and proper for the protection of the rights of the lessor and of the lessee of the leased premises and as are not inconsistent or in conflict with the provisions of this chapter.

      The governing body of the district, county or city shall adopt a resolution declaring its intention to issue bonds for the purposes authorized by this chapter, stating the amount of the bonds proposed to be issued, whether such bonds are revenue bonds or general obligation bonds, and the date upon which further action will be taken by the governing body looking forward to the issuance of such bonds. Such resolution shall be published once a week for at least three successive weeks in a newspaper published and of general circulation within such county or city. The first of such publications shall be made at least twenty-one days prior to the date set forth in said resolution as the date upon which further action will be taken by the governing body, and the last publication shall be made not more than seven days prior to said date. If, prior to the date set forth as aforesaid, there shall be filed with the clerk of such governing body a petition in writing signed by ten percent (10%) of the qualified electors of such regional area, county or city thereof, or fifteen hundred (1,500) qualified electors, whichever shall be the lesser number, requesting an election on the question of the issuance of such bonds, then such bonds shall not be issued unless authorized by a majority of the qualified electors in such regional area, county or city voting thereon at an election to be ordered by the governing body for that purpose. Notice of such election shall be given and such election shall be held and conducted in like manner as provided by law with respect to elections held on the submission of county or city bond issues. If the proposition so submitted shall fail to receive approval at such election, then no further proceedings for the issuance of such bonds shall be taken for a period of six months from and after the date of such election. If, however, no such petition shall be filed, or if such election or subsequent election on such proposition shall be assented to by a majority of the qualified electors voting thereon, then such governing body shall be authorized to proceed with the issuance of such bonds without further election.

     <p>
      Notwithstanding the powers and authority conferred on the district by this chapter, it is not the intent of this chapter to limit, abridge, restrict, or curtail any existing power granted to any municipality by law, but to provide a vehicle through which municipalities may more effectively perform their governmental and corporate functions, and the provisions of this chapter shall be cumulative, additional, and supplemental. Notwithstanding provisions of this chapter to the contrary, a municipality shall not be required to secure the approval by the district of any feasibility study, plans, or projects which the municipality may elect to undertake separately. Wherever any public agencies are now authorized to join with other municipalities, and undertake projects, then such municipalities may elect to proceed under such general laws, or may elect to come within the provisions of this chapter. Notwithstanding any regulation or requirement of any federal agency to the contrary, the governing body of the district shall not act for or on behalf of any public agency of the district in its dealings with such federal agency without the express consent of the public agency involved. It is the intent of this chapter that the governing body of the district shall not be vested with any governmental powers or functions other than those voluntarily conferred upon it by public agencies in the manner provided in this chapter.

       Under Miss. Code Section 17-13-7, no power, authority or responsibility may be exercised under Interlocal Cooperation Act by local governmental unit which it did not have from independent source. Stone, Feb. 26, 1993, A.G. Op. #93-0123.
      </p>
      <p>
       Miss. Code Section 17-13-7(5) does not empower county to pledge its full faith and credit as security for Planning and Development District (PDD) loan, and there is no grant of authority which would allow county to guarantee particular level of funding to PDD in such manner that purports to bind county beyond current governing board’s term. McFatter, Apr. 28, 1993, A.G. Op. #93-0250.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing prohibits municipal governing authorities from allowing municipal courtroom to be used by other local or state governmental entities when not in use by municipality and such cooperation between municipality and other governmental entities does not appear to be joint power, authority and responsibility that would require an interlocal agreement. Mills, March 2, 1994, A.G. Op. #94-0078.
      </p>
      <p>
       Generally, board of supervisors is not authorized to expend money on behalf of human resource agencies for operating expenses; however, it was possible for agency and county to enter into interlocal agreement for county repair department to provide repair work and maintenance on county human resource agency’s vehicles. DeBerry, March 9, 1994, A.G. Op. #93-1020.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under Section 17-13-7 a district attorney’s office is a state agency for the purposes of the Interlocal Cooperation Act, and therefore, the district attorney’s office may enter into an interlocal agreement with a local governmental unit to create a Drug Task Force. Evans, May 10, 1996, A.G. Op. #96-0280.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no authority for a county to enter into an agreement to house prisoners from another state in the county jail. Walters, January 9, 1998, A.G. Op. #97-0832.
      </p>
      <p>
       Other than specific situations specified by statute, there is no statutory authority which would permit a municipality to enter into an interlocal agreement with a county whereby the two entities could jointly carry out the flood control and drainage activities on the described property; the best course of action may be for the city and county to pursue local and private legislation approving the property in question as an industrial park and authorizing the work necessary to address the potential flooding issue. Prichard, January 15, 1998, A.G. Op. #97-0784.
      </p>
      <p>
       A city, county, and community college district may, but are not required to, enter into an interlocal agreement to accomplish the construction of a regional vocational education center.

       The authority granted in the Interlocal Cooperation Act authorizes governmental entities to jointly exercise powers which each entity has independent statutory authority to exercise; but the act does not enhance the authority of governmental entities.

       There is no authority for a municipality to enter into an interlocal agreement to perform animal control services or to exercise law enforcement authority in the county for consideration. Mitchell, Mar. 15, 2002, A.G. Op. #02-0094.

      <p>
       1993 amendment to Section 17-17-227 authorizes governing bodies to assess and collect fees from each single family residential generator of nonhazardous solid waste and each industrial, commercial and multi-family residential generator of nonhazardous solid waste for all periods of time such generator has not otherwise contracted for collection and disposal at permitted or authorized facility, but these amendments do not alter Section 17-17-13 exemption.

       Hazardous wastes shall not be handled or disposed of along with or in the same site or adjoining site as ordinary wastes unless specifically approved as exempted waste by the department. These shall be disposed of by special incinerators, separate landfills, or other means dictated by the particularities of the hazardous waste involved, as determined by the department or other responsible agency. The department may, in its discretion, maintain a field office at any treatment or disposal facility that receives hazardous wastes directly or indirectly from more than one (1) generator. However, the department shall maintain a field office at any commercial off-site multiuser hazardous waste incinerator designed to incinerate multiple nonhomogeneous types of wastes, and the cost of operating such field office shall be borne by the owner of such commercial hazardous waste incinerator. The field office, when required, shall be located in adequate accommodations provided by the facility owner and shall be staffed with department regulatory personnel as deemed necessary by the department. In exercising its discretion to determine the need for a field office, regulatory staff and support equipment, the department shall consider, at a minimum, the type and amount of hazardous waste received and also the type of facility. All fees shall be established by the department and shall be in addition to any other fees provided by law. The fee prescribed by the department shall be in an amount not less than the actual operating expenses of the permanent field office and shall be in addition to any other fees required by law.

It is the intent of the Legislature that commercial hazardous waste landfills be located on those sites which, by virtue of their geologic conditions, provide a high degree of environmental protection. In carrying out the intent of this provision, the commission is authorized to adopt siting criteria for commercial hazardous waste landfills which are more stringent or extensive in scope, coverage and effect than the rules and regulations promulgated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency.

Commercial hazardous waste underground injection wells designed or intended to dispose of multiple nonhomogeneous types of wastes from multiple sources other than the owner of the well are hereby prohibited in the State of Mississippi.
       <p>
        A commercial hazardous waste landfill shall not be located on the same site or within one thousand (1,000) feet of an existing or abandoned ordinary waste disposal site, unless the hazardous waste to be disposed of in said commercial landfill is specifically approved as exempted.

However, no person shall construct any new hazardous waste treatment or disposal facility or site or substantially alter any such existing facility or site, nor shall the permit board issue a permit for any such construction or alteration, until the commission has promulgated rules and regulations under the provisions of subsection (1)(j) of this section. Said rules and regulations shall be equivalent to counterpart rules and regulations of the Environmental Protection Agency whether now in effect or hereinafter promulgated. Any person who has made an application for a permit for an existing facility under this section shall be treated as having been issued such permit until such time as final administrative disposition of such application has been made unless the cause of such delay is the result of the failure of the applicant to furnish information reasonably required or requested in order to process the application.

       Any permit issued under this section may be revoked by the issuing agency at any time when the permittee fails to comply with the terms and conditions of the permit. Where the obtaining of or compliance with any permit required under this section would, in the judgment of the department, cause undue or unreasonable hardship to any person, the department may issue a variance from these requirements. In no case shall the duration of any such variance exceed one (1) year. Renewals or extensions may be given only after an opportunity has been given for public comment on each such renewal or extension.

      </p>
      <p>
       “Whereas, such organizations would take possession of such collected solid wastes, and would salvage those materials which can be recycled, and would reduce the great mass of the remainder into fuel; and

      <p>
       “Whereas, such cooperative and complementary collection, recovery and disposal operations, appear to be in the best interest of the local governments and of the State of Mississippi; Now, therefore,

   In reviewing an order by the Mississippi Commission on Environmental Quality (Commission) requiring a county board of supervisors to bring its sanitary landfill into compliance with the closure requirements of the Mississippi Nonhazardous Waste Regulations and imposing a $4000 penalty, a chancellor exceeded the limited scope of review for agency decisions where the chancellor affirmed the Commission’s order but modified it by ordering that the penalty be deposited into a separate fund to be spent curing the violations, instead of being paid into the Pollution Emergency Fund as provided by §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.49.html#t49c17s49-17-68" target="_blank">49-17-68</a></cite>, and that any funds remaining after closure be returned to the general fund of the county; a penalty should be assessed under the same standard of review as is employed when reviewing other agency findings and actions, and therefore the chancellor had no authority to substitute his own judgment for that of the agency by replacing the penalty with one he felt was more suited to the circumstances.

    Legislative intent as to promotion of projects for treatment of solid and hazardous wastes; certificate of public convenience and necessity; approval by Department of Environmental Quality and Mississippi Development Authority required for certain projects.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      It is the intent of the Legislature by the passage of Sections 17-17-101 through 17-17-135 to authorize municipalities to acquire, own and lease a project for the purpose of promoting the construction and installation of projects for the sale, collection, treatment, processing, reprocessing, generation, distribution, recycling, elimination, or disposal of solid and hazardous waste products, as hereinafter defined, by inducing manufacturing and industrial enterprises, qualified persons, firms, or corporations to locate and construct said projects in this state. It is intended that each project be self-liquidating. Sections 17-17-101 through 17-17-135 shall be construed to conform with its intent. Except as otherwise provided for projects to recycle solid waste products, the powers hereby conferred upon the municipalities shall be exercised only after such municipality has obtained a certificate of public convenience and necessity from the Mississippi Board of Economic Development as provided in Sections 57-1-19, 57-1-21, 57-1-23 and 57-1-27; provided, however, that if a project is constructed solely with revenue bonds the board shall not be required to adjudicate that there are adequate property values and suitable financial conditions so that the total bonded indebtedness of the municipality, solely for the purposes authorized by Sections 17-17-101 through 17-17-135, shall not exceed twenty percent (20%) of the total assessed valuation of the property in the municipality. The powers conferred in this section to municipalities for projects to recycle or sell recycled solid waste products shall be exercised only after such project has been approved by the Department of Environmental Quality and the Mississippi Development Authority.

    Resolution for issuance of revenue bonds; notice of resolution; protest and election.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Before issuing any revenue bonds hereunder, the governing body of any municipality shall adopt a resolution declaring its intention to so issue, stating the amount of bonds proposed to be issued, the purpose for which the bonds are to be issued, and the date upon which the governing body proposes to direct the issuance of such bonds. Such resolution shall be published once a week for at least three (3) consecutive weeks in at least one (1) newspaper published in the county in which such municipality is located. The first publication of such resolution shall be made not less than twenty-one (21) days prior to the date fixed in such resolution for the issuance of the bonds and the last publication shall be made not more than seven (7) days prior to such date. If no newspaper be published in such county, then such notice shall be given by publishing the resolution for the required time in some newspaper having a general circulation in such county, and, in addition, by posting a copy of such resolution for at least twenty-one (21) days next preceding the date fixed therein at three (3) public places in such county. If twenty percent (20%) or fifteen hundred (1500), whichever is less, of the qualified electors of the municipality shall file a written protest against the issuance of such bonds on or before the date specified in such resolution, then an election on the question of the issuance of such bonds shall be called and held as herein provided. If no such protest be filed, then such bonds may be issued without an election at any time within a period of two (2) years after the date specified in the above-mentioned resolution. However, the governing body of such municipality, in its discretion, may nevertheless call an election on the question of the issuance of the bonds, in which event it shall not be necessary to publish the resolution declaring its intention to issue bonds as herein provided.

      When the results of the election on the question of the issuance of such bonds shall have been canvassed by the election commissioners of such municipality and certified by them to the governing body of such municipality, it shall be the duty of such governing body to determine and adjudicate whether or not a majority of the qualified electors who voted thereon in such election voted in favor of the issuance of such bonds, and unless this is the case, then such bonds shall not be issued. Should a majority of the qualified electors who vote thereon in such election vote in favor of the issuance of such bonds, then the governing body of the municipality may issue such bonds, either in whole or in part, within two (2) years from the date of such election, or within two (2) years after the final favorable termination of any litigation affecting the issuance of such bonds, as such governing body shall deem best.

     <p>
      The bonds issued by a municipality under authority of Sections 17-17-101 through 17-17-135 shall be limited obligations of such municipality. The principal, interest and redemption premium, if any, shall be payable solely out of the moneys to be derived by the municipality pursuant to the agreements specified in subsections (d) and (e) of Section 17-17-105. Revenue bonds and interest coupons issued under authority of Sections 17-17-101 through 17-17-135 shall never constitute an indebtedness of such municipality within the meaning of any state constitutional provision or statutory limitation and shall never constitute nor give rise to a pecuniary liability of the municipality, or a charge against its general credit or taxing powers, and such fact shall be plainly stated on the face of each bond. Such bonds may be executed and delivered at any time as a single issue or from time to time as several issues; may be in such form and denominations; may be of such tenor; may be in registered or bearer form either as to principal or interest or both; may be payable in such installments and at such time or times not exceeding thirty (30) years from their date; may be subject to such terms of redemption; may be payable at such place or places; may bear interest at such rate or rates as the governing board and the industry shall agree upon, provided that the bonds of any issue shall not bear a greater overall maximum interest rate to maturity than that allowed in Section 75-17-103; and may contain such other provisions not inconsistent herewith, as the municipality may determine, all of which shall be provided in the proceedings authorizing the bonds. Any revenue bonds issued under the authority of Sections 17-17-101 through 17-17-135 may be sold at public or private sale at such price and in such manner and from time to time as may be determined by the governing board to be most advantageous, and the governing board may pay, as a part of the cost of acquiring any facilities out of the bond proceeds, all expenses, premiums and commissions with the authorization, sale and issuance thereof. All bonds issued under the authority of Sections 17-17-101 through 17-17-135, except registered bonds which are registered otherwise than to bearer, and all interest coupons appurtenant thereto shall be construed to be negotiable instruments, despite the fact that they are payable solely from a specified source. The proceedings authorizing the issuance of bonds may provide for the issuance, in the future, of further bonds on a parity with those initially issued. Bonds issued hereunder shall be validated in the chancery court in which the municipality is located.

    Security for bonds.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The principal, interest and premium, if any, on any bonds shall be secured by a pledge of the revenues payable to the municipality, pursuant to either of the agreements specified in subsections (d) and (e) of Section 17-17-105 and may also, in the case of an agreement under subsection (e) of Section 17-17-105, be secured by a lien which may be subordinate to a prior lien on any other property given as security by the industry pursuant to the lease/sale and any bonds may be issued pursuant to and secured by a trust indenture. The proceedings under which bonds are authorized to be issued or any such trust indenture may contain any agreements and provisions customarily contained in instruments securing bonds, including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, provisions respecting the fixing and collection of the sums payable by the industry to the municipality and/or the trustee, if any, as the case may be, pursuant to the lease/sale, the maintenance and insurance of a project, the creation and maintenance of special funds by the industry, and the rights and remedies available in the event of default to the bondholders or to the trustee under such trust indenture, all as the governing board shall deem advisable. Provided, however, that in making any such agreements or provisions, no municipality shall have the power to obligate itself except with respect to any security pledged, mortgaged or otherwise made available by the industry for the securing of revenue bonds, and the application of the revenues from the agreement, made under either subsection (d) or (e) of Section 17-17-105 and shall not have the power to incur a pecuniary liability or a charge upon its general credit or against its taxing powers. The proceedings authorizing any revenue bonds hereunder and any trust indenture securing such bonds may provide that in the event of default in payment of the principal of or the interest on such bonds or in the performance of any agreement contained in such proceedings or trust indenture, such payment and performance may be enforced by mandamus or by the appointment of a receiver in equity with such powers as may be necessary to enforce the obligations thereof. No breach of any such agreement shall impose any pecuniary liability upon any municipality, or any charge upon its general credit or against its taxing power.
     </p>
     <p>
      The trustee or trustees under any trust indenture, or any depository specified by such trust indenture, may be such persons or corporations as the governing board shall designate, notwithstanding that they may be nonresidents of Mississippi or incorporated under the laws of the United States or the laws of other states of the United States.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Any revenue bonds issued hereunder and at any time outstanding may at any time be refunded by a municipality by the issuance of its refunding bonds in such amount as the governing board may deem necessary, but not exceeding an amount sufficient to refund the principal of the bonds so to be refunded, together with any unpaid interest thereon and any premiums and commissions necessary to be paid in connection therewith. Any such refunding may be effected whether the bonds to be refunded shall have been matured or shall thereafter mature, either by sale of the refunding bonds and the application of the proceeds thereof for the payment of the bonds to be refunded thereby, or by exchange of the refunding bonds for the bonds to be refunded thereby, provided that the holders of any bonds so to be refunded shall not be compelled without their consent to surrender their bonds for payment or exchange prior to the date on which they are payable or, if they are called for redemption, prior to the date on which they are by their terms subject to redemption. Any refunding bonds issued under the authority of this section shall be payable solely from the revenues out of which the bonds to be refunded hereby were payable, and shall be subject to the provisions contained in Section 17-17-115, and may be secured in accordance with the provisions of Section 17-17-117.

      <li id="t17c17s17-17-203ol11">
       The Legislature finds that:
       <ol type="a">
        <li id="t17c17s17-17-203ol11a">
         Over one million five hundred thousand (1,500,000) tons of municipal solid waste are generated in Mississippi each year of which an estimated fifty thousand (50,000) tons is not even collected for disposal;
        </li>
        <li id="t17c17s17-17-203ol11b">
         On the average, each Mississippian currently discards approximately four (4) pounds of municipal solid waste each day;
        </li>
        <li id="t17c17s17-17-203ol11c">
         There are currently ninety-eight (98) commercial nonhazardous solid waste management facilities in this state;
        </li>
        <li id="t17c17s17-17-203ol11d">
         Most of the permitted sanitary landfill capacity will be used within the next ten (10) years;
        </li>
        <li id="t17c17s17-17-203ol11e">
         Monthly household collection fees have increased approximately fifteen percent (15%) in the last year. The costs of nonhazardous solid waste management will increase significantly due to decreased landfill capacity and more stringent federal requirements for nonhazardous solid waste management facilities. More stringent federal requirements may force an estimated eighty percent (80%) of the existing permitted facilities to close;
        </li>
        <li id="t17c17s17-17-203ol11f">
         Mississippians are spending approximate Fifty-five Million Dollars ($55,000,000.00) on nonhazardous solid waste management;
        </li>
        <li id="t17c17s17-17-203ol11g">
         Inefficient and improper methods of managing nonhazardous solid waste create hazards to the public health, cause pollution of air and water resources, constitute a waste of natural resources, have an adverse effect on land values and create public nuisances;
        </li>
        <li id="t17c17s17-17-203ol11h">
         Problems of nonhazardous solid waste management have become a matter statewide in scope and necessitate state action to assist local governments in identifying, financing, and improving methods and processes for more efficient management and collection of nonhazardous solid waste; and
        </li>
        <li id="t17c17s17-17-203ol11i">
         The economic and population growth of our state and improvements in the standard of living enjoyed by our population have resulted in a rising tide of unwanted and discarded materials.

         Reaffirm the state’s policy of minimizing the amount of nonhazardous solid waste being generated and managed at facilities in the state and the commitment to reach the state’s goal of reducing and minimizing waste generated in Mississippi by a minimum of twenty-five percent (25%) by January 1, 1996;
        </li>
        <li id="t17c17s17-17-203ol11i2c">
         Provide that a county shall have the power and its duty shall be to ensure the availability of adequate permitted management capacity for the nonhazardous solid waste which is generated within its boundaries;

       § 17-17-233.
    Establishment, collection and disposition of fees, surcharges, etc., to produce resources for closure of landfills and post-closure monitoring and remediation.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      From and after October 9, 1993, the owner of a sanitary landfill shall establish a fee, or a surcharge on existing fees or other appropriate revenue-producing mechanism, to ensure the availability of financial resources for the proper closure of the sanitary landfill and post-closure monitoring and remediation. However, the disposal of solid waste by persons on their own property, as described in Section 17-17-13, Mississippi Code of 1972, is exempt from this section.
     </p>
     <p>
      The revenue-producing mechanism must produce revenue at a rate sufficient to generate funds to meet state and federal landfill closure and post-closure requirements.
     </p>
     <p>
      The revenue shall be deposited in an interest-bearing escrow account to be held and administered by the owner. The owner shall file with the department an annual audit of the account. The audit shall be conducted by a certified public accountant and shall be filed no later than December 31 of each year. Failure to collect or report such revenue is a noncriminal violation, punishable by a fine of not more than Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000.00) for each offense. The owner may make expenditures from the account and its accumulated interest only for the purpose of landfill closure and post-closure requirements. If such expenditures do not deplete the fund to the detriment of eventual closure and post-closure requirements, any monies remaining in the account after paying for proper and complete closure and all post-closure requirements, as determined by the commission, shall be returned to the owner.
     </p>
     <p>
      The revenue generated under this section and any accumulated interest thereon may be applied to the repayment of any loan or the payment of, or pledged as security for, the payment of revenue bonds issued in whole or in part for the purpose of complying with state and federal landfill closure and post-closure requirements. Such application or pledge may be made directly in the proceedings authorizing such bonds or in an agreement with an insurer of bonds to assure such insurer of additional security therefor.

     <p>
      An owner or operator of a sanitary landfill may establish proof of financial responsibility with the commission in lieu of the requirements of Section 17-17-233. Such proof may include surety bonds, certificates of deposit, securities, letter of credit, or other methods, as approved by the commission, showing that the owner or operator has sufficient financial resources to cover, at a minimum, the costs of complying with any closure and post-closure requirements. The owner or operator shall estimate such costs to the satisfaction of the commission.

       Any public agency may, pursuant to a duly adopted resolution, contract with the authority for the authority to acquire, construct or provide facilities and projects to be owned by the authority for furnishing municipal solid waste management services to the public agency or to users within the boundaries of the public agency. The public agency shall be obligated to make payments which shall be sufficient to enable the authority to meet its expenses, interest and principal payments (whether at maturity or upon sinking funds redemption) for its bonds, reserves for debt service, payments into funds for operation and maintenance and renewals and replacements and the requirements of any rate covenant with respect to debt service coverage contained in any resolution, trust indenture or other security agreement relating to its bonds. Such contracts may also contain other terms and conditions as the authority and the public agency may determine, including provisions whereby the public agency is obligated to make payments under such contract whether or not use or services are rendered or whether or not the facilities are completed, operable or operating, and notwithstanding suspension, interruption, interference, reduction or curtailment of the use or services of such facilities. Such contracts may be for a term covering the life of the facilities or for any other term or for an indefinite period and may be made with or without consideration and may provide that the amounts payable by the public agency are in lieu of all or any part of the rates, fees and other charges which would otherwise be collected from the users of the facilities.

      The authority may issue refunding bonds for the purpose of paying any of its bonds at or prior to maturity or upon acceleration or redemption. Refunding bonds may be issued at such time prior to the maturity or redemption of the refunded bonds as the authority deems to be in the public interest. The refunding bonds may be issued in sufficient amounts to pay or provide the principal of the bonds being refunded, together with any redemption premium thereof, any interest accrued or to accrue to the date of payment of such bonds, the expenses of issue of the refunding bonds, the expenses of redeeming the bonds being refunded, and such reserves for debt service or other capital or current expenses from the proceeds of such refunding bonds as may be required by the resolution, trust indenture or other security instruments. The issue of refunding bonds, the maturities and other details thereof, the security therefor, the rights of the holders and the rights, duties and obligations of the authority shall be governed by Sections 17-17-327 and 17-17-329 relating to the issue of bonds other than refunding bonds insofar as the same may be applicable.

       Under Section 17-17-227, a county does not have to establish a regional solid waste authority to develop and implement its solid waste management plan. However, pursuant to Section 17-17-345, a county may contract with a regional solid waste authority to manage its solid waste for a term not to exceed thirty (30) years. Ainsworth, May 10, 1995, A.G.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The Legislature finds that:
     </p>
     <p>
      Uncontrolled disposal of waste tires may create a public health and safety problem because tire piles act as breeding sites for mosquitoes and other disease-transmitting vectors, pose substantial fire hazards and present a difficult disposal problem for landfills.
     </p>
     <p>
      A significant number of waste tires are illegally dumped in Mississippi.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is in the state’s best interest to encourage efforts to recycle or recover resources from waste tires.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is desirable to discourage the landfilling of whole waste tires.

     <p>
      The commission may promulgate and enforce rules and regulations pertaining to collection, transportation, storage, processing and disposal of waste tires and may modify, repeal, make exceptions to and grant exemptions and variances from the rules and regulations. The rules and regulations shall include:
     </p>
     <p>
      Methods of collection, storage, processing and disposal of waste tires. The following are permissible methods of waste tire processing and disposal:
     </p>
     <p>
      Controlling soil erosion, when whole tires are not used;
     </p>
     <p>
      Grinding into crumbs for use in road asphalt, tire derived fuel and as raw materials for other products;
     </p>
     <p>
      Pyrolizing or other physico-chemical processing;
     </p>
     <p>
      Incineration;
     </p>
     <p>
      Landfilling split, ground, chopped, sliced or shredded waste tires until July 1, 2000. Beginning July 1, 2000, the landfilling of waste tires in any form, including, but not limited to, split, ground, chopped, sliced, shredded or whole waste tires is prohibited, unless the commission grants an exception. In determining whether to grant an exception, the commission shall consider the following factors: A. Whether sufficient end-use or recycling markets have developed in all or parts of the state, B. whether the condition of the waste tire or waste tire derived material prevents recycling, C. whether the prohibition on landfilling waste tires will place a financial burden on local governments, or D. other factors the commission deems relevant. It is the intent of the Legislature that the commission shall, to the extent practicable, grant exceptions in areas of the state where the prohibition against landfilling waste tires will pose a demonstrated, unfunded financial burden on local governments.

     <p>
      Other methods as approved by the commission.

     <p>
      Procedures for authorization or permitting for waste tire collection sites, waste tire processing facilities, waste tire haulers and waste tire disposal sites, including a review of the applicant’s performance history;
     </p>
     <p>
      Requirements for location of facilities at which waste tires are collected, stored, processed or disposed, with regards to property boundaries and buildings, pest control, accessibility by fire fighting equipment and other considerations as they relate to protection of public health and safety and the environment; and
     </p>

If the person fails to take the requested action, the commission shall order the person to abate the unauthorized waste tire dump. If the person responsible for the unauthorized waste tire dump is not the owner of the property on which the unauthorized waste tire dump is located, the commission may order the property owner to permit abatement of the unauthorized waste tire dump. If the person responsible for the unauthorized waste tire dump fails to comply with the order, the commission shall take any action necessary to abate the unauthorized waste tire dump, including entering the property where the unauthorized waste tire dump is located and confiscating the waste tires or arranging to have the waste tires processed or removed.

The commission may initiate a civil action to recover these costs from any persons responsible for the unauthorized waste tire dump.

       Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, a community desiring to volunteer to host the state commercial hazardous waste management facility to be operated pursuant to this chapter may propose to do so by the adoption of a resolution by a majority vote of the governing body of the local governmental unit. The committee shall determine the adequacy of any proposal to voluntarily host the state commercial hazardous waste management facility. Once a proposal to volunteer to host the state commercial hazardous waste management facility has been accepted in writing by the committee, the resolution making such proposal may not be rescinded by the governing body of the local governmental unit, unless the management category or categories determined under Section 49-29-7 is changed after the date of the submission of such category determination to the Hazardous Waste Technical Siting Committee. The governing body of the local governmental unit shall hold a minimum of two (2) public hearings prior to submission of a resolution regarding any proposal to volunteer to host the state commercial hazardous waste management facility pursuant to this chapter. The governing body of the local governmental unit shall advertise its intent to hold the public hearings. The advertisement shall be in a newspaper of general circulation in the county. The advertisement shall be no less than one-fourth (1/4) page in size and the type used shall be no smaller than eighteen (18) point and surrounded by a one-fourth (1/4) inch solid black border. The advertisement may not be placed in that portion of the newspaper where legal notices and classified advertisements appear. It is legislative intent that, whenever possible, the advertisement appear in a newspaper that is published at least five (5) days a week, unless the only newspaper in the county is published less than five (5) days a week. It is further the intent of the Legislature that the newspaper selected be one of general interest and readership in the community, and not one of limited subject matter. The advertisement shall be run once each week for the two (2) weeks preceding the public hearings. The advertisement shall state that the governing body will meet on a certain day, time and place fixed in the advertisement, which shall be not less than seven (7) days after the day the first advertisement is published, for the purpose of hearing comments regarding the proposed resolution and to explain the reasons for the proposed resolution.

       Planning and Development Districts are not political subdivisions of state or local government, but county governing authorities have discretionary authority to appropriate funds to PDD in which county is located; there is no authority for counties to establish, charter and/or incorporate separate PDD as private corporation under Mississippi Nonprofit Corporation Act or other laws of state.

       Before any money is borrowed under the provisions of this article, the governing authority shall adopt a resolution declaring the necessity for such borrowing and specifying the purpose for which the money borrowed is to be expended, the amount to be borrowed, the date or dates of the maturity thereof, and how such indebtedness is to be evidenced. The resolution shall be certified over the signature of the head of the governing authority.

       The borrowing shall be evidenced by negotiable notes or certificates of indebtedness of the governing authority which shall be signed by the head and clerk of such governing authority. All such notes or certificates of indebtedness shall be offered at public sale by the governing authority after not less than ten (10) days’ advertising in a newspaper having general circulation within the governing authority. Each sale shall be made to the bidder offering the lowest rate of interest or whose bid represents the lowest net cost to the governing authority; however, the rate of interest shall not exceed that now or hereafter authorized in Section 75-17-101, Mississippi Code of 1972. No such notes or certificates of indebtedness shall be issued and sold for less than par and accrued interest. All notes or certificates of indebtedness shall mature in approximately equal installments of principal and interest over a period not to exceed five (5) years from the dates of the issuance thereof. Principal shall be payable annually, and interest shall be payable annually or semiannually; provided, however, that the first payment of principal or interest may be for any period not exceeding one (1) year. Provided, however, if negotiable notes are outstanding from not more than one (1) previous issue authorized under the provisions of this article, then the schedule of payments for a new or supplementary issue may be so adjusted that the schedule of maturities of all notes or series of notes hereunder shall, when combined, mature in approximately equal installments of principal and interest over a period of five (5) years from the date of the new or supplementary issue, or if a lower interest rate will thereby be secured on notes previously issued and outstanding, a portion of the proceeds of any issue authorized hereunder may be used to refund the balance of the indebtedness previously issued under the authority of this article. Such notes or certificates of indebtedness shall be issued in such form and in such denominations as may be determined by the governing authority and may be made payable at the office of any bank or trust company selected by the governing authority. In such case, funds for the payment of principal and interest due thereon shall be provided in the same manner provided by law for the payment of the principal and interest due on bonds issued by the governing authority.

       For the prompt payment of notes or certificates of indebtedness at maturity, both principal and interest, the full faith, credit and resources of the issuing entity are pledged. If the issuing entity does not have available funds in an amount sufficient to provide for the payment of principal and interest according to the terms of such notes or certificates of indebtedness, then the governing authority shall annually levy a special tax upon all of its taxable property at a rate the avails of which will be sufficient to provide such payment. Funds derived from any such tax shall be paid into a sinking fund and used exclusively for the payment of principal of and interest on the notes or certificates of indebtedness. Until needed for expenditure, monies in the sinking fund may be invested in the same manner as the governing authority is elsewhere authorized by law to invest surplus funds.

       This section applies to all contractors. Those contractors holding a certificate of responsibility from the State Board of Public Contractors are not required to pay any fees for obtaining such a license. Chamberlin, Feb. 2, 2004, A.G. Op. 03-0583.
      </p>
      <p>
       As long as the municipality or county in which a contractor obtains a local contractors license uses a qualified examination to determine competency, and the contractor meets the other requirements set out in the statute, all other municipalities and counties in which the contractor wishes to work must grant reciprocity for that examination, although they may require a separate privilege license. Chamberlin, Feb. 2, 2004, A.G. Op. 03-0583.
      </p>
      <p>
       A local jurisdiction is empowered to require local licensing, even for those contractors holding a certificate of responsibility from the State Board of Public Contractors, but is not mandated to require such a license. If a license is required, no fee shall be imposed. Chamberlin, Feb. 2, 2004, A.G. Op. 03-0583.
      </p>
      <p>
       The provision of this section specifically authorizing local jurisdictions to require contractors doing business in that locality to impose a bond is not limited solely to those jurisdictions in which the contractor has a separate place of business. Chamberlin, Feb. 2, 2004, A.G. Op. 03-0583.

      <p>
       If the exam administered to contractors prior to the effective date of this section was not approved by either the State Board of Contractors or the Building Officials Association of Mississippi, the section does not permit the “grandfathering” in of such contractors and a city or county may not extend reciprocity to them until they have successfully passed an examination in accordance with the statute.

   In a wrongful death case in which a mother alleged constitutional claims under 42 U.S.C.S. § 1983 against a sheriff, arguing that Miss. Code Annotated §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t17c25s17-25-11" target="_self">17-25-11</a></cite> prohibited the use of sheriff’s department equipment, other than the uniform and weapon, by off-duty officers and that the sheriff not only failed to train his deputies that such equipment could not lawfully be used by them for off-duty employment but went so far as to adopt a policy affirmatively allowing such off-duty use, that argument failed. The statute did not clearly prohibit the off-duty use of equipment other than that specifically authorized; thus it was by no means apparent that the sheriff’s policy ran afoul of state law.

    Continued payment of compensation and related benefits of county or municipality employees who protect public interest and are injured in the line of duty.

     <p>
      The governing authority of any municipality and the board of supervisors of any county may, in its discretion, adopt a policy to continue to pay all or a portion of the regular compensation and related benefits of any law enforcement officer, firefighter or other employee that protects the public interest of the municipality or county who is injured in the line of duty, during the time that the injured employee is physically unable to perform the duties of his or her employment, in accordance with the following:
     </p>
     <p>
      The municipality or county may continue to pay all or a portion of the injured employee’s regular compensation and related benefits until such time as the employee is physically able to perform the duties of his or her employment, or the employee retires on a disability retirement allowance, whichever occurs first.
     </p>
     <p>
      The maximum portion of the injured employee’s regular compensation that the municipality or county may continue to pay is the difference between the total amount that the injured employee is receiving from workers’ compensation benefits and disability benefits from the trust fund created under Section 45-2-21 and the amount of the employee’s regular compensation.
     </p>
     <p>
      At such time as the injured employee is no longer receiving any workers’ compensation benefits or disability benefits from the trust fund created under Section 45-2-21, the municipality or county may continue to pay the full amount of the employee’s regular compensation for such period of time as allowed under the policy.

     <p>
      The Legislature finds the following:
     </p>
     <p>
      Population growth as well as development in historical communities result in new and increased demands for public facilities and services that promote the public peace, health, safety, and general welfare;
     </p>
     <p>
      The residents and property owners in these communities should have reasonable methods available so they can provide these public facilities and services; and
     </p>
     <p>
      The ability of residents and property owners in historical communities to propose the establishment of municipal historical hamlets is a method to fulfill the demands for these much needed public facilities and services.
