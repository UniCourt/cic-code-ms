   Private plaintiffs having initiated action against private defendants in District Court to quiet title to property riparian to Mississippi River, Louisiana having filed a third-party complaint against Mississippi seeking to determine boundary between states, and District Court having denied leave to Louisiana to file bill and then finding land to be part of Mississippi uncompromising language of 28 USCS § 1251(a), which gives original and exclusive jurisdiction to Supreme Court over controversies between two or more States, deprived District Court of jurisdiction over Louisiana’s third-party complaint. While District Court’s adjudication of private action involving boundary did not violate section, adjudication of such action would not be binding on states in any way. However, because both District Court and Court of Appeals intermixed questions of title and location of boundary, matter would be remanded to determine whether, on record, claims of title may fairly be decided without additional proceedings in District Court.

       The preamble to Laws of 2005, ch. 302, reads as follows:
      </p>
      <p>
       “WHEREAS, the American Alligator is found in the southeastern United States from Texas to Florida, and from South Carolina to the Gulf Coast.
   They are found in both natural and manmade freshwater lakes, ponds, rivers and wetland areas; and
      </p>
      <p>
       “WHEREAS, the Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks estimates that there are 32,000-38,000 alligators and about 408,000 acres of alligator habitat in Mississippi. Alligator reports have come from as far north as Coahoma, Lafayette and Itawamba Counties, and as far south as the coastal counties of Jackson, Harrison and Hancock; and
      </p>
      <p>
       “WHEREAS, alligators are important to the ecology of their habitat.
   During droughts, they dig holes, or dens, which provide water for the wildlife community.
   The alligators construct these ‘gator holes’ with their large sweeping tails that retain water during periods of drought.
   This provides water and foraging space for many other species, such as wading birds; and
      </p>
      <p>
       “WHEREAS, alligators are unique in that, unlike other reptiles, female alligators will protect their young for up to two years after hatching.
   We feel this sets a good example for all animal parents.
   They have proven themselves to be highly resilient to both natural and induced mortality.
   In fact, they are known to have existed before the dinosaurs – more than 200 million years ago; and
      </p>
      <p>
       “WHEREAS, alligators are one of the few animals that have been listed as endangered and rallied back again.”

    State toy.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The Teddy Bear is designated the state toy of Mississippi, in recognition of the Mississippi connection to the origin of the Teddy Bear. The connection is that on November 14, 1902, during a hunting expedition led by distinguished Mississippian Holt Collier in Smedes, Mississippi, President Theodore Roosevelt refused to shoot a small, exhausted black bear. The shot not fired at a baby bear in the Mississippi Delta became a great credit to the heroic and sportsmanlike conduct of President Roosevelt, and because of the President’s journey to Mississippi, the stuffed bear toy was appropriately named the “Teddy Bear,” a positive symbol of love, comfort and joy for children of all ages.

       Defendant’s conviction for possession of cocaine, more then 10 grams, but less than 30 grams was appropriate because the State did not lack jurisdiction to prosecute the charge against him even though he was arrested on property owned by the United States. It was not unusual for the United States to own within a state lands which were set apart and used for public purposes, and such ownership and use, without more, did not withdraw the lands from the jurisdiction of the state; Mississippi was free to enforce its criminal and civil laws on federal land as long as the laws did not conflict with federal law.

      Section 3. Delegate Identity and Procedure. States shall be represented at the Convention through duly appointed delegates. The number, identity and authority of delegates assigned to each State shall be determined by this Compact in the case of Member States or, in the case of States that are not Member States, by their respective state laws. However, to prevent disruption of proceedings, no more than three (3) delegates may attend and participate in the Convention on behalf of any State. A certified chaptered conforming copy of this Compact, together with government-issued photographic proof of identification, shall suffice as credentials for delegates of Member States.

The transaction of any business on behalf of the Convention, including the designation of a Secretary, the adoption of parliamentary procedures and the rejection or proposal of any constitutional amendment, requires a quorum to be present and a majority affirmative vote of those States constituting the quorum.
     </p>
     <p>
      Section 7. Emergency Suspension and Relocation of the Convention. In the event that the Chair of the Convention declares an emergency due to disorder or an imminent threat to public health and safety prior to the completion of the business on the Agenda, and a majority of the States present at the Convention do not object to such declaration, further Convention proceedings shall be temporarily suspended, and the Commission shall subsequently relocate or reschedule the Convention to resume proceedings in an orderly fashion in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Compact with prior notice given to the Compact Notice Recipients.

     <p>
      Section 11. Adjournment of the Convention. The Convention shall permanently adjourn upon the earlier of twenty-four (24) hours after commencing proceedings under this Article or the completion of the business on its Agenda.

      Section 3. In addition to all other powers and duties conferred by state law which are consistent with the terms and conditions of this Compact, the chief law enforcement officer of each Member State is empowered to defend the Compact from any legal challenge, as well as to seek civil mandatory and prohibitory injunctive relief to enforce this Compact; and shall take such action whenever the Compact is challenged or violated.

      Section 4. The exclusive venue for all actions in any way arising under this Compact shall be in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas or the courts of the State of Texas within the jurisdictional boundaries of the foregoing district court. Each Member State shall submit to the jurisdiction of said courts with respect to such actions. However, upon written request by the chief law enforcement officer of any Member State, the Commission may elect to waive this provision for the purpose of ensuring an action proceeds in the venue that allows for the most convenient and effective enforcement or defense of this Compact. Any such waiver shall be limited to the particular action to which it is applied and not construed or relied upon as a general waiver of this provision. The waiver decisions of the Commission under this provision shall be final and binding on each Member State.
     </p>
     <p>

However, if any other phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this Compact, or the applicability of any other phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this Compact to any government, agency, person or circumstance, is declared in a final judgment to be contrary to the Constitution of the United States, contrary to the state constitution of any Member State, or is otherwise held invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, such phrase, clause, sentence or provision shall be severed and held for naught, and the validity of the remainder of this Compact and the applicability of the remainder of this Compact to any government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected.

Finally, if this Compact is declared in a final judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to be wholly or substantially in violation of Article I, Section 10, of the Constitution of the United States, then it shall be construed and enforced solely as reciprocal legislation enacted by the affected Member State(s).
     </p>
     <p>
      Section 7. Termination. This Compact shall terminate and be held for naught when the Compact is fully performed and the Constitution of the United States is amended by the Balanced Budget Amendment.
