       Laws, 1990, Chapter 588, § 24, amended this section effective July 1, 1990, provided the Legislature by concurrent resolution adopted by the House and Senate in session prior to July 1, 1990, declared that sufficient funds were dedicated and made available for the implementation of Chapter 588. Funds, however, were not made available by the Legislature prior to July 1, 1990, and by direction of the Office of the Attorney General of the State of Mississippi, the amendatory provisions were not implemented. The text of the proposed amendment can be found in the 1990 General Laws of Mississippi.

     </h3>
     <p>
      From and after January 1, 1991, the Mississippi Authority for Educational Television shall prepare and the Commissioner of Public Safety shall make available for loan to applicants for driving permits and licenses under this article and under Article 5 of this chapter, who are reading impaired, video tapes of instructional material designed to assist such applicants in preparing for driver’s license examinations. The commissioner shall be authorized to charge and collect a fee from any person to whom any such video tape is loaned, such fee to serve as security for the return of the video tape and which fee shall be refunded to the person upon return of the video tape to the commissioner. Such fee shall be in an amount as the commissioner determines necessary to defray the actual cost to the commissioner in replacing the video tape but shall not exceed the amount of the fee provided by law to be paid for the issuance of the class of driver’s license for which the person is applying. The video tape shall be returned, in good working order, to the location that such tape was borrowed in order for the individual to receive his security refund. In the event such tape is not returned within thirty (30) days from time of rental all security fees will be forfeited to the Department of Public Safety. Such security funds and all forfeited fees shall be placed in a separate interest-bearing account known as the “Driver License Educational Fund for the Reading Impaired.” All forfeited security fees shall be used to replace unreturned tapes and to offset the cost of this program.

       This section [Code 1942, § 8108], authorizes, by implication, officers to stop a car and require exhibition of a driver’s license; but this right must be exercised in good faith for the purpose of determining whether the operator is licensed, and not as a blind search without warrant.

       The stopping of cars and detaining drivers momentarily for the purpose of checking the driver’s license does not constitute an arrest warranting an incidental search. Morgan v. Heidelberg, 246 Miss. 481, 150 So. 2d 512, 1963 Miss. LEXIS 468 (Miss. 1963).

      </h4>
      <p>
       Pursuant to Section 1-1-109, the Joint Legislative Committee on Compilation, Revision and Publication of Legislation corrected a typographical error in the last sentence of subsection (4). The words “This subsection (4) of Section (3) shall stand repealed” were changed to “This subsection (4) shall stand repealed”. The Joint Committee ratified the correction at its May 20, 1998 meeting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 3 of Chapter 493, Laws of 2014, effective from and after July 1, 2014 (approved April 16, 2014), amended this section. Section 13 of Chapter 424, Laws of 2014, effective from and after October 1, 2014 (approved March 24, 2014), also amended this section. As set out above, this section reflects the language of both amendments pursuant to Section 1-1-109, which gives the Joint Legislative Committee on Compilation, Revision and Publication of Legislation authority to integrate amendments so that all versions of the same code section enacted within the same legislative session may become effective. The Joint Committee on Compilation, Revision and Publication of Legislation ratified the integration of these amendments as consistent with the legislative intent at the July 24, 2014, meeting of the Committee.

       Laws, 1990, Chapter 588, § 26, amended this section effective July 1, 1990, provided the Legislature by concurrent resolution adopted by the House and Senate in session prior to July 1, 1990, declared that sufficient funds were dedicated and made available for the implementation of Chapter 588. Funds, however, were not made available by the Legislature prior to July 1, 1990, and by direction of the Office of the Attorney General of the State of Mississippi, the amendatory provisions were not implemented. The text of the proposed amendment can be found in the 1990 General Laws of Mississippi.

Renewal drivers’ licenses of operators under the age of eighteen (18) shall be for one-year periods and may be renewed any time within two (2) months before the expiration of the license upon application and payment of the required fee, unless required to be reexamined. An intermediate license shall be valid for one (1) year from its date of issue and may be renewed any time within fourteen (14) days before expiration of the license,” substituted “under eighteen (18) years of age” for “under the age of eighteen (18)” and inserted “used in establishing compliance.”
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
       The 2010 amendment added the (7)(a) designation, and therein rewrote the first sentence, which formerly read: “Any license issued under this article to a person who is not a United States citizen and who does not possess a social security number issued by the United States government shall expire one (1) year from the date of issuance and may be renewed, if such person is otherwise qualified to renew such license, within thirty (30) days of expiration”; and added (7)(b).

       Laws, 1990, Chapter 588, § 25, amended this section effective July 1, 1990 provided that the Legislature, by concurrent resolution adopted by the House and Senate in session prior to July 1, 1990, declared that sufficient funds were dedicated and made available for the implementation of Chapter 588. Funds, however, were not made available by the Legislature prior to July 1, 1990, and by direction of the Office of the Attorney General of the State of Mississippi, the amendatory provisions were not implemented. The text of the proposed amendment can be found in the 1990 General Laws of Mississippi.

       As for revocation of licenses of persons for out-of-state convictions, Miss. Code Section 63-1-53(g) gives Commissioner of Public Safety authority to suspend license of any person who “has committed an offense in another state which if committed in this state would be grounds for suspension or revocation”. O’Cain, Jan. 20, 1993, A.G. Op. #93-0022.
      </p>
      <p>
       In justice court, clerk or deputy clerk has power, under Miss. Code Section 63-1-53, to send out “fail to appear” notices to defendants on traffic or game and fish violations. Ferguson, June 9, 1993, A.G. Op. #93-0331.
      </p>
      <p>
       A 10 day letter (commonly referred to as a DR15) on a traffic citation should be sent upon the failure of the defendant to appear on the date properly noticed or upon the failure of a defendant to pay any fine assessed; thus, if a defendant fails to appear for an initial appearance after receiving proper notice, the 10 day letter should be sent; in addition a 10 day letter should be sent if a defendant is tried in absentia, found guilty and assessed a fine.
   Mark, August 6, 1999, A.G. Op. #99-0398.
      </p>
      <p>
       No statute of limitation exists on the collection of unpaid fines, and there is no limit on the authority of the Commissioner of Public Safety to suspend the license of an individual who still owes a fine on a traffic offense conviction where such conviction occurred five or ten years prior. Via, Apr. 19, 2002, A.G. Op. #02-0185.
      </p>
      <p>
       The purpose of Section 63-1-53 is to give a person 10 days to respond to a citation; therefore, it is necessary to wait until the 10-day period has expired before issuing a warrant. Reno, July 29, 2005, A.G. Op. 05-0264.

The judge so ordering such suspension shall enter upon his docket “DEFENDANT’S DRIVER’S LICENSE SUSPENDED FOR_______________DAYS IN LIEU OF CONVICTION” and such action by the trial judge shall not constitute a conviction. The trial judge also may require the minor to successfully complete a defensive driving course approved by the judge as a condition of the suspension. Costs of court and penalty assessment for driver education and training program may be imposed in such actions within the discretion of the court.

     <p>
      The party states find that:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t63c01s63-1-103ol11">
       The safety of their streets and highways is materially affected by the degree of compliance with state and local ordinances relating to the operation of motor vehicles.
      </li>
      <li id="t63c01s63-1-103ol12">
       Violation of such a law or ordinance is evidence that the violator engages in conduct which is likely to endanger the safety of persons and property.

         “Conviction” means a conviction of any offense related to the use or operation of a motor vehicle which is prohibited by state law, municipal ordinance or administrative rule or regulation, or a forfeiture of bail, bond or other security deposited to secure appearance by a person charged with having committed any such offense, and which conviction or forfeiture is required to be reported to the licensing authority.

         <p>
          The licensing authority of a party state shall report each conviction of a person from another party state occurring within its jurisdiction to the licensing authority of the home state of the licensee. Such report shall clearly identify the person convicted; describe the violation specifying the section of the statute, code or ordinance violated; identify the court in which action was taken; indicate whether a plea of guilty or not guilty was entered, or whether the conviction was a result of the forfeiture of bail, bond or other security; and shall include any special findings made in connection therewith.

         </ol>

           Any party state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing the same, but no such withdrawal shall take effect until six months after the executive head of the withdrawing state has given notice of the withdrawal to the executive heads of all other party states.

          Construction and Severability
         </p>
         <p>
          This compact shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes thereof. The provisions of this compact shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this compact is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any party state or of the United States or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If this compact shall be held contrary to the constitution of any state party thereto, the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining states and in full force and effect as to the state affected as to all severable matters.

     </p>
     <p>
      Promote compliance with the laws, ordinances, and administrative rules and regulations relating to the operation of motor vehicles by their operators in each of the jurisdictions where such operators drive motor vehicles.
     </p>
     <p>
      Make the reciprocal recognition of licenses to drive and eligibility therefor more just and equitable by considering the overall compliance with motor vehicle laws, ordinances and administrative rules and regulations as a condition precedent to the continuance or issuance of any license by reason of which the licensee is authorized or permitted to operate a motor vehicle in any of the party states.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manslaughter or negligent homicide resulting from the operation of a motor vehicle;
     </p>
     <p>
      Driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or a narcotic drug, or under the influence of any other drug to a degree which renders the driver incapable of safely driving a motor vehicle;
     </p>
     <p>
      Any felony in the commission of which a motor vehicle is used;
     </p>
     <p>
      As to other convictions, reported pursuant to Article III, the licensing authority in the home state shall give such effect to the conduct as is provided by the laws of the home state.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the laws of a party state do not provide for offenses or violations denominated or described in precisely the words employed in subdivision (a) of this Article, such party state shall construe the denomination and description appearing in subdivision (a) hereof as being applicable to and identifying those offenses or violations of a substantially similar nature and the laws of such party state shall contain such provisions as may be necessary to ensure that full force and effect is given to this Article.
     </p>
     <p>
      The applicant has held such a license, but the same has been suspended by reason, in whole or in part, of a violation and if such suspension period has not terminated.
     </p>
     <p>
      The applicant has held such a license, but the same has been revoked by reason, in whole or in part, of a violation and if such revocation has not terminated, except that after the expiration of one year from the date the license was revoked, such person may make application for a new license if permitted by law. The licensing authority may refuse to issue a license to any such applicant if, after investigation, the licensing authority determines that it will not be safe to grant to such person the privilege of driving a motor vehicle on the public highways.
     </p>
     <p>
      The applicant is the holder of a license to drive issued by another party state and currently in force unless the applicant surrenders such license.

     <p>
      The commissioner may issue a nonresident commercial driver’s license to a person domiciled in a foreign jurisdiction if the United States Secretary of Transportation has determined that the commercial motor vehicle testing and licensing standards in the foreign jurisdiction do not meet the testing standards established in 49 CFR, Part 383. In addition, the commissioner may issue a nonresident commercial driver’s license to a person domiciled in a state while that state is prohibited from issuing commercial driver’s licenses in accordance with 49 CFR, Part 384.405. The word “nonresident” must appear on the face of the nonresident commercial driver’s license. An applicant shall surrender any nonresident commercial driver’s license issued by another state. Prior to issuing a nonresident commercial driver’s license, the commissioner shall establish the practical capability of revoking or suspending the nonresident commercial driver’s license.

      Except as otherwise specifically provided by this article, any violation of this article for which the only penalty under this article is the requirement that the commissioner suspend the commercial learner’s permit or commercial driver’s license of a person shall not, for the purposes of this article, constitute a criminal offense.

      If violation of any law of this state other than a violation of this article requires that the driver’s license or driving privileges of a person be suspended, cancelled or revoked, then any suspension, cancellation or revocation imposed for violation of such law shall also result in suspension, revocation or cancellation of the person’s commercial learner’s permit or commercial driver’s license under the provisions of this article for the same period of time and to run concurrently therewith.

       Violators of seat belt law can not be adjudicated guilty because there is no criminal offense and no fines or assessments may be imposed; charges should be dismissed for failure to allege a crime. Stephens, Jan. 12, 1994, A.G. Op. #93-0889.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a driver or a front-seat passenger is not wearing a seatbelt, the driver may be cited for the seatbelt violation only if he is cited for another non-seatbelt violation, and he may not be convicted of the seatbelt violation unless he is also convicted of the non-seatbelt violation; however, if a child between the ages of four and eight is not wearing a seatbelt, regardless of where he is seated, the driver of the car may be cited and convicted without a violation of any other non-seatbelt law.

Wallace v. State, — So.3d —, 2019 Miss. App. LEXIS 170 (Miss. Ct. App. Apr. 23, 2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       Stop of defendant’s vehicle was not pretextual because the deputy knew the confidential informant and found that person reliable; the deputy testified that he followed defendant before turning on his blue lights and did not see any traffic violations during that span, but he realized that when he was driving by, the driver was not wearing his seatbelt, and that was sufficient for purposes of the original stop. Wallace v. State, — So.3d —, 2019 Miss. App. LEXIS 170 (Miss. Ct. App. Apr. 23, 2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       Denial of defendant’s motion to suppress evidence seized at the time of defendant’s arrest during a traffic stop was appropriate because a police officer had probable cause to initiate a traffic stop, as the officer noticed that neither the driver of a car, nor defendant, who was a passenger in the car, was wearing a seat belt, and a pouch containing methamphetamine, which the officer discovered in the car after a pouch containing methamphetamine fell out from the bottom of defendant’s pants, was in plain view. Nowell v. State, 246 So.3d 77, 2018 Miss. App. LEXIS 210 (Miss. Ct. App. 2018).

   In a personal injury action, bus owner’s voluntary enactment of a seat-belt policy, not required by statute, did not vitiate the protection of Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c02s63-2-3" target="_self">63-2-3</a></cite> that would be in place were its passengers required by statute to wear seat belts. Boyd Tunica, Inc. v.

       Trial court was correct to admit evidence tending to show that the family of a minor girl injured in a car accident did not regularly use their seat belts, but it should have given a cautionary instruction that the evidence was admissible for the limited purpose of showing that, even if the warnings had been adequate, the family would not have heeded them. Palmer v. Volkswagen of Am., Inc., 904 So. 2d 1077, 2005 Miss. LEXIS 247 (Miss. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a minor child was killed by an air bag that deployed when the car that she was riding in was involved in an accident while her teenage older sister was driving, evidence of the decedent’s failure to wear a seat belt was relevant and admissible, the admission of evidence of the driver’s non-use of a seat belt was error, and the admission of photographs of the seat belt latches and an expert’s opinion that the latches showed insufficient scratches for the family to have used the seat belts regularly was error. Palmer v. Volkswagen of Am., Inc., 905 So. 2d 564, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 752 (Miss. Ct. App. 2003), aff'd in part and rev'd in part, 2005 Miss. LEXIS 21 (Miss. Jan. 13, 2005), aff'd in part and rev'd in part, 904 So. 2d 1077, 2005 Miss. LEXIS 247 (Miss. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       The statute provides that failure to use a seat belt may not be considered as evidence of contributory or comparative negligence; however, it does not purport to bar the admission of seat belt non-usage in all cases and does not provide that the use of a seat belt may not be considered. Herring v. Poirrier, 797 So. 2d 797, 2000 Miss. LEXIS 176 (Miss. 2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence of seat belt non-usage may constitute relevant evidence in some, but by no means all or even most, cases, so long as (1) the evidence has some probative value other than as evidence of negligence, (2) this probative value is not substantially outweighed by its prejudicial effect and is not barred by some other rule of evidence, and (3) appropriate limiting instructions are given to the jury, barring the consideration of seat belt non-usage as evidence of negligence.

   A trial court in a personal injury action did not err when it refused to instruct the jury that an automobile accident occurred within an “intersection” so that the defendant was in violation of law, pursuant to §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c03s63-3-611ol12" target="_self">63-3-611(2)</a></cite>, by attempting to pass within 100 feet of the intersection, since the conjunction where the accident took place did not constitute an “intersection” within the meaning of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c03s63-3-129" target="_self">63-3-129</a></cite>. An “intersection” requires the conjunction of “2 highways,” and one of the roads which formed the conjunction where the accident took place did not constitute a “highway” where the only evidence as to whether the road was public was the existence of a “Plant Entrance” sign and testimony regarding usage by employees of the electric plant; this evidence did not indicate that the road was public, but instead was consistent with permissive use of a private driveway.

Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c03s63-3-205" target="_self">63-3-205</a></cite>, and his duty to adhere to applicable traffic regulations was not discretionary, the circuit court erred in finding the DOT immune under Miss.

   Miss. Code Ann. § 65-21-1 controlled the specific issue of guide and warning posts around culverts, and § 63-3-303 controlled the discretionary placement of traffic devices that were not the subject of a specific statutory mandate.

Further, the duty to maintain highways and place warning signs clearly requires the Mississippi Transportation Commission to consider the policy considerations of doing so. Knight v. Miss. Transp.

       Under this section, the placement of traffic control signs or devices is dependent upon the discretion of the responsible entity. Jones v. Mississippi DOT, 744 So. 2d 256, 1999 Miss. LEXIS 201 (Miss. 1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       In an action to recover for injuries sustained by the plaintiff when his vehicle collided with a gravel pile built on a road as a barrier to an out-of-service bridge on the road, it was error for the court to prevent the plaintiff from introducing the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices as proof of the applicable standard of care concerning the placement of warning signs and barricades on public roads where the defendant county did not dispute that such manual is the system approved by the American Association of State Highway Officials. Jones v. Panola County, 725 So. 2d 774, 1998 Miss. LEXIS 244 (Miss. 1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       In cases involving injuries arising out of vehicular traffic on municipal streets or county roads where special municipal or county speed restrictions have been placed in effect, the party expecting to rely upon a violation of such restrictions should plead the existence of the special speed limit established by local authority, and its violation.

      <p>
       If the existence of a special county or municipal speed restriction is alleged and denied, or if its legality is put in issue by a responsive pleading, proof should then be required, the burden resting upon the party having the affirmative, as in other cases of disputed fact; but where the existence of the speed zone and rate of speed are properly alleged and not denied, proof that speed signs were in fact posted is sufficient to create a presumption that they reflect appropriate action by competent authority in restricting speeds.

   In an action for damages arising out of a collision between plaintiff’s motorcycle and defendant’s automobile in an intersection with a flashing red light and stop sign facing plaintiff and a flashing yellow light and warning sign facing defendant, the trial court did not err in refusing to grant plaintiff’s standard of care instruction which included the language, “the defendant had no lawful right to go forward. . . under the assumption that it would be open and clear,” where a granted instruction detailed the crucial point that the yellow light facing defendant demanded caution, and that a finding of negligence would flow from her failure to yield the right-of-way to plaintiff if, as he claimed, he had lawfully entered the intersection and stalled unexpectedly. The trial court also properly refused to grant an instruction which stated in part, “the driver of a motor vehicle has a lawful duty to decrease his speed upon approaching an intersection,” since §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c03s63-3-311ol12" target="_self">63-3-311(2)</a></cite> merely states that a driver “may proceed. . . only with caution” and caution is a relative concept not necessarily entailing decrease in speed since the current speed may already be a cautious speed. Allen v. Blanks, 384 So. 2d 63, 1980 Miss. LEXIS 2000 (Miss. 1980).

   Deputy, who stopped at an intersection and, with his blue lights and sirens activated, slowly proceeded across in a stop-and-start fashion, exercised sufficient safety measures to prompt other drivers near the intersection to yield the right-of-way, including the driver traveling in the lane ahead of plaintiffs. Thus, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to plaintiffs, the deputy’s conduct did not demonstrate a conscious indifference to consequences, nor did it rise to the level of reckless disregard for the safety and well-being of persons not engaged in criminal activity, so as subject the county to liability under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.11.html#t11c46s11-46-9ol11c" target="_blank">11-46-9(1)(c)</a></cite>. Rayner v. Pennington, 25 So.3d 305, 2010 Miss. LEXIS 12 (Miss. 2010).

       Evidence showed the officer was traveling approximately 37 miles per hour with lights and sirens activated, there was nothing obstructing the view of either the person later injured or the officer, and the greater weight of evidence also proved that the person’s left turn signal was not activated. In addition, the officer had consciously stopped at the previous two intersections because the officer considered both of those to be blind intersections, and therefore, the officer’s behavior supported the finding that the officer appreciated the risk involved in approaching the intersection and did not act with reckless disregard.

       That an indictment charging appellant with aggravated assault and leaving the scene of the accident did not state the location of the incident and whether the victims were pedestrians did not entitle him to post-conviction collateral relief, because he demonstrated no uncertainty as to these facts during his testimony at his sentencing hearing, and he waived any non-jurisdictional defects in the indictment when he pled guilty. Fox v. State, 129 So.3d 208, 2013 Miss. App. LEXIS 223 (Miss. Ct. App. 2013), cert. denied, 131 So.3d 577, 2014 Miss. LEXIS 78 (Miss. 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Indictment charging appellant with leaving the scene of the accident was sufficient and not vague; as it included the phrase “wilfully, unlawfully, and feloniously,” it was apparent that he was charged under the felony, not the misdemeanor, portion of Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c03s63-3-401" target="_self">63-3-401</a></cite>. Fox v. State, 129 So.3d 208, 2013 Miss. App. LEXIS 223 (Miss. Ct. App. 2013), cert. denied, 131 So.3d 577, 2014 Miss. LEXIS 78 (Miss. 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Denial of petitioner’s motion for postconviction relief was proper where his indictment was not defective because the indictment clearly charged an offense cognizable under the laws of Mississippi; it tracked the language in Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c03s63-3-401" target="_self">63-3-401</a></cite> and was therefore sufficient. Holifield v. State, 852 So. 2d 653, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 67 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 847 So. 2d 866, 2003 Miss. LEXIS 902 (Miss. 2003), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">540 U.S. 957</cite>, <cite class="s_court">124 S. Ct. 409</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">157 L.

      </h4>
      <p>
       Double Jeopardy Clause was not violated because the drunk-driving statute established separate crimes for each of the victims identified and the offense of leaving the scene of an accident contained different elements from the offenses established by the drunk-driving statute. Buckner v. State, 135 So.3d 915, 2013 Miss. App. LEXIS 682 (Miss. Ct. App. 2013), cert. denied, 136 So.3d 437, 2014 Miss. LEXIS 201 (Miss. 2014).

      </h4>
      <p>
       Defendant, an off-duty police officer, was properly convicted of felony leaving the scene of an accident because, while it was later determined that he was not at fault for a fatal accident with a pedestrian, returned to the scene, and admitted to hitting the pedestrian, more than one witness testified to seeing him leave the scene of the accident for as long as 15 minutes. Snyder v. State, 204 So.3d 859, 2016 Miss. App. LEXIS 261 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 205 So.3d 1085, 2016 Miss. LEXIS 499 (Miss. 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of the felony of leaving the scene of an accident that resulted in injury or death because, although defendant stated that he assumed that he possibly hit a bird, the jury heard testimony from three witnesses that the victim’s bicycle was equipped with a blinking strobe light and an orange medical flag, which sat atop a five-foot-high plastic pole; defendant’s collision with the victim not only damaged the right fender of defendant’s truck but also broke his passenger-side mirror and tore off the accompanying mirror cover; and defendant called his girlfriend and asked her to call the hospital to see whether any reports had come in regarding someone struck by a vehicle. Brown v. State, 169 So.3d 897, 2014 Miss. App. LEXIS 85 (Miss. Ct. App. 2014).

   A state “hit and run” statute, requiring the driver of a motor vehicle involved in an accident resulting in damage to any property to stop at the scene and give his name and address, does not violate the constitutional privilege against compulsory self-incrimination. California v. Byers, <cite class="us_code">402 U.S. 424</cite>, <cite class="s_court">91 S. Ct. 1535</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">29 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 9, 1971 U.S. LEXIS 128 (U.S. 1971).

       This section [Code 1942, § 8163], which makes it mandatory for the driver of a vehicle to stop such vehicle at the scene of accident and render reasonable assistance to the person injured, is not limited in its application to persons who have contributed to the accident in the sense that such persons must be shown to have been at fault or to have been guilty of negligence, which was a contributing approximate cause of the accident. Meadows v. State, 211 Miss. 557, 52 So. 2d 289, 1951 Miss. LEXIS 386 (Miss. 1951).

       The duty to “render assistance” to persons injured in the first accident did not relieve the defendant, whose negligence caused the first accident, of the duty of removing or attempting to remove his disabled vehicle from the highway where his vehicle was struck by a second vehicle. Huff v. Boyd, 242 So. 2d 698, 1971 Miss. LEXIS 1496 (Miss. 1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the main purposes of this section [Code 1942, § 8163] is to enable the persons injured and the officers investigating the accident to determine who is at fault, and to compel the driver of the car involved in the accident to render humanitarian assistance to the persons injured, whether he was guilty of negligence in the operation of his vehicle at the time of the accident or not.

      <p>
       Since no question of negligence is involved in the failure to comply with this section [Code 1942, § 8163], the trial court properly refused to instruct that the fact that the defendant left the scene of the motor vehicle accident was a strong presumption that he was guilty of negligence by failing to stay at the scene of the accident and rendering first aid to the plaintiff and assisting in calling an ambulance and discharging other duties owed to the plaintiff. Clark v. Mask, 232 Miss. 65, 98 So. 2d 467, 1957 Miss. LEXIS 445 (Miss. 1957).

       An indictment under this section [Code 1942, § 8163] was not defective where it did not show the highway on which the accident occurred, or described the scene of accident or show the extent of injuries of the persons involved in the accident.

       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       In a suit for the death of a child pedestrian struck by an automobile, the plaintiff was not entitled to an instruction that the driver of the automobile was guilty of negligence as a matter of law by reason of the driver’s alleged failure to decrease the speed of his automobile as he approached the intersection, where the evidence as to the automobile’s speed was in conflict. Young v. Schwarz, 230 So. 2d 583, 1970 Miss. LEXIS 1560 (Miss. 1970).
      </p>
      <p>
       The admission of a defendant motorist involved in an intersectional accident that she failed to reduce her speed on approaching the intersection would only entitle the plaintiff to an instruction that the defendant’s failure to reduce her speed was negligence and that if such negligence caused or contributed to the accident then he was entitled to a verdict against her. Richardson v. Adams, 223 So. 2d 536, 1969 Miss. LEXIS 1275 (Miss. 1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where there was evidence that defendant’s truck was traveling at about 60 miles an hour as it approached and entered the intersection, the lower court properly instructed the jury that if the truck was being operated at a greater rate of speed than 50 miles per hour immediately before the collision such speed would constitute negligence, and if such negligence proximately contributed to the collision then the verdict should be for the plaintiffs. Bush Constr. Co. v. Walters, 250 Miss. 384, 164 So. 2d 900, 1964 Miss. LEXIS 469 (Miss. 1964).
      </p>
      <p>
       In an action for damages resulting when defendant’s truck-trailer unit ran into the rear end of the plaintiff’s truck-trailer unit, instructions, which when read together, focused the attention of the jury on the real issue of whether the plaintiff’s truck was overtaken from behind, run into and damaged by the negligence of the defendant’s driver in operating his truck without proper control, without keeping a proper lookout, and at a negligent rate of speed, or whether plaintiff’s driver negligently stopped his truck on the half-moon curve in the right lane of the pavement when it was unnecessary and impractical to do so, and, if so, whether such negligence was the sole, proximate cause of the collision, were not reversibly erroneous, even though some imperfections could be found therein. Green Truck Lines, Inc. v. Hooper, 233 Miss. 794, 103 So. 2d 443, 1958 Miss. LEXIS 441 (Miss. 1958).
      </p>
      <p>
       In an action against an automobile driver for injuries sustained by a bicyclist, where in instructions the jury was told that the plaintiff failed to keep his bicycle under control and to keep a proper lookout for others on the highway and to use due care not to place himself in a place of danger and not to create emergency he could not recover, the instruction failed to take into account the provisions of comparative negligence statutes which provide that the plaintiff’s contributory negligence shall not bar a recovery, if the proof showed that the defendant was negligent and the defendant’s negligence was the proximate contributing cause to the plaintiff’s injuries. Rivers v. Turner, 223 Miss. 673, 78 So. 2d 903, 1955 Miss. LEXIS 422 (Miss. 1955).
      </p>
      <p>
       An instruction that if driver of plaintiff’s bus was operating it at night over public streets at such speed as not to permit driver to avoid striking vehicles coming within range of his lights, which was sole proximate cause of collision with defendant, jury should return verdict for defendant, announced sound law. Jackson City Lines v. Harkins, 204 Miss. 707, 38 So. 2d 102, 1948 Miss. LEXIS 399 (Miss. 1948).
      </p>
      <p>
       Instruction authorizing jury to find defendant guilty of violating city ordinance adopting provisions of this section [Code 1942, § 8176], if jury believed from the evidence beyond reasonable doubt that defendant unlawfully drove automobile on city street more than 55 miles per hour, was proper, where defendant made no attempt to overcome prima facie case. White v. Philadelphia, 197 Miss. 166, 19 So. 2d 493, 1944 Miss. LEXIS 287 (Miss. 1944).
      </p>
      <p>
       In action for injuries sustained in collision between trucks in municipality, instructions which did not refer to regulatory statutes which were allegedly violated by defendant’s truck driver, or declare that violation of statutes must contribute proximately to the collision, but which left jury to guess at what constituted negligence, were insufficient. McDonough Motor Express v. Spiers, 180 Miss. 88, 177 So. 655 (Miss. 1937).
      </p>
      <p>
       Instruction that it was truck driver’s duty to operate truck at safe rate of speed held properly refused; law requiring only reasonably safe rate. Robinson v. Haydel, 177 Miss. 233, 171 So. 7, 1936 Miss. LEXIS 266 (Miss. 1936).
      </p>
      <p>
       In action for injuries sustained when automobile in which plaintiff was riding was struck by truck, instruction which invoked for plaintiff aid of statute regarding excessive speed and prima facie rule of evidence held erroneous, where declaration was merely sufficient to state case of common-law liability for negligence. Gulf Research Dev. Co. v. Linder, 177 Miss. 123, 170 So. 646, 1936 Miss. LEXIS 246 (Miss. 1936).
      </p>
      <p>
       In prosecution for manslaughter by automobile, instruction that, if defendant was exceeding twenty miles per hour and exceeding speed at which reasonable or prudent man would have driven, he was guilty of culpable negligence, and authorizing conviction if death was proximate result of such culpable negligence, held reversible error. Bailey v. State, 176 Miss. 579, 169 So. 765, 1936 Miss. LEXIS 145 (Miss. 1936).
      </p>
      <p>
       Instruction that it is violation of state law to drive automobile on public highway at greater speed than reasonable and proper, having due regard to traffic and use of highway, and that motorist must anticipate presence of other persons and vehicles on highway and drive at such rate of speed as to enable him to avoid injury to such persons, held proper. Hadad v. Lockeby, 176 Miss. 660, 169 So. 691, 1936 Miss. LEXIS 140 (Miss. 1936).
      </p>
      <p>
       In action arising out of collision between automobile and truck on bridge, deficiency in instruction relating to precautions truck driver should have taken in approaching bridge held cured by instruction setting out statutory provisions defining duty of operator of automobile approaching bridge. Sternberg Dredging Co. v. Screws, 175 Miss. 383, 166 So. 754, 1936 Miss. LEXIS 37 (Miss. 1936).
      </p>
      <p>
       Court may, notwithstanding all facts regarding automobile collision are in evidence, instruct jury that violation of motor vehicle statute by defendant is negligence and entitles plaintiff to recover where it is proximate cause of injury, or that violation of statute by plaintiff which is sole proximate cause of injury defeats plaintiff’s recovery. White v. Weitz, 169 Miss. 102, 152 So. 484, 1934 Miss. LEXIS 9 (Miss. 1934).
      </p>
      <p>
       Instruction that plaintiff, if exceeding speed permitted by statute, was prima facie negligent, held erroneous, where all facts and circumstances of collision were in evidence, since violation of statute would not prevent recovery unless it was sole proximate cause of collision. White v. Weitz, 169 Miss. 102, 152 So. 484, 1934 Miss. LEXIS 9 (Miss. 1934).
      </p>
      <p>
       Instruction on rate of speed on highway where territory contiguous thereto was closely built up held erroneous under evidence. Bradford v. State, 158 Miss. 210, 127 So. 277, 1930 Miss. LEXIS 2 (Miss. 1930).

      <p>
       A verdict of $25,000 for the loss of an arm was excessive where the evidence showed that the negligence of the plaintiff to a very large extent contributed proximately to the injury, in that he was driving a truck without any brakes with knowledge thereof, and was violating the 30-mile speed limit for trucks prescribed by previous enactment of similar section (Code 1930, § 5569 [repealed]), during the nighttime and while he was crossing three bridges in a creek bottom one of which was very narrow.

       A declaration in an action seeking damages for personal injuries resulting from an automobile accident which charged special hazards, excessive rate of speed, and that the defendant negligently and in complete disregard of the rights and safety of others attempted to drive his truck between two vehicles, one stalled on the left hand lane and the other traveling in the right hand lane, was sufficient to state a cause of action.

       In an action arising out of a motor vehicle collision, where the evidence as to whether at the time defendant entered the intersection the plaintiff’s vehicle was approaching so closely on the through highway as to constitute an immediate hazard was in sharp conflict, and the plaintiff admitted that he did not reduce his speed as he approached the intersection, the trial court did not err in refusing plaintiff’s request for directed verdict. Junakin v. Kuykendall, 237 Miss. 255, 114 So. 2d 661, 1959 Miss. LEXIS 463 (Miss. 1959).

   Mother was required under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c03s63-3-505" target="_self">63-3-505</a></cite> to decrease the speed of her vehicle when she approached the intersection; the mother failed to keep a proper lookout as she approached the intersection, where a reasonable person would have recognized the need to slow the vehicle down when approaching the intersection. Clark v. Clark, 863 So. 2d 1027, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 38 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       In an action arising from an accident at an intersection between a bus with the right-of-way and an automobile which failed to stop at a stop sign, the statute was properly applied to require the bus driver to slow down as he approached the intersection and to brake when it became apparent that the automobile was not going to stop.

       A truckdriver, in the exercise of ordinary and reasonable care, should have reduced the speed of his truck so as to enable him to keep his truck under control and avoid striking the decedent when decedent came within the range of truck’s headlights; the fact that the decedent was at or near the center of the road, under the influence of intoxicating liquor and a black man dressed in black clothing does not in and of itself absolve the truckdriver of his liability. Hornburger v. Baird, 508 F. Supp. 84, 1980 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16076 (N.D. Miss. 1980).

       A motorist driving approximately 85 miles per hour who failed to reduce his speed while approaching an intersection was liable for injuries sustained by a passenger during a collision where the motorist’s speed was a proximate contributing cause of the collision. Youngblood v. Monteith, 340 So. 2d 4, 1976 Miss. LEXIS 1702 (Miss. 1976).
      </p>
      <p>
       Notwithstanding that it was raining hard on the morning of an accident, neither the owner nor the operator of a tractor-semi-trailer were guilty of negligence per se for failing to reduce speed from 50 to 45 miles per hour, where the operator testified that visibility was approximately one-quarter of a mile, and other witnesses for the plaintiff testified to the fact that it was raining but that they had no trouble seeing the highway and automobiles in front of them.

   In a suit brought by a widow against a company, alleging that her decedent was struck and killed by a truck negligently driven by one of the company’s employees, the trial court did not err in refusing a peremptory instruction, to the effect that the employee was negligent in failing to decrease his speed as he approached the intersection where the decedent’s vehicle was, as, pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c03s63-3-505" target="_self">63-3-505</a></cite> (Rev. 2004), the employee, who was already traveling 10 to 25 miles per hour below the speed limit, was not required to reduce his speed further upon approaching the intersection. Martin v. B&amp;B Concrete Co., 71 So.3d 611, 2011 Miss. App. LEXIS 210 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 71 So.3d 1207, 2011 Miss. LEXIS 487 (Miss. 2011).

   Where a driver turned left in front of another vehicle, causing an accident, there was no error in the trial court’s refusal to give a special hazard instruction, as there were no stalled or wrecked vehicles obstructing the highway, no emergency vehicles, and no emergency lights; the Supreme Court of Mississippi has never held, and Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c03s63-3-505" target="_self">63-3-505</a></cite> did not provide, that a momentarily inattentive driver was a special hazard for which another driver had to reduce speed.

      <p>
       In an action arising from a one-car accident that occurred when the 16-year-old driver lost control of her car when she hit some loose asphalt or gravel as she entered a curve, the court did not err in refusing to instruct the jury either that it was their sworn duty to return a verdict for the plaintiff or that the defendant was guilty of negligence in the operation of her motor vehicle as a matter of law where (1) the defendant estimated her speed at around 35 to 40 mph, but contended that she did not believe she was speeding, and (2) her response to the question of whether she slowed down before entering the curve was, “I do not recall applying my brakes before I entered the curve,” but slowing down can also be accomplished by letting off the gas, as opposed to braking. Jones v. United States Fid. & Guar. Co., 2001 Miss. App. LEXIS 86 (Miss. Ct. App. Feb. 27, 2001), aff'd, 822 So. 2d 946, 2002 Miss. LEXIS 224 (Miss. 2002).
      </p>
      <p>
       The court properly instructed the jury that it was the duty of the plaintiff to reduce her speed when approaching and going around a curve and that if the jury believed from the evidence that the plaintiff failed to reduce the speed of her automobile on approaching and going around a curve and, in the exercise of reasonable care, she should have reduced her speed while traveling on a wet highway, then she was guilty of negligence. Fielder v. Magnolia Bev. Co., 757 So. 2d 925, 1999 Miss. LEXIS 165 (Miss. 1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       A jury instruction in a negligence action arising from an automobile accident that required the defendant to “decrease her speed as may be necessary to avoid colliding with any person, vehicle, or other conveyance on the highway in compliance with legal requirements” was erroneous because it placed a higher burden on the defendant than that of reasonable care. Similarly, an instruction that required the defendant to be “vigilant and to anticipate the presence of vehicles at all times and under all circumstances” was erroneous for the same reason, and also warranted reversal and remand of the case. Turner v. Turner, 524 So. 2d 942, 1988 Miss. LEXIS 201 (Miss. 1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a suit for the death of a child pedestrian struck by an automobile, the plaintiff was not entitled to an instruction that the driver of the automobile was guilty of negligence as a matter of law by reason of the driver’s alleged failure to decrease the speed of his automobile as he approached the intersection, where the evidence as to the automobile’s speed was in conflict. Young v. Schwarz, 230 So. 2d 583, 1970 Miss. LEXIS 1560 (Miss. 1970).
      </p>
      <p>
       The admission of a defendant motorist involved in an intersectional accident that she failed to reduce her speed on approaching the intersection would only entitle the plaintiff to an instruction that the defendant’s failure to reduce her speed was negligence and that if such negligence caused or contributed to the accident then he was entitled to a verdict against her.

   In a motorist’s suit to recover damages for personal injuries he sustained in a car accident with a construction worker, the construction company and the worker’s motions for summary judgment were denied because even though it was undisputed that the motorist did not slow down when he approached the intersection at which the accident occurred, thereby violating Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c03s63-3-505" target="_self">63-3-505</a></cite>, whether this was negligence per se was for a jury to decide. Moran v. Callahan, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 94573 (S.D. Miss. Dec. 11, 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       In order to be in violation of this section [Code 1942, § 8176] a motorist must fail to reduce his speed from a maximum provided when one of the conditions set out in this section is present, and the question of whether the plaintiff motorist involved in an intersectional accident when travelling at a speed less than the maximum failed further to reduce his speed under the prevailing circumstances constituted negligence was one for the jury to determine. Richardson v. Adams, 223 So. 2d 536, 1969 Miss. LEXIS 1275 (Miss. 1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence that motorist approached intersection without reducing speed in violation of this section [Code 1942, § 8176] was sufficient to submit to the jury the question of whether he was guilty of any negligence which proximately caused or contributed to the accident.

       The admission by a motorist involved in an intersectional accident that she failed to decrease her speed upon approaching the intersection is not sufficient ground to support a directed verdict for the plaintiff on the basis of the contention that the defendant motorist was in violation of this section [Code 1942, § 8176] and therefore negligent as a matter of law.

   The trial court did not err in finding in favor of a driver in her action against a city and a police officer stemming from a vehicular accident in which the driver was struck by the officer, because the city’s argument that the driver was contributorily negligent under Miss. Code Ann. §§<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c03s63-3-805" target="_self">63-3-805</a></cite> and<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c03s63-3-505" target="_self">63-3-505</a></cite> contained no evidentiary basis. The driver’s view was blocked by a truck and therefore, she was unable to see the officer approach; the driver had a green light at the intersection and she was not speeding or violating any other rule of the road. City of Jackson v. Presley, 40 So.3d 578, 2009 Miss. App. LEXIS 793 (Miss. Ct. App. 2009), rev'd, 40 So.3d 520, 2010 Miss. LEXIS 385 (Miss. 2010).

       In an action for personal injuries and property damages resulting when plaintiff’s automobile ran into defendant’s truck which was going in the same direction on a U. S. highway, where it appeared that the speed of defendant’s truck at the time of the accident was from 10 to 20 miles per hour, the trial court committed reversible error in failing to charge that the jury should find for plaintiff if the defendant was driving his vehicle on a federal designated highway at the time and place of the accident at a speed of less than 30 miles per hour where no fact existed justifying such slow speed under this section [Code 1942, § 8178], and the reduced speed was the proximate, or a contributory cause of the accident.

       Intent of Miss.

       This section requires a municipality to have a population of two thousand or more according to the latest federal census in order to operate radar upon the public streets of the municipality. Davis, July 19, 1996, A.G. Op. #96-0473, 1996 Miss.

      <p>
       A town may not use electronic timing devices to calculate the speed of an automobile since the statute prohibits the use of all devices for the detection of the speed of automobiles except for the use of radar as limited by statute.
   Moore, August 10, 1998, A.G. Op. #98-0461.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the statute only allows the Mississippi Highway Safety Patrol to use radar speed detection equipment on federally designated highways located within the corporate limits of a municipality having a population of 15,000 or less according to the latest federal census, a city could not use a radar-based traffic monitoring device on federally designated highways within the corporate limits, although it could be used on other public streets of the municipality.
   Johnson, November 6, 1998, A.G. Op. #98-0688 (superseded by Payne, Jan. 18, 2000, A.G. op. #99-0709).
      </p>
      <p>
       Municipal law enforcement officers of a municipality with a population of 2,000 or more may operate radar speed detection equipment upon a state designated highway, however, such officers of a municipality having a population of less than 15,000 cannot lawfully operate such equipment on any federally designated highway.
   Scruggs, December 11, 1998, A.G. Op. #98-0752.
      </p>
      <p>
       The legislative intent of the statute does not prohibit the purchase and use of a radar-based device that will be used for driver safety awareness and not for enforcement purposes. Payne, Jr., Jan. 18, 2000, A.G. Op. #1999-0709.
      </p>
      <p>
       A city is entitled to use radar speed detection equipment on any portion of a federally designated highway lying within its corporate limits which is removed from the state maintained system and, if the population of the city exceeds 15,000, radar may be used regardless of whether the street is a public street of the municipality. Lawrence, Apr. 13, 2001, A.G. Op. #01-0164.
      </p>
      <p>
       A radar unit can be located on private property, including church and bank parking lots, as long as the vehicle being timed is located on a public street, and the radar unit can be operated safely and accurately. The private property owner may allow or disallow such use of its property. Russell, Jan. 14, 2005, A.G. Op. 04-0642.
      </p>
      <p>
       City police department cannot use radar speed detection equipment on a federal within the corporate limits of the city. Fazente, May 13, 2005, A.G. Op. 05-0231.

       The use of all devices for the detection of the speed of automobiles is prohibited under the terms of Section 63-3-519 and this would include VASCAR. Magee,
   Oct. 21, 2005,
   A.G. Op. 05-0496.
      </p>
      <p>
       The legislature clearly intended municipal radar on a highway designated both federal and state to be used only in municipalities of a population of 15,000 or more. Walker, Apr. 28, 2006, A.G. Op. 06-0137.
      </p>
      <p>

       Motorist overtaking and passing bicycle is required to do so at safe distance; motorist’s admission that he did not entirely clear bicyclist’s lane of traffic as he passed bicyclist but was only straddling center line and was unaware of location of vehicle in relation to bicycle as he passed it is sufficient basis upon which jury may find that collision between motorist’s vehicle and bicycle was caused by motorist’s negligence.

   The trial court in a negligence action arising out of an automobile accident properly granted plaintiff’s peremptory instruction on the issue of liability, where defendant driver testified that on the day of the accident it was raining and the road was wet, where he admitted knowing that oil rises to the surface of wet asphalt and admitted seeing a roadsign that said “slippery when wet,” and where he further stated that, while passing plaintiff, he had lost control of his truck, in that §§<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c03s63-3-609" target="_self">63-3-609</a></cite> and<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c03s63-3-611" target="_self">63-3-611</a></cite> imposed upon defendant a duty of care in passing plaintiff, a duty he failed to exercise in ignoring the danger he knew lay ahead, which resulted in the loss of control of his truck.

       Trial court did not in err when it refused to give a motor vehicle accident victim’s peremptory instruction on negligence per se because the question of whether the intersection where the accident occurred as the victim was making a left turn when hit by a passing vehicle was marked or readily distinguishable was left for the jury to determine.

   A trial court in a personal injury action did not err when it refused to instruct the jury that an automobile accident occurred within an “intersection” so that the defendant was in violation of law, pursuant to §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c03s63-3-611ol12" target="_self">63-3-611(2)</a></cite>, by attempting to pass within 100 feet of the intersection, since the conjunction where the accident took place did not constitute an “intersection” within the meaning of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c03s63-3-129" target="_self">63-3-129</a></cite>. An “intersection” requires the conjunction of “2 highways,” and one of the roads which formed the conjunction where the accident took place did not constitute a “highway” where the only evidence as to whether the road was public was the existence of a “Plant Entrance” sign and testimony regarding usage by employees of the electric plant; this evidence did not indicate that the road was public, but instead was consistent with permissive use of a private driveway.

       Instruction to jury that it would constitute negligence per se if tractor-trailer was attempting to pass another vehicle and crossed double-yellow no passing line going up hill with 79,000 pound load would be proper. Blackmon v. Payne, 510 So. 2d 483, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2522 (Miss. 1987).

       <p>
   The trial court in a negligence action arising out of an automobile accident properly granted plaintiff’s peremptory instruction on the issue of liability, where defendant driver testified that on the day of the accident it was raining and the road was wet, where he admitted knowing that oil rises to the surface of wet asphalt and admitted seeing a roadsign that said “slippery when wet,” and where he further stated that, while passing plaintiff, he had lost control of his truck, in that §§<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c03s63-3-609" target="_self">63-3-609</a></cite> and<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c03s63-3-611" target="_self">63-3-611</a></cite> imposed upon defendant a duty of care in passing plaintiff, a duty he failed to exercise in ignoring the danger he knew lay ahead, which resulted in the loss of control of his truck. Barkley v. Miller Transporters, Inc., 450 So. 2d 416, 1984 Miss. LEXIS 1693 (Miss. 1984).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a personal injury suit, instructions which required the defendant overtaking motorist under all circumstances to be diligent and to anticipate the presence of others, and placing an absolute duty to pass safely and to avoid injury to others on such defendant, who collided with an oncoming motorist, were erroneous in placing a higher standard of care on the defendant than required by law and providing no factual guide for determining his negligence, since the standard of the law is reasonable care. Acord v. Moore, 243 So. 2d 55, 1971 Miss. LEXIS 1501 (Miss. 1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       It was erroneous to grant the “emergency instruction” where it raised an inference that if the driver of a truck had suddenly turned his vehicle across the center line into the left lane of the highway at the time when the defendant’s bus was about to pass, that then the defendant was not guilty of contributory negligence in driving at an unlawful speed and approaching the truck at an unreasonable rate in an unreasonable manner. Peel v. Gulf Transport Co., 252 Miss. 797, 174 So. 2d 377, 1965 Miss. LEXIS 1148 (Miss. 1965).
      </p>
      <p>
       It was erroneous to instruct the jury that a bus driver could pass a preceding truck regardless of the surrounding circumstances if he did not know of the iced-over condition of the rear and side windows of the truck, because these instructions told the jury the defendant bus driver was not guilty of contributory negligence, regardless of the known surrounding circumstances and his duty to foresee the changes and to proceed with caution at a speed at which he could control the operation of the bus. Peel v. Gulf Transport Co., 252 Miss. 797, 174 So. 2d 377, 1965 Miss. LEXIS 1148 (Miss. 1965).
      </p>
      <p>
       An instruction is erroneous which tells the jury for the defendant bus driver that the defendant cannot be held for negligence if, while exercising ordinary care to see, he did not see or know the condition of the glass on the rear and sides of the preceding pickup truck, when the evidence showed in fact that before attempting to pass the truck the bus driver was aware of the iced-over condition of the rear and side windows of the truck. Peel v. Gulf Transport Co., 252 Miss. 797, 174 So. 2d 377, 1965 Miss. LEXIS 1148 (Miss. 1965).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a personal injury action arising out of a motor vehicle collision, an instruction that if the driver of the car in which the plaintiff was riding negligently attempted to pass the defendant’s vehicle within 100 feet of an intersection, and such negligence was the sole proximate cause of the accident, the jury could find for the defendant, was correct, where the defendant’s proof showed that the attempt to pass was made within 50 or 60 feet of the intersection, and the intersection involved was one coming within the contemplation of the statute. Clark v. Mask, 232 Miss. 65, 98 So. 2d 467, 1957 Miss. LEXIS 445 (Miss. 1957).
      </p>
      <p>
       Peremptory instruction to jury, that plaintiff violated Mississippi statute providing that a person riding a bicycle is prohibited from passing another vehicle going in the same direction on the right hand side of said vehicle and is also prohibited from passing another vehicle under any circumstances when approaching within 100 feet of or traversing any intersection, was proper in an action for injuries where plaintiff bicyclist, approaching defendant’s truck from rear, tried to pass it at an intersection, was hit by the truck as it also started to turn right, and was catapulted into pathway of another car. Cochran v. Peeler, 209 Miss. 394, 47 So. 2d 806, 1950 Miss. LEXIS 404 (Miss. 1950).

       Tailgating statute is not impermissibly vague and does not fail to give a driver notice of the prohibited conduct; the statute, coupled with the rules of the road, is sufficiently definite such that an ordinary person can understand the prohibited conduct and that law enforcement can avoid arbitrary enforcement. The statute is sufficiently specific to pass constitutional scrutiny. Nolan v. State, 182 So.3d 484, 2016 Miss. App. LEXIS 21 (Miss. Ct. App. 2016).

       Trial court did not err in failing to find that a police officer committed a traffic violation by tailgating a driver’s vehicle because the driver had to show more than mere negligence to establish reckless disregard and remove a city’s immunity; the statute applies to traffic regulations but does not address governmental immunity.

       Driver of motor vehicle was entitled to peremptory instruction or directed verdict on liability, although there is no per se rule that driver of following car is negligent if he collides with rear of preceding vehicle, where driver of following car did not know her approximate speed, was driving approximately one car length behind preceding vehicle when she saw truck turn off in front of preceding vehicle, and saw preceding vehicle’s brake lights come on; there was no way any rational jury could reach any conclusion but that following driver failed in either one or more of her duties to keep proper lookout ahead, keep her car under proper control, and drive at speed and sufficient distance behind preceding vehicle to stop without colliding into its rear end when that vehicle stopped to allow truck to turn off street.

       Court’s instruction for plaintiff that it was the duty of the driver of defendant’s truck at all times to maintain a reasonably safe and proper distance between his vehicle and any vehicle proceeding in front of his truck, that it was his duty to anticipate that preceding vehicles would slow or would stop on the highway, and that it was his duty to keep the truck under reasonable control at all times and to take reasonable precautions commensurate with the type of vehicle and load thereon, imposed no absolute liability on the truckdriver for the consequences of his actions.

       In an action for damages resulting when defendant’s truck-trailer unit ran into the rear end of plaintiff’s truck-trailer unit, instructions, which when read together, focused the attention of the jury on the real issue of whether the plaintiff’s truck was overtaken from behind, run into and damaged by the negligence of the defendant’s driver in operating his truck without proper control, without keeping a proper lookout, and at a negligent rate of speed, or whether plaintiff’s driver negligently stopped his truck on the half-moon curve in the right lane of the pavement when it was unnecessary and impractical to do so, and, if so, whether such negligence was the sole, proximate cause of the collision, were not reversibly erroneous, even though some imperfections could be found therein. Green Truck Lines, Inc. v. Hooper, 233 Miss. 794, 103 So. 2d 443, 1958 Miss. LEXIS 441 (Miss. 1958).

       In an action for damages resulting when defendant’s truck-trailer unit ran into the rear end of plaintiff’s truck-trailer unit on the curved portion of the highway, the court did not err in refusing to charge the defendant’s driver with negligence in respect to speeding, overtaking on the right, and following too closely, particularly in view of Code 1942, § 1455.

       Since Code 1942, § 8149, provides that this section [Code 1942, § 8188] is applicable to a person riding a bicycle, an instruction to the jury, that if they believe that the plaintiff violated this section [Code 1942, § 8188] and such violation was proximate cause of accident they should find for the defendants, was proper in an action for injuries to the plaintiff bicyclist who, approaching the defendant’s truck from the rear, tried to pass it at an intersection, was hit by the truck as it also started to turn right, and was catapulted into pathway of another car.

       In action for damages to automobile arising out of ramming by truck from rear, it was error for court to refuse plaintiff instruction that failure of any person to perform duty imposed by statute is negligence in itself, and that should jury find that defendant in his truck immediately prior to and at time of collision followed vehicle of plaintiff more closely than was reasonable and prudent, having due regard to speed of such vehicles and traffic upon and condition of highway, and that such failure was proximate cause of collision, his conduct constituted actionable negligence, and refusal to grant this instruction is not cured by granting of instruction which also includes another point.

       In an action for personal injuries sustained by a plaintiff when his automobile was struck from the rear by the defendant’s automobile, where the evidence presented jury questions as to whether the defendant was negligent in driving at an excessive speed, or following another vehicle too closely, or in failing to have his vehicle under proper control, or whether the sole proximate cause of the collision was the manner in which the plaintiff’s vehicle was driven into the intersection, the trial court erred in directing a verdict for plaintiff on the issue of liability.

      <p>
       Evidence was sufficient to support a tailgating conviction under this statute because an officer was able to articulate an objective basis for the stop by stating that defendant’s vehicle was following another vehicle more closely than was reasonable and prudent, and defendant admitted that he was following a business associate’s car too closely to a hotel because he was unfamiliar with the area and did not want to get separated. The conviction was not against the manifest weight of the evidence either. Nolan v. State, 182 So.3d 484, 2016 Miss. App. LEXIS 21 (Miss. Ct. App. 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence was sufficient to support defendant’s conviction for following too closely where the officer testified that defendant was traveling at about 50 miles per hour, there was only one car length between her and the car in front of her, she was tapping her brakes, and she was operating her vehicle under the influence of intoxicating liquor.

       § 63-3-703.
    Turning at intersections.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The driver of a vehicle intending to turn at an intersection shall do so as follows:
     </p>
     <p>
      Both the approach for a right turn and the turn itself shall be made as close as practical to the right-hand curb or edge of the roadway.
     </p>
     <p>
      The approach for a left turn shall be made in that portion of the right half of the roadway nearest the center line thereof and after entering the intersection the left turn shall be made so as to leave the intersection to the right of the center line of the roadway being entered.
     </p>
     <p>
      The approach for a left turn from a two-way street into a one-way street shall be made in that portion of the right half of the roadway nearest the center line thereof and by passing to the right of such center line where it enters the intersection. A left turn from a one-way street into a two-way street shall be made by passing to the right of the center line of the street being entered upon leaving the intersection.
     </p>
     <p>
      Local authorities in their respective jurisdictions may cause markers, buttons, or signs to be placed within or adjacent to intersections and thereby require and direct that a different course from that specified in this section be traveled by vehicles turning at an intersection. When markers, buttons, or signs are so placed no driver of a vehicle shall turn a vehicle at an intersection other than as directed and required by such markers, buttons, or signs.

      <p>
       In an action by a motorcyclist against a motorist for injuries resulting from an intersectional collision which occurred when the automobile driver made a left turn in front of the motorcycle approaching from the opposite direction immediately prior to the collision, evidence that the motorcycle struck the front bumper of the car to the left of center, together with the motorist’s admission that his vehicle was at an angle with the direction of the highway from which he was turning, at the time of the collision, clearly established that the automobile driver made his left turn by “cutting the corner” before reaching the center of the intersection, in violation of this section [Code 1942, § 8189].

       Allowing an investigating officer not an eyewitness to an accident, to give his opinion, in an action for injuries resulting from the collision, as to the place of impact and to depict this point on a map, was harmless error where the negligence of the defendant motorist was clearly established by other evidence.

       In an action for injuries sustained in an intersectional collision, it was proper for the investigating officer to testify as to the location of the vehicles at the time of his investigation, the location of the injured plaintiff, and the location of debris created by the impact, and equally proper for him to mark the location of these things on the map of the intersection.

       A motorist is not only under a duty to keep a proper lookout and be on the alert for other vehicles using the highway, but is also under duty not to turn his vehicle from a direct course upon the highway unless such movement can be made with reasonable safety, and then only after giving an appropriate signal by hand, arm or other signal device, in the event that any other vehicle might be affected by such movement. Sohio Petroleum Co. v. Fowler, 231 Miss. 72, 94 So. 2d 350, 1957 Miss. LEXIS 490 (Miss. 1957).

       Jury verdict defied all logic, as the evidence presented at trial established that the driver was negligent as a matter of law for failing to maintain a proper lookout and to yield the right-of-way by executing a turn across the insured’s lane of travel. A verdict should have been returned in favor of the insured because the violation of said statutory duties by the driver was the unequivocal proximate cause of the insured’s injury; even if the driver was not negligent per se, the facts presented at trial unconditionally demonstrated that the collision was the result of her negligence and the trial court committed reversible error in failing to apply Miss. R. Civ. P. 50, and by denying the insured’s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. State Farm Auto Ins. Cos. v. Davis, 887 So. 2d 192, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 1065 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).

       That a motorist actuated a stop signal on the automobile by applying the brake does not necessarily exonerate the motorist from a charge of negligence toward a following car. Box v. Swindle, 306 F.2d 882, 1962 U.S. App. LEXIS 4242 (5th Cir. Miss. 1962).

       The fact that a motorist, who had previously given a lawful notice that she was reducing the speed of her vehicle, failed to signal of her ultimate intention to make a right turn, this was not a proximate contributing cause of the collision which resulted when she was struck in the rear by the plaintiff’s automobile which was following too closely, being driven at a high, excessive and unlawful rate of speed, at a time when its driver was not maintaining a proper lookout ahead, and did not have the vehicle under control.

       Plaintiff’s testimony that he observed defendant’s approaching vehicle until it was about 150 feet behind him and although he realized it was traveling at a faster speed and overtaking him, he drove about 15 seconds from the time he last looked before he made his left turn, that by merely glancing in his rear view mirror he could have ascertained the location of the defendant’s car before he began his left turn, and that he relied completely on his blinker signal to keep traffic behind him from coming around him, established that plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence. Stockton v. Lamberth, 278 So. 2d 423, 1973 Miss. LEXIS 1440 (Miss. 1973).

       A motorist was guilty of contributory negligence who, without giving any warning signal of any kind to indicate her intention, had turned from her right lane of traffic and was proceeding across the left or oncoming traffic lane of the highway to enter a driveway when she was struck by defendant’s automobile, which, at the time of the motorist’s turn, had been approaching some 40 to 60 feet away.

   A plaintiff motorist was entitled to an instruction that a preceding motorist was negligent as a matter of law under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c03s63-3-707" target="_self">63-3-707</a></cite>, which provides that a driver should not turn a vehicle from a highway unless the turn can be made with reasonable safety, where the preceding driver admitted that he turned his vehicle to the left out of his lane of traffic without first looking to see whether the plaintiff was following him, and the court’s refusal to give this requested instruction was reversible error. Conner v. Harris, 624 So. 2d 482, 1993 Miss. LEXIS 304 (Miss. 1993).

       Minor who enters upon an adult activity such as the operation of a motor vehicle must exercise a commensurate degree of responsibility, and will be held to adult standard in determining whether their conduct while engaging in such adult activity is negligent.

      <p>
       In a personal injury action arising out of an automobile accident at an intersection in which the defendant was struck by the plaintiff’s automobile as he made a left turn across the plaintiff’s traffic lane, the trial court erred in giving an instruction that the defendant was entitled to a verdict if the jury believed that the accident had been proximately caused by the negligence of a truck driver who had allegedly indicated to the defendant that he could safely cross the plaintiff’s traffic lane; the defendant did not have the legal right to rely on the truck driver and had a duty to ascertain whether he could cross the traffic lane with reasonable safety. Boyd v. Smith, 390 So. 2d 994, 1980 Miss. LEXIS 2155 (Miss. 1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the evidence made a jury issue as to whether defendant was guilty of negligence in failing to give a signal indicating his intention to turn left for a reasonable distance before turning, and in turning his vehicle from a direct course upon the highway when such movement could not be made with reasonable safety, the trial court should not have granted defendant’s motion for a peremptory instruction. Cronier v. Denson, 198 So. 2d 252, 1967 Miss. LEXIS 1260 (Miss. 1967).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a wrongful death action arising out of a collision of defendant’s automobile with a bicycle ridden by a nine-year-old child upon a highway, the trial court did not err in instructing that the rider of a bicycle or other vehicle along a public highway should not turn from a direct course unless such movement could be made with reasonable safety and then only after giving an appropriate signal, and the signal for a left turn should be given by extending the hand and arm horizontally. Moak v. Black, 230 Miss. 337, 92 So. 2d 845, 1957 Miss. LEXIS 376 (Miss. 1957).

       The trial court properly refused defendant a peremptory instruction where, in an action for a personal injury sustained when the truck in which plaintiff was a passenger was struck by defendant’s automobile while undertaking to turn from the right lane of traffic across the oncoming traffic lane to enter a driveway, the jury was warranted in finding that the truck driver’s movements were consistent with reasonable safety as required by this section. [Code 1942, § 8192], and that, in view of defendant’s admission that although she saw the truck slowing down for one-half mile and thought he was going to turn in to the driveway, she did not slow down, but continued to operate her automobile at 50 miles per hour, the contributing, if not the sole, cause of accident was defendant’s negligence. Hamilton v. McCry, 229 Miss. 481, 91 So. 2d 564, 1956 Miss. LEXIS 629 (Miss. 1956).

       In action for damages to automobile arising out of ramming by truck from rear, there being no controversy in record that car was equipped with signal light in rear in good order, instruction for defendant that person driving upon highway is required by law, before stopping or suddenly decreasing the speed of his automobile, to give proper signal of such intention, and if jury believe from evidence in case that plaintiff so stopped or decreased his speed without giving such proper signal, then jury must find plaintiff was negligent is reversibly erroneous and cannot be cured by other instructions in conflict with it.

       In a felony fleeing case, an argument that an officer lacked probable cause to make a traffic stop was rejected because the officer testified that he personally observed defendant make a right turn onto a state highway without signaling while traffic was present. Moreover, defendant admitted to committing the offense. Johnson v. State, 228 So.3d 933, 2017 Miss. App. LEXIS 112 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 229 So.3d 120, 2017 Miss. LEXIS 379 (Miss. 2017).

       Code 1942, § 8195 merely prescribes the general rule as to an ordinary intersection and is inapplicable to one with traffic lights and signals. Gates v. Green, 214 So. 2d 828, 1968 Miss. LEXIS 1337 (Miss. 1968).
      </p>
      <p>
       The statutory rule announced in subsection (2) of this section [Code 1942, § 8195] is inapplicable to the intersection of an existing public road and a new highway under construction which is not yet open for general vehicular traffic. Carlisle v. Cobb Bros. Constr. Co., 238 Miss. 681, 119 So. 2d 918, 1960 Miss. LEXIS 457 (Miss. 1960).
      </p>
      <p>
       Right-of-way statutes have no legal application to traffic on private property. Vaughan v. Lewis, 236 Miss. 792, 112 So. 2d 247, 1959 Miss. LEXIS 378 (Miss. 1959).
      </p>
      <p>
       Violation of statutory rules of the road is negligence per se. Vaughan v. Lewis, 236 Miss. 792, 112 So. 2d 247, 1959 Miss. LEXIS 378 (Miss. 1959).
      </p>
      <p>
       The statute does not require the driver of a vehicle who has already entered onto an intersection with a through highway to yield the right of way to an approaching vehicle which has neither entered the intersection nor approached so closely thereto from the through highway as to constitute an immediate hazard, and this is likewise true as to a vehicle about to enter or cross a through highway from a private road or driveway. Jones v. Carter, 192 Miss. 603, 7 So. 2d 519, 1942 Miss. LEXIS 55 (Miss. 1942).

       Unless priority is otherwise given, the vehicle first entering an intersection has the right of way. Vaughan v. Lewis, 236 Miss. 792, 112 So. 2d 247, 1959 Miss. LEXIS 378 (Miss. 1959).
      </p>
      <p>
       If two vehicles arrive at an intersection at the same time, it is the duty of the driver to yield to the other driver who is on the right. Herring v. Hart, 225 Miss. 115, 82 So. 2d 710, 1955 Miss. LEXIS 564 (Miss. 1955).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where an automobile was first to reach an intersection, a driver of a truck approaching from the other street had the duty to yield the right of way to the first automobile and if necessary, to stop so as to permit him to pass through the intersection without interference.

   Finding in favor of a trucking company and truck driver in a wrongful-death action brought by the decedent’s widow was proper because the trial court did not err in refusing the widow’s requested jury instructions under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c03s63-3-801" target="_self">63-3-801</a></cite> since the record contained no evidence to show that the truck driver or decedent were in close proximity to each other at an intersection when the truck driver entered the highway. The accident occurred two and one-half miles after the truck driver had entered the highway from the trucking company’s lot and had been traveling in the right-hand lane. Utz v. Running &amp; Rolling Trucking, Inc., 32 So.3d 450, 2010 Miss. LEXIS 200 (Miss. 2010).
      </p>
      <p>
       A party is not entitled to an instruction that one should yield to the car first entering an intersection where the statute requires stopping before entering the intersection in response to a red signal light, and Code 1942, § 8195 merely prescribes the general rule as to an ordinary intersection and is inapplicable to one with traffic lights and signals. Gates v. Green, 214 So. 2d 828, 1968 Miss. LEXIS 1337 (Miss. 1968).
      </p>
      <p>
       Since common-law principles of negligence applied to an action arising out of a motor vehicle collision at an intersection of an existing public road, and a new highway under construction which was not open to general vehicular traffic, the court committed reversible error in giving the favored driver instruction which is solely statutory in origin. Carlisle v. Cobb Bros. Constr. Co., 238 Miss. 681, 119 So. 2d 918, 1960 Miss. LEXIS 457 (Miss. 1960).
      </p>
      <p>
       A motorist who approached an intersection with the signal light flashing red in her direction, and failed to stop before entering the intersection, was not entitled to an instruction under this section [Code 1942, § 8195], providing that the driver of a vehicle approaching an intersection shall yield the right of way to vehicle which has entered the intersection from a different highway. Bates v. Walker, 232 Miss. 804, 100 So. 2d 611, 1958 Miss. LEXIS 333 (Miss. 1958).

       The action of the trial court in a manslaughter prosecution in instructing the jury in reference to the so-called “rules of the road” as contained in previous repealed section (Code 1930, § 5574) was not error as against the contention that such rules had no application in a criminal case, since the jury was entitled to know the relative rights and duties of the driver of the truck and of the driver of the automobile in order to be able to determine who was at fault when the driver of the automobile was killed in a collision. Turner v. State, 183 Miss. 658, 183 So. 522, 1938 Miss. LEXIS 279 (Miss. 1938).

       In an action for personal injuries sustained by a plaintiff when his automobile was struck from the rear by the defendant’s automobile, where the evidence presented jury questions as to whether the defendant was negligent in driving at an excessive speed, or following another vehicle too closely, or in failing to have his vehicle under proper control, or whether the sole proximate cause of the collision was the manner in which the plaintiff’s vehicle was driven into the intersection, the trial court erred in directing a verdict for plaintiff on the issue of liability.

       Jury verdict defied all logic, as the evidence presented at trial established that the driver was negligent as a matter of law for failing to maintain a proper lookout and to yield the right-of-way by executing a turn across the insured’s lane of travel. A verdict should have been returned in favor of the insured because the violation of said statutory duties by the driver was the unequivocal proximate cause of the insured’s injury; even if the driver was not negligent per se, the facts presented at trial unconditionally demonstrated that the collision was the result of her negligence and the trial court committed reversible error in failing to apply Miss. R. Civ. P. 50, and by denying the insured’s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. State Farm Auto Ins. Cos. v. Davis, 887 So. 2d 192, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 1065 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).

       Allowing an investigating officer, not an eyewitness to an accident, to give his opinion, in an action for injuries resulting from the collision, as to the place of impact and to depict this point on a map, was harmless error where the negligence of the defendant motorist was clearly established by other evidence.

       In a personal injury action arising out of an automobile accident at an intersection in which the defendant was struck by the plaintiff’s automobile as he made a left turn across the plaintiff’s traffic lane, the trial court erred in giving an instruction that the defendant was entitled to a verdict if the jury believed that the accident had been proximately caused by the negligence of a truck driver who had allegedly indicated to the defendant that he could safely cross the plaintiff’s traffic lane; the defendant did not have the legal right to rely on the truck driver and had a duty to ascertain whether he could cross the traffic lane with reasonable safety. Boyd v. Smith, 390 So. 2d 994, 1980 Miss. LEXIS 2155 (Miss. 1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       An instruction that the operator of a vehicle continuing its course is bound to have his vehicle under such control that another vehicle, entering the intersection first, can safely make the left turn, is improper as making such operator the insurer of the other’s safety without regard to whether such other had at the time a right to turn across the traffic lane, and without regard to whether or not he was in such close proximity to the intersection as to constitute an immediate hazard. Greenville Ice & Coal Co. v. Brown, 236 Miss. 253, 109 So. 2d 858, 1959 Miss. LEXIS 315 (Miss. 1959).
      </p>
      <p>
       An instruction that the driver of an oncoming truck who saw a car signalling at a controlled-traffic intersection for a left turn but continued on a green light was bound to know that the car’s driver contemplated turning, is objectionable as ignoring whatever right the truck driver had to assume that the car would wait until the traffic lane was clear. Greenville Ice & Coal Co. v. Brown, 236 Miss. 253, 109 So. 2d 858, 1959 Miss. LEXIS 315 (Miss. 1959).

       In an action for injuries sustained by 16-year-old motorcyclist in an intersectional collision with a truck, the driver of which had, contrary to Code 1942, § 8189(a), and a city ordinance, “cut the corner” in making a left turn, instructions permitting the jury to find that the motorcycle had already entered the intersection at the time of the left turn, and was readily visible to the truck driver, was not reversible error, where, under conflicting evidence, the jury could, and evidently did, reject the version of defendant’s witnesses. City of Jackson v. Reed, 233 Miss. 280, 102 So. 2d 342, 1958 Miss. LEXIS 559 (Miss. 1958).

       The action of a truckdriver, whose view of the road ahead was admittedly obstructed by a preceding pulpwood truck, who pulled into the left lane of traffic in order to make a turn into a county road was guilty of violating this section [Code 1942, § 8196] and should have stopped or slowed down until the pulpwood truck ceased to obstruct his view.

       In an action for injuries sustained when plaintiff’s truck was struck by defendant’s truck which was making a left turn in front of plaintiff’s vehicle to enter an intersecting county road, where the defendant’s own testimony showed that he had failed to maintain a proper lookout, and was negligent in failing to comply with this section [Code 1942, § 8196], the jury’s verdict for defendant was contrary to the overwhelming weight of the evidence. Cobb v. Williams, 228 Miss. 807, 90 So. 2d 17, 1956 Miss. LEXIS 568 (Miss. 1956).

      The driver of a vehicle shall stop as required by this chapter at the entrance to a through highway and shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles which have entered the intersection from said through highway or which are approaching so closely on said through highway as to constitute an immediate hazard. However, said driver having so yielded may proceed and the drivers of all other vehicles approaching the intersection on said through highway shall yield the right-of-way to the vehicle so proceeding into or across the through highway.

      The driver of a vehicle shall likewise stop in obedience to a stop sign as required by this chapter at an intersection where a stop sign is erected at one or more entrances thereto although not a part of a through highway and shall proceed cautiously, yielding to vehicles not so obliged to stop which are within the intersection or approaching so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard, but may then proceed.

       Record showed substantial evidence that a jury could reasonably base their verdict on in favor of the truck driver in a car accident; the jury found that the car driver had time to react at the intersection. Phan v. Denley, 915 So. 2d 504, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 901 (Miss. Ct. App. 2005).
      </p>

       As the driver failed to reduce his speed and keep a lookout as he approached an intersection that he knew was dangerous, the trial court did not err in assessing 54 percent liability against him. Classic Coach, Inc. v. Johnson, 823 So. 2d 517, 2002 Miss. LEXIS 243 (Miss. 2002), amended, 2003 Miss. LEXIS 81 (Miss. Feb. 20, 2003).

       Although this section places a burden on a driver to yield the right-of-way before entering a through highway, and further provides that when a STOP sign is present the driver is to observe the sign, it does not mandate that the state or a county place a STOP sign at an intersection. Jones v. Mississippi DOT, 744 So. 2d 256, 1999 Miss. LEXIS 201 (Miss. 1999).

       The general rule is that a vehicle which first enters and occupies the intersection has the right of way. Tant v. Fairchild, 228 Miss. 126, 87 So. 2d 78, 1956 Miss. LEXIS 495 (Miss. 1956).
      </p>
      <p>
       The general rule that the first vehicle in intersection has the right of way does not relieve a truck owner from the duty of having a flagman present to direct and stop traffic at busy intersection where the truck carried a huge cargo and was very slow in going through the intersection.

       Employee was required to obey the stop sign and then proceed onto the highway intersection only after yielding to automobiles that were approaching and were close enough to be considered an immediate hazard; however, the mother failed to keep a proper lookout when approaching the intersection, and a reasonable person would have recognized the need to slow the vehicle when approaching the intersection, and the employee was unable to avoid an accident.

   Injured party’s interpretation of Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c03s63-3-805" target="_self">63-3-805</a></cite>, was incorrect because the injured party seemed to contend that the uncontradicted proof that the injured party was traveling on the through highway at the time of the accident necessarily establishes the driver’s negligence for the accident, but because the driver testified that the injured party’s vehicle was not in sight just moments before the collision and the driver made reference to the degree of damage inflicted on the driver’s truck as evidence tending to show that the injured party’s vehicle was speeding, there was evidence that the injured party was speeding, which supported an inference that the injured party’s speeding was the cause of the collision; thus, the jury verdict in favor of the driver and against the injured party was not against the weight of the evidence. Redmond v. Breakfield, 840 So. 2d 828, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 235 (Miss. Ct. App. 2003).

       A motorist either at, or when entering, an intersection to cross a through highway has no right of way, and must yield to another car farther from the intersection but yet so close as to present a hazardous situation.

      </p>
      <p>
       The statute does not require the driver of a vehicle who has already entered onto an intersection with a through highway to yield the right of way to an approaching vehicle which has neither entered the intersection nor approached so closely thereto from the through highway as to constitute an immediate hazard, and this is likewise true as to a vehicle about to enter or cross a through highway from a private road or driveway.

       Failure of motorist on unfavored street to continue to look for approaching vehicles after having stopped at stop sign and looked at intersection of highway with through highway constitutes negligence; motorist who claims to have looked and failed to see vehicles in intersection or approaching so closely as to constitute immediate hazard is guilty of negligence as matter of law. Dogan v. Hardy, 587 F. Supp. 967, 1984 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15383 (N.D. Miss. 1984).

   There was sufficient evidence to find that a driver was contributorily negligent including driver’s duty of common sense under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c03s63-3-805" target="_self">63-3-805</a></cite>, the fact that a good portion of the bus was past the center line before colliding with the car, and the disputed testimony with regard to the amount of time between when the bus pulled into the road and when the bus arrived at the point of collision. Callahan v. Ledbetter, 992 So. 2d 1220, 2008 Miss. App. LEXIS 547 (Miss. Ct. App. 2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       Court’s finding of contributory negligence on the part of plaintiff was proper where defendant bus driver testified that he came to a complete stop at the stop sign, he looked both ways for oncoming traffic before entering the intersection, both parties had a clear unobstructed view of the intersection as they approached from their respective directions, and defendant’s bus was hit by plaintiff’s truck, thus indicating a lack of evasive action on the part of plaintiff. Thompson ex rel. Thompson v. Lee County Sch. Dist., 925 So. 2d 57, 2006 Miss. LEXIS 50 (Miss. 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       Plaintiff was not guilty of contributory negligence where it appeared that while traveling on his side of a city street, without excessive speed, he was struck by an automobile driven by the defendant, who, upon entering the intersection, had seen the plaintiff’s automobile approaching at such a distance as to constitute an immediate hazard, but, without looking again, continued across the intersection. Wells v. Bennett, 229 Miss. 135, 90 So. 2d 199, 1956 Miss. LEXIS 594 (Miss. 1956).
      </p>
      <p>
       Since defendant’s own admission showed that he was guilty of negligence in proceeding into a through street without continuing to look for the hazard of plaintiff’s approaching automobile, plaintiff was entitled to a peremptory instruction on the issue of liability, and the question of whether plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence was for the jury, and, after finding plaintiff guilty, the jury would only diminish the amount of damages to be awarded.

Dunnam v. Abney, 137 So.3d 876, 2013 Miss. App. LEXIS 770 (Miss. Ct. App. 2013), cert. denied, 139 So.3d 74, 2014 Miss. LEXIS 242 (Miss. 2014).

       In action for injuries resulting from automobile collision at intersection of cross road with through traffic lane, failure to give a comparative negligence instruction on behalf of plaintiff is not erroneous when instruction was not requested and plaintiff predicated liability on finding that defendant was negligent and defendant’s negligence was the sole, proximate cause of plaintiff’s injuries.

       When ultimate issue in intersection collision negligence case is relative position and speed of parties in moments prior to collision and evidence offered by witnesses is sharply conflicting, it is proper for jury to resolve conflict. Mills v. Nichols, 467 So. 2d 924, 1985 Miss. LEXIS 2017 (Miss. 1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       In an action for personal injuries arising out of a multiple vehicle collision, the trial court erred in directing a verdict in favor of the defendant where a question of fact existed as to whether the defendant had been negligent in failing to yield the right-of-way to the plaintiff’s vehicle. Marshall v. Conley, 391 So. 2d 656, 1980 Miss. LEXIS 2183 (Miss. 1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       What is a “through highway” may be answered categorically and absolutely, but the question who has the “right of way” cannot, since the answer to that question is variable, changing as the circumstances and facts of each situation change, so that it must be for the jury to decide under the facts of a particular case. Shivel v. Ferguson, 259 So. 2d 123, 1972 Miss. LEXIS 1524 (Miss. 1972).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the driver of the automobile in which the infant decedent was riding was guilty of negligence in entering the intersection, the defendant was not entitled to a directed verdict in an action for the wrongful death of the child, where the evidence raised a jury question as to whether defendant’s driver was guilty of negligence which proximately contributed to the collision. Bush Constr. Co. v. Walters, 250 Miss. 384, 164 So. 2d 900, 1964 Miss. LEXIS 469 (Miss. 1964).
      </p>
      <p>
       Violation of this section [Code 1942, § 8197] may warrant a jury in finding that an automobile was being negligently operated. West v. Armstrong, 248 Miss. 617, 159 So. 2d 805, 1964 Miss. LEXIS 285 (Miss. 1964).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence, although conflicting, was sufficient to present question for jury as to whether truck driven from private road onto highway in front of an approaching car at nighttime constituted an immediate hazard. Miller Petroleum Transporters, Ltd. v. Price, 237 Miss. 284, 114 So. 2d 756, 1959 Miss. LEXIS 466 (Miss. 1959).
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether one entering a through highway intersection after stopping should have yielded a right of way to an approaching car as presenting an immediate hazard, held for the jury where there was evidence that when he started, 15 to 20 feet from the edge of the highway, the approaching car was still several hundred feet distant and that its driver did not reduce speed after he saw or should have seen the other car entering the intersection. Junakin v. Kuykendall, 237 Miss. 255, 114 So. 2d 661, 1959 Miss. LEXIS 463 (Miss. 1959).
      </p>
      <p>
       In an action for personal injuries and property damages arising out of a collision between plaintiff’s automobile and that of the defendant when defendant allegedly drove, without stopping, from a private driveway into the highway upon which plaintiff was proceeding in such manner that plaintiff could not avoid striking him, conflicting evidence raised jury questions as to defendant’s negligence, and whether his negligence was the proximate cause of the accident. Stewart v. Madden, 233 Miss. 206, 101 So. 2d 353, 1958 Miss. LEXIS 372 (Miss. 1958).

       Since defendant’s own admission showed that he was guilty of negligence in proceeding into a through street without continuing to look for the hazard of plaintiff’s approaching automobile, plaintiff was entitled to a peremptory instruction on the issue of liability, and the question of whether plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence was for the jury, and, after finding plaintiff guilty, the jury would only diminish the amount of damages to be awarded. Wells v. Bennett, 229 Miss. 135, 90 So. 2d 199, 1956 Miss. LEXIS 594 (Miss. 1956).
      </p>
      <p>
       It was for the jury to say whether the defendants, in an action for death of a motorist resulting from an automobile collision, were negligent in entering an intersection without looking in the direction from which another motorist was coming, after making a stop at a stop sign some distance from the intersection. Avent v. Tucker, 188 Miss. 207, 194 So. 596, 1940 Miss. LEXIS 28 (Miss. 1940).
      </p>

       The fact that the defendants stopped at a stop sign a short distance from the intersection before proceeding into the intersection of a through highway would not discharge them of their duty to exercise ordinary care and diligence in proceeding upon the crossing and whether their failure to look to the south in entering the intersection was negligence proximately causing or contributing to the injury or death of a motorist approaching from that direction was for the jury.

       <p>
   In an action for damages arising out of a collision between plaintiff’s motorcycle and defendant’s automobile in an intersection with a flashing red light and stop sign facing plaintiff and a flashing yellow light and warning sign facing defendant, the trial court did not err in refusing to grant plaintiff’s standard of care instruction which included the language, “the defendant had no lawful right to go forward. . . under the assumption that it would be open and clear,” where a granted instruction detailed the crucial point that the yellow light facing defendant demanded caution, and that a finding of negligence would flow from her failure to yield the right-of-way to plaintiff if, as he claimed, he had lawfully entered the intersection and stalled unexpectedly. The trial court also properly refused to grant an instruction which stated in part, “the driver of a motor vehicle has a lawful duty to decrease his speed upon approaching an intersection,” since §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c03s63-3-311ol12" target="_self">63-3-311(2)</a></cite> merely states that a driver “may proceed. . . only with caution” and caution is a relative concept not necessarily entailing decrease in speed since the current speed may already be a cautious speed. Allen v. Blanks, 384 So. 2d 63, 1980 Miss. LEXIS 2000 (Miss. 1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       An instruction to the effect that it is the duty of a motorist approaching a through highway to anticipate the presence of other persons and vehicles thereon and keep a reasonable lookout for them, and to stop for the stop sign at the intersection and yield the right of way to traffic on the through highway, and to see if she could enter the intersection with safety to herself and the traveling public, and that if she failed in any one of those particulars or respects such failure was the sole proximate cause of an intersectional accident then it was the jury’s duty to find against her, is erroneous in the absence of a further statement that after complying with these stated conditions the motorist had a right to enter the intersection and that vehicles on the through highway must yield the right of way to her. Richardson v. Adams, 223 So. 2d 536, 1969 Miss. LEXIS 1275 (Miss. 1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       An instruction was properly refused where it would have told the jury that when the operator of an automobile is confronted with a stop sign at an intersection, he, before entering the intersection, is under a duty to appraise traffic on the intersecting highway and to make certain that the way is clear for him to make a safe passage across the highway. Such an instruction would make the person entering the intersection an insurer of his own safety, regardless of the negligence of others. Bush Constr. Co. v. Walters, 250 Miss. 384, 164 So. 2d 900, 1964 Miss. LEXIS 469 (Miss. 1964).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the defendant was entitled to an instruction under this section [Code 1942, § 8197], the trial court properly refused to give an instruction which was calculated to confuse the jury and did not properly present the issues. Bush Constr. Co. v. Walters, 250 Miss. 384, 164 So. 2d 900, 1964 Miss. LEXIS 469 (Miss. 1964).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court did not err in refusing an instruction that would have required a holding that defendant, who was traveling along a through highway, was guilty of negligence as a matter of law even though the jury could have found that, when plaintiff had entered the intersection, defendant was so close at hand that he could not possibly have stopped or averted a collision. Walton v. Owens, 244 F.2d 383, 1957 U.S. App. LEXIS 3100 (5th Cir. Miss. 1957).
      </p>
      <p>
       In cross actions for damages and personal injuries arising out of a motor vehicle intersectional collision, the trial court erred in instructing that the defendant who had been traveling along a road upon which a stop sign was located, not only had the duty to stop his automobile at the intersection but “to wait until he could safely proceed,” since that duty is not required by this section [Code 1942, § 8197]. Hill v. Columbus Ice Cream & Creamery Co., 230 Miss. 634, 93 So. 2d 634, 1957 Miss. LEXIS 404 (Miss. 1957).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the plaintiff and the driver of the car in which he was riding both testified that before entering the intersection of a through highway they had looked to the north and the south, the trial court committed reversible error in instructing that the driver of the car was guilty of negligence in driving his car into the intersection without looking to the north immediately before doing so. Moore v. Herman Guy Auto Parts, Inc., 230 Miss. 189, 92 So. 2d 373, 1957 Miss. LEXIS 358 (Miss. 1957).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where defendant testified that at the time he had stopped before entering a through street he had seen plaintiff’s car approaching thereon from a distance of about 100 yards and traveling at about 40 miles per hour, but that he did not look any further before driving slowly into the through street where the collision occurred, plaintiff was entitled to a peremptory instruction in his action for personal injuries sustained as the result of the collision. Wells v. Bennett, 229 Miss. 135, 90 So. 2d 199, 1956 Miss. LEXIS 594 (Miss. 1956).
      </p>
      <p>
       In action for injuries resulting from automobile collision at intersection of cross road with through traffic lane, failure to give a comparative negligence instruction on behalf of plaintiff is not erroneous when instruction was not requested and plaintiff predicated liability on finding that defendant was negligent and defendant’s negligence was the sole, proximate cause of plaintiff’s injuries. Davidian v. Wendell, 37 So. 2d 570 (Miss. 1948).

       In a widow’s wrongful-death action, the trial court properly entered a directed verdict in favor of an employer and an employee because the employee had the right of way to proceed onto the highway unless the decedent’s pickup truck was so close as to constitute an immediate hazard, and the employee testified that the truck was approximately three-fourths of a mile away. Moreno v. TLSL, Inc., 187 So.3d 127, 2016 Miss. LEXIS 124 (Miss. 2016).

   The trial court did not err in finding in favor of a driver in her action against a city and a police officer stemming from a vehicular accident in which the driver was struck by the officer, because he city’s argument that the driver was contributorily negligent under Miss. Code Ann. §§<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c03s63-3-805" target="_self">63-3-805</a></cite> and<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c03s63-3-505" target="_self">63-3-505</a></cite> contained no evidentiary basis. The driver’s view was blocked by a truck and therefore, she was unable to see the officer approach; the driver had a green light at the intersection and she was not speeding or violating any other rule of the road.

       Trial court properly found that defendant driver breached no duty to a pedestrian he struck and killed as she was walking near an entrance ramp; he was traveling at a prudent speed, keeping a proper lookout for traffic while preparing to merge, and the pedestrian was in his lane of travel when she was hit.

       The statute does not require the driver of a vehicle who has already entered onto an intersection with a through highway to yield the right of way to an approaching vehicle which has neither entered the intersection nor approached so closely thereto from the through highway as to constitute an immediate hazard, and this is likewise true as to a vehicle about to enter or cross a through highway from a private road or driveway.

       Evidence showed the officer was traveling approximately 37 miles per hour with lights and sirens activated, there was nothing obstructing the view of either the person later injured or the officer, and the greater weight of evidence also proved that the person’s left turn signal was not activated. In addition, the officer had consciously stopped at the previous two intersections because the officer considered both of those to be blind intersections, and therefore, the officer’s behavior supported the finding that the officer appreciated the risk involved in approaching the intersection and did not act with reckless disregard.

   Deputy, who stopped at an intersection and, with his blue lights and sirens activated, slowly proceeded across in a stop-and-start fashion, exercised sufficient safety measures to prompt other drivers near the intersection to yield the right-of-way, including the driver traveling in the lane ahead of plaintiffs. Thus, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to plaintiffs, the deputy’s conduct did not demonstrate a conscious indifference to consequences, nor did it rise to the level of reckless disregard for the safety and well-being of persons not engaged in criminal activity, so as subject the county to liability under Miss.

       In an action to recover damages for personal injuries sustained by plaintiff in an automobile intersectional collision allegedly caused by defendant’s bus being parked in such a manner as to obscure a stop sign, any negligence on the part of the plaintiff and the driver of the car in which he was riding, as well as the driver of the other automobile, did not supersede defendant’s negligence. Meridian Hatcheries, Inc. v. Troutman, 230 Miss. 493, 93 So. 2d 472, 1957 Miss. LEXIS 391 (Miss. 1957).
      </p>
      <p>
       In an action to recover for the death of a child who was fatally injured when thrown from an automobile fender on which she was riding when the automobile struck an unattended parked automobile on a bridge, it was a question for the jury to determine whether the parking of the automobile upon the bridge and leaving it there unattended for a period of eleven hours was not a proximate contributing cause of the death of the child. Belk v. Rosamond, 213 Miss. 633, 57 So. 2d 461, 1952 Miss. LEXIS 405 (Miss. 1952).
      </p>
      <p>
       When the legislature has said that there shall be a clear and unobstructed width of at least twenty feet of the main traveled portion of the highway for the free passage of vehicles, and that an automobile shall not be parked upon a bridge, it cannot be reasonably contended that the parking of an automobile upon a bridge nineteen feet three inches in width and leaving the car unattended for a period of eleven hours did not constitute an act of negligence.

       Since this statute does not require that a motorist drive his vehicle off the pavement while slowing down but only requires him to do so before coming to a stop, it was not violated by a truck driver who, after his airbrakes failed, slowed down but was still moving toward the shoulder of the highway when the truck was struck by an automobile. Sprayberry v. Blount, 336 So. 2d 1289, 1976 Miss. LEXIS 1546 (Miss. 1976).
      </p>
      <p>
       The general rule that the first vehicle in intersection has the right of way does not relieve a truck owner from the duty of having a flagman present to direct and stop traffic at busy intersection where the truck carried a huge cargo and was very slow in going through the intersection.

       Where defendant stopped his car, to aid a pedestrian, on the traveled portion of the highway with part of his car extending on a highway bridge, so as to leave less than 20 feet clearance, although shoulders of the road were such that defendant could have parked entirely off highway, and plaintiff’s truck struck the rear of defendant’s car causing the damage complained of, defendant was guilty of violation of paragraph m of subsection (1) of this section [Code 1942, § 8217]. Gulf Refining Co. v. Brown, 196 Miss. 131, 16 So. 2d 765, 1944 Miss. LEXIS 173 (Miss. 1944).

       Contributory negligence of driver of plaintiff’s truck, in colliding with defendant’s car, stopped on the traveled highway and at the entrance to a highway bridge in violation of law, was more responsible for the damages sued for than negligence of defendant and warranted reduction of recovery by 50 per cent.

      <p>
       The constitutionality of this section [Code 1942, § 8215] can be sustained by giving the word “practical” in subsection (1) an operation throughout the entire section, and by preserving as referable to the words, “in any event,” the provision that, when possible, a clear view for 200 feet shall be available. Teche Lines, Inc. v. Danforth, 195 Miss. 226, 12 So. 2d 784, 1943 Miss. LEXIS 116 (Miss. 1943).

       The word “impossible” as used in subsection (2) should be construed as “not reasonably practical”. Hankins v. Harvey, 248 Miss. 639, 160 So. 2d 63, 1964 Miss. LEXIS 288 (Miss. 1964).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the driver of a motor vehicle was actually negligent in bringing his motor vehicle to a stop partially on the paved and main traveled portion of the highway, the fact that he may have pulled his motor vehicle as far to the right as practicable, including sound and safe shoulders, and that there may have been a clear view of this stopped vehicle for a distance of 200 feet in each direction, does not relieve him from the liability for injuries proximately caused by his negligence. Continental Southern Lines, Inc. v. Klaas, 217 Miss. 795, 63 So. 2d 211, 65 So. 2d 575, 1953 Miss. LEXIS 496 (Miss. 1953).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section [Code 1942, § 8215] is to be construed to the effect that when 20 feet of clearance is impossible, the vehicle shall turn as far to the right as practical including sound and safe shoulders, but must not stop upon any part of the traveled highway unless and until at least 200 feet clear view is available in each direction from the point where the stop is made, save when the vehicle is disabled, as provided for under subsection (2); and save further, when on account of obstructions or equivalent conditions ahead, it is impossible to proceed so as to leave the 200 feet of clear view; and that all this is for the determination of the jury. Gulf Refining Co. v. Brown, 196 Miss. 131, 16 So. 2d 765, 1944 Miss. LEXIS 173 (Miss. 1944); Teche Lines, Inc. v. Danforth, 195 Miss. 226, 12 So. 2d 784, 1943 Miss. LEXIS 116 (Miss. 1943).
      </p>
      <p>
       In construing this section [Code 1942, § 8215] the court will take judicial notice that at least 85 per cent of the public highways in the state are of such width that it is only occasionally possible, and that at distant intervals, to stop a vehicle so as to leave as much as 20 feet of unobstructed highway. Teche Lines, Inc. v. Danforth, 195 Miss. 226, 12 So. 2d 784, 1943 Miss. LEXIS 116 (Miss. 1943).

       In an action to recover for the death of a motorist who had run into the rear of a bus which had stopped on the traveled highway to discharge a passenger at a point where it was impossible to leave 20 feet clearance opposite the bus, an instruction that if the bus was stopped upon the paved or improved or main traveled part of the highway, not in an emergency, at a place and time and in such a way as not to leave a clear and unobstructed width of at least 20 feet opposite such bus, was a violation of the law and negligence, was erroneous, since the question whether there had been a compliance with this section [Code 1942, § 8215], under the circumstances existing, was for the jury.

       Truck driver negligently violated this section where, though he made several attempts to start his truck after it became disabled and stopped on the highway, he did not look under the hood and thus did not discover that a recently installed battery cable had become unfastened and was the cause of the problem. Aetna Casualty & Surety Co. v. Condict, 417 F. Supp. 63, 1976 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15305 (S.D. Miss. 1976).

       Parking of a tractor and trailers at least two feet on the paved portion of the road, although there was room to park them entirely off, on a dark, foggy night, without rear lights, reflectors, or flares, is a violation of this section [Code 1942, § 8215].

       When the legislature has said that there shall be a clear and unobstructed width of at least twenty feet of the main traveled portion of the highway for the free passage of vehicles, and that an automobile shall not be parked upon a bridge, it cannot be reasonably contended that the parking of an automobile upon a bridge nineteen feet three inches in width and leaving the car unattended for a period of eleven hours did not constitute an act of negligence. Belk v. Rosamond, 213 Miss. 633, 57 So. 2d 461, 1952 Miss. LEXIS 405 (Miss. 1952).
      </p>
      <p>
       In an action for personal injuries where the plaintiff’s car ran into defendant’s truck parked on a highway the court did not err in giving an instruction based on this section [Code 1942, § 8215] which requires any vehicle parking upon a highway to leave a width of at least twenty feet of the highway opposite such standing vehicle for the passage of other cars, where the parked truck could have been moved back from seven to ten feet. Planters Wholesale Grocery v. Kincade, 210 Miss. 712, 50 So. 2d 578, 1951 Miss. LEXIS 309 (Miss. 1951).

       The operator of an automobile has the right to slow down and come to a stop, to back, or to turn his car, in the street or highway, but in so doing must exercise reasonable care with respect to other vehicles and pedestrians and this duty exists independently of any regulations on the subject, and where the driver of an automobile is actually not negligent, the fact that he is violating no statute or ordinance does not relieve him of that liability. Continental Southern Lines, Inc. v. Klaas, 217 Miss. 795, 63 So. 2d 211, 65 So. 2d 575, 1953 Miss. LEXIS 496 (Miss. 1953).

       Where defendant’s truck became partially disabled because of water damage to engine and was proceeding slowly ahead of plaintiff’s automobile, which was struck in the rear by an overtaking truck, and at the time of the collision the driver of defendant’s truck was attempting to move it to place where he could get off the highway and the forward movement of defendant’s truck was halted for very brief intervals, the driver of the defendant’s truck did not violate the parking statute.

   Although a county was not liable for an individual’s injuries after a third party hit the individual and forced her into a county garbage truck because weather conditions were determined to be the sole cause of the accident, the county also would have been immune under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c03s63-3-903" target="_self">63-3-903</a></cite>, as there was no evidence that any negligence was attributed to the driver of the garbage truck. Hayes v.

       Where the driver of a tractor-trailer, while attempting to turn the rig around, had stopped the vehicle in violation of this section [Code 1942, § 8215] in such a fashion that it was blocking both lanes of a two way highway, the fact that there was no time later in which he could extricate himself from the dangerous position in which he had deliberately placed himself cannot excuse his original act of negligence. Anderson v. Eagle Motor Lines, Inc., 423 F.2d 81, 1970 U.S. App. LEXIS 10685 (5th Cir. Miss. 1970).
      </p>

       Where the exigencies of the traffic situation require, a motorist can stop momentarily in the highway without being guilty of negligence and is not required to drive the vehicle off the main portion of the highway prior to stopping. Burt v. Duckworth, 206 So. 2d 850, 1968 Miss. LEXIS 1592 (Miss. 1968).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section [Code 1942, § 8215] should be construed in a practical manner, and it does not mean that a motorist forced to stop momentarily upon the paved portion of a highway because the vehicle in front of him stopped and oncoming traffic prevented him from passing is guilty of negligence in not immediately driving from the highway onto the shoulder. Whitten v. Land, 188 So. 2d 246, 1966 Miss. LEXIS 1375 (Miss. 1966).

      <p>
       The driver of a passenger bus, like the operator of any other motor vehicle on the public highway, must not only observe the statutory requirements of bringing his vehicle to a stop, but he must also exercise due care not to endanger the safety of other persons using the highway and this duty to exercise due care exists independently of any statutory regulation. Continental Southern Lines, Inc. v. Klaas, 217 Miss. 795, 63 So. 2d 211, 65 So. 2d 575, 1953 Miss. LEXIS 496 (Miss. 1953).

       Contributory negligence of driver of plaintiff’s truck, in colliding with defendant’s car, stopped on the traveled highway and at the entrance to a highway bridge in violation of law, was more responsible for the damages sued for than negligence of defendant and warranted reduction of recovery by 50 per cent. Gulf Refining Co. v. Brown, 196 Miss. 131, 16 So. 2d 765, 1944 Miss. LEXIS 173 (Miss. 1944).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where defendant stopped his car, to aid pedestrian, on traveled portion of highway at entrance to bridge so as to leave less than 20 feet clearance, although the shoulders of the road were in such condition that defendant could have parked entirely off the highway, and plaintiff’s truck struck the rear of defendant’s car causing the damage complained of, trial judge was warranted in finding that the stopping of defendant’s car at the particular place shown by the evidence was in violation of this section [Code 1942, § 8215], and constituted actionable negligence. Gulf Refining Co. v. Brown, 196 Miss. 131, 16 So. 2d 765, 1944 Miss. LEXIS 173 (Miss. 1944).

       Violation of this section [Code 1942, § 8215] by stopping a bus with the rear end thereof out into the highway was not the proximate cause of injury to a passenger, who after alighting from the bus passed around the rear end of the bus into traffic and was struck by an automobile. Mississippi City Lines, Inc. v. Bullock, 194 Miss. 630, 13 So. 2d 34, 1943 Miss. LEXIS 93 (Miss. 1943).

       The right to travel being the right to go from one place to another includes the right to stop on the way, temporarily, for a legitimate or necessary purpose when that purpose is an immediate incident to travel; and such rights, being fundamental, are constitutional rights which the legislature may regulate in pursuance of the police power but may not arbitrarily or unreasonably restrict.

       Where defendant’s driver was grossly negligent in entering intersection at 50 miles per hour without stopping as required by this section [Code 1942, § 8213], and collided with plaintiff’s driver who, in entering the intersection on a through street at unabated speed of 30 miles per hour, was prima facie negligent under Code 1942, § 8176, the negligence of plaintiff’s driver was a contributing factor to the accident and warranted application of the comparative negligence statute (Code 1942, § 1454).

   Just as one seeking relief for any other cause of action needs not refer to the case establishing the particular tort at the center of his case, Fed. R. Civ. P. 8 does not demand that a plaintiff claiming negligence per se include within his complaint an explicit citation to authority simply for the sake of doing so; so long as the complaint alleges particular conduct that clearly violates a statute or regulation, it pleads negligence per se with sufficient particularity. Therefore, summary judgment was denied in a negligence per se case where there was no citation to Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c03s63-3-1003" target="_self">63-3-1003</a></cite> since a complaint was sufficient where it alleged that a truck driver failed to adhere to the proper standard of care when he did not yield the right of way.

   Federal district court did not err in rejecting an injured contract worker’s contention that a railroad was negligent per se for failing to install a flagman near a crossing 20-30 feet from where the worker was removing obstructions from the right-of-way; although the worker’s truck was hit by a train while crossing the tracks, the evidence showed that the location of the work zone did not force the worker to “foul the tracks” while maneuvering his truck and that he had violated three separate laws when he crossed the tracks: not stopping after hearing the locomotive’s whistle in violation of Miss.

      <p>
       Conviction for reckless driving did not require that defendant pose a danger to another person, but to himself and his property; therefore, there was sufficient evidence to sustain the conviction due to the fact that defendant posed a danger to himself and an officer where he was proceeding at a high rate of speed on the wrong side of the road. Ouzts v. State, 947 So. 2d 1005, 2006 Miss. App. LEXIS 698 (Miss. Ct. App. 2006).

       Reckless driving means the commission of conscious acts or omissions which the driver knows or should know create an unreasonable risk of injury or damage either to the driver and his property, or to the person or property of others. Barnes v. State, 249 Miss. 482, 162 So. 2d 865, 1964 Miss. LEXIS 409 (Miss. 1964).

       A motorist is not guilty of reckless driving where there are no persons or vehicles on the highway ahead of and in view of the motorist or where the driving allegedly reckless did not occur on the highway. Gause v. State, 203 Miss. 377, 34 So. 2d 729, 1948 Miss. LEXIS 282 (Miss. 1948).

       Evidence was sufficient to establish reckless driving by the defendant where (1) a police officer observed the defendant driving at an excessively high rate of speed while weaving in and out of traffic in a 45 mile per hour speed zone and passing other vehicles at an excessive rate of speed, and (2) the officer testified that after questioning the defendant about his speed, the defendant responded and admitted to driving at a speed of 135 miles per hour (although a passenger in his car stated that the defendant drove at 60 to 65 miles per hour) and that he drove at that rate because “I wanted to.” Nix v. State, 763 So. 2d 896, 2000 Miss. App. LEXIS 175 (Miss. Ct. App. 2000).
      </p>

       Where defendant drives through a village and he is committing no crime and violating no law, and where two men without possession of any authority undertake to stop him he continues wherein two men shoot at him or at his vehicle and where one of the men jumps into automobile and pursues him and during that pursuit he drives motor vehicle faster than legal speed limit, all as a result of then being pursued by one who had tried to shoot him or the vehicle in which he was riding, the defendant is not guilty of the crime of reckless driving of an automobile. Brown v. State, 227 Miss. 823, 87 So. 2d 84, 1956 Miss. LEXIS 758 (Miss. 1956).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence that state witness approached intersection at a speed of 15 or 20 miles per hour and that accused was approaching intersection from another direction at about the same speed and that accused neglected to be on a constant lookout to see the other vehicle in time to stop his car before striking it, did not establish reckless driving which would subject accused to conviction under this section [Code 1942, § 8175].

       In the absence of proof that accused was driving in a reckless manner or at a rate of speed such as to indicate a wilful or wanton disregard for the safety of persons or property, it is to be assumed that the presence of passengers for hire in his own car would indicate a contrary state of mind.

       The statute is not unconstitutionally vague as, although the language of the statute was broad, ordinary people could understand its meaning. United States v. Escalante, 239 F.3d 678, 2001 U.S. App. LEXIS 614 (5th Cir. Miss. 2001).

       This section is not unconstitutionally vague, notwithstanding the contention that the phrase “careless or imprudent manner” is vague and subjective and provides no objective criteria by which an individual is put on notice of what conduct the statute proscribes.

       The court properly instructed the jury with regard to careless, rather than reckless, driving where the defendant was cited for careless driving after he was stopped after an officer observed him driving 20 to 25 m.p.h. in a 35 m.p.h. zone and weaving between 2 northbound lanes.

   Because a police officer observed defendant’s vehicle cross the right lane fog line once, and then again approach or “bump” the fog line, and the video evidence from the officer’s car camera, while unclear, did not directly contradict the officer’s testimony, there was sufficient evidence that the officer had probable cause to believe that defendant had driven in a careless or imprudent manner, without due regard for the width and use of the streets and highways, and to stop defendant’s vehicle. Martin v. State, 240 So.3d 1047, 2017 Miss. LEXIS 424 (Miss. 2017), cert. denied, — U.S. —, <cite class="s_court">138 S. Ct. 2592</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">201 L.

      </p>
      <p>
       Testimony from the arresting officer that he observed defendant’s truck pass so close to a deputy that the outside mirror could have struck the officer and that the truck then ran off the road provided sufficient probable cause for a traffic stop based on careless driving. Ludwig v. State, 122 So.3d 1229, 2013 Miss. App. LEXIS 313 (Miss. Ct. App. 2013).

   Defendants’ convictions for possession of more than five kilograms of marijuana were appropriate because, under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c03s63-3-1213" target="_self">63-3-1213</a></cite>, defendants’ vehicle was seen driving in a careless or imprudent manner and the deputy had the authority to stop them. When defendants acted nervous, the deputy’s retrieval of a drug-detecting dog was appropriate and the drug-detecting dog’s positive alerts created probable cause for the deputy to search the trunk of the rental car. Shelton v. State, 45 So.3d 1203, 2010 Miss. App. LEXIS 141 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 49 So.3d 636, 2010 Miss. LEXIS 548 (Miss. 2010), cert. denied, 2010 Miss. LEXIS 553 (Miss. Oct. 21, 2010).

   Court could not say that it was clear that a police officer’s observation of a driver driving in the middle of two lanes did not or could not constitute a violation of Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c03s63-3-1213" target="_self">63-3-1213</a></cite>, nor could it say that there was no objective basis for the stop of the driver’s vehicle; thus the case was not one in which the officer acted without any objective reason or on the basis of a purely subjective feeling or “hunch.” On the contrary, the officer did have an objective, reasonable suspicion that the driver had committed the traffic violation of careless driving, even though he was ultimately acquitted of the careless driving charge. Adams v. City of Booneville, 910 So. 2d 720, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 217 (Miss. Ct. App. 2005).
      </p>

   There was probable cause for the stop of a driver’s vehicle because the time of night was very late (2:30 a.m.), the particular night, New Year’s Eve, was one on which persons were widely known to celebrate and often consume alcohol, and in the officer’s observation, the vehicle was traveling without due regard for the width and use of the highway by traveling in the middle of two lanes of traffic, and the reserve officer accompanying the officer saw the vehicle swerve. All of these circumstances served to bolster the conclusion that the driver appeared to the officer to be driving in violation of the careless driving statute, Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c03s63-3-1213" target="_self">63-3-1213</a></cite>. Adams v. City of Booneville, 910 So. 2d 720, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 217 (Miss. Ct. App. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court properly denied defendant’s motion to suppress cocaine found during a strip search conducted after defendant’s arrest for driving under the influence. There was probable cause for the traffic stop where a police officer witnessed the vehicle defendant was driving approach the curb twice; the presence or absence of traffic is not controlling to a determination of carelessness. Henderson v. State, 878 So. 2d 246, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 657 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).

   Defendant’s conviction for driving under the influence, first offense, in violation of Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c11s63-11-30ol11a" target="_self">63-11-30(1)(a)</a></cite>, was proper where there was probable cause for the stop because she had repeatedly crossed over the center line and that constituted careless driving pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c03s63-3-1213" target="_self">63-3-1213</a></cite>; thus, there was probable cause to believe that a traffic offense had been committed and defendant was properly stopped for further police action.

       Defendant’s convictions for driving under the influence of an intoxicating liquor, careless driving, and driving without a seatbelt were appropriate because defendant failed to raise any of the issues he complained of on appeal in his motion for a directed verdict or new trial and because the facts of the case provided sufficient evidence to convict.

       Evidence was sufficient to support defendant’s convictions of running a red light and careless driving where a police officer testified that she observed defendant drive his entire vehicle over a concrete median and saw him run a red light. Lobo v. City of Ridgeland, 135 So.3d 148, 2013 Miss. App. LEXIS 300 (Miss. Ct. App. 2013).
      </p>
      <p>
       Sufficient evidence supported defendant’s conviction for careless driving because a police sergeant, who responded to two independent calls from drivers who reported that defendant was driving carelessly, testified that defendant was kind of drifting from right to left, that it was pretty obvious that defendant could not maintain control of defendant’s vehicle to keep it in defendant’s direct lane, and that defendant did not stop when the sergeant turned on the police car’s blue lights and did not come to a complete stop at a stop sign.

       <p>
   In a case in which it was undisputed that the height of the load hauled by a trucking company exceeded twelve feet, six inches, in violation of Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c05s63-5-17" target="_self">63-5-17</a></cite>, the trucking company was not strictly liable for the damage to a car when the load snagged a telephone wire and caused a telephone company’s pole to fall and damage the car. The statute’s imposition of strict liability did not apply to claims for damage to “structures” other than the overhead structure or structure supporting the overhead wire, thus the statute was inapplicable to the claims for recovery for damage to the car or for personal injuries.” Moncrief v. Bennett Truck Transp., LLC, 631 F. Supp. 2d 841, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 46915 (S.D. Miss. 2009).

       This statute being remedial in nature, should be liberally construed, and since it does not identify the protected class or group of persons, and has no exclusions, and does not exclude one riding in a trailer, it can be assumed that it is a safety measure enacted for the benefit and protection of pedestrians, bystanders, motorists, and other individuals who reasonably might be expected to be affected by a violation of the statute, and that the plaintiff in a personal injury suit who was injured while riding in the trailer, was one of the class of persons which the statute was intended to protect.

       Given Legislative intent under this section to protect public from damage and injury resulting from runaway trailers which have separated from towing vehicle, provisions of statute requiring safety chain would be construed as applicable to trailer which was coupled with vehicle being towed in excess of 20 miles per hour even though vehicle and trailer were temporarily slowed to less than 20 miles per hour at which time trailer became uncoupled.

       The statute grants the Transportation Commission the authority to enact police and protective regulations for the control of traffic on the state highways, which may include setting limits that would have the effect of limiting truck traffic on certain highways for public safety reasons; however, the Commission should, in the exercise of this power, establish procedures and criteria for determining the necessity of any such action, and apply those procedures consistently.

     <p>
      Moreover, in addition to the per axle weight limitation specified by Section 63-5-27, the maximum load carried on a combination of vehicles shall be subject to the following additional limitations: The maximum load carried on any group of two (2) axles shall not exceed twenty-four thousand (24,000) pounds in instances where one or more of such axles is a driving axle (that is, an axle turned by the vehicle’s engine power).
     </p>
     <p>
      An axle group shall consist of any two (2) or more consecutive axles of any vehicle or combination of vehicles.

      Wheel, axle loads, spacing and weight by Sections 63-5-27 and 63-5-33, and

      Weight limitations on highways and bridges by Section 65-1-45, Mississippi Code of 1972, any product produced on or distributed from a location on any highway within or without the State of Mississippi may be transported from such place of production or location of distribution by the nearest route toward its destination on such highway or highways to a point where such highway intersects a highway previously found or hereafter found by the commission to be suitable to carry the maximum load limits pursuant to Sections 63-5-33 and 63-5-35; and provided further, that any goods, materials, and equipment actually used in the supply of an activity of producing, manufacturing or distributing products on any such highway within the State of Mississippi may be transported on such highway to the site of such manufacture, production or distribution. However, any penalty assessed against a vehicle operating under the provisions of this paragraph (3) (b) shall be calculated according to the maximum weight which that particular vehicle is legally permitted to transport and not the maximum gross weight limit established for that highway.
     </p>
     <p>
      Nothing herein contained shall be construed to permit movements of weights in excess of those provided for in this section (63-5-29) over a route or section thereof for the purpose of a shortcut between two (2) highways found by the commission to be suitable to carry the maximum load limits pursuant to Sections 63-5-33 and 63-5-35 or any other purpose not consistent with the aforementioned provisions.
     </p>
     <p>
      Nothing in Sections 63-5-29, and 63-5-34, shall be construed to imply any general variation from the maximum weight limitations designated by the Mississippi Department of Transportation other than specified in Sections 63-5-29 and 63-5-34.

       Subject to the limitations imposed on wheel and axle loads by Section 63-5-27, and to the further limitations hereinafter specified, the total combined weight (vehicles plus load) on any group of axles of a vehicle or a combination of vehicles shall not exceed the value given in the following table (Table III) corresponding to the distance in feet between the extreme axles of the group, measured longitudinally to the nearest foot, on those highways or parts of highways designated by the Mississippi Transportation Commission as being capable of carrying the maximum load limits and, in addition thereto, such other highways or parts of highways found by the commission to be suitable to carry the maximum load limits from an engineering standpoint, and so designated as such by order of the commission entered upon its minutes and published once each week for three (3) consecutive weeks in a daily newspaper published in this state and having a general circulation therein. The maximum total combined weight carried on any group of two (2) or more consecutive axles shall be determined by the formula contained in the Federal Weight Law enacted January 4, 1975, as follows: W=500 (LN/N-1+12N+36) where W=maximum weight in pounds carried on any group of two (2) or more axles computed to the nearest five hundred (500) pounds, L=distance in feet between the extremes of any group of two (2) or more consecutive axles, and N=number of axles in any group under consideration.

      The provisions of this section may be superseded by action of the Mississippi Transportation Commission, by resolution spread upon its minutes, for any specified segment of a state highway or bridge in accordance with the provisions set forth in Section 65-1-45, when, due to any special weather or other hazard, such highways or bridges have been weakened or when such highways have substandard surfacing or weak bridges due to any cause.
     </p>
     <p>
      This section shall not apply to situations in which its application would create a conflict with any length regulation or weight restriction imposed by federal law on the federal interstate highway system.

       Recovery against railroad company could not be sustained for death of truck driver occurring at night when he drove his truck into an unlighted railroad car on a railroad crossing, where if decedent had been observing the requirements contained in former enactment of this section (Code of 1930, § 5575), and of the law that a driver of a motor vehicle should decrease its speed to avoid colliding with any person, vehicle, or other conveyance on or entering a highway when special hazard exists with respect to pedestrians or other traffic or by reason of weather or highway conditions in approaching and crossing an intersection, the accident would not have occurred.

       In automobile collision case, erroneous instruction authorizing verdict for plaintiff if defendant was violating statute regarding headlights at time of accident held not cured by other instructions that evidence must show that statutory violation was proximate cause of injury, since instructions were so radically conflicting as to mislead jury.

       In action arising out of collision allegedly resulting from absence of headlights on defendant’s truck, instruction that verdict should be for plaintiff if collision occurred more than one-half hour after sunset held reversible error, since violation of statute would not make out absolute case of liability.

   Dismissal of a petition for post-conviction relief was reversed and remanded for an evidentiary hearing because defendant made a prima facie showing that his attorney was deficient in recommending a plea to a weapons charge since there was no probable cause to stop a car where one taillight was working under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c07s63-7-13" target="_self">63-7-13</a></cite>; however, there was no ineffective assistance of counsel shown based on a failure to explain an Alford plea or the failure to investigate.

     <p>
      When the department has reason to believe that an approved lighting device as being sold commercially does not comply with the requirements of this chapter, it may, after giving thirty days’ previous notice to the person holding the certificate of approval for such device in this state, conduct a hearing upon the question of compliance of said approved device. After said hearing the department shall determine whether said approved device meets the requirements of this chapter. If said device does not meet such requirements, it shall give notice to the person holding the certificate of approval for such device in this state.
     </p>
     <p>
      If after the expiration of ninety days after such notice the person holding the certificate of approval for such device has failed to satisfy the department that said approved device as thereafter to be sold meets the requirements of this chapter, the department shall suspend or revoke the approval issued therefor until or unless such device is resubmitted to and retested by an authorized testing agency and is found to meet the requirements of this chapter. The department may require that all said devices sold since the notification following the hearing be replaced with devices that do comply with the requirements of this chapter. The department may at the time of the retest purchase in the open market and submit to the testing agency one or more sets of such approved devices, and if such device upon such retest fails to meet the requirements of this chapter, the department may refuse to renew the certificate of approval of such device.

       Motorist invoking sudden emergency rule must prove that his car had brake equipment required by this section [Code 1942, § 8249], that in exercise of reasonable care he could not have known of any defects therein, that he made reasonable effort to use both braking systems, that both failed, or that on failure of foot brakes he could not have stopped with the emergency brakes, and that after the emergency arose he exercised the care of a reasonable prudent driver.

       An instruction calling for a court ruling that the driver of a truck which struck a car ahead, halted by a traffic light, when the brakes failed to hold, was negligent as a matter of law, is properly refused as lacking the qualification that the failure of the brakes must have been attributable to negligence.

       In an action against the driver by a share-the-expense guest for injuries allegedly sustained when the automobile foot brake failed to function properly resulting in the driver’s automobile colliding with the rear of another automobile which had come to a stop, a sudden emergency instruction was erroneous which assumed by the use of the words “failure of the defendant’s brakes” that there was evidence in the record upon which the jury might find that both braking systems were defective, when in fact there was no evidence to show that the emergency brake was in any way defective, and which omitted entirely the statement that after the emergency arose, the defendant exercised such care as a reasonably prudent and capable driver would use under the unusual circumstances.

      <p>
       In a wrongful death action arising out of defendant’s automobile colliding with a bicycle ridden by a nine-year-old child upon the highway, the jury’s verdict for defendant was against the overwhelming weight of the evidence where it appeared that the road in the vicinity of the accident was straight and defendant’s view was entirely unobstructed, and defendant testified that he had seen the boy for a distance of several hundred feet before overtaking him, and yet had not sounded his horn nor applied his brakes until he was within 12 or 15 feet of the boy, when it was too late to avoid hitting him.

       In an action for injuries sustained in a collision which occurred when the defendant motorist was attempting to overtake the plaintiff motorcyclist, an instruction that if the defendant had a right to pass the plaintiff, and he was not speeding, he was not required by law to blow his horn unless the plaintiff was at the time giving a signal indicating his intention to turn from a straight path of travel, was erroneous, where it was undisputed that at the time the defendant attempted to overtake the plaintiff the motorcycle was rapidly slowing down, since such activity of the motorcyclist would have indicated to a reasonable and prudent man situated in a following vehicle traveling at a rapid rate of speed that it was reasonably necessary to insure safe operation to give audible warning with his horn. McHale v. Daniel, 233 So. 2d 764, 1970 Miss. LEXIS 1666 (Miss. 1970).

      <p>
       Instruction to the effect that constable in pursuit of reckless driver, sounding his siren, was entitled to assume that other drivers would yield right of way, held, in view of other instructions on proximate cause and duty to have regard to safety of others, no error.

      </p>
      <p>
       There being no statute imposing a duty upon the driver of an overtaking vehicle the absolute duty of sounding an audible signal before passing without regard to whether the sounding of the signal is reasonably necessary to insure safe operation, an instruction that such was the law constituted reversible error where the proof was uncontradicted that the driver of the overtaking vehicle in which plaintiff was riding, did not sound his horn before attempting to pass defendant’s vehicle, since it in effect peremptorily instructed the jury that the driver of the overtaking vehicle was guilty of negligence. Clark v. Mask, 232 Miss. 65, 98 So. 2d 467, 1957 Miss. LEXIS 445 (Miss. 1957).
      </p>
      <p>
       The court erred in instructing that if a nine-year-old boy, riding a bicycle on the highway, was aware of the approach of the defendant’s automobile, or that the actions of the boy while riding on the highway were such that reasonably led the defendant to believe that the child had noticed and was fully aware of the approach of his automobile, the defendant was under no legal duty to sound his horn and continue sounding his horn at short and frequent intervals when approaching the child, where there was no showing which warranted a finding that the boy was aware of the approach of the automobile prior to the time the defendant had sounded his horn when he was only 12 or 15 feet from the child.

       In action arising out of collision between vehicle driven by plaintiff’s decedent and disabled truck stopped in middle of roadway, plaintiff was not entitled to negligence per se instruction under statute barring operation of trucks during nighttime hours without proper warning devices; although neither stopped truck nor another truck attempting to start it had safety devices, plaintiff failed to establish time component of statute, i.e., whether half hour had passed since sunset at time of accident.

       Truck driver’s violation of this statute was negligence per se where, after his truck became disabled on a highway outside a business or residential district, he placed two reflectors within fifty feet of his vehicle and, instead of placing the third reflector on the roadway side, placed it by the rear of the truck away from the road.

       The contention that an emergency situation created when the driver of a tractor-trailer was stopped in such a position that the rig blocked both lanes of a two-lane highway while attempting a U-turn did not permit sufficient time for the placing of flares as required by this section [Code 1942, § 8256] was not tenable, for it was the driver’s original negligence in attempting an illegal maneuver which created the emergency.

       Where defendant’s truck became partially disabled because of water damage to engine and was proceeding slowly ahead of plaintiff’s automobile, which was struck in the rear by an overtaking truck, and the forward movement of defendant’s truck was halted for very brief intervals, the defendant was not guilty of negligence per se in not putting out flares or warnings so required by this section [Code 1942, § 8256].

      <p>
       This section [Code 1942, § 8256] has no application to a wrecker which was engaged in its normal use on a highway and was in no sense disabled and where the court gave instruction to the contrary, in an action against owners of wrecker for damages sustained when plaintiff’s automobile at night crashed into the rear end of a disabled automobile which wrecker was engaged in rescuing, this instruction was in error.

       In an action for personal injuries where the plaintiff’s car ran into the defendant’s truck parked on the highway without any flares or fusees or other signals on the highway to the rear of the truck, the court did not err in giving instruction that the failure of defendant to place flares, fusees and other signals on the highway to the rear of the truck, was contrary to the law of the state of Mississippi and defendant was negligent.

       A defendant must inform the court either orally or in writing postmarked on or before the date listed on the citation that he/she plans on attending a traffic safety violator course or he/she becomes ineligible to have the violation removed from his/her record as authorized by this section.

       A court may supply to a defendant a list of the courses that have been approved by the court and allow the defendant to choose which course to attend from that list. O’Brien, Oct. 18, 2002, A.G. Op. #02-0598.
      </p>
      <p>
       The affidavit required by this section may be acknowledged by the court clerk or judge or any individual who has the authority to acknowledge an oath. Cruber, Oct. 18, 2002, A.G. Op. #02-0599.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is the defendant’s choice whether he/she will attend the traffic safety violator course, if he/she is eligible; if the court determines that the defendant is not eligible to attend the traffic safety violator course, the court should process the traffic ticket in the normal course of business.

       Formal requisites of affidavit are title, venue, signature, jurat, and authentication, but essentials are that it is in writing and that it is sworn to by some legally authorized officer; .traffic ticket form, i.e. affidavit, when sworn to shall be read and considered as whole, which would include parts in issue, i.e. (State of Mississippi, County of), (location) and (highway/Street).

       Although Miss. Code Section 21-23-7 requires complaint filed in municipal court to state statute or ordinance relied upon, Uniform Traffic Ticket Law, Miss. Code Section 63-9-21(2), constitutes exception thereto for traffic violations. Baker, Feb. 10, 1993, A.G. Op. #93-0035.

       On traffic ticket, it is required by Miss. Code Section 63-9-21(3)(c) that county of infraction be written on blank signifying location. Bonds, Apr. 7, 1993, A.G. Op. #93-0101.

       Under Uniform Traffic Ticket Law, Miss. Code Section 63-9-21, copy of official document is usable when copy is duly sworn to, as was original. Cooke, June 9, 1993, A.G. Op. #93-0239.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 63-9-21 is the Uniform Traffic Ticket Law and states that the State Auditor and the Attorney General shall prescribe a uniform traffic ticket. Upon notification by the State Auditor’s Office, the city clerk should have the new tickets printed and collect all of the old tickets from the municipal law enforcement officers. Thompson, October 11, 1996, A.G. Op. #96-0678.
      </p>
      <p>
       As long as the municipality’s ticket conforms to the requirements of Section 63-9-21, which is known as the Uniform Traffic Ticket Law, the designation of the Town of Burnsville as the “City of Burnsville” does not deprive the municipal court of jurisdiction. Such a scrivener’s error does not deprive the individual issued the ticket of notice concerning the jurisdiction of the municipal court. Therefore, the Town of Burnsville may continue to issue the citations already printed up but, any newly printed tickets should properly identify Burnsville as a town and not a city. Cadle, December 13, 1996, A.G. Op. #96-0725.

       A patrol officer appointed as a deputy court clerk may not administer an oath of affidavit to himself or herself for traffic citations issued by that officer, and each citation must be sworn to separately to be considered an affidavit. Pickens, July 3, 1997, A.G. Op. #97-0365.
      </p>
      <p>
       Original traffic tickets must be retained for at least two years and, while there are no prescribed means or methods of destruction or notification prior to destruction of such tickets after two years, nor any requirements for record keeping past two years, reference should be made to the Local Government Records Committee to ascertain whether there are any schedules mandating retention for a longer time.

       Policemen acting in their capacity as employees of a city must use traffic tickets issued by that city and identifying that city’s municipal court as the court

      <p>
       A traffic ticket that contains the information set forth in Section 63-9-21 constitutes a “sworn affidavit” as referred to in Section 21-23-7(1) when the officer who issues the ticket has it properly attested and filed with the proper court; a criminal affidavit can be acknowledged by any person authorized by law to administer oaths and this would include a court clerk or deputy court clerk from another jurisdiction or a notary public. Aldridge, Apr. 1, 2005, A.G. Op. 05-0111.

       Town provided defendant with charging instruments because the two traffic tickets a police officer issued to defendant met the requirements established by the statute; in addition, the town supplemented its discovery disclosures and explicitly informed defendant that he was charged with operating a motor vehicle without a valid driver’s license and failing to maintain or provide proof of insurance. Caissie v. State, 254 So.3d 849, 2018 Miss. App. LEXIS 110 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 254 So.3d 170, 2018 Miss. LEXIS 410 (Miss. 2018).

   Traffic citation issued to defendant constituted a sworn affidavit and thus provided jurisdiction to both a municipal court and a circuit court to hear a charge of DUI despite a failure to include a court date as required by Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c09s63-9-21ol13c" target="_self">63-9-21(3)(c)</a></cite>, because defendant had actual knowledge of the date and the citation had been amended to include it.

      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Citation charging defendant with DUI was not flawed because it contained a P. O. box address for the municipal court rather than a physical address; Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c09s63-9-21" target="_self">63-9-21</a></cite> did not require that a traffic citation contain the court’s physical address. Godbold v.

   Citation charging defendant with driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor indicated an arraignment date, but did not indicate whether it would be a.m. or p.m.; the omission did not render the citation defective under Miss.

   Citation charging defendant with driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor was not defective because it listed the incorrect municipal court address; Miss.

Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c09s63-9-21ol13c" target="_self">63-9-21(3)(c)</a></cite> was contained on the traffic citation issued to defendant, and because there was no requirement that the address of the municipal court be contained on the ticket, the sworn complaint requirement of Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.21.html#t21c23s21-23-7" target="_blank">21-23-7</a></cite> was met, and the municipal court had jurisdiction over defendant’s prosecution.

      </p>
      <p>
       Fact that an older citation form was issued to defendant in a DUI case did not mean that it was insufficient just because it was not a uniform traffic ticket since the issuing municipality had obtained new tickets; moreover, the law applicable to defendant’s case involving the standards for operators of commercial vehicles had not changed. Scott v. City of Booneville, 962 So. 2d 698, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 185 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 968 So. 2d 948, 2007 Miss. LEXIS 637 (Miss. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       Fact that a traffic ticket issued in a driving under the influence case had a scrivener’s error regarding the date of offense did not render it ineffective under Miss. Unif. Cir. & Cty. R. 7.06 because defendant was put on notice of the date of the offense by the fact that the date was correct on the other two citations he was issued. Scott v. City of Booneville, 962 So. 2d 698, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 185 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 968 So. 2d 948, 2007 Miss. LEXIS 637 (Miss. 2007).

Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c09s63-9-21" target="_self">63-9-21</a></cite> does not state that a citation must contain the address of a court; therefore, the fact that a traffic ticket in a DUI case had the wrong court address did not render it ineffective because it stated that the arraignment was to take place in a specific court. Scott v. City of Booneville, 962 So. 2d 698, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 185 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 968 So. 2d 948, 2007 Miss. LEXIS 637 (Miss. 2007).

Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c11s63-11-30" target="_self">63-11-30</a></cite> over his objection to irregularities in the “copy” of the citation/affidavit he received because, although defendant did not have an exact blood alcohol content (BAC) reading listed on the copy of the citation that he received, he was nevertheless aware that his BAC level was above that allowable for individuals under the legal age to purchase alcohol; thus, defendant’s traffic ticket complied with Miss.

       Pursuant to Section 1-1-109, the Joint Legislative Committee on Compilation, Revision and Publication of Legislation corrected a typographical error in (1). The letter “s” was deleted from the end of the word “offenses” so that “except for the offenses of driving while under the influence of intoxicating liquors, drugs or narcotics” now reads as “except for the offense of driving while under the influence of intoxicating liquors, drugs or narcotics.” The Joint Committee ratified the correction at its May 16, 2002 meeting.

      <p>
       If a police officer has probable cause to believe that an individual is driving under the influence on the state fairgrounds in violation of Section 63-11-30, the officer may stop the individual and charge the violator accordingly; however, if the operator of the vehicle refuses to submit to a chemical test, it must be shown that the vehicle was being operated on the public highways, public roads, and streets of the state before the violator can be subjected to the penalties of Section 63-11-5.

       There was no authority in support of the defendant’s contention that the officer must arrest the individual before administering the breath test. Green v. State, 710 So. 2d 862, 1998 Miss. LEXIS 143 (Miss. 1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       As long as there is probable cause to believe that the person is impaired by some substance, an officer has acted in accordance with the statute, and consequently, the results of a blood alcohol concentration tests are admissible.

       The statutes under the Implied Consent Law allow not only a chemical test or tests of a person’s breath, but also other tests of a person’s blood or urine for determining alcoholic content; all 3 methods-breath, blood and urine tests-are valid tests for determining alcoholic content in a person’s body which would impair that person’s ability to operate a motor vehicle.

      </h4>
      <p>
       Defendant’s breathalyzer tests were admissible because (1) an officer testified defendant was observed for at least 20 minutes before the test was administered, and (2) any dispute about the officer’s testimony went to weight and credibility, not admissibility. Prince v. State, 225 So.3d 545, 2017 Miss. App. LEXIS 289 (Miss. Ct. App. 2017).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant’s conviction for driving under the influence did not deprive defendant of a protected property right when an officer allegedly did not observe defendant for the required 20-minute period before administering a breath test because (1) it was not error to find defendant was observed for the mandatory period, and (2) defendant had no protected property right in defendant’s driving privilege. Gore v. State, 168 So.3d 1097, 2013 Miss. App. LEXIS 842 (Miss. Ct. App. 2013), cert. denied, 146 So.3d 981, 2014 Miss. LEXIS 450 (Miss. 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       It was not error to accept an officer’s testimony that the officer observed defendant for the required 20 minutes before administering a breath test because (1) the officer’s conversation with defendant’s wife took no significant amount of time, and (2) defendant was in the officer’s presence and observed by other officers. Gore v. State, 168 So.3d 1097, 2013 Miss. App. LEXIS 842 (Miss. Ct. App. 2013), cert. denied, 146 So.3d 981, 2014 Miss. LEXIS 450 (Miss. 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       The length of time that a person charged with driving under the influence must be observed prior to the administration of the breath test is mandatory. By statute, that length of time is 15 minutes; however, police procedure requires that the person be observed for 20 minutes. The observation itself can be performed as long as the defendant is in the presence of the officer. The officer is not required to “stare at” the defendant for the observation to be effective. A dispute as to whether the observation lasted the mandatory length of time or whether the observation was performed while in the presence of an officer goes to the weight of the testimony and the credibility of the witnesses. Fisher v. Eupora, 587 So. 2d 878, 1991 Miss. LEXIS 669 (Miss. 1991).

   Where defendant was convicted of first offense DUI, the trial court did not err by admitting the tests results from the Intoxilizer 8000, which showed a .11 blood alcohol content; the test began 27 minutes after the observation period began, well beyond the statutorily-required 15-minute waiting period set forth in Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c11s63-11-5ol11" target="_self">63-11-5(1)</a></cite>, and proper procedures were followed, the administrator of the test was certified to perform the test, and the machine had been properly certified. Godbold v. Water Valley, 962 So. 2d 133, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 504 (Miss. Ct. App. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   In a suit by a minor driver against a medical insurer seeking coverage for injuries suffered in a one-car accident, the minor’s excessive blood alcohol level was not inadmissible under the implied consent law because the blood test was taken by a hospital and was admissible under Miss. Code. Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c11s63-11-5" target="_self">63-11-5</a></cite>. Allen v. Clarendon Nat'l Ins. Co., 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 64602 (S.D. Miss. Sept. 8, 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       Officer testified that approximately 45 minutes passed from the time he encountered defendant until the time the breathalyzer test was run, that defendant was in his presence the entire time and was not allowed to take anything by mouth during that time; the trial judge properly held the evidence to be admissible, and the jury found the testimony of the officer to be credible on this question. Graham v. State, 878 So. 2d 162, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 54 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 878 So. 2d 67, 2004 Miss. LEXIS 922 (Miss. 2004).

       <p>
   Pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c11s63-11-5" target="_self">63-11-5</a></cite>, the officer properly read defendant his rights before attempting to administer the intoxilyzer test and obtaining a blood alcohol content reading. Palmer v. City of Oxford, 860 So. 2d 1203, 2003 Miss. LEXIS 757 (Miss. 2003).
      </p>

   The language “chemical test or test of his breath,” as provided in §§<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c11s63-11-5" target="_self">63-11-5</a></cite> and<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c11s63-11-30" target="_self">63-11-30</a></cite>, contemplates the use of an intoxilyzer machine as a proper means of measuring alcohol content of the blood; as long as accuracy, reliability, and all other factors questioning the competency of the test as proof of intoxication are complied with by the administering officers, the proof thereunder is admissible. Fulton v. City of Starkville, 645 So. 2d 910, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 533 (Miss. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   A defendant’s arrest for driving while intoxicated was legal, and therefore the subsequent intoxilyzer test was not tainted, even though the arresting officer did not observe the defendant driving, where the defendant admitted to the arresting officer that he had been driving an automobile which was involved in an accident, and the defendant was publicly intoxicated in the presence of the officer and others in violation of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.97.html#t97c29s97-29-47" target="_blank">97-29-47</a></cite>. Goforth v. Ridgeland, 603 So. 2d 323, 1992 Miss. LEXIS 348 (Miss. 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       An officer’s failure to inform the defendant that he had a right to refuse the officer’s request for a blood sample did not render the test results inadmissable in a manslaughter prosecution against the defendant where the officer had probable cause to obtain the blood sample in that the officer knew that the defendant was the driver of an automobile which had collided head on with another vehicle, the collision occurred on a straight and level highway when the road condition was dry, the officer knew that at least two people were dead in the vehicle which the defendant hit, the officer had observed a beer in the defendant’s vehicle, and the defendant had slurred speech and dilated pupils. For a search which would otherwise be illegal, absent consent, knowledgeable waiver of one’s constitutional right not to be searched is guaranteed by Article 3, § 23 of the Mississippi Constitution. However, blood searches which are based upon probable cause are not illegal, and, therefore, the question of the defendant’s knowledgeable waiver was not relevant. Longstreet v. State, 592 So. 2d 16, 1991 Miss. LEXIS 840 (Miss. 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       A conviction for driving under the influence may be based upon intoxilyzer results if the test is administered in accordance with the proper procedures and the defendant fails to introduce credible evidence which overcomes the statutory presumption of intoxication. Thus, defendants could be convicted on the basis of a breath test which presumed a 2100 to 1 breath to blood ratio where the defendants did not introduce any evidence concerning their particular ratios. Fisher v. Eupora, 587 So. 2d 878, 1991 Miss. LEXIS 669 (Miss. 1991).

   Trial court did not err in giving its instruction on defendant’s refusal to submit to a breath test as the instruction tracked the language of Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c11s63-11-5" target="_self">63-11-5</a></cite> (Supp. 2012) and did not violate defendant’s U.S. Const. amend. V prosecution against self-incrimination. Merritt v. State, 127 So.3d 1150, 2013 Miss. App. LEXIS 431 (Miss. Ct. App. 2013), cert. denied, 131 So.3d 577, 2014 Miss. LEXIS 14 (Miss. 2014).

       A jury instruction that “a person who operates a motor vehicle over the public roads of this state has given his or her implied consent to submit to the test administered using the Intoxilyzer 5000 to determine the person’s blood alcohol content” did not improperly emphasize one piece of evidence over the rest, thereby helping the state by implication by focusing the jury’s attention on defendant’s refusal to submit to the test.

       Two officers smelled alcohol emanating from defendant’s vehicle; he admitted that he had consumed alcohol, and he refused to perform sobriety tests. Under the evidence, defendant was guilty of driving under the influence by virtue of the implied consent law. Havard v. State, 911 So. 2d 991, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 697 (Miss. Ct. App. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       A city was not liable to a man who was arrested for public intoxication and placed in a drunk tank, even though he was never given an intoxication test and even though it was later determined that he had in fact suffered a stroke, where there was no evidence that the city had either tacitly or explicitly encouraged the improper arrest and detention of stroke victims on charges of public drunkenness and where there was no showing that the city had been reckless or grossly negligent in its training, supervising, or disciplining of the officers or jailers involved in plaintiff’s arrest and detention; although state law required that an intoximeter test must be given to those arrested for driving while intoxicated, such test was not required for those arrested merely for public drunkenness and liability would not attach on the basis of the city’s policy against giving the test to persons in plaintiff’s situation.

      If any person be unconscious or dead as a result of an accident, or unconscious at the time of arrest or apprehension or when the test is to be administered, or is otherwise in a condition rendering him incapable of refusal, such person shall be subjected to a blood test for the purpose of determining the alcoholic content of his blood as provided in this chapter, if the arresting officer has reasonable grounds to believe the person to have been driving a motor vehicle upon the public highways, public roads and streets of this state while under the influence of intoxicating liquor. The results of such test or tests, however, shall not be used in evidence against such person in any court or before any regulatory body without the consent of the person so tested, or, if deceased, such person’s legal representative. However, refusal of release of evidence so obtained by such officer or agency will in criminal actions against such person result in the suspension of his or her driver’s license for a period of ninety days as provided in this chapter for conscious and capable persons who have refused to submit to such test. Blood may only be withdrawn under the provisions of Section 63-11-9. It is the intent of this chapter that blood samples taken under this section shall be used exclusively for statistical evaluation of accident causes with safeguards established to protect the identity of such victims and to extend the rights of privileged communications to those engaged in taking, handling and evaluating such statistical evidence.

   Although defendant argued the circuit court committed reversible error when it admitted blood-sample test results into evidence in violation of the statutory privileges afforded in the Implied Consent Act, defendant’s constitutional challenge was moot, as his blood was not taken pursuant to the Implied Consent Act. Whitaker v. State, 146 So.3d 333, 2014 Miss. LEXIS 321 (Miss. 2014), cert. denied, — U.S. —, <cite class="s_court">135 S. Ct. 1165</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">190 L.

   Blood alcohol test results were admissible in civil case when performed on driver who died as result of accident, both because decedent’s representative waived statutory protection and results of test were submitted in defense of person tested, Miss Code §§<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c11s63-11-7" target="_self">63-11-7</a></cite> and<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c11s63-11-43" target="_self">63-11-43</a></cite> [repealed] (1972) being intended to protect interests of person submitted to blood alcohol test.

       Blood alcohol test administered as part of medical treatment is admissible in civil action where driver from whom blood is taken has made contractual waiver of physician-patient privilege. Edwards v. Ellis, 478 So. 2d 282, 1985 Miss. LEXIS 2262 (Miss. 1985).

   Even if state failed to comply with Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c11s63-11-7" target="_self">63-11-7</a></cite>, defendant’s argument that the test results were therefore inadmissible was misplaced since admissibility of evidence is governed by the Mississippi Rules of Evidence, not by statutory enactment.

   The results of a blood alcohol content test, which was performed on a defendant pursuant to §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c11s63-11-7" target="_self">63-11-7</a></cite> while he was semi-conscious in a hospital, were admissible in a criminal action against the defendant, even though the statute provides that the results of such tests shall not be used in evidence against the person without the person’s consent, since the statutory exclusion yielded to the Mississippi Rules of Evidence, under which admission of the blood test results was permissible. Whitehurst v. State, 540 So. 2d 1319, 1989 Miss. LEXIS 136 (Miss. 1989).
      </p>
      <p>
       Results of blood-alcohol test performed on defendant after automobile accident resulting in death of 2 people were admissible where officers at scene of accident smelled alcohol and saw several beer cans and whiskey bottle on floorboard, at hospital informed defendant that he was being charged with 2 counts of manslaughter, read defendant his rights, and requested and obtained his consent for blood sample; evidence was sufficient to provide probable cause to search for and seize evidence of intoxication; contention of defendant that test results should not have been admissible because evidence indicated he was unable to consent was rejected, although testimony showed that defendant was belligerent and slurred his speech, was unco-operative, and unsuccessfully resisted efforts to procure blood sample. Whitley v. State, 511 So. 2d 929, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2691 (Miss. 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a prosecution for involuntary manslaughter arising out of a traffic accident, in which the defendant contended that the deceased caused the accident by suddenly turning into the defendant’s lane of traffic, the trial court committed reversible error in refusing to permit the introduction into evidence of the results of the blood alcohol test given to the deceased. This section does not prohibit the use of such evidence, over the objection of the legal representative, in favor of an accused in a criminal trial. McNamee v. State, 313 So. 2d 392, 1975 Miss.

       An example where four persons were killed in a 32 car pile-up, under Section 63-11-8, such a multi-vehicle accident may be considered to be several “accidents,” only one of which accident “resulted in a death.” The officer may, through his investigation, determine which drivers were involved in the particular accident that resulted in a death, and limit blood testing to those drivers. Perkins, August 23, 1995, A.G. Op. #95-0563.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 63-11-8 does not require a vehicle operator to pay for a blood test. The test is administered in order to provide evidence for a possible prosecution. Costs of prosecution are to be paid for by the county and would include a blood test. Perkins, August 23, 1995, A.G. Op. #95-0563.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a law enforcement officer requests a qualified person to withdraw blood under the statute and a qualified person draws blood, the person who is qualified to withdraw blood can not be held civilly or criminally liable as the result of the proper administration of a blood test when requested in writing by a law enforcement officer to administer such a test.
   Head, April 24, 1998, A.G. Op. #98-0200.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a person qualified to withdraw blood refuses to do so, that person may not be charged with the crime under the statute. Head, April 24, 1998, A.G. Op. #98-0200.
      </p>
      <p>
       If an operator of a motor vehicle involved in an accident that results in a death is taken out of state for treatment, a law enforcement officer may request the out of state medical personnel draw blood to be used to test alcohol or drug content; however, the medical personnel are under no obligation to honor that request.
   Head, April 24, 1998, A.G. Op. #98-0200.
      </p>
      <p>
       The operator of any motor vehicle involved in an accident that results in a death must be tested for the purpose of determining the alcohol content or drug content of such operator’s blood, breath, or urine, and there is no requirement that an officer have reasonable grounds to believe that the driver is impaired.

       Proper predicate was laid for the introduction of the blood-alcohol-content test results showing that approximately two hours after the accident, a defendant had a blood-alcohol concentration of .09 percent, where the results were admitted into evidence at trial through a forensic toxicologist who tested the sample and where there was extensive testimony about the forensic toxicologist’s qualifications to perform the tests and about the lab’s procedures and protocols.

       Defendant’s conviction of driving under the influence causing death was appropriate because there was no evidence that police officers deliberately delayed defendant’s blood alcohol test, as they had acted immediately in obtaining a subpoena and traveling to Memphis to get a blood sample from defendant, and there was no evidence that defendant was prejudiced by the delay. Moreover, while probable cause existed to test defendant, probable cause did not exist to test the other driver. Andino v. State, 125 So.3d 700, 2013 Miss. App. LEXIS 715 (Miss. Ct. App. 2013).
      </p>
      <p>
       Court did not err by denying defendant’s motion to suppress her blood test results as her blood was not drawn until three hours after the accident because the evidence showed that the officer was not immediately aware that defendant was under the influence, and he was not immediately aware of her involvement in the accident. Further delay was caused by the time it took for the tow truck to arrive, the travel time to the police station, and the travel time to the hospital. Teston v. State, 44 So.3d 977, 2008 Miss. App. LEXIS 681 (Miss. Ct. App. 2008), cert. dismissed, 44 So.3d 969, 2010 Miss. LEXIS 520 (Miss. 2010).
      </p>
      <p>
       The results of a blood test performed two and one-half to three hours after an accident were properly introduced into evidence as there was no evidence of deliberate delay on the part of the arresting officers and the time lapse was in no way prejudicial to the defendant. Wash v. State, 790 So. 2d 856, 2001 Miss. App. LEXIS 69 (Miss. Ct. App. 2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       The administration of a blood test within two and 1/2 hours after an accident constituted substantial compliance with statute where the delay was caused by travel time to a hospital and waiting for a nurse to obtain permission from her supervisor to perform the test. Wilkerson v. State, 731 So. 2d 1173, 1998 Miss. LEXIS 548 (Miss. 1998).

   Although defendant argued that the State did not provide evidence that a nurse was qualified to draw defendant’s blood pursuant to this section, this issue could be dismissed because the Implied Consent Act was not the basis for obtaining the blood sample. Whitaker v. State, 146 So.3d 333, 2014 Miss. LEXIS 321 (Miss. 2014), cert. denied, — U.S. —, <cite class="s_court">135 S. Ct. 1165</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">190 L.

   Even if the State failed to comply with Miss.

   Miss.

Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c11s63-11-39ol12" target="_self">63-11-39(2)</a></cite>, which authorized admission of “any other competent evidence” bearing upon the issue of whether a person was intoxicated; clearly “any other test,” properly administered under appropriate procedures and designed to determine the alcohol or drug content of one’s blood or urine, constitutes other competent evidence. Jones v. State, 881 So. 2d 209, 2002 Miss. App. LEXIS 869 (Miss. Ct. App. 2002), aff'd, 2003 Miss. LEXIS 588 (Miss. Oct. 30, 2003).

   Trial court did not err in refusing to exclude the results of defendant’s urine analysis performed by a hospital employee simply because the employee did not hold a valid permit from the State Crime Laboratory (Mississippi) pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c11s63-11-19" target="_self">63-11-19</a></cite>; because the employee, who had 40 years experience, was clearly qualified to perform the analysis at issue, and defendant did not question the credibility of the test or the procedures used by the employee in performing the analysis, the court found that the test was reasonable and the results admissible under Miss. Code Ann. §§<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c11s63-11-39" target="_self">63-11-39</a></cite>,<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c11s63-11-13" target="_self">63-11-13</a></cite>. Jones v.

   Defendant’s conviction for vehicular homicide was affirmed where the appellate court found that a hospital employee’s analysis of his urine that showed defendant had cocaine in his system at the time of the fatal accident was properly admitted even though the employee was not licensed by the State crime laboratory; while Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c11s63-11-13" target="_self">63-11-13</a></cite> addressed tests offered by the accused, it would constitute an anomaly in the law to allow the accused to present evidence of the test analysis done by a person who was not licensed by the State crime laboratory, while, at the same time, preventing the State from using such analysis.

       While the State’s expert was accepted as an expert in toxicology, there was no testimony that she was in any way involved in the testing of defendant’s blood specimen or that she was actively involved in the production of the report and had intimate knowledge of the analyses even though she did not perform the tests first hand, and the trial court erred in admitting the test results without evidence that the expert actually performed the test or participated in its analysis; however, because overwhelming evidence was presented to the jury that defendant was intoxicated, this error was harmless. Debrow v. State, 972 So. 2d 550, 2007 Miss. LEXIS 647 (Miss. 2007).
      </p>

       <p>
   Consistent with 36 CFR § 4.2, federal law preempts state law on the issue of intoxicated motor-vehicle operators within national park areas, and courts are not bound to follow state law, such as Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c11s63-11-19" target="_self">63-11-19</a></cite>, when interpreting 36 CFR § 4.23. United States v. Jackson, 470 F. Supp. 2d 654, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4868 (S.D. Miss. 2007), aff'd, 273 Fed. Appx. 372, 2008 U.S. App. LEXIS 7811 (5th Cir. Miss. 2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       Forensic toxicologist provided testimony on how the gas chromatograph operated and how it was calibrated before and after each test. He also established that the machine was run in accordance with crime lab procedures; thus, defendant’s claims that the trial court should not have allowed the admission of the blood test results because the result was not achieved within the methods adopted by the Mississippi Commissioner of Public Safety was without merit. Lawrence v. State, 931 So. 2d 600, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 552 (Miss. Ct. App. 2005), cert. denied, 933 So. 2d 303, 2006 Miss. LEXIS 345 (Miss. 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       Certificates of intoxilyzer calibration were an example of a public record, the authentication of which was contemplated by Miss. R. Evid. 901(b)(7); because defendant did not contest that the certificates came from the county jail, they satisfied the authentication requirements of Rule 901(b)(7) and were properly admissible. Pulliam v. State, 856 So. 2d 461, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 299 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 859 So. 2d 1017, 2003 Miss. LEXIS 595 (Miss. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       Certification of the intoxilyzer machines have to take place at least quarterly. Meeks v. State, 800 So. 2d 1281, 2001 Miss. App. LEXIS 501 (Miss. Ct. App. 2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       The statutes under the Implied Consent Law allow not only a chemical test or tests of a person’s breath, but also other tests of a person’s blood or urine for determining alcoholic content; all 3 methods-breath, blood and urine tests-are valid tests for determining alcoholic content in a person’s body which would impair that person’s ability to operate a motor vehicle. Fulton v. City of Starkville, 645 So. 2d 910, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 533 (Miss. 1994).

       County court did not err in admitting breath-test results because the State met the requirements of the statute during a policy officer’s testimony; the officer testified that he waited at least twenty minutes before administering the breath test to defendant, and a two-year permit issued by the Mississippi Department of Public Safety to the officer authorized him to conduct analyses of breath specimens to determine alcohol content. Bratcher v. State, 193 So.3d 639, 2015 Miss. App. LEXIS 539 (Miss. Ct. App. 2015), cert. denied, 202 So.3d 1268, 2016 Miss. LEXIS 268 (Miss. 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       Breath-test results were properly admitted in defendant’s trial for vehicular manslaughter while driving under the influence because an officer who conducted the testify was certified, and the officer properly had defendant observed for 20 minutes, although the officer did not personally observe defendant for the full 20 minute period. Hudspeth v. State, 28 So.3d 600, 2009 Miss. App. LEXIS 244 (Miss. Ct. App. 2009), cert. denied, 27 So.3d 404, 2010 Miss. LEXIS 89 (Miss. 2010).
      </p>
      <p>
       Proper predicate was laid for the introduction of the blood-alcohol-content test results showing that approximately two hours after the accident, a defendant had a blood-alcohol concentration of .09 percent, where the results were admitted into evidence at trial through a forensic toxicologist who tested the sample and where there was extensive testimony about the forensic toxicologist’s qualifications to perform the tests and about the lab’s procedures and protocols. Lepine v. State, 10 So.3d 927, 2009 Miss. App. LEXIS 91 (Miss. Ct. App. 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Defendant’s conviction for driving under the influence of alcohol, in violation of 36 CFR § 4.23 was supported by sufficient evidence where testimony showed that the Intoxilyzer machine on which defendant was tested was accurate and the tests on defendant, which showed results of .099 and .084, were properly administered; the certification requirements in Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c11s63-11-19" target="_self">63-11-19</a></cite> did not apply because defendant was convicted under federal law, not Mississippi law. United States v. Jackson, 470 F. Supp. 2d 654, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4868 (S.D. Miss. 2007), aff'd, 273 Fed. Appx. 372, 2008 U.S. App. LEXIS 7811 (5th Cir. Miss. 2008).

      <p>
       <p>
   State had to prove as part of its authenticity burden that defendant’s breath test was performed by an individual possessing a valid permit issued by the State Crime Laboratory for making such analysis, Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c11s63-11-19" target="_self">63-11-19</a></cite>; the statute, however, was not a rule of evidence, so that evidence “otherwise admissible” would not be excluded because of failure to comply with the statute, especially given that the officer was subject to cross-examination on any and all matters concerning his knowledge and experience with the machine, and the State proved that the officer was certified to perform the breath test in compliance with the statute. Henley v. State, 885 So. 2d 89, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 962 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Trial court did not err in refusing to exclude the results of defendant’s urine analysis performed by a hospital employee simply because the employee did not hold a valid permit from the State Crime Laboratory (Mississippi) pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c11s63-11-19" target="_self">63-11-19</a></cite>; because the employee, who had 40 years experience, was clearly qualified to perform the analysis at issue, and defendant did not question the credibility of the test or the procedures used by the employee in performing the analysis, the court found that the test was reasonable and the results admissible under Miss. Code Ann. §§<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c11s63-11-13" target="_self">63-11-13</a></cite>,<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c11s63-11-39" target="_self">63-11-39</a></cite>. Jones v.

      </p>
      <p>
       State laid sufficient predicate for accuracy of intoxilyzer results in prosecution for felony driving under the influence (DUI), despite failure to produce the original certificate attesting to machine’s accuracy, where officer testified that he was certified with state crime lab to run simulator test on intoxilyzer to certify calibration on it. McIlwain v. State, 700 So. 2d 586, 1997 Miss. LEXIS 310 (Miss. 1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       Prior to admitting results of chemical analysis in prosecution for driving under the influence (DUI), court must determine that proper procedures were followed, that operator of machine was properly certified to perform test, and that accuracy of machine was properly certified. McIlwain v. State, 700 So. 2d 586, 1997 Miss. LEXIS 310 (Miss. 1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       State is not required, for purposes of admitting certificate of accuracy for intoxilyzer, to present testimony and allow cross-examination of calibrating officer; rather, state must present testimony and allow cross-examination of calibrating officer only in absence of certification of intoxilyzer or where there is genuine issue as to authenticity of certification. McIlwain v. State, 700 So. 2d 586, 1997 Miss. LEXIS 310 (Miss. 1997).
      </p>
      <p>

   A blood alcohol test is admissible into evidence when performance of the test “substantially complied” with §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c11s63-11-19" target="_self">63-11-19</a></cite>. Bearden v. State, 662 So. 2d 620, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 503 (Miss. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       A chemical analysis of a person’s breath, blood, or urine is deemed valid only when performed according to approved methods, by a person certified to do so, and on a machine certified to be accurate. Certification of the machine must take place at least quarterly. These safeguards ensure a more accurate result in the gathering of scientific evidence through intoxilyzers and are strictly enforced. Where one of the safeguards is deficient, the State bears the burden of showing that the deficiency did not affect the accuracy of the result. Johnston v. State, 567 So. 2d 237, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 562 (Miss. 1990).

      <p>
       Defendant was properly convicted of driving under the influence because he admitted to drinking, had red glassy eyes, smelled of alcohol, and was unsteady on his feet, and the proper foundation was laid to admit the breathalyzer test results into evidence where the trooper was certified to give the test, the machine itself was calibrated, and there was nothing in the record to suggest that the results of the test were invalid because the machine was not calibrated properly. Miller v. State, 152 So.3d 1184, 2014 Miss. App. LEXIS 690 (Miss. Ct. App. 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Although the urinalysis evidence came under the Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.13.html#t13c01s13-1-21ol11" target="_blank">13-1-21(1)</a></cite> physician-patient privilege, defendant could not rely on the privilege to exclude the incriminating evidence of cocaine in defendant’s system where the procedure allegedly failed to comply with Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c11s63-11-19" target="_self">63-11-19</a></cite>. Jones v. State, 858 So. 2d 139, 2003 Miss. LEXIS 579 (Miss. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       State provided sufficient evidence regarding calibration of intoxilyzer used to test defendant’s blood alcohol level, in prosecution for driving while intoxicated, even if state did not provide actual test cards used in calibration; best evidence rule did not apply where officer responsible for calibration testified at trial and state presented records of results of tests performed. Young v. City of Brookhaven, 693 So. 2d 1355, 1997 Miss. LEXIS 232 (Miss. 1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   There was substantial compliance with §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c11s63-11-19" target="_self">63-11-19</a></cite>, and the trial judge did not err in admitting intoxilyzer test results into evidence in a prosecution for negligently causing injury while intoxicated under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c11s63-11-30" target="_self">63-11-30</a></cite>, where the police dispatcher who administered the intoxilyzer test had attended a one-day school for intoxilyzer test operators conducted by the Mississippi Highway Patrol and had been issued a permit, she testified that she had administered the test “on hundreds,” the intoxilyzer machine had been calibrated by someone from the Highway Safety Patrol a few days before the test was administered on the defendant, the dispatcher followed the checklist provided for machine operators, she told the defendant he had a right to refuse the test, the defendant blew into a mouthpiece attached to the machine until a bell rang, the printout card showed .19 percent, and the dispatcher testified that the defendant appeared to be intoxicated. Estes v. State, 605 So. 2d 772, 1992 Miss. LEXIS 473 (Miss. 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       The evidence was sufficient to establish that an officer who administered an intoxilyzer test was certified to operate the intoxilyzer, even though no evidence was introduced to show that the intoxilyzer used by the officer was the same model on which he was certified; the statute only requires that the person performing the test be certified to do so. However, the officer’s testimony that the intoxilyzer was calibrated every month was insufficient to meet the calibration requirements of the statute where a certificate of calibrations indicated that the machine was not calibrated every month, there was no evidence to establish that the machine had been calibrated within the statutory period, and the State made no effort to carry its burden that even if the intoxilyzer was not properly certified the deficiency did not affect the accuracy of the test. Strictly enforcing the statutory requirements, there is no support for the accuracy of the results absent evidence of proper certification, and the trial court abused its discretion in finding a sufficient predicate for admitting the results of the intoxilyzer in the testimony of the officer. Johnston v. State, 567 So. 2d 237, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 562 (Miss. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   A city policeman was fully qualified to administer a breath test for alcohol content under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c11s63-11-19" target="_self">63-11-19</a></cite>, where he had received training at the Mississippi Highway Safety Patrol under the Mississippi Department of Public Safety on the use of the intoxilyzer and its predecessor machine, the intoximeter, had taken a written examination on which he made a correct score of more than 85 percent, and held a permit from the Department of Public Safety to conduct tests on this machine; furthermore, the result of the test was properly admitted as competent evidence, where the officer precisely followed the procedure recommended by the Department of Public Safety in conducting the examination, the machine had been checked for accuracy only two days prior to the test, and the officer scrupulously followed the Department of Public Safety checklist of steps to take in administering the test, in spite of defendant’s claim that the officer failed to determine that defendant’s mouth was empty at the time of administering the test.

       <p>
   Where defendant was convicted of DUI, the Intoxilyzer machine used to determine defendant’s BAC was calibrated thirteen days prior to its use, and the testing requirements of Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c11s63-11-19" target="_self">63-11-19</a></cite> were satisfied. While the machine was later replaced, the court found that it was working properly when defendant was tested. Dobbins v. City of Starkville, 938 So. 2d 296, 2006 Miss. App. LEXIS 166 (Miss. Ct. App. 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant’s conviction for first-offense driving under the influence of alcohol, which was based on an intoxilyzer result, was reversed because the State failed to properly authenticate copies of a page from the intoxilyzer log book and the calibration certificate; the State was required to offer either the testimony of the calibrating officer, the original certificate of calibration, or a certified copy of the certificate as evidence of the machine’s accuracy. Jones v. State, 798 So. 2d 592, 2001 Miss. App. LEXIS 265 (Miss. Ct. App. 2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       When a city’s intoxilyzer has been inspected and a certificate of accuracy issued, the municipal clerk’s office is fairly seen as the statutorily authorized location for the certificate to be filed. Callahan v. State, 811 So. 2d 420, 2001 Miss. App. LEXIS 91 (Miss. Ct. App. 2001).

      If a person refuses upon the request of a law enforcement officer to submit to a chemical test of his breath designated by the law enforcement agency as provided in Section 63-11-5, none shall be given, but the officer shall at that point demand the driver’s license of the person, who shall deliver his driver’s license into the hands of the officer. If a person refuses to submit to a chemical test under the provisions of this chapter, the person shall be informed by the law enforcement officer that the refusal to submit to the test shall subject him to suspension of the privilege to operate a motor vehicle. The officer shall give the driver a receipt for his license on forms prescribed and furnished by the Commissioner of Public Safety. The officer shall forward the driver’s license together with a sworn report to the Commissioner of Public Safety stating that he had reasonable grounds and probable cause to believe the person had been operating a motor vehicle upon the public highways, public roads and streets of this state while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any other substance which may impair a person’s mental or physical ability, stating the grounds, and that the person had refused to submit to the chemical test of his breath upon request of the law enforcement officer.

      <p>
       Under Section 63-11-21, if a person refuses to submit to a chemical test, the officer should inform the person that he is subject to arrest and upon conviction faces the same penalties as one who does submit to the test. The law enforcement office need not provide such a warning if the person does not refuse to submit to a chemical test. See also Section 63-11-30. Jones, November 8, 1996, A.G. Op. #96-0786.
      </p>
      <p>
       The failure to advise the person as set forth in Section 63-11-21 would not effect the prosecution. This amendment to the code section affords the defendant no additional rights. See also Section 63-11-30. Jones, November 8, 1996, A.G. Op. #96-0786.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pursuant to Section 63-11-21 it is only necessary for the officer to inform the driver of the consequences if the driver refuses to submit to a chemical test. See also Section 63-11-30. Henderson, November 8, 1996, A.G. Op. #96-0763.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 63-11-21 does not require any checklist or form to be filled out regarding the information given to a driver who refuses to submit to a chemical test prior to the driver being charged with D.U.I. Henderson, November 8, 1996, A.G. Op. #96-0763.
      </p>
      <p>
       The intention of the Legislature under Section 63-11-21 was to insure that a driver was made fully aware of the consequences the driver faced if he refused to submit to a chemical test when requested by a law enforcement officer. Henderson, November 8, 1996, A.G. Op. #96-0763.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a defendant is convicted of DUI first offense and he also refused the intoxilyzer test, his driver’s license is suspended for two years and 90 days (one year pursuant to Section 63-11-30(2)(a) plus 90 days pursuant to Section 63-11-23(1) plus one year pursuant to Section 63-11-30(4)); the two years and 90 days is reduced to 270 days upon successful completion of MASEP.

      <p>
       The cost associated with impoundment, immobilization, or ignition interlock is a cost of court that should be paid by the defendant upon conviction; if the defendant is indigent, the cost may be borne by the prosecution and the defendant placed on a work program to satisfy the costs.

       The method of immobilization is not specified in the law and is left to the discretion of the judge; as such, the judge may tailor the method of immobilization in order to contain the costs incurred by the city or county, i.e., the removal of the tires or car battery or some other part so as to immobilize the vehicle.

       Fact that police officer arrested driver prior to requesting that driver submit to official breath test did not establish that improper procedures were followed in suspending driver’s license for driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor (DUI) refusal, notwithstanding statute requiring finding that person was placed under arrest after refusal to take test; “arrest” as used in statute referred to arrest for DUI, and probable cause to arrest had to exist before test could be requested, so requiring arrest only after test refusal was unworkable and was inconsistent with intent of statute.

       Sufficient evidence existed to find defendant guilty where although there was some argument that the results of the intoxilyzer test were within the margin of error, no evidence of the margin of error, if any, of the testing procedures was offered and the appellate court could not review the claim; the admissibility of the calibration evidence satisfied the need to prove the accuracy of the intoxilyzer.

      </h4>
      <p>
       Miss. Code Section 63-11-30(2)(b) provides that justice court may fine person full amount provided for, that is, up to $1,500, even though justice court’s civil jurisdiction is still limited to $1,000. Tallant, Apr. 21, 1993, A.G. Op. #93-0236.
      </p>
      <p>
       Miss. Code Section 63-11-30 requires justice court judges to sentence persons convicted of driving under influence (DUI) to complete safe driving course; this statute places duty on judge, not clerk, to sign order requiring defendant to attend these programs. Ferguson, June 9, 1993, A.G. Op. #93-0331.
      </p>
      <p>
       Constable, where probable cause does exist, may charge an individual with D.U.I. under statute, even though constable may not administer breath test under Section 63-11-5. Lewis, July 14, 1993, A.G. Op. #93-0369.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 99-15-26 of Mississippi Code, which allows judge to withhold adjudication upon defendant’s completion of certain conditions, specifically does not apply to any offense under the Mississippi Implied Consent Law. Stephens, Jan. 12, 1994, A.G. Op. #93-0889.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 21-23-7(5) authorizes a municipal court judge, in the judge’s discretion to suspend the jail time under Section 63-11-30(2)(b). Crow, February 23, 1995, A.G. Op. #95-0105.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under this section, a conviction of the charge of DUI, where the defendant had refused to submit to a breath test, would count as a DUI conviction for enhancement purposes. Fike, April 6, 1995, A.G. Op. #95-0195.
      </p>
      <p>
       Double jeopardy does not necessarily prohibit charging a defendant with public drunkenness under Section 97-29-47, even if that defendant has been acquitted of DUI under Section 63-11-30. The two are separate and distinct criminal charges and contain different elements. Moffett, June 6, 1995, A.G. Op. #95-0277.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 63-11-30(7) overrules Page v. State, 607 So. 2d 1163 (Miss. 1992) and Ashcraft v. City of Richland, 620 So. 2d 1210 (Miss. 1993) in that Section 63-11-30(7) states that the indictment shall not be required to enumerate previous DUI convictions. It shall only be necessary that the indictment state the number of times that a defendant has been convicted and sentenced within the required time. Mitchell, August 14, 1995, A.G. Op. #95-0522.
      </p>
      <p>
       The date of the offense and not the date of trial determines when the 1995 amendment to Section 63-11-30, which extends the time period for which prior D.U.I. offenses may be considered for enhancement purposes to ten years, should apply. Solomon, August 14, 1995, A.G. Op. #95-0521.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under this section, there is no requirement that a breath alcohol intoxilizer test be given to an individual who is suspected of DUI. Gentry, May 3, 1996, A.G. Op. #96-0251.
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
       Under Section 63-11-21, if a person refuses to submit to a chemical test, the officer should inform the person that he is subject to arrest and upon conviction faces the same penalties as one who does submit to the test. The law enforcement office need not provide such a warning if the person does not refuse to submit to a chemical test. See also Section 63-11-30. Jones, November 8, 1996, A.G. Op. #96-0786.
      </p>
      <p>
       The failure to advise the person as set forth in Section 63-11-21 would not effect the prosecution. This amendment to the code section affords the defendant no additional rights. See also Section 63-11-30. Jones, November 8, 1996, A.G. Op. #96-0786.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pursuant to Section 63-11-21 it is only necessary for the officer to inform the driver of the consequences if the driver refuses to submit to a chemical test. See also Section 63-11-30. Henderson, November 8, 1996, A.G. Op. #96-0763.
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
       Section 63-11-30(5) does not provide the exclusive method of establishing prior convictions for enhancement purposes under the DUI law and that a certified copy of a conviction from the clerk of the court where the defendant was previously convicted would be sufficient. Cadle, November 15, 1996, A.G. Op. #96-0791.
      </p>
      <p>
       The vehicle forfeiture provisions of Miss Code Section 63-11-30(2)(c) only apply to a vehicle that is owned by the driver charged with a third DUI violation and not to a vehicle owned by someone other than such a driver. Bryan, Aug. 15, 1997, A.G. Op. #97-0498.

      <p>
       The statute mandates that the court order an offender to attend MASEP and does not make exceptions for out-of-state drivers who are convicted of a first offense DUI.
   Miller, September 4, 1998, A.G. Op. #98-0520.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Zero Tolerance for Minors law only applies when a person under the age of 21 years has a blood alcohol concentration of two one-hundredths percent (.02%) or more, but lower than eight one-hundredths percent (.08%); therefore, if a person refuses to take an intoxilizer test and there is no blood alcohol level reading, the Zero Tolerance for Minors section of the DUI law would not apply.
   Johnston, October 27, 1998, A.G. Op. #98-0607.
      </p>
      <p>
       It must be shown that a DUI defendant either employed an attorney or waived his right to an attorney, regardless of whether a defendant is given jail time on a DUI 1st and 2nd offense.

      </p>
      <p>
       If a police officer has probable cause to believe that an individual is driving under the influence on the state fairgrounds in violation of Section 63-11-30, the officer may stop the individual and charge the violator accordingly; however, if the operator of the vehicle refuses to submit to a chemical test, it must be shown that the vehicle was being operated on the public highways, public roads, and streets of the state before the violator can be subjected to the penalties of Section 63-11-5.
   DeLaughter, Nov. 20, 2000, A.G. Op. #2000-0679.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a defendant is convicted of DUI second offense and he also refused the intoxilyzer test, his driver’s license is suspended for five years (two years pursuant to Section 63-11-30(2)(b) plus one year pursuant to Section 63-11-23(1) plus two years pursuant to Section 63-11-30(4)); the five years is reduced to three 3 years upon successful completion of chemical dependency treatment at a facility approved by the Department of Mental Health.

Shirley, Mar. 30, 2001, A.G. Op. #01-0167.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (1)(d) requires that the prosecution show that the defendant was under the influence of any drug or controlled substance, the possession of which is unlawful under the Mississippi Controlled Substances Law; there is no requirement that the prosecution show a level of impairment, but merely that the defendant is under the influence of such a drug. Knight, Apr. 23, 2001, A.G. Op. #01-0227.
      </p>
      <p>
       A minor charged with being impaired by any substance other than alcohol does not qualify for the Zero Tolerance for Minors provisions (subsection 3) since he will not have a blood alcohol reading between .02 percent and .08 percent. Knight, Apr. 23, 2001, A.G. Op. #01-0227.
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
       A justice court has authority to nonadjudicate a charge only in the instance of a DUI under the Zero for Tolerance for Minors Act found in subsection (3)(g); the nonadjudication of a charge does not automatically expunge the record of such charges, but the court has the discretion to expunge a nonadjudicated charge on its own motion or the defendant may petition the court to expunge a nonadjudicated charge; unless or until the nonadjudicated charges are expunged, they remain on the docket with the disposition of nonadjudicated/dismissed. Shirley, Nov. 30, 2001, A.G. Op. #01-0719.
      </p>

Cruber, Feb. 22, 2002, A.G. Op. #02-0102.
      </p>
      <p>
       Law enforcement officers may revise existing uniform Implied Consent or DUI citations from .10 BAC to .08 BAC. to reflect the current threshold level of alcohol concentration. Mullen, Oct. 18, 2002, A.G. Op. #02-0572.

Mullen, Oct. 18, 2002, A.G. Op. #02-0572.
      </p>
      <p>
       The provisions of the Zero Tolerance for Minors subsection apply only to someone under the age of twenty-one who is being charged under subsection(1)(c) which requires a specific amount of alcohol in the person’s blood; they do not apply to someone who is charged under subsection (1)(d). Baker, Dec. 6, 2002, A.G. Op. #02-0698.
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
       A defendant convicted of DUI second offense would not receive credit against the mandatory five days of imprisonment for time spent at an inpatient treatment facility. Zebert, June 21, 2004, A.G. Op. 04-0246.

Nowak, July 23, 2004, A.G. Op. 04-0325.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that a driver apprehended driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of a drug or controlled substance has a valid prescription is a defense to a prosecution under 63-11-30(1)(d); however, it would be a violation of Section 63-11-30 (1)(b) regardless of the existence of a prescription if the person’s driving ability was impaired. Mitchell, Feb. 3, 2006, A.G. Op. 05-0188.

       To be guilty of “operating” a motor vehicle while under the influence of drugs or alcohol, or with an illegally high blood alcohol content, a person must be shown to have driven the vehicle while in that condition by direct proof of reasonable inferences; therefore, defendant’s conviction was reversed because it was insufficient to prove “operating” by showing that defendant was intoxicated and sitting behind the wheel of a parked car that was out of gas.

       Defendant’s challenge to her indictment was procedurally barred because defendant failed to raise the issue in the circuit court; the indictment clearly alleged both of the essential elements of the aggravated driving while under the influence statute, and thus, the alleged defect was not “jurisdictional” in nature.

      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant had clear notice of the nature of the charges against her because the indictment clearly charged defendant with aggravated driving under the influence (DUI) based on her blood-alcohol concentration, which was still nearly three times the legal limit three hours after the fatal wreck; therefore, the incorrect citation to an inapplicable subsection of the DUI statute was mere “surplusage.” Dartez v.

       Under the aggravated driving while under the influence statute, the State is not required to prove a specific act of negligence, only that the death was caused in a negligent manner; if the State is not required to prove a specific act of negligence at trial, it necessarily follows that such specificity is not required in the indictment.

       Fact that an older citation form was issued to defendant in a DUI case did not mean that it was insufficient just because it was not a uniform traffic ticket since the issuing municipality had obtained new tickets; moreover, the law applicable to defendant’s case involving the standards for operators of commercial vehicles had not changed.

Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c11s63-11-30ol11a" target="_self">63-11-30(1)(a)</a></cite>, the statement adequately informed defendant of the elements that the State was required to prove and the indictment was sufficient as required by Miss.

       When a defendant is charged with subsequent violations of the statute, an indictment containing evidence of prior convictions should not be read to the jury and the jury should not be made aware of the defendant’s prior convictions for the same crime as the one for which he is currently facing trial; the prior convictions are only relevant as to sentencing and should only be admitted during a separate sentencing phase. Strickland v. State, 784 So. 2d 957, 2001 Miss. LEXIS 139 (Miss. 2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       An indictment charging DUI maiming was sufficient, notwithstanding the assertion that it failed to charge that the defendant’s negligent driving caused the accident, where it actually read that the defendant in a negligent manner caused the mutilation of the victim’s left arm, as the indictment gave sufficient notice of the charges pending against the defendant. McCollum v. State, 785 So. 2d 279, 2001 Miss. LEXIS 120 (Miss. 2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       An indictment for driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor was valid where it included the proper code section and subsection number, provided the date, time, and location of the offense, and described the offense as driving negligently while intoxicated, striking the victim’s vehicle and causing numerous injuries to her face and body. Harris v. State, 757 So. 2d 195, 2000 Miss. LEXIS 43 (Miss. 2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       It was plain error to convict and sentence the defendant for a felony DUI conviction rather than a second offense misdemeanor where the first three convictions cited in the indictment occurred more than five years prior to the date of the incident at issue; therefore, the court would reverse and remand for re-sentencing in accordance with the provisions of subsection (2)(c) of this section in effect at the time of his arrest.

       Failure to demur to the indictment for felony DUI does not waive a defect not otherwise curable by amendment. Porter v. State, 1998 Miss. App. LEXIS 948 (Miss. Ct. App. Nov. 10, 1998), op. withdrawn, sub. op., 749 So. 2d 250, 1999 Miss. App. LEXIS 542 (Miss. Ct. App. 1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       An indictment for DUI-third offense, a felony, was sufficient where not only were the convictions and the courts in which they were tried enumerated on the face of the indictment, but the state went further and each abstract of court record showing the defendant’s prior convictions for DUI were attached and made a part of the indictment. Weaver v. State, 713 So. 2d 860, 1997 Miss. LEXIS 624 (Miss.), modified, 713 So. 2d 860, 1997 Miss. LEXIS 949 (Miss. 1997).
      </p>

       Affidavit and indictment were sufficient to charge defendant with third offense felony driving under the influence (DUI), and thus, defendant’s guilty plea was not invalid on that basis; indictment specifically set forth two prior offenses and convictions, and clearly designated dates, fines imposed, and location of record for each prior conviction.

The Porter decision stood for the proposition that in a driving under the influence (DUI) per-se case, defendant could not offer evidence regarding whether or not he was under the influence which would impair his ability to drive a vehicle; the Porter decision did not hold that in a DUI-per-se case, evidence regarding the consumption of alcohol could not be introduced to prove whether or not defendant was at a certain blood alcohol concentration when he or she was driving a motor vehicle.

When the police chief began his pursuit, it was not a pursuit for the purpose of making an arrest, rather, it was a pursuit to give a courtesy warning; at the time defendant was arrested at his home, he had committed the crime of felony DUI, as well as the crime of driving with a suspended license.

       Defendant’s right to a fair trial was not violated by introducing evidence of prior DUI convictions during the guilt phase of a trial because they were an element of the crime of DUI third offense; the state was required to prove all the essential elements of the crime charged.

       Where defendant was taken to a hospital after a two-car collision, the search warrant for a blood draw was invalid because: (1) the officer who requested the search warrant falsely stated in his affidavit that defendant had (a) refused to submit to an “analysis of his breath” after having been offered an opportunity to submit, and (b) been placed under arrest for driving while under the influence, although at that time he had not yet been arrested; and (2) there were no exigent circumstances present at the hospital that would have justified a blood test since defendant was not fleeing, and the officer obviously had time to secure a warrant, albeit an invalid one. As to the admissibility of defendant’s statements about having consumed several beers, made to police at the scene of the accident, defendant did not claim that he was in custody at the time, and his statements clearly had probative value, thus the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the statements to be admitted into evidence despite the defendant’s argument that he was disoriented, confused, and suffering from shock and retrograde amnesia when he made the statements and they were therefore not reliable.

       Where defendant was charged with and found guilty of felony driving under the influence of alcohol, the trial court did not err in denying defense counsel’s motion to suppress evidence of defendant’s blood alcohol results, because the warrant authorizing the blood alcohol test was valid. Inter alia, the officer observed defendant’s slurred speech and staggered walk, and he noted that defendant’s breath smelled of alcohol and defendant actually admitted to having drunk four beers that morning and was unable to recite the alphabet.

       Where defendant was charged with and found guilty of felony driving under the influence of alcohol, the trial court did not err in denying defense counsel’s motion to suppress evidence of defendant’s prior DUI convictions because those prior arrests were elements of the crime with which defendant was charged.

       Defendant’s prior DUI convictions were properly included at his trial for felony DUI where, since prior DUI convictions were necessary elements of felony DUI, any other holding would have precluded the State from proving an essential element of the crime, and the circuit court would have breached its duty to instruct the jury on all the essential elements of the crime charged should the prior felony convictions not have been included.

       Despite the circuit court’s ruling on defendant’s motion in limine, the jury further heard the arresting officer’s testimony about the results of the portable breath test given at the time of the traffic stop, which was erroneously admitted without a specific limiting or cautionary instruction; further, there was substantial evidence contrary to the State’s case, for example, no results were obtained from the Intoxilyzer 5000 tests. In addition, defendant seemed acutely aware of the consequences of mixing alcohol with the prescription medications defendant was taking, and defendant’s physician testified that the symptoms of a sudden change in glucose levels in a diabetic could have been mistaken for intoxication. Given the erroneous admission of evidence barred by the motion in limine and the limited evidence supporting the jury’s verdict, reversal and remand was required. Cannon v.

       While medical science may not be able to inform the courts as to exactly what level of particular narcotics must be ingested to safely lead to the conclusion that the user is under the influence of the drug, the similar issue of whether a person is under the influence of alcohol has for many years been routinely submitted to the jury based on evidence other than scientific testing; such determinations can properly be based upon observed behavior and the common understanding of jurors that persons under the influence of certain chemical substances, whether alcohol or narcotics, behave in ways that are different from the average person and thus, there is no basis to draw a distinction between narcotic use and alcohol use and the appellate court declines to do so.

       When a defendant is charged with subsequent violations of the statute, an indictment containing evidence of prior convictions should not be read to the jury and the jury should not be made aware of the defendant’s prior convictions for the same crime as the one for which he is currently facing trial; the prior convictions are only relevant as to sentencing and should only be admitted during a separate sentencing phase.

       In a prosecution for driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor, the defendant’s statement to a police officer that the breathalyzer machine would “probably show I’m in a coma” was essentially a confession that the defendant was drunk, and was therefore admissible into evidence as a voluntary statement where it was made spontaneously after the defendant had been given the Miranda warnings.

       In case involving driving under the influence manslaughter, a trial court did not abuse its discretion by allowing defendant’s blood-test results into evidence because the totality of the circumstances established that defendant provided valid, voluntary consent to provide blood samples for blood-alcohol testing. Defendant’s consent was valid until revoked by him or until completion of the blood draw. John v. State, 189 So.3d 683, 2015 Miss. App. LEXIS 626 (Miss. Ct. App. 2015).

       Evidence was sufficient to convict defendant for felony DUI because he provided no authority specific to the alleged gaps in the evidence relating to his blood-alcohol test, he could have been convicted without the test results, there was substantial evidence that he was driving while impaired, and, while he argued reasonable doubt from the absence of the certification of the most recent calibration of the machine used to test his blood-alcohol concentration, he failed to pursue his claim.

       Motion to suppress was properly denied because defendant’s Fourth Amendment rights were not violated in a case involving aggravated driving under the influence because there was probable cause for a blood sample taken from defendant based on his behavior after an accident, the fact that he smelled of alcohol and marijuana, and the fact that such items were observed in his car; the blood draw also fell under the exceptions of a search incident to arrest and exigent circumstances.

       The state cannot use the results of a horizontal gaze nystagmus (HGN) test to show that the defendant was under the influence of intoxicating liquor to prove the requisite elements of subsection (1)(a) and, furthermore, the state cannot attempt to introduce the HGN test as scientific evidence to show a defendant’s degree of intoxication; however, the test can still be used as a field sobriety test to establish probable cause to administer the intoxilyzer. Graves v. State, 761 So. 2d 950, 2000 Miss. App. LEXIS 289 (Miss. Ct. App. 2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       The defendant was entitled to reversal of his conviction and a new trial where the court improperly allowed the introduction of evidence of the horizontal gaze nystagmus test to show intoxication; the state’s evidence of guilt was not so overwhelming as to render allowing the improper evidence harmless error. Holmes v. State, 740 So. 2d 952, 1999 Miss. App. LEXIS 321 (Miss. Ct. App. 1999).

       Prior to admitting results of chemical analysis in prosecution for driving under the influence (DUI), court must determine that proper procedures were followed, that operator of machine was properly certified to perform test, and that accuracy of machine was properly certified. McIlwain v. State, 700 So. 2d 586, 1997 Miss. LEXIS 310 (Miss. 1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       State laid sufficient predicate for accuracy of intoxilyzer results in prosecution for felony driving under the influence (DUI), despite failure to produce the original certificate attesting to machine’s accuracy, where officer testified that he was certified with state crime lab to run simulator test on intoxilyzer to certify calibration on it. McIlwain v. State, 700 So. 2d 586, 1997 Miss. LEXIS 310 (Miss. 1997).

      <p>
       Horizontal gaze nystagmus (HGN) test, in which person’s eye movements are evaluated as potential evidence of intoxication, was scientific test which was not generally accepted within scientific community and could not be used as scientific evidence to prove intoxication or as mere showing of impairment, in prosecution for driving while intoxicated, although test could be used to prove probable cause to arrest and administer intoxilyzer or blood test. Young v. City of Brookhaven, 693 So. 2d 1355, 1997 Miss. LEXIS 232 (Miss. 1997).

   There was substantial compliance with §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c11s63-11-19" target="_self">63-11-19</a></cite>, and the trial judge did not err in admitting intoxilyzer test results into evidence in a prosecution for negligently causing injury while intoxicated under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c11s63-11-30" target="_self">63-11-30</a></cite>, where the police dispatcher who administered the intoxilyzer test had attended a one-day school for intoxilyzer test operators conducted by the Mississippi Highway Patrol and had been issued a permit, she testified that she had administered the test “on hundreds,” the intoxilyzer machine had been calibrated by someone from the Highway Safety Patrol a few days before the test was administered on the defendant, the dispatcher followed the checklist provided for machine operators, she told the defendant he had a right to refuse the test, the defendant blew into a mouthpiece attached to the machine until a bell rang, the printout card showed .19 percent, and the dispatcher testified that the defendant appeared to be intoxicated.

       <p>
   A defendant’s arrest for driving while intoxicated was legal, and therefore the subsequent intoxilyzer test was not tainted, even though the arresting officer did not observe the defendant driving, where the defendant admitted to the arresting officer that he had been driving an automobile which was involved in an accident, and the defendant was publicly intoxicated in the presence of the officer and others in violation of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.97.html#t97c29s97-29-47" target="_blank">97-29-47</a></cite>.

       Trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant’s motion for a new trial since the jury found that defendant, driving with a blood-alcohol concentration nearly three times the legal limit, wrecked the car because she was negligent, and there was no contrary evidence that overwhelmed the jury’s verdict; the State’s accident reconstruction expert concluded that defendant did not maintain the proper lane of travel, overcorrected, and lost control of the car as a result.

Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c11s63-11-30ol15" target="_self">63-11-30(5)</a></cite> (2013) because (1) defendant’s blood alcohol content was over twice the legal limit, (2) the evidence showed defendant operated a vehicle negligently, and (3) expert testimony was not required to show defendant’s victim’s injuries. Prince v. State, 225 So.3d 545, 2017 Miss. App. LEXIS 289 (Miss. Ct. App. 2017).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence supported defendant’s conviction because officers testified that defendant was swerving the vehicle defendant was driving, that defendant admitted to operating the vehicle while consuming alcohol, that defendant emanated an odor of alcohol, that defendant had glassy, bloodshot eyes and slurred speech, that defendant experienced difficulty turning off the vehicle, that defendant was unsteady, and that defendant failed field sobriety tests. In addition, the prosecution offered into evidence dash-camera footage of the encounter. Longest v. State, 223 So.3d 799, 2017 Miss. App. LEXIS 241 (Miss. Ct. App. 2017).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence supported defendant’s conviction for aggravated driving under the influence because testimonial evidence from witnesses indicated that defendant swerved recklessly while driving a vehicle and was unable to maintain the lane of traffic or control of the vehicle when defendant collided with another vehicle, resulting in the death of a passenger in the other vehicle. Moreover, testimony showed that defendant exhibited the side effects of Xanax, including disorientation, confusion, slurred speech, pinpoint pupils, diaphoretic, and syncope. Roberts v.

      <p>
       Evidence that defendant used his right-turn indicator at an intersection before making a left turn, hit the fog line multiple times within a short distance, failed to move his car completely off the road when he was pulled over by the officer, and, at the scene of the traffic stop, exhibited slurred speech, bloodshot eyes, poor balance, smelled strongly of alcohol, and failed two field sobriety tests was sufficient to support defendant’s conviction for felony driving under the influence. Clemons v. State, 199 So.3d 670, 2016 Miss. LEXIS 345 (Miss. 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence that defendant drove recklessly through a checkpoint after being instructed to stop, a deputy smelled an odor of alcohol coming from defendant’s vehicle, defendant admitted to drinking wine, and a portable breath test was positive was sufficient to support defendant’s conviction for common-law DUI. Schlepphorst v. State, 201 So.3d 517, 2016 Miss. App. LEXIS 126 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 203 So.3d 1134, 2016 Miss. LEXIS 418 (Miss. 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       Officer’s testimony that defendant was speeding and weaving in the road, that he smelled alcohol in defendant’s vehicle and on his breath, and defendant’s admission to having taken NyQuil along with his insistence that he had not consumed alcohol was sufficient to support defendant’s DUI conviction. Fancher v. State, 185 So.3d 1066, 2016 Miss. App. LEXIS 65 (Miss. Ct. App. 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence was sufficient to support a conviction for driving under the influence under this statute because, although defendant’s speech was not slurred, he admitted to drinking, smelled of alcohol, had glassy, bloodshot eyes, and failed to perform the field sobriety tests adequately; moreover, the conviction was not against the weight of the evidence because the fact that defendant was calm and cooperative and did not exhibit balance issues other than during the field sobriety tests did not negate a finding of intoxication. Nolan v. State, 182 So.3d 484, 2016 Miss. App. LEXIS 21 (Miss. Ct. App. 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of driving under the influence of marijuana because the officer observed defendant’s vehicle weave twice before pulling him over; defendant’s eyes were bloodshot when he exited his vehicle, he failed the lack-of-convergence test, he exhibited eyelid tremors during the Romberg test, and he did not successfully complete the walk-and-turn test or finger-to-nose test; defendant exhibited 12 indicators that he was under the influence of marijuana while undergoing a drug evaluation; and a forensic toxicologist testified that defendant’s blood tested positive for the active metabolite of marijuana, meaning that the drug would have had an impairing effect on defendant when he was pulled over. Warwick v. State, 179 So.3d 1069, 2015 Miss. LEXIS 582 (Miss. 2015).
      </p>
      <p>
       In case involving driving under the influence manslaughter, a guilty verdict was not against the overwhelming weight of the evidence where there were alcoholic beverage containers found inside of a vehicle wrecked in a creek, defendant admitted that he consumed alcohol prior to the accident, defendant’s blood-alcohol level was .18 percent, and the cause of death for the passengers was drowning. John v. State, 189 So.3d 683, 2015 Miss. App. LEXIS 626 (Miss. Ct. App. 2015).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence was sufficient to support defendant’s DUI conviction where the officer testified that she speeding and failed to completely stop at a stop sign, he smelled alcohol coming from inside the vehicle, defendant’s eyes were bloodshot and glassy, her speech was slurred, she admitted she had consumed alcohol that evening, a wine bottle one-fourth full was found inside the vehicle, and a preliminary breath test tested positive for alcohol. Robinette v. State, 189 So.3d 675, 2015 Miss. App. LEXIS 593 (Miss. Ct. App. 2015).
      </p>
      <p>
       Prosecution presented sufficient evidence that defendant was driving under the influence of marijuana because a police observed that defendant had dilated pupils, reddened eyes, and slurred speech, and defendant exhibited eyelid and leg tremors while performing a sobriety test; defendant’s blood tests revealed the presence of active metabolites for marijuana,and he admitted to smoking marijuana twenty minutes prior to encountering the officer.

      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Jury’s return of a general verdict finding defendant guilty of felony driving under the influence was of no significance where the evidence was sufficient to support a verdict under either Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c11s63-11-30ol11a" target="_self">63-11-30(1)(a)</a></cite> or (c) (Supp. 2014). Campbell v. State, 164 So.3d 519, 2015 Miss. App. LEXIS 269 (Miss. Ct. App. 2015).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence was sufficient to support defendant’s conviction because the officers who arrived on the scene found defendant’s vehicle positioned halfway in the street and halfway on a curb, with several garbage cans strewn about the adjacent yard, and witnessed defendant sitting in the driver’s seat of his vehicle with the key in the ignition. They also testified that defendant was unable to walk, talk, or stand without extreme difficulty and stated that they smelled an intoxicating substance. Pittman v. City of Starkville, 151 So.3d 1056, 2014 Miss. App. LEXIS 680 (Miss. Ct. App. 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although defendant argued that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction for driving under the influence (DUI) because he had an adequate explanation for each factor that the trooper considered in charging him with DUI, this argument in effect challenged, not the sufficiency of the evidence presented by the State during trial, but the weight and credibility given by the circuit court to that evidence. The issue of the weight of the evidence presented against defendant during trial was not before the appellate court. Terrell v. State, 151 So.3d 277, 2014 Miss. App. LEXIS 657 (Miss. Ct. App. 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of felony driving under the influence (DUI) because the evidence showed that defendant operated a motor vehicle while impaired as an officer testified that defendant admitted he had been drinking earlier that night, that he smelled of alcoholic beverages, had bloodshot eyes, appeared nervous, and acted obstinately, and that he failed or could not complete all three field sobriety tests; and because, although there was some conflicting data, defendant’s name, social security/driver’s license number, day and month of birth, sex, race, and city of residence appeared on both abstracts of conviction for prior DUI offenses committed in the previous five years. Jefferson v. State, 151 So.3d 261, 2014 Miss. App. LEXIS 652 (Miss. Ct. App. 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although, alone, the fact that defendant admitted to consuming a small amount of alcohol may not have been sufficient evidence for common law driving under the influence (DUI), the State presented other evidence, including evidence that defendant’s speech was slurred, he had to lean on his vehicle for support, he seemed uncoordinated, he had bloodshot eyes, and he smelled of alcohol; therefore, the evidence was sufficient to support defendant’s conviction for felony DUI, third offense. Moore v. State, 151 So.3d 200, 2014 Miss. LEXIS 562 (Miss. 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       In view of evidence that defendant admitted that he had consumed alcoholic beverages about an hour prior to being stopped, his admission that he had an open beer container in his car, his slurred speech, and his acknowledgement that the only field sobriety test he passed was the one-leg-stand test, the evidence was sufficient to sustain defendant’s common law driving under the influence conviction. Platt v. State, 151 So.3d 236, 2014 Miss. App. LEXIS 621 (Miss. Ct. App. 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the jury could have convicted defendant of either common-law driving under the influence (DUI) or per se DUI, and the evidence was legally sufficient for either crime, the jury’s return of a general verdict was of no significance. Oatis v. State, 146 So.3d 1015, 2014 Miss. App. LEXIS 477 (Miss. Ct. App. 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       There was sufficient evidence for a jury to find defendant guilty of every element of common-law driving under the influence; looking at the evidence presented at trial, a jury could reasonably find that defendant had been driving his car while under the influence of alcohol. Oatis v. State, 146 So.3d 1015, 2014 Miss. App. LEXIS 477 (Miss. Ct. App. 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Evidence showed that a reasonable fact-finder could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant committed the crime of DUI, first offense, under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c11s63-11-30ol11a" target="_self">63-11-30(1)(a)</a></cite> and she did so under such circumstances that every element of the offense existed given a police officer’s observations, defendant’s demonstrated impairment during a field sobriety test, and a video recording of defendant’s traffic stop. Oglesby v. City of Madison, 151 So.3d 1022, 2014 Miss. App. LEXIS 440 (Miss. Ct. App. 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a prosecution of defendant for driving under the influence, first offense, there was ample evidence of slurred speech, the smell of alcohol, and failed field sobriety tests. Further, defendant admitted to drinking beer, and stated he was about five on a subjective intoxication scale of one to ten. Krueger v. State, 147 So.3d 887, 2014 Miss. App. LEXIS 336 (Miss. Ct. App. 2014).

   Where a defendant appealed her conviction and sentence for violating Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c11s63-11-30ol15" target="_self">63-11-30(5)</a></cite>, the evidence presented established that defendant was under the influence, and the evidence of her erratic and dangerous driving established that she was driving negligently and that such driving resulted in the death of a passenger in another car. There was no error in the denial of her motions for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict or for a new trial. Faulkner v. State, 131 So.3d 1240, 2014 Miss. App. LEXIS 52 (Miss. Ct. App. 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although defendant produced evidence that his truck’s power steering had been replaced, the manner in which he handled an incident he blamed on his power steering going out (failing to stop to inform anyone of the incident) supported a finding that defendant was under the influence at the time he hit mailboxes and a boat. Chapman v. State, 126 So.3d 959, 2013 Miss. App. LEXIS 808 (Miss. Ct. App. 2013).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence supported defendant’s conviction of felony driving under the influence causing death because (1) surveillance videos showed that defendant consumed six beers at a casino in a two hour period; (2) defendant, upon leaving the casino, turned defendant’s vehicle into an oncoming vehicle; (3) a passenger in the other vehicle was killed; (4) a police officer testified that defendant showed signs of intoxication; and (5) defendant’s blood contained .14 percent concentration of alcohol. Andino v. State, 125 So.3d 700, 2013 Miss. App. LEXIS 715 (Miss. Ct. App. 2013).
      </p>
      <p>
       Sufficient evidence was presented to allow a reasonable and fair-minded juror to find that defendant operated a motor vehicle under circumstances indicating that he was impaired by alcohol because defendant testified that he had consumed alcohol on the day he was arrested, and the State presented testimony that several empty beer cans and a half-full beer can were found in his car and that he smelled like alcohol when he was pulled over. Young v. State, 119 So.3d 309, 2013 Miss. LEXIS 392 (Miss. 2013).
      </p>
      <p>
       There was not a sufficient factual basis, pursuant to Miss. Unif. Cir. & Cty. R. 8.04, to support defendant’s guilty plea to driving under the influence (DUI) manslaughter and DUI mayhem because there was no factual basis that defendant had been driving in the county where the accident occurred, that defendant was impaired by controlled substances while defendant was driving, and that defendant performed a negligent act that caused one child’s death and another child’s serious bodily injury in an auto accident. Porter v. State, 126 So.3d 68, 2013 Miss. App. LEXIS 479 (Miss. Ct. App. 2013).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence supported defendant’s driving under the influence conviction because defendant admitted to having been drinking, defendant’s performance on field sobriety tests suggested that defendant was impaired, and a video of defendant at a police department waiting to take an Intoxilyzer breath exam depicted defendant as unsteady, eventually losing balance and falling off a stool, while defendant presented part of the video of what defendant alleged was a seizure, without any other support. Carlson v. City of Ridgeland, 131 So.3d 1220, 2013 Miss. App. LEXIS 474 (Miss. Ct. App. 2013), cert. denied, 132 So.3d 579, 2014 Miss. LEXIS 112 (Miss. 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Evidence was sufficient to support defendant’s driving under the influence conviction where two police officers smelled alcohol emitting from defendant’s vehicle, defendant exhibited physical signs of impairment during field sobriety tests, and defendant refused to submit to an Intoxilyzer test, which was admissible pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c11s63-11-41" target="_self">63-11-41</a></cite>. Lobo v. City of Ridgeland, 135 So.3d 148, 2013 Miss. App. LEXIS 300 (Miss. Ct. App. 2013).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of DUI, first offense, even without the results of a breathalyzer test, where the arresting officer testified defendant admitted to drinking five alcoholic beverages, he smelled like alcohol, his speech was slurred, he swayed while standing, and his eyes were bloodshot and watery. Ludwig v. State, 122 So.3d 1229, 2013 Miss. App. LEXIS 313 (Miss. Ct. App. 2013).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court did not err in denying defendant’s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict because ample evidence was offered in the form of testimony from the sole testifying witness, a police officer, with regard to defendant’s condition on the morning in question; the officer’s observations of defendant during the field-sobriety tests were ample proof that defendant’s ability to operate her motor vehicle had been impaired by her admitted consumption of alcohol. Huhn v. City of Brandon, 121 So.3d 947, 2013 Miss. App. LEXIS 331 (Miss. Ct. App. 2013).

Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c11s63-11-30ol15" target="_self">63-11-30(5)</a></cite>, although defendant’s blood sample was not positive for alcohol, where both a victim and a deputy testified that defendant smelled of alcohol, one of the victim’s testified that defendant was driving in the wrong lane and an alarming speed, one of the victims suffered permanent disabilities as a direct result of the accident, and defendant’s blood analysis revealed significant levels of alprazolam and hydrocodone.

Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c11s63-11-30ol11a" target="_self">63-11-30(1)(a)</a></cite>, (c), because appellant admitted to having several drinks that night, a portable breathalyzer test (PBT) indicated that appellant was probably intoxicated, a police officer testified that appellant displayed signs of intoxication while performing the field-sobriety tests, and the signs from the tests, the PBT results, and the videotape all corroborated most of the officer’s testimony and supported his belief that appellant was intoxicated. Barrow v. State, 121 So.3d 935, 2013 Miss. App. LEXIS 170 (Miss. Ct. App. 2013).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although defendant argued that the prosecution failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant’s breath-alcohol content was .08 percent or greater at the time that defendant was driving, because a doctor provided retrograde-extrapolation testimony that defendant’s blood-alcohol content would have been .03 percent at the time of the traffic stop of defendant, the county court judge acted within its discretion when it found that the doctor’s testimony was not credible.

Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c11s63-11-30ol15" target="_self">63-11-30(5)</a></cite>, as defendant was exceeding the speed limit, defendant did not brake before the accident, and defendant’s blood-alcohol level was over the legal limit.

   Defendant’s conviction for DUI maiming in violation of Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c11s63-11-30ol15" target="_self">63-11-30(5)</a></cite> was appropriate because the overwhelming weight of the evidence supported a guilty verdict. The other driver testified that, as she drove over a hill, she saw defendant’s truck in her lane driving toward her at an alarming speed, resulting in a collision; there was also testimony that defendant smelled of alcohol and although his blood sample was not positive for the presence of alcohol, it did test positive for other substances that affected one’s ability to operate a motor vehicle. Irby v. State, 2010 Miss. LEXIS 423 (Miss. Aug. 12, 2010), sub. op., 49 So.3d 94, 2010 Miss. LEXIS 638 (Miss. 2010).

Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c11s63-11-30ol11a" target="_self">63-11-30(1)(a)</a></cite>, was supported by the evidence because the circuit court did not err in considering evidence of the smell of alcohol and the presence of beer cans in defendant’s truck; defendant admitted consuming at least “a couple” of beers. Knight v. State, 14 So.3d 76, 2009 Miss. App. LEXIS 484 (Miss. Ct. App. 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       In defendant’s trial for vehicular manslaughter while driving under the influence, a jury was presented with evidence that defendant’s blood-alcohol concentration was three times the legal limit; testimony was presented from an officer that defendant admitted in an interview on the night of the accident that she believed her vehicle had crossed the centerline of the road just before the collision; and evidence was presented that there was no other reasonable cause of the victim’s death. Hudspeth v. State, 28 So.3d 600, 2009 Miss. App. LEXIS 244 (Miss. Ct. App. 2009), cert. denied, 27 So.3d 404, 2010 Miss. LEXIS 89 (Miss. 2010).

   Evidence was sufficient to sustain defendant’s conviction under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c11s63-11-30" target="_self">63-11-30</a></cite> because, based on defendant’s level of hydrocodone in her system, the State’s expert opined that defendant had to have been impaired at the time of the accident. The expert testified that a person could be impaired at any dosage no matter how small, but that defendant’s level of hydrocodone demonstrated significant impairment. Teston v. State, 44 So.3d 977, 2008 Miss. App. LEXIS 681 (Miss. Ct. App. 2008), cert. dismissed, 44 So.3d 969, 2010 Miss. LEXIS 520 (Miss. 2010).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of three counts of driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) maiming because (1) the State established that defendant consumed alcohol prior to the wreck and was drinking at the time of the wreck; (2) defendant swerved and crossed the center line immediately prior to the wreck; (3) several witnesses testified to the presence of alcohol, including beer cans and a partially consumed bottle of vodka in defendant’s vehicle, and that the inside of his vehicle smelled of alcohol; and (4) four hours after the wreck, defendant’s blood alcohol content was .07% Gilpatrick v. State, 991 So. 2d 130, 2008 Miss. LEXIS 393 (Miss. 2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant’s argument, in his motion for new trial and on appeal, that the verdict convicting him of felony driving under the influence was against the overwhelming weight of the evidence was without merit, because the appellate court had to accept the evidence which supported the verdict as true; the evidence included the testimony of one officer that defendant’s speech was slurred and that he had poor balance, and the testimony of two other officers that his eyes were red and that he smelled of alcohol. Brooks v. State, 999 So. 2d 408, 2008 Miss. App. LEXIS 390 (Miss. Ct. App. 2008), cert. denied, 999 So. 2d 852, 2009 Miss. LEXIS 48 (Miss. 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence was sufficient for a rational jury to find defendant guilty of vehicular homicide beyond a reasonable doubt because the State presented evidence to show that defendant ran a stop sign; it was undisputed that the victim’s death was a result of the collision with defendant, and defendant admitted to drinking that night. Moreover, officers discovered an open beer can on the floorboard of defendant’s car, and his blood alcohol content was 0.22. Smith v. State, 981 So. 2d 1025, 2008 Miss. App. LEXIS 275 (Miss. Ct. App. 2008).
      </p>

       <p>
   During a traffic stop, the officer smelled alcohol, defendant exhibited slurred speech, admitted he had been drinking, and the Breathalyzer showed that he was well above the legal limit; a second officer had to carry defendant to the patrol car. Despite conflicting testimony at trial, the evidence was sufficient to sustain defendant’s conviction for driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor in violation of Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c11s63-11-30ol11" target="_self">63-11-30(1)</a></cite>. Ivy v. City of Louisville, 976 So. 2d 951, 2008 Miss. App. LEXIS 140 (Miss. Ct. App. 2008).

   There was sufficient evidence to support a verdict of guilty of driving under the influence, first offense, under
   Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c11s63-11-30ol11" target="_self">63-11-30(1)</a></cite>, because (1) a circuit court found that there was sufficient, circumstantial evidence that defendant was operating a vehicle under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c11s63-11-30" target="_self">63-11-30</a></cite> because defendant admitted that he was headed home; (2) the circuit court accepted an officer’s testimony that he watched defendant exit the vehicle from the driver’s side, that he smelled alcoholic beverages, and that defendant displayed signs of intoxication, such as his slurred speech and unsteadiness on his feet; (3) it was a reasonable inference from the evidence presented that defendant had driven the car in violation of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c11s63-11-30" target="_self">63-11-30</a></cite>; and (4) the results of an Intoxilyzer and defendant’s behavior witnessed by the officer were admitted into evidence.

      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence was sufficient to sustain a conviction for operating a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol because, upon arriving at the scene of the accident, a witness testified that defendant was the only individual present, defendant admitted that he was the driver of the truck, and both deputies concluded that defendant was driving under the influence based upon the witness’s statement, the absence of any other occupants at the scene, the presence of scattered open beer cans, and the distinct scent of alcohol on defendant’s breath.

Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c11s63-11-30ol11a" target="_self">63-11-30(1)(a)</a></cite>, careless driving, and driving without a seatbelt were appropriate because defendant failed to raise any of the issues he complained of on appeal in his motion for a directed verdict or new trial and because the facts of the case provided sufficient evidence to convict. Jones v. State, 958 So. 2d 840, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 423 (Miss. Ct. App. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of DUI first offense because: (1) an officer observed marijuana on defendant’s clothing, noted that defendant’s eyes were bloodshot, and remarked that defendant appeared to be particularly nervous; (2) the officer testified that defendant stated that he had smoked marijuana a short time before the stop; (3) although defendant testified and gave a different account of the events, the court, as the fact finder, was entitled to believe whatever testimony it found most credible; and (4) nothing about the officer’s allowing defendant to drive away from the scene affected whether defendant was actually under the influence when he was stopped initially. Beal v. State, 958 So. 2d 254, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 379 (Miss. Ct. App. 2007).

       <p>
   Where a police officer testified that he noticed a strong smell of alcohol coming from defendant, that defendant had glazed and bloodshot eyes, and his speech was slurred, and defendant also failed field sobriety tests, the evidence was sufficient to support defendant’s conviction for driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c11s63-11-30ol11a" target="_self">63-11-30(1)(a)</a></cite>. Loveless v. City of Booneville, 958 So. 2d 230, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 347 (Miss. Ct.

      <p>
       <p>
   Where defendant’s blood alcohol content was over the legal limit, and while there was no eyewitness testimony that defendant in fact drove the car that hit the victim, there was sufficient circumstantial evidence to convict defendant of a DUI homicide under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c11s63-11-30ol11c" target="_self">63-11-30(1)(c)</a></cite> and (5) because: (1) the early morning time and rural location of the collision allowed the jury to form a reasonable inference that defendant drove the car that hit the victim; (2) the jury could have found based on the time and location that it was unlikely that defendant would have been walking in that area; (3) the jury could have reasonably inferred that defendant was at the scene of the collision because he drove one of the two cars involved in the collision and would not have been able to leave the scene of the accident; (4) the jury could have found that defendant’s proximity to the collision and his status as the sole non-emergency personnel present indicated his involvement in the collision; (5) defendant told an officer that he could not remember how the collision happened, not that he did not know how the collision occurred; (6) defendant never mentioned anyone else who could have possibly been driving; and (7) pursuant to Miss. R. Evid. 701, the officer testified that he concluded that defendant was driving based on his presence, the presence of emergency responders, and common sense. Travis v. State, 972 So. 2d 674, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 342 (Miss. Ct. App. 2007), cert. denied, 973 So. 2d 244, 2008 Miss. LEXIS 1 (Miss. 2008).

   Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c11s63-11-30ol12c" target="_self">63-11-30(2)(c)</a></cite> requires that the state prove that the first and second offenses were “committed” within five years of the third offense, and the only way to establish this fact is for the state to introduce evidence of the date the first and second offenses were committed; evidence of only the conviction, which does not also contain the date the offense was committed, is not sufficient. Smith v. State, 950 So. 2d 1056, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 111 (Miss. Ct. App. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Because the state did not prove the date of offense for a prior DUI charge, a conviction for felony third offense DUI was not supported by the evidence since there was no proof that two prior convictions were committed within five years of the third offense; however, a remand was appropriate for sentencing under
   Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c11s63-11-30ol12b" target="_self">63-11-30(2)(b)</a></cite> since it was undisputed that defendant had violated §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c11s63-11-30ol11" target="_self">63-11-30(1)</a></cite>.

   Trial court did not err in denying defendant’s motion for a new trial after he was convicted of third offense felony driving under the influence, in violation of Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c11s63-11-30ol11ac" target="_self">63-11-30(1)(a)(c)</a></cite>, where a reasonable juror could have found defendant guilty based on the evidence presented; the arresting officers testified that they observed defendant unsteady on his feet, with red, watery eyes, a dazed stare, and slurred speech.

      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Defendant’s motion for a new trial was properly denied where the state presented sufficient evidence from which a jury could reasonably conclude that he was under the influence of intoxicating liquor to the degree that his motor skills necessary to properly operate a vehicle were impaired; under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c11s63-11-30ol11a" target="_self">63-11-30(1)(a)</a></cite> and (b), the state was not required to prove that he had a certain blood-alcohol content.

      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Defendant’s motion for a new trial on his driving under the influence charge was properly denied because a trooper’s testimony, defendant’s intoxilyzer test, and a uniform traffic ticket revealed that defendant registered a breath-alcohol content of 0.13 percent. McLendon v. State, 945 So. 2d 372, 2006 Miss. LEXIS 548 (Miss. 2006), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">551 U.S. 1145</cite>, <cite class="s_court">127 S. Ct. 3008</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">168 L.

      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Defendant’s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict was properly denied because there was legally sufficient evidence for the trial court to find defendant guilty of DUI; it was established that defendant had a breath-alcohol content of 0.13 percent through the testimony of an officer, a printout from a completed intoxilyzer test, and a uniform traffic ticket. McLendon v. State, 945 So. 2d 372, 2006 Miss. LEXIS 548 (Miss. 2006), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">551 U.S. 1145</cite>, <cite class="s_court">127 S. Ct. 3008</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">168 L.

      </p>
      <p>
       There was sufficient evidence for a driving under the influence conviction, even though there was no scientific evidence of intoxication because an officer’s testimony regarding defendant’s conduct, as well as the reading on a breath test and his refusal to cooperate with an Intoxilyzer test, showed that he was intoxicated; the officer did not have qualify as an expert to so testify.

Further, it was irrelevant that defendant was initially charged under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c11s63-11-30ol11c" target="_self">63-11-30(1)(c)</a></cite> as both subsections (1)(a) and (1)(c) charged defendant with the same crime.

   Verdict finding defendant guilty of DUI manslaughter under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c11s63-11-30" target="_self">63-11-30</a></cite> was not against the weight of the evidence where investigating officers at the accident scene testified to statements that defendant made about how much alcohol he had consumed before the accident; photographs of the accident scene showed that there were empty beer cans inside defendant’s truck and all around the site of the accident; other photographs also showed an unopened six pack of beer inside defendant’s truck; and officers testified that the unopened six pack was cold, and, therefore, very likely purchased close in time to the accident. Testimony of the officers also showed that there was a trail of empty beer cans leading from the point where defendant’s truck started to flip to the point where it landed. Cowart v. State, 910 So. 2d 726, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 218 (Miss. Ct. App. 2005) (Miss. Ct. App. – 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Verdict of felony DUI, third offense, was consistent with the weight of the evidence where defendant was observed driving south in a northbound lane and after being stopped defendant asked to talk to a particular officer for help with that DUI. In addition, three officers testified to the alcohol on defendant’s breath and his bloodshot eyes and a doctor, on cross-examination, refuted the possibility that hypoglycemia could have caused the odor of alcohol on defendant’s breath.

      <p>
       In a prosecution of defendant for vehicular homicide, there was sufficient evidence that defendant was driving a truck at the time of an accident in which his girlfriend’s son was killed, even though no witnesses saw defendant driving; defendant’s girlfriend testified that defendant emphatically refused to allow her son to drive the truck, and the girlfriend witnessed defendant approach the driver’s side and her son approach the passenger’s side.

      <p>
       Record showed that the officer found defendant slumped over the steering wheel with the motor running and that when defendant finally woke up, he was disoriented. Similarly, the officer testified that he could smell a strong odor of alcohol emanating from defendant, that defendant staggered, was very incoherent and admitted to having consumed three beers; even without the breath test, which defendant refused, there was ample evidence to support defendant’s conviction for driving under the influence and defendant’s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict was properly denied.

      <p>
       Evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of driving under the influence, first offense, where defendant exhibited signs of intoxication in front of a police officer, the intoxilyzer test was positive for alcohol consumption, and defendant, at the station, refused on two occasions to give a breath sample for analysis by an intoxilyzer machine. Knight v. City of Aberdeen, 881 So. 2d 926, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 894 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).

      <p>
       State presented evidence that when stopped at a roadblock, defendant had a strong odor of alcohol on his breath, his speech was slurred, he had trouble walking to the back of the vehicle, and a breath alcohol test showed a blood alcohol level of .188; reasonably minded jurors had substantial credible evidence, upon which to find defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of DUI.

      <p>
       Trial court properly found defendant guilty of driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor; although the State was not obligated to offer proof on impairment of defendant’s driving ability, a police officer testified that defendant ran a stop sign and failed to turn off his high beams as he passed the officer.

The State offered proof that defendant ran a stop sign and did not dim his headlights when an officer passed his car, that the officer smelled the odor of alcohol coming from defendant’s vehicle and saw two six-packs of beer inside the car, that defendant was belligerent and hostile to the officer, and that defendant refused to take an intoxilyzer test at the jail.

       Where defendant was found asleep behind the wheel of defendant’s parked car, defendant’s statement to the deputy that defendant had consumed some beer prior to driving the vehicle to its then location, in conjunction with the deputy’s observations of defendant and the results of the intoxilyzer test, provided sufficient evidence that defendant was guilty of operation of a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor.

       Defendant’s challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence basically asserted that the victims’ careless conduct had made the accident unavoidable and that his driving while intoxicated was not a contributing factor to the accident; however, it was not necessary for the State to prove that an intoxicating liquor was a proximate cause or a proximate contributing cause of a death, and the jury was entitled to find that defendant had committed an act of negligence when he chose to driving while intoxicated and caused the death of another.

       Trial court did not err in finding that sufficient probable cause existed for the discovery of defendant’s DUI violation, where the underlying charge for possession of beer, which led to the revealing search and seizure, was dismissed; where the officer testified that an open container was in defendant’s vehicle and defendant admitted he had been drinking, and the officer smelled an intoxicating substance on defendant’s breath, the presence of beer provided sufficient probable cause to conduct a search of defendant and his vehicle.

       Evidence that defendant drove with a blood alcohol content of .20 and was involved in a traffic accident in which a passenger in defendant’s vehicle was killed, was sufficient to support defendant’s conviction for aggravated driving while intoxicated; evidence of blood test results was properly admitted despite the fact that defendant demanded that hospital personnel stop trying to draw a sample of defendant’s blood after a third unsuccessful attempt, as defendant had consented to have the sample drawn.

       Officer’s testimony was sufficient to support the guilty verdict of driving under the influence because the officer testified (1) that the officer smelled alcohol in defendant’s vehicle, on defendant’s breath, and defendant’s clothes; (2) that defendant admitted to consuming alcohol; and (3) that defendant could not pass the field sobriety test, defendant’s gait was impaired, and defendant swayed when standing still.

       A conviction for driving under the influence may be based upon intoxilyzer results if the test is administered in accordance with the proper procedures and the defendant fails to introduce credible evidence which overcomes the statutory presumption of intoxication. Thus, defendants could be convicted on the basis of a breath test which presumed a 2100 to 1 breath to blood ratio where the defendants did not introduce any evidence concerning their particular ratios.

       The evidence was not sufficient to establish that the defendant was guilty of manslaughter by culpable negligence with respect to an automobile accident where the State proved only that the defendant’s car collided with the rear of a pickup truck and that the defendant was driving while intoxicated, the defendant and his passenger testified that the defendant was driving well, and not recklessly, negligently, unlawfully, or at a high rate of speed, and no other witnesses contradicted the testimony of the defendant and his passenger. However, the evidence was sufficient to support a conviction for the lesser included offense of negligently killing another while under the influence of intoxicating liquor. Evans v.

       Jury was properly instructed on the elements of aggravated driving under the influence. Furthermore, the instruction did not constructively amend defendant’s indictment, as the instruction did not substantially alter the elements of proof necessary for a conviction, and did not materially alter the defense by defendant. Friston v. State, 243 So.3d 198, 2017 Miss. App. LEXIS 444 (Miss. Ct. App. 2017), cert. denied, 246 So.3d 71, 2018 Miss. LEXIS 230 (Miss. 2018).

       Jury was properly instructed and returned a guilty verdict that was supported by the evidence at trial because the State presented evidence that defendant was negligent in maintaining her lane of travel, which caused her to lose control of her vehicle and, thereby, caused the victim’s death.

       Trial court did give an erroneous and confusing jury instructions regarding negligence because the negligence instructions, when read as a whole, adequately instructed the jury on the standard of care applicable to defendant.

       Jury was properly instructed on simple negligence, which was enough to support a conviction under this section. Koch v. State, 222 So.3d 1088, 2017 Miss. App. LEXIS 15 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 222 So.3d 312, 2017 Miss. LEXIS 295 (Miss. 2017).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant was properly convicted of felony driving under the influence because the trial court did not err in refusing to instruct on reckless driving, as defendants in the State of Mississippi no longer enjoyed the right to have the jury instructed on a charge for which they were not indicted unless it was included in the charged offense. McCoy v. State, 196 So.3d 1007, 2015 Miss. App. LEXIS 616 (Miss. Ct. App. 2015), cert. denied, 202 So.3d 615, 2016 Miss. LEXIS 325 (Miss. 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a felony driving under the influence (DUI) case, defendant was not entitled to a jury instruction that it was not illegal to drink and drive, because the jury was properly instructed as to the elements of felony DUI and the level of proof required, and there was no evidentiary basis for the instruction, as defendant did not testify at trial that he had not consumed enough alcohol to be considered under the influence; he denied that he had consumed any alcohol on the day of his arrest. Brooks v. State, 999 So. 2d 408, 2008 Miss. App. LEXIS 390 (Miss. Ct. App. 2008), cert. denied, 999 So. 2d 852, 2009 Miss. LEXIS 48 (Miss. 2009).

   In a criminal trial, the jury was properly instructed that the elements required to prove the offense of felony driving under the influence (DUI) in violation of Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c11s63-11-30ol11" target="_self">63-11-30(1)</a></cite> were: (1) defendant was operating a motor vehicle, (2) defendant was under the influence of intoxicating liquor, and (3) defendant had two prior DUI convictions within the past 5 years. Defendant was not entitled to a jury instruction that the alcohol intoxication impaired his ability to operate the vehicle. Heidelberg v. State, 976 So. 2d 948, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 738 (Miss. Ct.

       <p>
   Where jury instructions did not mention defendant’s being under the influence but instead provided that conviction was permitted if defendant did “negligently operate a motor vehicle while having .08% or more blood alcohol by weight volume,” the instruction properly reflected the statutory standard for driving under the influence as set forth in Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c11s63-11-30ol11" target="_self">63-11-30(1)</a></cite>. Sumrall v. State, 955 So. 2d 332, 2006 Miss. App. LEXIS 404 (Miss. Ct.

   Where defendant was tried for one count of negligent operation of a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquors, aggravated assault for his injury of the driver, and five counts of manslaughter by culpable negligence for the deaths of five passengers, he was not entitled to an instruction that aggravated operation of a vehicle while under the influence (DUI), set out in Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c11s63-11-30" target="_self">63-11-30</a></cite>, was a lesser-included offense of manslaughter by culpable negligence. Lawrence v.

       In a prosecution for felony driving under the influence of alcohol causing death arising from an incident in which the defendant struck and killed an elderly man as he walked across a street, it was reversible error to instruct the jury that any contributory negligence of the victim was not a defense to the crime charged unless such negligence was the sole proximate cause of the collision and that the defense of contributory negligence had to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt; such instruction effectively shifted the burden of proof to the defendant.

      <p>
       Double Jeopardy Clause was not violated because the drunk-driving statute established separate crimes for each of the victims identified and the offense of leaving the scene of an accident contained different elements from the offenses established by the drunk-driving statute. Buckner v. State, 135 So.3d 915, 2013 Miss. App. LEXIS 682 (Miss. Ct. App. 2013), cert. denied, 136 So.3d 437, 2014 Miss. LEXIS 201 (Miss. 2014).

      <p>
       Inmate’s convictions for both driving under the influence (DUI) manslaughter and DUI mayhem did not constitute a violation of his double jeopardy rights. The inmate could be convicted for each death or injury that he caused and the accident he was involved in killed one of his passengers and injured four others. Sills v.

       Defendant’s double jeopardy rights were not violated by her convictions for three counts of driving under the influence and negligently causing death because the State was not required to specifically list the substance or substances that defendant allegedly was driving under the influence of at the time of the accident. Defendant was only convicted of one count of driving under the influence of hydrocodone and negligently causing the death or injury of another for each death or injury so caused. Teston v.

       Each offense is separate and distinct in cases of felony DUI enhancement and does not violate the constitutional right against double jeopardy.

       Section 63-11-39, as reinstated, applies to all cases pending from and after effective date. Simpson, Nov. 5, 1992, A.G. Op. #92-0815.
      </p>
      <p>
       Miss. Code Section 63-11-39 does not limit court at trial on merits on ultimate disposition of case; it prohibits reduction of charge at any stage of proceeding, but not dismissals or final verdicts. Cooke, June 9, 1993, A.G. Op. #93-0239.
      </p>
      <p>
       Term “lesser charge” referred to in statute means non-DUI offenses and charge of DUI second or DUI third may be changed by amendment to DUI first or DUI second, if facts warrant. Moffett, July 19, 1993, A.G. Op. #93-0437.
      </p>
      <p>
       Statute only applies to cases where defendant is charged with driving under influence of liquor or alcohol and therefore charge of driving under influence of other substance could be reduced on motion of prosecutor. Clinton, June 30, 1994, A.G. Op. #93-0436.
      </p>
      <p>
       Based on this section, a DUI charge may only be reduced to a non-DUI offense if there is no BAC (blood alcohol content) reading of .10%. If there is no BAC reading, the DUI charge may be reduced by the court on a motion by the prosecutor. Spencer, April 5, 1996, A.G. Op. #96-0154.
      </p>
      <p>
       The amendment to Section 63-11-39 went into effect July 2, 1996. Therefore, no DUI charge may be reduced to a non-DUI charge after July 2, 1996, regardless of when the offense occurred. Emfinger, September 6, 1996, A.G. Op. #96-0617.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under this section, there is no prohibition against reducing a DUI charge if the defendant registers below .10 on the intoxilyzer. Childers, July 8, 1996, A.G. Op. #96-0444.
      </p>
      <p>
       A municipal prosecuting attorney may not request a court to reduce a third offense of driving under the influence charge to a second offense as a municipal court does not have jurisdiction over such a charge; instead, after a probable cause finding, the municipal court should bind such a case over to the grand jury and, once a case has been bound over, it must be heard by the grand jury.

       Sole function of statute was to prohibit reduction of DUI charges to non-DUI charges, the modifying phrase “under this chapter,” signifying DUI offenses, was not repeated after the phrase “to a lesser charge.” Ostrander v. State, 803 So. 2d 1172, 2002 Miss. LEXIS 8 (Miss. 2002).

       Reducing three citations for driving under influence (DUI) in violation of statute precluding such reductions, assessing costs of fines in excess of statutory maximum in six criminal cases, failing to require affidavits in four criminal cases, issuing orders without authority, and allowing cameras in courtroom warranted public reprimand, fine of $2,628, and assessment of costs.

       Justice court judge improperly handled driving under the influence charges (DUI) and acted beyond his legal authority in violation of judicial canons when he reduced charges to possession of beer and whiskey because prosecuting attorney informed him that evidence was not clear as to whether defendant was driving and that he had an agreement with defendant to pay fines on lesser charge.

   Because a urine test was a chemical test under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c11s63-11-3ol1c" target="_self">63-11-3(c)</a></cite> (Rev. 2013), defendant’s refusal to take the test was admissible. Schlepphorst v. State, 201 So.3d 517, 2016 Miss. App. LEXIS 126 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 203 So.3d 1134, 2016 Miss. LEXIS 418 (Miss. 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a driving under the influence case, defendant’s failure to submit to the Intoxilizyer 8000 was properly admitted into evidence where the State submitted sufficient evidence of intoxication. The evidence was relevant and admissible. Nolan v. State, 182 So.3d 484, 2016 Miss. App. LEXIS 21 (Miss. Ct. App. 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       Mention of defendant’s past DUI experiences during the State’s closing argument were not improper because the fact that defendant refused to blow was evidence, which was strengthened by the fact defendant had been through it before and understood the consequences of blowing above the legal limit. Snyder v. State, 174 So.3d 331, 2015 Miss. App. LEXIS 457 (Miss. Ct. App. 2015).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court did not err in allowing the State to mention defendant’s prior DUI’s during an officer’s testimony because the State’s questions were crafted to get to the reason why defendant refused to take the field sobriety and breathalyzer test, which was relevant and admissible; the evidence was admitted to show knowledge and intent because the State mentioned defendant’s prior experience with field sobriety and breathalyzer tests to prove he knew he was intoxicated and would fail the tests. Snyder v. State, 174 So.3d 331, 2015 Miss. App. LEXIS 457 (Miss. Ct. App. 2015).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Evidence was sufficient to support defendant’s driving under the influence conviction where two police officers smelled alcohol emitting from defendant’s vehicle, defendant exhibited physical signs of impairment during field sobriety tests, and defendant refused to submit to an Intoxilyzer test, which was admissible pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c11s63-11-41" target="_self">63-11-41</a></cite>. Lobo v. City of Ridgeland, 135 So.3d 148, 2013 Miss. App. LEXIS 300 (Miss. Ct. App. 2013).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Evidence was sufficient to support defendant’s conviction for common law DUI under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c11s63-11-30ol11a" target="_self">63-11-30(1)(a)</a></cite> (Rev. 2004) as it showed that defendant admitted to the officer who stopped his vehicle that he had drunk two beers while he was driving, that he also admitted that he had drunk liquor and beer earlier in the day, that the officer smelled a strong odor of alcohol coming from defendant and observed defendant’s glassy eyes, and that defendant refused to field sobriety test and the chemical test. Evidence that defendant refused the chemical test was admissible pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c11s63-11-41" target="_self">63-11-41</a></cite> (Rev. 2004) and Miss. R. Evid. 402. Ellis v. State, 77 So.3d 1119, 2011 Miss. App. LEXIS 223 (Miss. Ct. App. 2011), cert. denied, 78 So.3d 906, 2012 Miss. LEXIS 25 (Miss. 2012).
      </p>
      <p>
       During defendant’s trial for DUI, the court did not err in considering defendant’s refusal to submit to a breathalyzer test because the evidence was admissible under the statute and relevant. Knight v. State, 14 So.3d 76, 2009 Miss. App. LEXIS 484 (Miss. Ct. App. 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   In a prosecution for driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor, the admission into evidence under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c11s63-11-41" target="_self">63-11-41</a></cite> of the defendant’s refusal to take a breathalyzer test did not violate the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article 3, § 26 of the Mississippi Constitution, even though the defendant was not specifically warned that his refusal could be admitted into evidence against him; the penalty of introducing a refusal serves an important state interest in encouraging defendants to submit to a chemical test, and as the refusal is physical instead of testimonial, its introduction into evidence violates neither the Fifth Amendment nor § 26. Ricks v. State, 611 So. 2d 212, 1992 Miss. LEXIS 819 (Miss. 1992).

   During defendant’s trial for felony DUI, third offense, the admittance of defendant’s refusal to submit to a breath test was not a violation of his right against self-incrimination under either Miss. Const. Art. 3, § 26 or USCS Const. Amend. 5; thus, defendant’s challenge to the constitutionality of Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c11s63-11-41" target="_self">63-11-41</a></cite> failed. Starkey v. State, 941 So. 2d 899, 2006 Miss. App. LEXIS 827 (Miss. Ct. App. 2006).

     <p>
      The Commissioner of Public Safety, acting in concert with the Mississippi Forensics Laboratory created pursuant to Section 45-1-17, is hereby expressly authorized and directed to determine the equipment and supplies which are adequate and necessary from both a medical and law enforcement standpoint for administration of this chapter. The Commissioner of Public Safety, upon receiving such recommendation from the Mississippi Forensics Laboratory, shall recommend an equipment standard for such equipment to the Department of Finance and Administration. The Department of Finance and Administration, using such a uniform standard for said equipment, shall advertise its intention of purchasing said equipment by one (1) publication in at least one (1) newspaper having general circulation in the State of Mississippi at least ten (10) days before the purchase of such equipment and supplies, and the advertisement shall clearly and distinctly describe the articles to be purchased, and shall receive sealed bids thereon which shall be opened in public at a time and place to be specified in the advertisement.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Department of Finance and Administration shall accept the lowest and best bid for said equipment and supplies; in its discretion, it may reject any and all bids submitted. The lowest and best bid for said equipment and supplies accepted by the Department of Finance and Administration shall be the state-approved price of said equipment for purchase by the state, county and city governments.
     </p>
     <p>
      Title to all such testing equipment in the state purchased hereunder shall remain in the Commissioner of Public Safety regardless of what entity pays the purchase price.
     </p>
     <p>
      The state, counties and municipalities may purchase in the name of the Commissioner of Public Safety such equipment and supplies from other vendors of said equipment and supplies necessary to implement this chapter, provided they purchase of the same quality and standard as certified to the Department of Finance and Administration and approved by the department. However, such equipment and supplies shall not be purchased by the state, counties and municipalities unless it is at a price equivalent to or lower than that approved by the Department of Finance and Administration, pursuant to the bid procedure as outlined herein.

       The omnibus clause in an automobile liability insurance policy which allows the insured to include others as insureds under the policy merely by granting permission to use the vehicle should be construed in the light of the manifest public policy of this state as indicated by the Motor Vehicle Safety-Responsibility Law and the Uninsured Motor Vehicle Law, both of which clearly indicate the legislative policy of protecting the public and providing insurance coverage where persons are injured on the highways of the state.

   Trial court correctly found there was no genuine issue of material fact that an insured made a false warranty and a misrepresentation as to frequent drivers. However, the trial court incorrectly applied the holding in Lyons v. Direct General, 138 So.3d 887 (Miss. 2014), to the present case because the legislature amended Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c15s63-15-3" target="_self">63-15-3</a></cite>, which overruled Lyons. Safeway Ins. Co. v. Dukes, 185 So.3d 977, 2015 Miss. LEXIS 585 (Miss. 2015).

      <p>
       It was proper to reverse a summary judgment entered for an insurer in a passenger’s suit seeking a declaration that a policy covered the default judgment he obtained against the insured’s son because the policy did not comply with minimum-liability coverage requirements; an insurer may not issue an insurance card for use as proof of coverage unless the policy complies with minimum statutory requirements, and if the policy provides no liability coverage for certain drivers, it does not comply. Lyons v. Direct Gen. Ins. Co., 138 So.3d 887, 2014 Miss. LEXIS 100 (Miss. 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       Mandatory liability insurance requirement pertains to vehicles, not owners or operators; every vehicle operated within the State must have the statutorily required minimum-coverage requirements of $25,000 for injury to one person, $50,000 for injury to two or more people, and $25,000 for property damage, and a liability policy that purports to exclude that coverage for certain drivers fails to comply with the statutory mandate.

       Car rental agency was not alleged to have known of or to have had a duty to suspect any recklessness about the renter, and the renter’s valid license was inspected, and the required information was recorded on the rental contract; the car rental agency was a self-insurer and a clause recognizing the applicability of state motor-vehicle responsibility laws was printed on the reverse side of the rental agreement signed by the renter.

       At the time of the decedents’ accident, there was absolutely no evidence to suggest that the Mississippi Department of Transportation (MDOT) vehicle was in transit or was involved in any mode of transportation, that an MDOT employee was behind the steering wheel, that the vehicle’s engine was running, or that an MDOT employee was driving or using the vehicle for any purpose related or incident to transportation; the vehicle was stationary and off the roadway while the bucket was used to attempt to push the tree down and the vehicle’s purpose, at the time in question, was to allow the MDOT employees to maneuver the equipment permanently attached, i.e., the lift platform, for purposes unrelated to transportation services; therefore, there was insufficient evidence for the jury to conclude that the accident arose from the use of the MDOT vehicle.

       A violation of the statute occurs only when both the owner and operator fail to have proof of insurance; therefore, there is no violation if the operator has proof of insurance that covers his operation of the vehicle but the owner does not, or if the owner of the motor vehicle has proof of insurance in the vehicle but the operator does not.

      </p>
      <p>
       If a defendant was ticketed for a violation of the statute and later obtained liability insurance as required by law, the violator should be fined $ 100.00; however, that fine, or a portion thereof, may be suspended by the judge. Fountain, Apr. 13, 2001, A.G. Op. #01-0217.

       Evidence of insurance coverage must be presented on the hearing date, or the date of payment of the fine, in order to have the fine reduced or waived. Markopoulos, Oct. 29, 2004, A.G. Op. 04-0513.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the requirements of subsection (5) of this section are met, the fine for not showing proof of liability insurance at the time of a traffic stop shall be reduced to one hundred dollars or waived, whichever is appropriate under the statute, either on the hearing date or on the date of payment of the fine. Miller, Aug. 27, 2004, A.G. Op. 04-0432 is withdrawn. Dawson, Dec. 17, 2004, A.G. Op. 04-0578.

      <p>
       The “hearing date” in this section is the date on which the charge was heard by the court. The “date of payment of the fine” is the date the court, at sentencing, ordered the fine to be paid. Thus, if the owner, on either date, shows proof that he purchased liability insurance subsequent to receiving the citation the fine should be reduced to $100.00; if he, on either date, shows proof that the insurance was in effect at the time he received the citation the fine and court costs should be waived. Lawrence, Apr. 8, 2005, A.G. Op. 05-0053.
      </p>
      <p>
       In order to have a fine reduced or waived under the terms of Section 63-15-4(5), proof of coverage must have been produced at the hearing date or the date the court ordered the fine to be paid in its sentence. Therefore, a judge has no authority to alter or reduce a fine where a defendant furnished proof that coverage was obtained after he was tried, found guilty and sentenced. Darby, May 10, 2005, A.G. Op. 05-0078.

       Legislature possesses the sole power to authorize exclusions, and automobile insurers are not free to escape the statutorily required minimum-liability coverage simply by inserting an exclusion of their choice, no matter how well-reasoned, into their policies; arguments for exceptions to clear statutory requirements should be made to the Legislature, not the supreme court.

       Mandatory liability insurance requirement pertains to vehicles, not owners or operators; every vehicle operated within the State must have the statutorily required minimum-coverage requirements of $25,000 for injury to one person, $50,000 for injury to two or more people, and $25,000 for property damage, and a liability policy that purports to exclude that coverage for certain drivers fails to comply with the statutory mandate.

       It was proper to reverse a summary judgment entered for an insurer in a passenger’s suit seeking a declaration that a policy covered the default judgment he obtained against the insured’s son because the policy did not comply with minimum-liability coverage requirements; an insurer may not issue an insurance card for use as proof of coverage unless the policy complies with minimum statutory requirements, and if the policy provides no liability coverage for certain drivers, it does not comply.

   A state motor vehicle safety responsibility statute providing that an unsatisfied automobile accident judgment is a ground for suspension of the judgment debtor’s license and registration, even if the debtor has received a discharge in bankruptcy after the rendering of the judgment, has both the effect and the purpose of frustrating federal law under the Bankruptcy Act (11 USCS §§ 1 et seq.) and is therefore invalid under the supremacy clause of the Constitution.

      </h4>
      <p>
       Pursuant to
   Section 1-1-109, the Joint Legislative Committee on Compilation, Revision and Publication of Legislation corrected two typographical errors in the version effective until January 1, 2017, in (2)(a) by substituting “coverage is granted” for “coverage granted” and in (6)(d) by substituting “application for the policy” for “application the policy.” The Joint Committee ratified the correction at its August 5, 2016, meeting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 21 of ch. 328, Laws of 2016, effective July 1, 2016 (approved April 4, 2016), amended this section. Section 2 of ch. 410, Laws of 2016, effective January 1, 2017 (approved April 11, 2016), also amended this section. The amendments to this section do not conform and do not meet the Joint Legislative Committee on Compilation, Revision and Publication of Legislation’s criteria for integration. As set out above, this section reflects the language of Section 21 of ch. 328, Laws of 2016, effective until January 1, 2017, and Section 2 of ch. 410, Laws of 2016, effective January 1, 2017, pursuant to
   Section 1-3-79, which provides that whenever the same section of law is amended by different bills during the same legislative session,
   the amendment with the latest effective date shall supersede all other amendments to the same section taking effect earlier.

      <p>
       The first 2016 amendment (ch. 328), effective July 1, 2016, until January 1, 2017, substituted “in the policy” for “therein” near the end of (1), near the beginning of (2)(b), in (3), and in (6); deleted “is thereby to be” preceding “granted” in (2)(a); in (4), substituted “for the policy” for “therefor”; substituted “under the policy” for “thereunder” in (4) and (9); substituted “workers’ compensation law” for “workmen’s compensation law” in (5)(a) and (b); substituted “amount of the settlement” for “amount thereof” in (6)(c); added (12); and made minor stylistic changes throughout.
      </p>
      <p>
       The second 2016 amendment (ch. 410), effective January 1, 2017, substituted “operator’s motor vehicle liability policy, that has been certified” for “operator’s policy of liability insurance certified” in (1); in (2), inserted “motor vehicle liability” in the introductory paragraph, rewrote (a), which read: “Shall designate by explicit description or by appropriate reference all motor vehicles with respect to which coverage is thereby to be granted,” in (b), deleted “pay on behalf of the insured named therein and any other person, as insured, using any such motor vehicle or motor vehicles with the express or implied permission of such named insured, all sums which the insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use of such motor vehicle or motor vehicles within the United States of America or the Dominion of Canada, subject to limits exclusive of interest and costs, with respect to each such motor vehicle, as follows” following “Shall” and inserted “have limits of liability no less than” thereafter; deleted former (3) through (5), which required liability insurance pay sums that insured was legally obligated to pay as damages arising out of use of insured’s use of motor vehicle, included requisite information to be stated in policy and provided certain excluded liabilities; redesignated former (6) through (11) as (3) through (8); and in (3), inserted “certified under the provisions of this chapter” in the introductory paragraph.

       Mississippi’s Uninsured Motorist Act (UM Act) was designed to fill three gaps in coverage that were left after enactment of Mississippi’s Safety Responsibility Act: negligent drivers would often fail to purchase liability insurance mandated by law; denial of coverage on basis of uninsured motorist exclusions or policy breaches; and tortfeasor sometimes happened to be hit-and-run driver.

   Where a county hospital and its employee were sued in tort for injuries related to a car accident that occurred when the employee was running an errand for her employer, the dismissal of the employee from the action under the Mississippi Tort Claims Act did not act as a release of her insurance company.

       The rule that a permittee may not allow a third party to use a named insured’s automobile does not preclude recovery under the omnibus clause where first permittee has “broad and unfettered domination” over the insured automobile, and the permission from the insured may be implied particularly where the operation by the second permittee serves some purpose of the first permittee.

       In enacting Mississippi’s Uninsured Motorist Act (UM Act), Mississippi legislature intended to put “first accident” insureds in as good a position as they would have been in had uninsured motorist purchased automobile liability insurance pursuant to terms of Mississippi’s Safety Responsibility Act. Boatner v. Atlanta Specialty Ins. Co., 115 F.3d 1248, 1997 U.S. App. LEXIS 22634 (5th Cir. Miss. 1997).

      <p>
       <p>
   Language in an insurance policy limiting uninsured motorist (UM) coverage to injury or damage caused by an accident “arising out of the operation, maintenance or use of an uninsured motor vehicle” did not impermissibly narrow the limits of UM coverage intended under Mississippi’s UM statute (§<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.83.html#t83c11s83-11-101" target="_blank">83-11-101</a></cite> et seq.); although the UM statute does not specifically set out the connection that must exist between the injury and the uninsured vehicle, §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.83.html#t83c11s83-11-101" target="_blank">83-11-101</a></cite> states that the limits of UM coverage shall be no less than those set forth in the Motor Vehicle Safety Responsibility Law (§<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c15s63-15-1" target="_self">63-15-1</a></cite> et seq.), which provides in part that an owner’s liability insurance policy which has been certified as proof of financial responsibility shall pay damages “arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use of such motor vehicle” (§<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c15s63-15-43ol12b" target="_self">63-15-43(2)(b)</a></cite>), and therefore the UM policy language satisfied the intent and purpose of the UM statute by affording a person injured by an uninsured motorist the same protection he or she would have if injured by a financially responsible driver.

      </p>
      <p>
       Where uninsured motorist benefits were written into an assigned risk policy through operation of law, the imposed coverage would be the statutory minimum of $10,000 per vehicle, rather than the amount contracted in a previously canceled policy, where there was no evidence that either party intended to reinstate the policy limits contained in the former policy; since coverage was written into the contract by operation of law, so was the amount of coverage. Harris v. Magee, 573 So. 2d 646, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 900 (Miss. 1990), overruled in part, Meyers v. Am. States Ins. Co., 914 So. 2d 669, 2005 Miss. LEXIS 322 (Miss. 2005).

       Clause in uninsured motorist provision of automobile insurance policy providing that insured may not recover for expenses for medical services payable under separate provision of policy does not reduce policy’s uninsured motorist limit below statutory minimum, but merely provides that insured would not be paid for medical expenses twice, once under medical payment coverage and again under uninsured motorist provision.

       Under Mississippi law, radius limitation in commercial truckers policy that excluded coverage for accidents occurring more than 50 miles from “the town” of principal garaging of insured vehicle was not rendered ambiguous when read in conjunction with declarations page that identified both town of principal garaging and territory in which it was located.

       Proof of financial responsibility may be furnished by filing a bond with the department, accompanied by the statutory recording fee of the chancery clerk to cover the cost of recordation of the notice provided for herein. The bond may be either a surety bond with a surety company authorized to do business within the state or a bond with at least two individual sureties each owning real estate within the state not exempt under the constitution or laws of the State of Mississippi and together having equities equal in value to at least twice the amount of such bond. In cases of a bond with two individual sureties, such real estate shall be scheduled and a description thereof shall appear in the bond approved by the clerk of the chancery court of the county or counties in which the real estate is located and also approved by the tax collector of the county or counties where the property is situated as being free from any delinquent tax liens. Such bond shall be conditioned for payments in amounts and under the same circumstances as would be required in a motor vehicle liability policy, and shall not be cancellable except after five days’ written notice is received by the department. However, cancellation shall not prevent recovery with respect to any right or cause of action arising prior to the date of cancellation.

     <p>
      In all cases, under this chapter, in which a person is required to furnish proof of financial responsibility, he shall maintain such proof for a period of three years, except as otherwise required or permitted in this section. The department shall, upon request, consent to the immediate cancellation of any bond or certificate of insurance, or the department shall direct and the state treasurer shall return to the person entitled thereto any money or securities deposited pursuant to this chapter as proof of financial responsibility, or the department shall waive the requirement of filing proof, in any of the following events:
     </p>
     <p>
      at any time after three years from the date such proof was required when, during the three-year period preceding the request, the department has not received record of a conviction or a forfeiture of bail which would require or permit the suspension or revocation of the license or nonresident’s operating privilege of the person by or for whom such proof was furnished; or
     </p>
     <p>

     </p>
     <p>
      in the event the person who has given proof surrenders his license to the department.
     </p>
     <p>
      However, the department shall not consent to the cancellation of any bond or the return of any money or securities in the event any action for damages upon a liability covered by such proof is then pending or any judgment upon any such liability is then unsatisfied, or in the event the person who has filed such bond or deposited such money or securities has, within one year immediately preceding such request, been involved as an operator or owner in any motor vehicle accident resulting in injury or damage to the person or property of others. An affidavit of the applicant as to the nonexistence of such facts, or that he has been released from all of his liability, or has been finally adjudicated not to be liable, for such injury or damage, shall be sufficient evidence thereof in the absence of evidence to the contrary in the records of the department.
     </p>
     <p>
      Whenever any person whose proof has been cancelled or returned under provision (c) of this section applies for a license within a period of three years from the date proof was originally required, any such application shall be refused unless the applicant shall reestablish such proof for the remainder of such three-year period.

      Insurance companies, authorized to issue motor vehicle liability policies in this state, shall establish an administrative agency and make necessary reasonable rules in connection therewith, relative to the formation of a plan and procedure to provide a means by which insurance may be assigned to an authorized insurance company for a person required by this chapter to show proof of financial responsibility for the future and who is in good faith entitled to motor vehicle liability insurance in this state, but is unable to secure it through ordinary methods. Such insurance companies shall establish a plan and procedure for the equitable apportionment among such authorized companies of applicants for such policies and for motor vehicle liability policies, including, but not limited to, voluntary agreements by insurance companies to accept such assignments. The premium for assigned risk plans shall not exceed the basic manual rate for risks of like classification at time of application, plus any surcharge as set by the insurance commission. When any such plan has been approved by the insurance commission, all insurance companies authorized to issue motor vehicle liability policies in the State of Mississippi, shall subscribe thereto and participate therein.

      The insurance commission may determine, fix, prescribe, promulgate, change, and amend rates or minimum premiums normally applicable to a risk so as to apply to any and every assignment such rates and minimum premiums as are commensurate with the greater hazard of the risk, considering in connection therewith the experience, physical or other conditions of such risk of the person applying for insurance under any such plan.

       If the operator of a motor vehicle being operated on the public roads, streets or highways of the State of Mississippi or registered in the State of Mississippi has been found failing to have motor vehicle liability insurance in at least the minimum amounts required under Section 63-15-3(j), it is a misdemeanor and, upon conviction, is punishable by a fine of One Hundred Dollars ($100.00) and suspension of driving privilege for a period of one (1) year or until the owner of the motor vehicle shows proof of liability insurance that is in compliance with the liability limits required by Section 63-15-3(j) and has paid the fines and assessments imposed and the driver’s license reinstatement fees imposed by the Department of Public Safety. A judge shall determine whether the defendant is indigent, and if a determination of indigence is made, shall authorize the reinstatement of that person’s driver’s license upon proof of mandatory liability insurance subject to compliance with a payment plan for any fines, assessments and/or fees. If such fines are levied in a municipal court, the funds from such fines shall be deposited in the general fund of the municipality.

       The highway patrol had no authority to deliver a stolen pickup truck, which had an altered vehicle identification number and had been seized from an innocent purchaser pursuant to a valid search warrant, to an insurance company, which had paid the owner the full value of the truck under a theft loss insurance policy and was therefore the lawful owner of the vehicle, absent court approval with no advance notice to the innocent purchaser of its intent to do so and without giving him an opportunity to contest the matter in a court of competent jurisdiction; the appropriate procedure would have been for the highway patrol, once the truck served no further purpose in the criminal investigation or prosecution, to make a motion in the justice court for authority to release it to the insurance company, and to give the innocent purchaser and the insurance company reasonable notice of such application and an opportunity to be heard; however, the circuit court erred in directing return of the pickup truck to the innocent purchaser without making the insurance company a party to the hearing or giving it any notice of the proceeding, as this was a blatant violation of the insurance company’s right to due process.

       Pursuant to Section 1-1-109, the Joint Legislative Committee on Compilation, Revision and Publication of Legislation corrected a reference appearing in the amendment made to this section by § 11 of ch. 418, Laws 2000. Section 11 of ch. 418 amended the section by substituting “Sections 63-17-51 through 63-17-121” for “Sections 63-17-51 through 63-17-105.” However, as directed by the Joint Committee, the reference to “Sections 63-17-51 through 63-17-121” was changed to “Sections 63-17-51 through 63-17-119.” The Joint Committee ratified the correction at its June 29, 2000 meeting.

     <p>
      The legislature finds and declares that the distribution and sales of motor vehicles in the State of Mississippi vitally affects the general economy of the state and the public interest and the public welfare. The legislature further finds and declares that it is necessary, in the exercise of its police power, to regulate and to license motor vehicle manufacturers, factory branches and divisions, distributors, distributor branches and divisions, distributor representatives, wholesalers, wholesaler branches and divisions, dealers and salesmen doing business in the State of Mississippi in order (1) to prevent frauds, unfair practices, discrimination, impositions and other abuses upon the citizens of the State of Mississippi, (2) to avoid undue control of the independent motor vehicle dealer by motor vehicle manufacturing and distributing organizations, (3) to foster and keep alive vigorous and healthy competition, (4) to prevent the creation or perpetuation of monopolies, (5) to prevent the practice of requiring the buying of special features, accessories, special models, appliances and equipment not desired by a motor vehicle dealer or the ultimate purchaser, (6) to prevent false and misleading advertising, (7) to promote and keep alive a sound system of distribution of motor vehicles to the public, and (8) to promote the public safety and welfare.

       Pursuant to Section 1-1-109, the Joint Legislative Committee on Compilation, Revision and Publication of Legislation corrected a typographical error in the first sentence. The word “the” was inserted between “to” and “credit” so that “shall be deposited in the State Treasury to credit of a special fund” now reads as “shall be deposited in the State Treasury to the credit of a special fund.” The Joint Committee ratified the correction at its May 16, 2002 meeting.

       § 63-17-75.
    Applications for licenses [Effective until July 1, 2019].
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Within ninety (90) days after July 1, 1970, all persons who on July 1, 1970, are engaged in a business or occupation for which a license is required under the Mississippi Motor Vehicle Commission Law shall make application on forms prescribed by the commission for their respective licenses. All such persons shall be permitted, without a license, to continue to engage in the business or occupation for which a license is applied for until the license is either granted or, in case it is denied, until the applicant has exhausted or has had an opportunity to exhaust all of his remedies under Section 63-17-99. No person not engaged in a business or occupation requiring such a license on July 1, 1970, shall be permitted to engage in such business or occupation until he shall have first obtained a license to engage in such business or occupation.
     </p>
     <p>
      Applications for licenses shall be verified by the oath or affirmation of the applicants and shall be on forms prescribed by the commission and furnished to such applicants. Applications shall contain such information as the commission deems necessary to enable it to fully determine the qualifications and eligibility of the several applicants to receive the license or licenses applied for. The commission shall require that there be set forth in each application information relating to the applicant’s financial standing, the applicant’s business integrity, whether the applicant has an established place of business and is primarily engaged in the pursuit, avocation or business for which a license or licenses is applied for, and whether the applicant is able to properly conduct the business for which a license or licenses is applied for, and such other pertinent information consistent with the safeguarding of the public interest and public welfare. Applications for license as a motor vehicle dealer shall, in addition to the foregoing, be accompanied by the filing with the commission of a bona fide contract or franchise then in effect between the applicant and a manufacturer, distributor or wholesaler of the new motor vehicle or vehicles proposed to be dealt in, unless such contract or franchise has already been filed with the commission in connection with a previous application made by such applicant, in which event the applicant shall, in lieu of again filing the contract or franchise, identify the contract or franchise by appropriate reference and file all revisions and additions, if any, which have been made to said contract or franchise. The applicant must furnish satisfactory evidence that he or it maintains adequate space in the building or structure wherein his or its established business is conducted for the display of new motor vehicles, or he will have such facilities within a reasonable time after receiving a license, and that he or it has or will have adequate facilities in said building or structure for the repair and servicing of motor vehicles and the storage of new parts and accessories for same. However, the failure to furnish the evidence called for in the preceding sentence shall not constitute sufficient cause for denying a license to any motor vehicle dealer who on July 1, 1970, was an enfranchised new motor vehicle dealer in this state of a manufacturer, distributor or wholesaler of new motor vehicles and who continued to be such a dealer from such date until application was made for a license as a motor vehicle dealer.
     </p>
     <p>
      New applications for licenses as a new, used or wholesale motor vehicle dealer shall, in addition to the foregoing, be accompanied by the filing with the commission of a corporate surety bond in the penal sum of Twenty-five Thousand Dollars ($25,000.00) on a bond form approved by the commission. However, an applicant for licenses at multiple locations may choose to provide a corporate surety bond in the penal sum of One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000.00) covering all licensed locations of the same capacity in lieu of separate bonds for each location.
     </p>
     <p>
      The bond shall be in effect upon the applicant being licensed and shall be conditioned upon his complying with the provisions of the Mississippi Motor Vehicle Commission Law. The bond shall be an indemnity for any loss sustained by any person by reason of the acts of the person bonded when those acts constitute grounds for the suspension or revocation of license. The bond shall be executed in the name of the State of Mississippi for the benefit of any aggrieved party. The aggregate liability of the surety for any claimants, regardless of the number of years this bond is in force or has been in effect, shall not exceed the amount of the bond. The proceeds of the bond shall be paid upon receipt by the commission of a final judgment from a Mississippi court of competent jurisdiction against the principal and in favor of an aggrieved party.
     </p>
     <p>
      New, used and wholesale motor vehicle dealers shall be required to maintain motor vehicle liability insurance providing blanket coverage on vehicles operated on the public streets and highways of this state, including vehicles in dealership inventory. Evidence of liability insurance for business and inventory vehicles shall be filed with the application for license, and the application for license shall be denied if proof of liability insurance satisfactory to the Department of Revenue is not provided.

    License of salesman.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Every motor vehicle salesman shall have his license upon his person, or displayed at his place of employment, except as hereinafter provided, when engaged in his business, and shall display the same upon request. The name and business address of the employer of such salesman shall be stated on the license.
     </p>
     <p>
      In case of a change of employer the following procedure shall be adhered to:
     </p>
     <p>
      The licensee shall within three (3) days following such change mail or deliver his license to the commission for its endorsement of such change thereon. The license shall be accompanied by a fee of Two Dollars and Fifty Cents ($2.50) for endorsing each such change of employer and a written statement of the licensee setting forth the name and business address of his new employer, the date his employment terminated with his last employer, and the date his employment commenced with his new employer.
     </p>
     <p>
      The last employer of the licensee shall, within three (3) days following the termination of employment of the licensee, make a report to the commission setting forth the reason or reasons why the services of the licensee were terminated and such other information as may be required by the commission.
     </p>
     <p>
      Upon receipt by the commission of the licensee’s license and fee and his last employer’s report, the commission shall immediately make an appropriate endorsement on said license showing the change of employer and mail the license, as endorsed, to the licensee unless the commission has grounds to believe and does believe that the licensee is no longer qualified under the provisions of the Mississippi Motor Vehicle Commission Law as a motor vehicle salesman. Under such circumstances the commission shall immediately notify him and his new employer in writing that a hearing will be held for the purpose of determining whether his license should be revoked or suspended, specifying the grounds for revocation or suspension, as the case may be, and the time and place for the hearing. Such hearing and any and all appeals by the licensee with respect thereto shall be in accordance with the provisions of Sections 63-17-89 through 63-17-99.
     </p>
     <p>
      If, after the commission receives the licensee’s license and fee and his last employer’s report, the executive director of the commission cannot for any reason endorse and mail to the licensee his license within a period of three (3) days following the receipt by the commission of the licensee’s license and fee and his last employer’s report, then and in that event he shall mail to the licensee a permit in such form as the commission shall prescribe, which permit shall serve in lieu of a license until such time as the commission endorses and mails the license to the licensee or until such time as the licensee’s license is revoked or suspended in accordance with the provisions of the Mississippi Motor Vehicle Commission Law. If the license is ultimately revoked or suspended then immediately upon such revocation or suspension the licensee shall return said permit to the commission for cancellation.
     </p>
     <p>
      The commission shall maintain a permanent file with respect to each licensed motor vehicle salesman. Each such file shall contain all pertinent information with respect to the fitness and qualifications of each such licensee for the use by the commission in from time to time determining whether his license should be revoked or suspended.
     </p>
     <p>
      There is no intent under the Mississippi Motor Vehicle Commission Law to prevent a salesman who has not previously been licensed or a transferee salesman from selling during the time required to process his application. Such applicant shall be allowed to sell from the date of employment as long as he and his dealer follow the procedure for license application.

    Grounds for denial, revocation, or suspension of license; assessment of civil penalty in lieu of suspension of license; collection and disposition of penalty.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The commission may deny an application for a license, or revoke or suspend a license after it has been granted, for any of the following reasons:
     </p>
     <p>
      On satisfactory proof of unfitness of the applicant or the licensee, as the case may be, under the standards established and set out in the Mississippi Motor Vehicle Commission Law.
     </p>
     <p>
      For fraud practiced or any material misstatement made by an applicant in any application for license under the provisions of Section 63-17-75.
     </p>
     <p>
      For any willful failure to comply with any provision of said law or with any rule or regulation promulgated by the commission under authority vested in it by said law.
     </p>
     <p>
      Change of condition after license is granted or failure to maintain the qualifications for license.
     </p>
     <p>
      Continued or flagrant violation of any of the provisions of said law or of any of the rules or regulations of the commission.
     </p>
     <p>
      For any willful violation of any law relating to the sale, distribution or financing of motor vehicles.
     </p>
     <p>
      Willfully defrauding any retail buyer to the buyer’s damage.
     </p>
     <p>
      Willful failure to perform any written agreement with any retail buyer.
     </p>
     <p>
      Being a manufacturer who, for the protection of the buying public, fails to specify the delivery and preparation obligations of its motor vehicle dealers prior to delivery of new motor vehicles to retail buyers. A copy of the delivery and preparation obligations of its motor vehicle dealers and a schedule of the compensation to be paid to its motor vehicle dealers for the work and services they shall be required to perform in connection with such delivery and preparation obligations shall be filed with the commission by every licensed motor vehicle manufacturer and shall constitute any such dealer’s only responsibility for product liability as between such dealer and such manufacturer. The compensation as set forth on said schedule shall be reasonable and the reasonableness thereof shall be subject to the approval of the commission. Any mechanical, body or parts defects arising from any express or implied warranties of any such manufacturer shall constitute such manufacturer’s product or warranty liability.
     </p>
     <p>
      On satisfactory proof that any manufacturer, distributor, wholesaler, distributor branch or division, factory branch or division, or wholesaler branch or division has unfairly and without due regard to the equities of the parties or to the detriment of the public welfare failed to properly fulfill any warranty agreement or to adequately and fairly compensate any of its motor vehicle dealers for labor, parts and/or incidental expenses incurred by any such dealer with regard to factory warranty agreements performed by any such dealer. In no event shall any such manufacturer, distributor, wholesaler, distributor branch or division, factory branch or division, or wholesaler branch or division pay to any of its motor vehicle dealers a labor rate per hour for warranty work less than that charged by any such dealer to its retail customers. No such dealer shall charge to its manufacturer, distributor, wholesaler, distributor branch or division, factory branch or division, or wholesaler branch or division, a labor rate per hour in excess of the rate charged to its retail customers. All claims made by motor vehicle dealers hereunder for such labor, parts and/or incidental expenses shall be paid within thirty (30) days following their approval. All such claims shall be either approved or disapproved within thirty (30) days after their receipt, and when any such claim is disapproved the motor vehicle dealer who submits it shall be notified in writing of its disapproval within said period, and each such notice shall state the specific grounds upon which the disapproval is based.
     </p>
     <p>
      For the commission of any act prohibited by Sections 63-17-73 through 63-17-83 or the failure to perform any of the requirements of said sections.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the commission finds, after notice and hearing in the manner provided for under the Mississippi Motor Vehicle Commission Law, that there is sufficient cause upon which to base the revocation of the license of any licensee involved in the hearing, the commission may in lieu of revoking such license assess a civil penalty against the guilty licensee not to exceed ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00). If the commission finds, after such notice and hearing, that sufficient cause exists for the suspension only of the license of any licensee, the commission may in lieu of suspending such license assess a civil penalty against the guilty licensee of not less than fifty dollars ($50.00) nor more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) per day for each day such license would otherwise be suspended. However, the amount of such penalty shall not exceed an aggregate of seven thousand five hundred dollars ($7,500.00). Failure of the licensee to pay all penalties so assessed within the time allowed by the commission for the payment thereof, which time shall in no case exceed ninety (90) days from the date of the commission’s order making such assessment, shall, unless an appeal is taken and perfected within the time and in the manner provided by the Mississippi Motor Vehicle Commission Law, result in an automatic revocation of such licensee’s license. Any such penalties assessed by the commission remaining unpaid at the expiration of the time for payment may be recovered by an action in the name of the commission. All such actions shall be brought by the attorney general of the State of Mississippi upon the written request of the commission to do so, and shall be brought in the chancery court of the county or the chancery court of the judicial district of the county to which the commission’s order making such assessment is appealable under the provisions of Section 63-17-99. All civil penalties assessed and collected by the commission under the authority of this subsection shall be deposited in the general fund of the state treasury.

       Pursuant to Section 1-1-109, the Joint Legislative Committee on Compilation, Revision and Publication of Legislation corrected a typographical error in the first sentence of paragraph (i). The word “retain” was changed to “retail” so that “delivery of new motor vehicles to retain buyers” now reads as “delivery of new motor vehicles to retail buyers.” The Joint Committee ratified the correction at its May 16, 2002 meeting.

       § 63-17-99.
    Appeals from decisions of commission; finality of decisions.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The following procedure shall govern in taking and perfecting appeals:
     </p>
     <p>
      1. Any person who is a party to any hearing before the commission and who is aggrieved by any decision of the commission with respect to any hearing before it shall have the right of appeal to the chancery court of the county of such person’s residence or principal place of business within this state; if such person is a nonresident of the state he shall have the right of appeal to the chancery court of the residence of the opposing party, and if the opposing party is also a nonresident, the appeal shall be to the Chancery Court of the First Judicial District of Hinds County, Mississippi. All such appeals shall be taken and perfected within sixty days from the date of the decision of the commission which is the subject of the appeal. The chancery court to which such appeal is taken may affirm such decision or reverse and remand the same to the commission for further proceedings as justice may require or dismiss such decision. All such appeals shall be taken and perfected, heard and determined, either in term time or in vacation, on the record, including a transcript of pleadings and evidence, both oral and documentary, heard and filed before the commission. In perfecting any such appeal, the provisions of law respecting notice to the reporter and allowance of bills of exceptions, now or hereafter in force, respecting appeals from the chancery court to the supreme court shall be applicable. The reporter shall transcribe his notes, taken stenographically or by machine, and file the record with the commission within thirty days after approval of the appeal bond, unless, on application of the reporter, or of the appellant, an additional fifteen days shall have been allowed by the commission to the reporter within which to transcribe his notes and file the transcript of the record with the commission.
     </p>
     <p>
      2. Upon the filing with the commission of a petition of appeal to the proper chancery court, it shall be the duty of the commission, as promptly as possible, and in any event within sixty days after approval of the appeal bond, to file with the clerk of said Chancery Court to which the appeal is taken, a copy of the petition for appeal and of the decision appealed from, and the original and one copy of the transcript of the record of the proceedings and evidence before the commission. After the filing of said petition, the appeal shall be perfected by the filing of a bond in the penal sum of five hundred dollars ($500.00) with two sureties or with a surety company qualified to do business in Mississippi as surety, conditioned to pay the costs of such appeal, said bond to be approved by any member of the commission or by its executive secretary or by the clerk of the chancery court to which such appeal is taken.
     </p>
     <p>
      3. No decision of the commission made as a result of a hearing shall become final with respect to any party affected and aggrieved by such decision until such party shall have exhausted or shall have had an opportunity to exhaust all of his remedies. However, any such decision may be made final if the commission finds that failure to do so would be detrimental to the public interest or public welfare; however, the finality of any such decision shall not prevent any party or parties affected and aggrieved thereby to appeal the same in accordance with the appellate procedure set forth in this section.

       It was not arbitrary or capricious for the Mississippi Motor Vehicle Commission to dismiss a competitor’s contest of a manufacturer’s approval of a dealer’s relocation because (1) the competitor was not entitled to notice either statutorily or under the competitor’s Dealer Sales and Service Agreement (SSA), as the competitor’s SSA was not modified, and (2) the competitor only speculated that the competitor’s Area of Primary Responsibility would change.

       Although the Mississippi Motor Vehicle Warranty Enforcement Act does share some characteristics with the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act, when the statutes as a whole are compared to the Magnuson-Moss Act, the Mississippi Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) is most analogous. Therefore, a trial court erred by finding that the claims filed by two vehicle purchasers were barred by the statute of limitations because a six-year limitations period under the UCC applied.

     <p>
      The Legislature recognizes that a motor vehicle is a major consumer purchase and that a defective motor vehicle creates a hardship for the consumer. The Legislature further recognizes that a duly franchised motor vehicle dealer is an agent of the manufacturer. It is the intent of the Legislature that a good faith motor vehicle warranty complaint by a consumer should be resolved by the manufacturer, or its agent, within a specified period of time. It is further the intent of the Legislature to provide the statutory procedures whereby a consumer may receive a replacement motor vehicle, or a full refund, for a motor vehicle which cannot be brought into conformity with the express warranty issued by the manufacturer. However, nothing in Sections 63-17-151 et seq. shall in any way limit the rights or remedies which are otherwise available to a consumer under any other law.

The subtraction of a reasonable allowance for use shall apply when either a replacement or refund of the motor vehicle occurs. A reasonable allowance for use shall be that sum of money arrived at by multiplying the number of miles the motor vehicle has been driven by the consumer by Twenty Cents (20¢) per mile.

After delivery of the vehicle to the designated repair facility by the consumer, the manufacturer shall have ten (10) working days to conform the motor vehicle to the express warranty. Upon notification from the consumer that the vehicle has not been conformed to the express warranty, the manufacturer shall inform the consumer if an informal dispute settlement procedure has been established by the manufacturer in accordance with Section 63-17-163, and provide the consumer with a copy of the provisions of Sections 63-17-151 et seq. However, if prior notice by the manufacturer of an informal dispute settlement procedure has been given, no further notice is required. If the manufacturer fails to notify the consumer of the availability of this informal dispute settlement procedure, the requirements of Section 63-17-163 shall not apply.

       If a consumer finally prevails in any action brought under Sections 63-17-151 et seq., the court may allow him to recover as part of the judgment a sum equal to the aggregate amount of costs and expenses, including attorney’s fees based on actual time expended, determined by the court to have been reasonably incurred by the plaintiff for or in connection with the commencement and prosecution of such action.

       Although the Mississippi Motor Vehicle Warranty Enforcement Act does share some characteristics with the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act, when the statutes as a whole are compared to the Magnuson-Moss Act, the Mississippi Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) is most analogous. Therefore, a trial court erred by finding that the claims filed by two vehicle purchasers were barred by the statute of limitations because a six-year limitations period under the UCC applied.

       Circuit court properly granted summary judgment to an automobile manufacturer and dealer (jointly, the sellers) in a buyer’s breach of warranty action because the buyer presented no evidence that the vehicle had manufacturing defects or that his complaints were not part of the normal function of the vehicle, it was undisputed that the sellers were not given at least three attempts to repair the alleged defects or that the alleged defects impaired the use or market value of the vehicle or put the vehicle out of service for 15 or more days, and an inspection of the vehicle found that it operated normally, all the evidence presented showed that the vehicle was new when purchased by the buyer.

A single act in violation of the provisions of Sections 63-17-201 through 63-17-221 shall be sufficient to authorize the issuance of an injunction.

      Any sales finance company may purchase or acquire or agree to purchase or acquire from any seller any contract on such terms and conditions as may be agreed upon between them. Filing of the assignment, notice to the buyer of the assignment, and any requirement that the holder maintain dominion over the payments or the motor vehicle if repossessed shall not be necessary to the validity of a written assignment of a contract as against creditors, subsequent purchasers, pledgees, mortgagees and lien claimants of the seller. Unless the buyer has notice of the assignment of his contract, payment thereunder made by the buyer to the last known holder of such contract shall be binding upon all subsequent holders.

    Payment of debt in full prior to maturity.

     <p>
      Notwithstanding the provisions of any retail installment contract to the contrary, any buyer may pay in full at any time before maturity the debt of any retail installment contract and in so paying such debt shall receive a refund credit thereon for such anticipation of payments provided such contract shall have a precomputed finance charge. The amount of such refund shall be calculated on the rule of the sum of the digits, commonly known as the “Rule of 78ths,” after deducting from such refund an acquisition cost of Ten Dollars ($10.00). Where the amount of credit is less than One Dollar ($1.00), no refund need be made. In the event the finance charge on a contract evidencing the sale of a commercial vehicle is not precomputed, any buyer may pay in full at any time before maturity the then remaining unpaid principal balance of the contract and shall pay a penalty for such prepayment as may have been agreed to by the buyer and the seller in the contract, not to exceed Fifty Dollars ($50.00).
     </p>
     <p>
      The provisions of this section shall apply in the event the vehicle is repossessed by the finance company or the dealer, and the dealer is required to pay the balance of indebtedness due the holder thereof.

       Creditor, a vehicle dealer, exercised control over debtor’s vehicle in violation of the automatic stay by refusing to furnish him with an application for a new certificate of title as required by Mississippi Motor Vehicle and Manufactured Housing Title Law, even though debtor’s counsel made him aware of the bankruptcy filing and automatic stay. Creditor’s passive act of holding on to the existing certificate of title prevented debtor from lawfully driving the vehicle, which had the same effect as if creditor had repossessed the vehicle pre-petition and refused to return it post-petition.

   The statutory requirement that an application for a certificate of title must include the vehicle owner’s name was satisfied by an application that listed a sole proprietorship as owner since the term “firm,” as used in the definition of the term “person” meant a sole proprietorship; thus, the fact that title was so held did not defeat perfection of a lienholder’s security interest in the vehicle. Further, a failure to list all of the facts for an application under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c21s63-21-15" target="_self">63-21-15</a></cite> does not defeat the perfection of a security interest under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c21s63-21-43" target="_self">63-21-43</a></cite>, which does not require that the owner’s name be listed.

       Assuming the creditors had valid, perfected security interests in the trucks, lease payments for the trucks were proceeds of the collateral under Nevada law as although Nevada deferred to Mississippi law with respect to the perfection of a security interest in the trucks, the Mississippi Motor Vehicle and Manufactured Housing Title Law did not provide a method for perfection of the proceeds of a vehicle; the payments were proceeds of the trucks and any perfection of security interests in the trucks continued automatically in the payments, but a fact issue remained as to whether the security interest in the cash proceeds were identifiable and continued beyond the 20th day after attachment.

       A bank that was the first lienholder on a car that was demolished in a collision was entitled to judgment against the negligent driver of the other car and her insurer for the amount of the lien at the time of the accident where the insurer had entered into a settlement agreement and release with the bank’s debtor, under the terms of which the insurer sold the wrecked car as salvage, without first making an effort to inspect the certificate of title on the vehicle, as permitted by law; such failure to investigate was unreasonable under the circumstances, wherein a vehicle was demolished leaving the residue of salvage value only, and the insurer and its insured thus settled the claim with constructive notice of the bank’s lien.

       Creditor, a vehicle dealer, exercised control over debtor’s vehicle in violation of the automatic stay by refusing to furnish him with an application for a new certificate of title as required by Mississippi Motor Vehicle and Manufactured Housing Title Law, even though debtor’s counsel made him aware of the bankruptcy filing and automatic stay. Creditor’s passive act of holding on to the existing certificate of title prevented debtor from lawfully driving the vehicle, which had the same effect as if creditor had repossessed the vehicle pre-petition and refused to return it post-petition.

   By executing and filing with the comptroller a surety bond in the amount of $5,000 obligating itself that in the event an automobile dealer did not fulfill his duties as “designated agent” under the Mississippi Motor Vehicle Title Law it would be liable to the extent of the amount of the bond, a surety company made itself liable to any member of the public to the extent of the amount of the bond for damages resulting from the dealer’s failure to fulfill his statutory obligations as a dealer to furnish a buyer of a car with a clear title to a vehicle. Thus, upon the dealer’s failure to provide a buyer with a clear title to a vehicle, the dealer became liable to the buyer for whatever damages were caused from such failure, and the surety was also liable up to $5,000. The surety, in expressing its willingness to be the buyer’s surety on a bond to be executed under the provisions of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c21s63-21-23" target="_self">63-21-23</a></cite>, did not fulfill its obligations under the bond it executed with respect to the dealer pursuant to §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c21s63-21-13" target="_self">63-21-13</a></cite>, since the buyer would have had a contingent liability as principle under the bond for any damages caused to others having some claim of ownership in the car.

       Chancellor’s order and the execution on a truck in partial satisfaction of the judgment in favor of a mall security company that brought a suit for payment of pre-receivership services was proper because the title to the truck reflected no lienholder. Thus, when the security company obtained its judgment against the mall, it became a judgment creditor with a priority claim over other creditors to the truck. Lend Lease Asset Mgmt., L.P. v. Cobra Sec., Inc., 912 So. 2d 471, 2005 Miss. LEXIS 674 (Miss. 2005).

   The statutory requirement that an application for a certificate of title must include the vehicle owner’s name was satisfied by an application that listed a sole proprietorship as owner since the term “firm,” as used in the definition of the term “person” meant a sole proprietorship; thus, the fact that title was so held did not defeat perfection of a lienholder’s security interest in the vehicle. Further, a failure to list all of the facts for an application under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c21s63-21-15" target="_self">63-21-15</a></cite> does not defeat the perfection of a security interest under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c21s63-21-43" target="_self">63-21-43</a></cite>, which does not require that the owner’s name be listed.

       § 63-21-18.
    Automated statewide motor vehicle title registration system.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The Mississippi Department of Information Technology Services shall provide equipment for the operation and maintenance of the automated statewide motor vehicle, manufactured housing and mobile home registration system by the State Tax Commission.
     </p>
     <p>
      The automated statewide motor vehicle, manufactured housing and mobile home registration system shall provide for computer terminals and printers, as authorized by the Mississippi Department of Information Technology Services, to be located in the quantity necessary in each county seat tax collector’s office and any other office in which more than fifty percent (50%) of the motor vehicle registrations in the county are made.
     </p>
     <p>
      All county tax collectors shall participate in such system as it applies to Chapter 19, Title 27; Chapter 51, Title 27; Chapter 21, Title 63; Mississippi Code of 1972, in accordance with rules and regulations promulgated by the State Tax Commission. Such rules and regulations shall provide that counties which have an existing computer system designed to produce registration data may elect to use such existing system to communicate title/registration data to the commission through the computer furnished by the state as hereinabove provided in this section. If the State Tax Commission finds and determines that a county has failed to successfully establish or update title/registration data into the statewide vehicle, manufactured housing and mobile home title/registration system, either through use of equipment supplied by the State Tax Commission or through the interfacing between the network system and county computer equipment, the State Tax Commission shall thereafter cause to be withheld the county’s homestead exemption reimbursement monies, except for school districts and municipalities, until such time as the county has complied with this provision. Such monies as are withheld from a county for failure to comply with this provision shall be placed into a special escrow account to be established in the State Treasury. Once the county achieves compliance by successfully establishing or updating title/registration data into the statewide vehicle, manufactured housing and mobile home title/registration system, then the commission shall cause to be released to the county all funds held in escrow on the county’s behalf during the period of noncompliance. All interest earned shall accrue to the benefit of the county on any funds placed in an escrow account. Any cost involved in interfacing between existing county computer systems and the state-provided computer shall be paid by the county.
     </p>
     <p>
      The computer terminals and printers placed in each county tax collector’s office may be utilized to provide additional computer functions as authorized by the Mississippi Department of Information Technology Services.
     </p>
     <p>
      The State Fiscal Officer shall issue his warrants to the State Treasurer for the expenditures for the implementation and maintenance of the system upon requisitions signed by the Chairman of the State Tax Commission, as authorized by the Legislature.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is the intent of the Legislature that the operation of the statewide motor vehicle, manufactured housing and mobile home title registration system shall be the responsibility of the State Tax Commission.
     </p>
     <p>
      The State Tax Commission shall provide for the transfer of motor vehicle, manufactured housing and mobile home title and lien registration information to the commission by electronic means from banks and other lending institutions as provided in Section 63-21-18. The Mississippi Department of Information Technology Services shall cooperate with the State Tax Commission in implementing the provisions of Section 63-21-18, and shall provide the State Tax Commission with whatever assistance the commission needs to carry out the provisions of Section 63-21-18.

The bond or cash shall be in an amount equal to one and one-half (1-1/2) times the value of the vehicle, manufactured home or mobile home as determined by the commission and conditioned to indemnify any prior owner and lienholder and any subsequent purchaser of the vehicle, manufactured home or mobile home or person acquiring any security interest in it, and their respective successors in interest, against any expense, loss or damage, including reasonable attorney’s fees, by reason of the issuance of the certificates of title of the vehicle, manufactured home or mobile home or on account of any defect in or undisclosed security interest upon the right, title and interest of the applicant in and to the vehicle, manufactured home or mobile home. Any such interested person has a right of action to recover on the bond or cash for any breach of its conditions, but the aggregate liability of the surety to all persons shall not exceed the amount of the bond or cash. The bond or cash shall be returned at the end of three (3) years unless the commission has been notified of the pendency of an action to recover on the bond or cash or that the vehicle, manufactured home or mobile home does not belong to the registered owner or that it is encumbered by an undisclosed lien.

   By executing and filing with the comptroller a surety bond in the amount of $5,000 obligating itself that in the event an automobile dealer did not fulfill his duties as “designated agent” under the Mississippi Motor Vehicle Title Law it would be liable to the extent of the amount of the bond, a surety company made itself liable to any member of the public to the extent of the amount of the bond for damages resulting from the dealer’s failure to fulfill his statutory obligations as a dealer to furnish a buyer of a car with a clear title to a vehicle. Thus, upon the dealer’s failure to provide a buyer with a clear title to a vehicle, the dealer became liable to the buyer for whatever damages were caused from such failure, and the surety was also liable up to $5,000. The surety, in expressing its willingness to be the buyer’s surety on a bond to be executed under the provisions of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c21s63-21-23" target="_self">63-21-23</a></cite>, did not fulfill its obligations under the bond it executed with respect to the dealer pursuant to §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c21s63-21-13" target="_self">63-21-13</a></cite>, since the buyer would have had a contingent liability as principle under the bond for any damages caused to others having some claim of ownership in the car.

     <p>
      If a dealer buys a vehicle, manufactured home or mobile home and holds it for resale and procures the certificate of title from the owner or the lienholder within ten (10) days after delivery to him of the vehicle, manufactured home or mobile home, he need not send the certificate to the State Tax Commission. However, upon transferring the vehicle, manufactured home or mobile home to another person other than by the creation of a security interest, he shall promptly execute the assignment and warranty of title by a dealer, showing the names and addresses of the transferee and of any lienholder holding a security interest created or reserved at the time of the resale and the date of his security agreement, in the spaces provided therefor on the certificate or as the State Tax Commission prescribes, and deliver the certificate to a designated agent with the transferee’s application for a new certificate.
     </p>
     <p>
      Every dealer shall maintain for five (5) years a record in the form the State Tax Commission prescribes of every vehicle, manufactured home or mobile home bought, sold or exchanged by him or received by him for sale or exchange, which shall be open to inspection by a representative of the State Tax Commission or patrol or peace officer during reasonable business hours.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any person found to be in possession of a vehicle, manufactured home or mobile home with an improperly assigned title which fails to identify the transferee shall immediately establish ownership of the vehicle, manufactured home or mobile home, register the vehicle, manufactured home or mobile home and pay the required tax and penalty. The vehicle, manufactured home or mobile home shall be impounded by state or local law enforcement officials until such time as the person in possession can prove ownership or until the rightful owner is located. In the event the rightful owner cannot be established within thirty (30) days, the vehicle, manufactured home or mobile home shall be deemed abandoned and shall be disposed of as provided by law.
     </p>
     <p>
      An insurance company which obtains title to a motor vehicle as a result of paying a total loss claim resulting from collision, fire, flood or other cause shall obtain a salvage certificate of title in its name for such vehicle from the State Tax Commission. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to vehicles ten (10) years old or older with a value of One Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($1,500.00) or less, or to vehicles with damage which requires the replacement of five (5) or fewer minor components, which such insurer may dispose of by endorsing change in ownership on the certificate of title using space reserved for reassignment of title by licensed dealer without obtaining a salvage certificate of title.

       Security interest in automobiles could not be perfected by using Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) method for nontitled personal property; interest in motor vehicles was not valid unless the security interest was perfected pursuant to applicable version of Mississippi Motor Vehicle Title Law.

      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   The statutory requirement that an application for a certificate of title must include the vehicle owner’s name was satisfied by an application that listed a sole proprietorship as owner since the term “firm,” as used in the definition of the term “person” meant a sole proprietorship; thus, the fact that title was so held did not defeat perfection of a lienholder’s security interest in the vehicle. Further, a failure to list all of the facts for an application under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c21s63-21-15" target="_self">63-21-15</a></cite> does not defeat the perfection of a security interest under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t63c21s63-21-43" target="_self">63-21-43</a></cite>, which does not require that the owner’s name be listed.

      A lienholder may assign, absolutely or otherwise, his security interest in the vehicle, manufactured home or mobile home to a person other than the owner without affecting the interest of the owner or the validity of the security interest. However, any person without notice of the assignment is protected in dealing with the lienholder as the holder of the security interest and the lienholder remains liable for any obligations as lienholder until the assignee is named as lienholder on the certificate in the manner prescribed by the State Tax Commission.

      <p>
       Where creditor willfully violated the automatic stay by repossessing debtors’ vehicle, an award of punitive damages was warranted, as creditor’s actions evidenced a blatant disregard for the bankruptcy process and a pattern of disrespect for the court. Amount of punitive damages awarded ensured that creditor’s security interest in the vehicle was cancelled; thus, creditor was required to release his lien on the vehicle and deliver the certificate of title to debtors in accordance with Mississippi law, and debtors’ objection to the proof of claim was granted.

      The rules and regulations promulgated by the State Tax Commission shall make suitable provisions for the use by an applicant of the duplicate copy of his application for a certificate of title to serve as a permit for the operation of the motor vehicle or the use and occupation of a manufactured home or mobile home described in the application until the commission either issues the certificate of title of such motor vehicle, manufactured home or mobile home or refuses to issue the certificate. The commission and every designated agent receiving an application for the certificate of title, when the provisions of this chapter have been otherwise complied with, shall deliver to the applicant the duplicate copy of his application which shall contain a suitable permit for the purposes mentioned in this paragraph.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the event the commission refuses to issue the certificate of title the applicant shall, immediately upon receiving written notice from the commission that such certificate will not be issued for the reason or reasons stated in the notice, deliver or mail to the commission by registered mail the duplicate copy of his application containing the permit mentioned in the previous paragraph of this section and, in the case of a vehicle, the current privilege license tag which was issued for the vehicle. The motor vehicle, manufactured home or mobile home described in said application shall not be operated on the highways or other public places of this state or used or occupied after the applicant receives notice that the certificate will not be issued unless its operation is subsequently authorized by the commission either by the issuance of a new permit or by a certificate of title. If for any reason the said duplicate copy of the application for certificate of title and, in the case of a vehicle, the current privilege license tag which was issued for the vehicle in question is not received by the commission within ten (10) calendar days after the commission mails written notice to the applicant that it will not issue the certificate of title applied for, the commission or, at the request of the commission, any state highway patrolman, sheriff or other peace officer of this state, is authorized and empowered to require and compel the surrender of said duplicate copy of the application for certificate of title and, in the case of a vehicle, the said current privilege license tag. The commission, after it obtains possession of said duplicate copy of application for certificate of title and, in the case of a vehicle, said current privilege license tag, is authorized to retain same until it is satisfied that said applicant is entitled to receive a certificate of title of the vehicle, manufactured home or mobile home in question.

     <p>
      Any motor vehicle, trailer or similar conveyance used to transport another motor vehicle or crushed motor vehicle sold in violation of Section 63-21-39 or otherwise used to aid in the commission of a violation of Section 63-21-39 may be seized by a law enforcement agency and is subject to forfeiture ordered by the court in the manner and under the terms and conditions set out for forfeitures of a vehicle, trailer or similar conveyance in this article; however, no conveyance is subject to forfeiture under this article by reason of any act or omission proved by the owner thereof to have been committed or omitted without his knowledge or consent. If the seizing law enforcement agency has reason to believe that the conveyance is a leased or rented conveyance, then the seizing law enforcement agency shall notify the owner of the conveyance as soon as practicable after the seizure. A forfeiture of a conveyance encumbered by a bona fide security interest is subject to the interest of the secured party if he neither had knowledge of nor consented to the act or omission.

     <p>
      The intent of this chapter is to provide a means for removing abandoned motor vehicles from the right-of-way and open lands of the state to enhance the beauty of the countryside and the health and welfare of its citizens. It is also to provide a means of relieving automobile dealers, repairmen, and others dealing in motor vehicles from unnecessary storage of deteriorated cars which prevent the use of such floorspace or property for storage for hire or use in their business, and is therefore in the public interest.

      For the purposes of this chapter, an “abandoned motor vehicle” shall mean a motor vehicle as defined by the Mississippi Motor Vehicle Title Law:
     </p>
     <p>
      which has been left by the owner, or some person acting for the owner, with an automobile dealer, repairman or wrecker service for repair or for some other reason and has not been called for by such owner or other person within a period of forty (40) days after the time agreed upon or within forty (40) days after such vehicle is turned over to such dealer, repairman or wrecker service when no time is agreed upon.
     </p>
     <p>
      which is left unattended on a public street, road or highway or other public property for a period of at least five (5) days.
     </p>
     <p>
      which has been lawfully towed onto the property of another at the written request of a law enforcement officer and left there for a period of not less than forty (40) days without any one having made claim thereto.

       If the Department of Public Safety seizes vehicles pursuant to Section 41-29-153 and it decides not to seek forfeiture of the vehicles and notifies the owners to come and get them, if the owners fail to retrieve their vehicles, the Department of Public Safety may not treat the vehicles as abandoned vehicles as defined in this section and may not dispose of them pursuant to Section 63-23-5.

       Municipalities cannot immobilize a vehicle for five days and then declare it to be abandoned and sell it; however, if vehicles remain at the impoundment lot or other storage facility for the required 120 days, after due notice has been provided to the owner, they may be deemed abandoned and sold.

       Truck sitting in yard of landlord, whose tenant was in arrears on his rent and had vacated premises, failed to fit any description of abandoned vehicle under statute. Mere fact that truck may have been left on landlord’s property and in inoperable condition is of no moment, and for purchaser to profit on this point, he would have to show that truck was abandoned in law, not merely in fact.

       Phrase “when ownership cannot be determined” made it clear that the legislature did not intend to allow the seizure and forfeiture of private property where the owner was known; a finding that ownership could not be determined was a precursor to a valid forfeiture under the statute.

      <p>
       The highway patrol had no authority to deliver a stolen pickup truck, which had an altered vehicle identification number and had been seized from an innocent purchaser pursuant to a valid search warrant, to an insurance company, which had paid the owner the full value of the truck under a theft loss insurance policy and was therefore the lawful owner of the vehicle, absent court approval with no advance notice to the innocent purchaser of its intent to do so and without giving him an opportunity contest the matter in a court of competent jurisdiction; the appropriate procedure would have been for the highway patrol, once the truck served no further purpose in the criminal investigation or prosecution, to make a motion in the justice court for authority to release it to the insurance company, and to give the innocent purchaser and the insurance company reasonable notice of such application and an opportunity to be heard; however, the circuit court erred in directing return of the pickup truck to the innocent purchaser without making the insurance company a party to the hearing or giving it any notice of the proceeding, as this was a blatant violation of the insurance company’s right to due process.

       When a piece of property is ordered forfeited by the court to the sheriff’s department, the property should be entered upon the county property rolls in the same manner as other county property being used by the sheriff’s department; once the property has been placed upon the property rolls of the county, said property may be sold or traded or disposed of or otherwise used in the identical manner as other sheriff department property originally purchased with county funds or used by any other county agency or department “designated by the court.” Keenum, Mar. 19, 1992, A.G. Op. #92-0175.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under Miss. Code Section 63-25-9(4), where law enforcement officers cannot in and of themselves make final determination as to ownership of vehicle, they must consult with experts. Turner, Feb. 18, 1993, A.G. Op. #92-0937. Mis/63-25-9.
      </p>
      <p>
       With respect to motor vehicles, Miss. Code Section 63-25-9(7)(a) mandates filing of forfeiture proceeding, except for motor vehicles seized under Miss. Code Section 63-25-7(1) where ownership of that vehicle cannot be determined. Turner, Feb. 18, 1993, A.G. Op. #92-0937.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 63-25-9(7)(c) requires notice be sent to any person that may appear to have any right, title or interest in or to property and since contraband motor vehicles are forfeited to seizing agency under 63-25-9(7)(g)(ii) as one of two alternatives, seizing agency has right or interest in property as set forth in 63-25-9(7)(c) and notice should therefore be sent to each seizing agency of forfeiture proceedings. Head, August 18, 1993, A.G. Op. #93-0286.
      </p>
      <p>
       The statute mandates the forfeiture of a motor vehicle/motor vehicle part seized pursuant to Section 63-25-7(1) where ownership cannot be determined. Mitchell, III, April 7, 2000, A.G. Op. #2000-0157.
      </p>
      <p>
       Vehicles ordered by a court to be sold at auction should be released by the seizing agency to the purchaser even if the ownership cannot be determined, provided the purchaser of the vehicle obtains an assigned or replacement vehicle identification plate number.
   Mitchell, III, April 7, 2000, A.G. Op. #2000-0157.

    Warranty reimbursement insurance policy requirements.

     <p>
      No warranty reimbursement insurance policy shall be issued, sold or offered for sale in this state unless the policy meets the following conditions:
     </p>
     <p>
      The policy states that the issuer of the policy will reimburse or pay on behalf of the vehicle protection product warrantor all covered sums which the warrantor is legally obligated to pay, or will provide all service that the warrantor is legally obligated to perform according to the warrantor’s contractual obligations under the provisions of the insured warranties sold by the warrantor;
     </p>
     <p>
      The policy states that in the event that payment due under the terms of the warranty is not provided by the warrantor within sixty (60) days after proof of loss has been filed according to the terms of the warranty by the warranty holder, the warranty holder may file directly with the warranty reimbursement insurance company for reimbursement;
     </p>
     <p>
      The policy provides that a warranty reimbursement insurance company that insures a warranty shall be deemed to have received payment of the premium if the warranty holder paid for the vehicle protection product and the insurer’s liability under the policy shall not be reduced or relieved by a failure of the warrantor, for any reason, to report the issuance of a warranty to the insurer; and
     </p>
     <p>
      The policy has the following provisions regarding cancellation of the policy:
     </p>
     <p>
      The issuer of a reimbursement insurance policy shall not cancel such policy until a notice of cancellation in writing has been mailed or delivered to the Motor Vehicle Commission and each insured warrantor;
     </p>
     <p>
      The cancellation of a reimbursement insurance policy shall not reduce the issuer’s responsibility for vehicle protection products sold prior to the date of cancellation; and
     </p>
     <p>
      In the event an insurer cancels a policy that a warrantor has filed with the Motor Vehicle Commission, the warrantor shall do either of the following:
     </p>
     <p>
      1. File a copy of a new policy with the Motor Vehicle Commission, before the termination of the prior policy, provided that there is no lapse in coverage following the termination of the prior policy; or
     </p>
     <p>
      2. Discontinue acting as a warrantor as of the termination date of the policy until a new policy becomes effective and is accepted by the Motor Vehicle Commission.
