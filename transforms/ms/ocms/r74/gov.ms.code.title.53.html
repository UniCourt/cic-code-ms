     </h3>
     <p>
      It is hereby declared to be in the public interests to foster, encourage and promote the development, production and utilization of the natural resources of oil and gas in the State of Mississippi; and to protect the public and private interests against the evils of waste in the production and utilization of oil and gas, by prohibiting waste as herein defined; to safeguard, protect and enforce the coequal and correlative rights of owners in a common source or pool of oil and gas to the end that each such owner in a common pool or source of supply of oil and gas may obtain his just and equitable share of production therefrom; and to obtain, as soon as practicable, consistent with the prohibition of waste, the full development by progressive drilling of other wells in all producing pools of oil and gas or of all pools which may hereafter be brought into production of such, within the state, until such pool is fully defined.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is not the intent nor the purpose of this law to require or permit the proration or distribution of the production of oil and gas among the fields and pools of Mississippi, on the basis of market demand. It is the intent and purpose of this law to permit each and every oil and gas pool in Mississippi to be produced up to its maximum efficient rate of production, subject to the prohibition of waste as herein defined, and subject further to the enforcement and protection of the coequal and correlative rights of the owners of a common source of oil and gas, so that each common owner may obtain his just and equitable share of production therefrom.

       The use of the word “unit” rather than the word “pool” in one place in an order of the Oil and Gas Board did not invalidate the order. Stacy v. Tomlinson Interests, Inc., 405 So. 2d 93, 1981 Miss. LEXIS 2235 (Miss. 1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       The 1948 law limiting drilling units to 40 acres or less was prospective only, and did not destroy the established drilling units. Superior Oil Co. v. Beery, 216 Miss. 664, 64 So. 2d 357, 1953 Miss. LEXIS 683 (Miss. 1953).
      </p>
      <p>
       The 1932 and 1936 statutes had the effect of vesting in the board the power to prescribe rules for the spacing of oil and gas wells and to regulate the drilling for and production of oil and gas, and by implication these same statutes authorized the board to establish drilling units. Green v. Superior Oil Co., 59 So. 2d 100 (Miss. 1952).

      <p>
       A mineral lessee has a duty not to deplete the resources of the lessor, including an obligation not to drain away the oil under the land without compensation. Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Millette, 221 Miss. 1, 72 So. 2d 176, 1954 Miss. LEXIS 510, 1954 Miss. LEXIS 511 (Miss. 1954).
      </p>
      <p>
       Those having the exclusive right to drill for and produce oil and gas represent the royalty owners in the drilling and spacing of wells in compliance with regulations of the state oil and gas board. Superior Oil Co. v. Beery, 216 Miss. 664, 64 So. 2d 357, 1953 Miss. LEXIS 683 (Miss. 1953).
      </p>
      <p>
       There is an implied covenant in a lease of oil property that the lessee will do nothing to impair the value of the lease, and that he must use reasonable care to protect lessor from damage or loss by affirmative act of such lessee, and this implied obligation has been extended to include, in the absence of express stipulation, a duty to drill offset wells if practicable and profitable.

       Although oil is a fugacious product and ordinarily belongs to the producer who captures it upon his own lands, yet when such producer is under an obligation to do nothing to destroy or deplete the lands of his lessor, he may not with impunity impair the value of the lessor’s property.

   The order of a state regulatory agency requiring an interstate natural gas pipeline company to take gas “ratably,” that is, in proportion to the shares of various well owners and operators, from a common gas pool and to purchase the gas under nondiscriminatory conditions directly undermines Congress’ determination under the Natural Gas Policy Act (15 USCS §§ 3301 et seq.) that the supply, the demand, and the price of the particular type of natural gas involved in the case be determined by market forces, in that the order threatens to distort the market by artificially increasing supply and price, disturbs the uniformity of the federal scheme for the regulation of all wholesales of natural gas enacted in the Natural Gas Policy Act (15 USCS §§ 3301 et seq.), since interstate pipelines will be forced to comply with varied state regulations of their purchasing practices, and would have the effect of increasing the ultimate price to consumers, thereby disrupting the federal goal enacted in the Natural Gas Policy Act (15 USCS §§ 3301 et seq.) to insure low prices most effectively.

   The order of a state regulatory agency requiring an interstate natural gas pipeline company to take gas “ratably,” that is, in proportion to the shares of various well owners and operators, from a common gas pool and to purchase the gas under nondiscriminatory conditions is pre-empted by the comprehensive scheme of federal regulation of all wholesales of natural gas in interstate commerce enacted in the Natural Gas Act (15 USCS §§ 717 et seq).

       Contamination complained of by the landowners was deposited on their property in the course of oil and gas exploration and production activities pursuant to a mineral lease, and the contamination resulted from the oil company’s noncommercial disposal of oil field exploration and production waste; the contamination resulted directly from oil field exploration and production activities on the property, not via commercial disposition, such that the Mississippi Oil and Gas Board had exclusive authority over noncommercial disposal of oil field exploration and production waste; therefore, the landowners had to assert their claims based on the contamination before the Board before suing privately.

       The Oil & Gas Board properly promulgated a rule regarding the control of naturally occurring radioactive material as the order promulgating the rule was founded on substantial evidence, was neither arbitrary nor capricious, was within the authority of the board, and was not a violation of some constitutional or statutory right. Boyles v. Mississippi State Oil & Gas Bd., 794 So. 2d 149, 2001 Miss. LEXIS 14 (Miss. 2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       When the Oil & Gas Board promulgates a rule regarding the disposal of waste products, as mentioned in subsection (3)(a), the statute requires that the board gain the approval of the Commission on Environmental Quality; however, when regulating the control of naturally occurring radioactive material when it is present in an oilfield, the board has exclusive jurisdiction and authority and is not required to seek commission approval before promulgating a rule.

   The order of a state regulatory agency requiring an interstate natural gas pipeline company to take gas “ratably,” that is, in proportion to the shares of various well owners and operators, from a common gas pool and to purchase the gas under nondiscriminatory conditions directly undermines Congress’ determination under the Natural Gas Policy Act (15 USCS §§ 3301 et seq.) that the supply, the demand, and the price of the particular type of natural gas involved in the case be determined by market forces, in that the order threatens to distort the market by artificially increasing supply and price, disturbs the uniformity of the federal scheme for the regulation of all wholesales of natural gas enacted in the Natural Gas Policy Act (15 USCS §§ 3301 et seq.), since interstate pipelines will be forced to comply with varied state regulations of their purchasing practices, and would have the effect of increasing the ultimate price to consumers, thereby disrupting the federal goal enacted in the Natural Gas Policy Act (15 USCS §§ 3301 et seq.) to insure low prices most effectively.

   The order of a state regulatory agency requiring an interstate natural gas pipeline company to take gas “ratably,” that is, in proportion to the shares of various well owners and operators, from a common gas pool and to purchase the gas under nondiscriminatory conditions is pre-empted by the comprehensive scheme of federal regulation of all wholesales of natural gas in interstate commerce enacted in the Natural Gas Act (15 USCS §§ 717 et seq).

       The act of the state oil and gas board in amending its statewide rules to widen and increase the spacing pattern for oil and gas wells drilled below 12,000 feet, and in the Pennsylvanian and older formations below a measured depth of 3,500 feet, to a drilling unit of 80 acres for an oil well and a drilling unit of 640 acres for a gas well, was not arbitrary or capricious and was not beyond the power of the board.

       The state oil and gas board has power to fix the limits of gas-oil ratios, to regulate secondary recovery methods, to allocate the production of oil and gas from any proof for the prevention of waste, and to allocate on a fair and equitable basis the permissible production among tracts under separate ownership.

       Forrest County Board of Supervisors had the authority to enact a fencing ordinance under the home rule statute and the ordinance was not preempted by state law since: (1) the Mississippi legislature had not expressly granted the Mississippi Oil and Gas Board (OGB) the exclusive authority to address industry safety issues: (2) the ordinance was not inconsistent with state oil and gas statutes and regulations; and (3) the OGB had not promulgated any regulation prohibiting perimeter fencing.

       The standard for judicial review of the orders of the state oil and gas board is whether the order is supported by substantial evidence, is arbitrary or capricious, beyond the power of the board to make, or violates some constitutional right of the complaining party. Superior Oil Co. v. State Oil & Gas Bd., 220 So. 2d 602, 1969 Miss. LEXIS 1466 (Miss. 1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a proceeding to review an order of the state oil and gas board, amending field rules and redefining gas pools in a part of a particular field so as to recognize the existence of two separate pools, the board was justified from the evidence in holding that perforations and production of the various strata subsequent to a 1952 definition, have not made the sands in the two pools connected so as to form one pool, the board apparently determining the limits on the basis of engineering and geologic facts. Superior Oil Co. v. State Oil & Gas Bd., 220 So. 2d 602, 1969 Miss. LEXIS 1466 (Miss. 1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the board has the duty to require that gas or oil pools be separately produced and not commingled, an order of the board amending field rules and redefining gas pools in a part of a particular field so as to recognize the existence of two separate pools, was not arbitrary or so unreasonable as to invalidate it. Superior Oil Co. v. State Oil & Gas Bd., 220 So. 2d 602, 1969 Miss. LEXIS 1466 (Miss. 1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the gas and oil board on petition, and after due notice to all parties, entered an order establishing five gas units as exception units for production of gas from a specified pool and provided for allowables, and found that production from these units, including the unit encompassing a 115-acre tract, would fully and adequately protect the correlative rights of all interested owners in the production from the pool, the order adjudicated all things necessary for the establishment of said units for gas production, and this was all that was necessary to constitute the pooling and integration of the deep rights of owners of one-half mineral interest in the 115 acres. Frost v. Gulf Oil Corp., 238 Miss. 775, 119 So. 2d 759, 1960 Miss. LEXIS 463 (Miss. 1960).

       Because the amendments to State Oil and Gas Board Rule 68 regulated the disposal of Naturally Occurring Radioactive Materials (NORM), and subsection (3)(a) did not distinguish between commercial and noncommercial disposal of waste when stating that the Mississippi Oil and Gas Board had to seek the approval of the Mississippi Commission on Environmental Quality, the Board exceeded its authority by not seeking the approval of the Commission before adopting the amendments.

      </p>
      <p>
       Forrest County fencing ordinance that required perimeter fencing around oil and gas facilities did not materially impede the Mississippi Oil and Gas Board’s authority to make inspections of oil and gas sites and the requirement that the Mississippi State Oil and Gas supervisor and his representatives to have access to all wells drilled for oil and gas at any and all times in light of the public policy considerations of protecting private property and the health and safety of Forrest County citizens cited by the Forrest County Board of Supervisors in adopting the ordinance.

    Appeals to the chancery court; pending cases in circuit court.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      In addition to other remedies now available, the state, or any interested person aggrieved by any final rule, regulation or order of the board, shall have the right, regardless of the amount involved, of appeal to the Chancery Court of the First Judicial District of Hinds County, Mississippi, or to the chancery court of the county in which all or a part of appellant’s property affected by such rule, regulation or order is situated, which shall be taken and perfected as hereinafter provided, within thirty (30) days from the date that such final rule, regulation or order is filed for record in the office of the board; and the said chancery court may affirm such rule, regulation or order, or reverse same for further proceedings as justice may require. All such appeals shall be taken and perfected, heard and determined either in termtime or in vacation on the record, including a transcript of pleadings and testimony, both oral and documentary, filed and heard before the board, and such appeal shall be heard and disposed of promptly by the court as a preference cause. In perfecting any appeal provided by this section, the provisions of law respecting notice to the reporter and the allowance of bills of exception, now or hereafter in force respecting appeals from the chancery court to Supreme Court shall be applicable. However, the reporter shall transcribe his notes and file the transcript of the record with the board within thirty (30) days after approval of the appeal bond.
     </p>
     <p>
      Upon the filing with the board of a petition for appeal to the chancery court, it shall be the duty of the board, as promptly as possible, and in any event within sixty (60) days after approval of the appeal bond, to file with the clerk of the chancery court to which the appeal is taken, a copy of the petition for appeal and of the rule, regulation or order appealed from, and the original and one (1) copy of the transcript of the record of proceedings in evidence before the board. After the filing of said petition, the appeal shall be perfected by the filing with the clerk of the chancery court to which the appeal is taken of bond in the sum of Five Hundred Dollars ($500.00) with two (2) sureties or with a surety company qualified to do business in Mississippi as the surety, conditioned to pay the cost of such appeal; said bond to be approved by any member of the board or by the supervisor, or by the clerk of the court to which such appeal is taken. The perfection of an appeal shall not stay or suspend the operation of any rule, regulation or order of the board, but the judge of the chancery court to which the appeal is taken may award a writ of supersedeas to any rule, regulation or order of the board after five (5) days’ notice to the board and after hearing. Any order or judgment staying the operation of any rule, regulation or order of the board shall contain a specific finding, based upon evidence submitted to the chancery judge and identified by reference thereto, that great or irreparable damage would result to the appellant if he is denied relief, and the stay shall not become effective until a supersedeas bond shall have been executed and filed with and approved by the clerk of the court or the chancery judge, payable to the state. The bond shall be in an amount fixed by the chancery judge and conditioned as said chancery judge may direct in the order granting the supersedeas.
     </p>
     <p>
      Appeals of rules, regulations or orders of the board pending in the circuit court prior to July 1, 1988, shall proceed in the circuit court having jurisdiction under the appropriate statutes and rules applicable to such cases in the circuit courts. Appeals of rules, regulations or orders of the board on or after July 1, 1988, shall be perfected in the appropriate chancery court and shall proceed under the statutes and rules applicable to such cases in the chancery courts.

   Judicial review may be had of any final rule, regulation, or order of the State Oil &amp; Gas Board. Prior to an appeal from a final rule, regulation, or order, as contemplated by §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t53c01s53-1-39ol1a" target="_self">53-1-39(a)</a></cite>, the Chancery Court has no jurisdiction to participate in the administrative process and it was error to do so when the effect amounted to an intervention in the pending proceedings. State Oil &amp; Gas Bd. v. McGowan, 542 So. 2d 244, 1989 Miss. LEXIS 184 (Miss. 1989).
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the board has the duty to require that gas or oil pools be separately produced and not commingled, an order of the board amending field rules and redefining gas pools in a part of a particular field so as to recognize the existence of two separate pools, was not arbitrary or so unreasonable as to invalidate it. Superior Oil Co. v. State Oil & Gas Bd., 220 So. 2d 602, 1969 Miss. LEXIS 1466 (Miss. 1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       The standard for judicial review of the orders of the state oil and gas board is whether the order is supported by substantial evidence, is arbitrary or capricious, beyond the power of the board to make, or violates some constitutional right of the complaining party. Superior Oil Co. v. State Oil & Gas Bd., 220 So. 2d 602, 1969 Miss. LEXIS 1466 (Miss. 1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       Order of state oil and gas board that proceedings on integration petition be stayed until chancery suits involving question of title had been finally settled was not a final order but merely an order of continuance and no appeal therefrom was permissible. Proctor v. Hassie Hunt Trust, 215 Miss. 119, 60 So. 2d 558, 1952 Miss. LEXIS 544 (Miss. 1952).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where an integration order has been reversed because 20 acres of non-contiguous land was included in the 320 acre drilling unit, the reversal was without prejudice to the right of any party in interest in the 300 acres to institute any further proceedings to obtain order of integration of lands and leases in the unit, although there would be no interest in the non-contiguous 20 acres erroneously included or in the 20 acres necessary to be substituted. Superior Oil Co. v. Griffith, 214 Miss. 891, 60 So. 2d 505, 1952 Miss. LEXIS 527 (Miss. 1952).

       Erroneous filing of a timely notice of appeal seeking review of a decision of the Mississippi Oil and Gas Board adopting a rule regarding disposal of waste from gas production sites containing radioactive material directly with the chancery court having jurisdiction over the action rather than with the Board did not deprive the chancery court of jurisdiction to consider the appeal; appellate court applied the analogous provisions of Miss. R. App. 4 to find that the filing was sufficient to confer jurisdiction on the chancery court. Adams v. Miss. State Oil & Gas Bd., 854 So. 2d 7, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 151 (Miss. Ct. App. 2003).

      No temporary restraining order or injunction of any kind shall be granted against the board, or against any agent, employee or representative of said board restraining the board, or any of its agents, employees or representatives, from enforcing any statute of this state relating to conservation of oil and gas, or any of the provisions of Sections 53-1-1 through 53-1-47, inclusive, and Sections 53-3-1 through 53-3-21, inclusive, or any rule, regulation or order made thereunder, except after due notice to said board, and to all other defendants, and after a hearing at which it shall be clearly shown to the court that the act done or threatened is without sanction of law, or that the provision of law, or the rule, regulation or order complained of, is invalid, and that, if enforced against the complainant, will cause an irreparable injury. With respect to any order or decree granting temporary injunctive relief, the nature and extent of the probable invalidity of the statute, or of any provision of the aforesaid sections, or of any rule, regulation or order thereunder involved in such suit, must be recited in the order or decree granting the temporary relief, as well as a clear statement of the probable damage relied upon by the court as justifying temporary injunctive relief.

    Suits to restrain violations or threatened violations; lien remedy.

     <p>
      Whenever it shall appear that any person is violating or threatening to violate any statute of this state with respect to the conservation of oil and gas, or any provision of Sections 53-1-1 through 53-1-47, inclusive, and Sections 53-3-1 through 53-3-21, inclusive, or any rule, regulation or order made by the board thereunder, and fails or refuses to cease such violation or threats of violation on notice so to do, by the board or supervisor, the board may bring suit against such person in the chancery court in the county of the residence of the defendant, or in the county of the residence of any defendant, if there be more than one (1) defendant, or in the county where the violation is alleged to have occurred or is threatened, to restrain such person from continuing such violation or from carrying out the threat of violation. In such suit the board may obtain injunctions, prohibitory and mandatory, including temporary restraining orders and preliminary injunctions, as the facts may warrant, including, when appropriate, an injunction restraining any person from moving or disposing of any illegal oil, illegal gas, illegal condensate, or illegal product.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the event the board should fail to bring suit within ten (10) days to enjoin any actual or threatened violation of any statute of this state with respect to the conservation of oil and gas, or of any provision of Sections 53-1-1 through 53-1-47, inclusive, and Sections 53-3-1 through 53-3-21, inclusive, or of any rule, regulation or order made thereunder, then any person or party in interest adversely affected by such violation, and who has notified the board in writing of such violation, or threat thereof, and has requested the board to sue, may, to prevent any or further violation, bring suit for that purpose in the chancery court of any county in which the board could have brought suit, and the board shall be made a party to such suit.
     </p>
     <p>
      The board may utilize the provisions of Section 85-7-132, Mississippi Code of 1972, in prosecuting violations of Sections 53-1-1 through 53-1-47 and Sections 53-3-1 through 53-3-21, or any rule, regulation or order made by the board thereunder.

   Amended State Oil and Gas Board Rule 68 was not in contravention of Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t53c03s53-3-3" target="_self">53-3-3</a></cite> because contestants did not cite any particular violation or allege that they exhausted their remedies with the Mississippi Oil and Gas Board by filing charges there; when read in conjunction with the other definitions of “waste,” it is clear the rule is concerned with the inappropriate production of oil and gas. Adams v. Miss. State Oil &amp; Gas Bd., 139 So.3d 58, 2014 Miss. LEXIS 121 (Miss. 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       Jurisdiction of the Oil and Gas Board extended to the landowners’ fraud claims asserting that oil company misled the landowners, the public, and the Oil and Gas Board; this was because judicial resolution of those claims would require a jury to determine whether the oil company misrepresented information to the board in violation of the board’s reporting requirements; the board had to be given the chance to investigate and to penalize the oil company for any false reporting that occurred. Town of Bolton v. Chevron Oil Co., 919 So. 2d 1101, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 523 (Miss. Ct. App. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       In an action seeking damages to property caused by the disposal of oil field waste upon it, a cause of action for negligence per se was properly dismissed for failure to exhaust administrative remedies; the plaintiff could have and should have filed a written request for hearing with the Oil and Gas Board as an “interested person,” and the board could have penalized the defendants and required them all to pay the costs of clean-up and restoration.

      For the purposes of paying the costs and expenses incurred in connection with the administration and enforcement of the oil and gas conservation laws of the State of Mississippi and of the rules, regulations and orders of the State Oil and Gas Board, there is levied and assessed against each barrel of oil produced in the State of Mississippi a charge not to exceed sixty (60) mills on each barrel of such oil sold, and against each one thousand (1,000) cubic feet of gas produced and sold a charge not to exceed six (6) mills on each one thousand (1,000) cubic feet of gas. The State Oil and Gas Board shall fix the amount of such charge in the first instances, and may, from time to time, change, reduce or increase the amount thereof, as in its judgment the charges against the fund may require, but the amounts fixed by the board shall not exceed the limits hereinabove prescribed; and it shall be the duty of the board to make collection of such assessments. All monies collected shall be used exclusively to pay the expenses and other costs in connection with the functioning of the State Oil and Gas Board and the administration of the oil and gas conservation laws of the State of Mississippi now in force or hereafter enacted and the rules, regulations and orders of the board.

       § 53-3-5.
    Drilling and production regulated.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The state oil and gas board shall have the power and authority and it shall be its duty, after due notice and a hearing, to regulate the drilling and location of wells in any pool and the production therefrom so as to prevent reasonably avoidable net drainage from each developed unit (that is, drainage which is not equalized by counterdrainage) so that each owner in a pool shall have the right and opportunity to recover his fair and equitable share of the recoverable oil and gas in such pool.
     </p>
     <p>
      For the prevention of waste, to protect and enforce the correlative rights of the owners in a pool, and to avoid the augmenting and accumulation of risks arising from the drilling of an excessive number of wells, or the reduced recovery which might result from too small a number of wells, the board shall, after a hearing, establish a drilling unit or units for each pool. The establishment of a unit for gas shall be limited and apply only to the production of gas and not oil.
     </p>
     <p>
      Each well permitted to be drilled upon any drilling unit shall be drilled in accordance with the rules and regulations promulgated by the board and in accordance with a spacing pattern fixed by the board for the pool in which the well is located with such exceptions as may be reasonably necessary where it is shown, after notice and upon hearing, that the unit is partly outside the pool or, for some other reason, a well otherwise located on the unit would be nonproductive, or topographical conditions are such as to make the drilling at such location unduly burdensome. Whenever an exception is granted, the board shall take such action as will offset any advantage which the person securing the exception may have over other producers by reason of the drilling of the well as an exception, but no well drilled and completed as an exception to prescribed footage limitations for the reason that a portion of the drilling unit upon which such well is located is partly outside the pool or productive horizon shall be allocated a reduced daily production allowable whenever it shall be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the board that the productive acreage underlying such drilling unit is equal to, or more than, the reasonable minimum amount of productive acreage which would underlie such drilling unit under the minimum conditions which would permit the drilling of a well thereon so located as to comply with all applicable footage limitations. Each well drilled and completed as an exception to prescribed footage limitations for the reason that a portion of such drilling unit is partly outside the pool or productive horizon shall be allocated a reduced daily production allowable whenever it cannot be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the board that the productive acreage underlying such drilling unit is equal to, or more than, the minimum amount of productive acreage which would underlie such drilling unit under the minimum conditions which would permit the drilling of a well thereon so located as to comply with all applicable footage limitations. Such reduced allowable shall be allocated in proportion to the relationship which the productive acreage, as determined by the board, bears to the reasonable minimum amount of productive acreage which would underlie such drilling unit under the minimum conditions which would permit the drilling of a well thereon so located as to comply with all footage limitations applicable to such drilling unit. The reasonable minimum amount of productive acreage shall be determined for all purposes as if each oil well drilling unit were a regular governmental quarter-quarter section, comprising forty acres, more or less, and as if each gas well drilling unit were a regular governmental one half section, comprising three hundred twenty acres, more or less, and shall be calculated for the purpose of each oil well drilling unit as being the total acreage which would be encompassed within a triangular shaped area bounded on two sides by the exterior boundaries of such forty-acre drilling unit meeting at a 90° angle corner and on the third side by a straight line running on a 45° angle through a location point situated at the minimum distance out of such corner as shall be in accordance with prescribed oil well drilling unit footage limitations and intersecting each of such two exterior boundaries at 45° angles, and shall be calculated for the purposes of each gas well drilling unit as being the total acreage which would be encompassed within a triangular shaped area bounded on two sides by the exterior boundaries of such three hundred twenty-acre drilling unit meeting at a 90° angle corner and on the third side by a straight line running on a 45° angle through a location point situated at the minimum distance out of such corner as shall be in accordance with prescribed gas well drilling unit footage limitations and intersecting each of such two exterior boundaries at 45° angles. Should drilling units for any field or area be established so as to permit the drilling of oil or gas wells on smaller or larger units than 40 acre or 320 acre drilling units then, in such event, the same method of determining the reasonable minimum amount of productive acreage shall be applied to the consideration of such oil or gas drilling units with respect to the size of, and the prescribed footage limitations applicable to, such drilling units.
     </p>
     <p>
      Except where otherwise provided, any allocation or apportionment of production shall be made on the basis of and in proportion to the surface acreage content of the drilling units prescribed for the producing horizons for the pools so that each such prescribed unit shall have equal opportunity to produce the same daily allowable, and any special unit of less than the prescribed amount of surface acreage shall be allowed to produce only in the proportion that the surface acreage content of any such special unit bears to the surface acreage content of the regular prescribed unit. In the event any well in attempting to make its allowable should be operated in a way that would commit waste as herein defined, or to the detriment of the field as a whole, the allowable for any such well shall be subject to adjustment.

       “Net drainage” and “counter-drainage” within subsection (a) of this section [Code 1942, § 6132-21] preventing net drainage should be applied to each separate developed unit as established by the order of the oil and gas board.

      <p>
       Where the evidence supported a finding that there was a substantial amount of oil under the property owned by the lessors which oil was being drained by the lessee’s well or adjacent property belonging to another surface owner, the lessees did not act in good faith and were liable to the lessors for such drainage when they refused to drill an offset well which would have been permitted by the oil and gas board, or dropped their lease on the lessor’s property as required by an implied covenant in the lease, even though the lessors had a 50 percent participation in the existing well on the adjacent property.

       Spacing rules, which required that rights of all owners in drilling unit upon which the walls were located should first be pooled and which defined term owner as person having right to drill into pool and to appropriate production therefrom, were reasonable exercises of police powers of state delegated to the oil and gas board by the 1932 and 1936 statutes. Superior Oil Co. v. Beery, 216 Miss. 664, 64 So. 2d 357, 1953 Miss. LEXIS 683 (Miss. 1953).

       Where surface acreage had been adopted as basis for apportionment of oil production in each drilling unit, the oil and gas board properly based order on acreage basis and not on claim of certain owners that sands underlying the lands were thicker and contained more hydro-carbons than the adjoining lands in the same unit for which reason they asserted their lands are more productive and consequently the order of integration should allocate to their acreage and each unit a larger proportion of the production from each unit well than that which should be allocated to the other lands comprising the unit.

   When owners of mineral interest sued operator of oil well in state court, well operator did not commit conversion by not properly determining amount of oil taken from integrated wells; since developer had followed proper procedures under integration statute prior to commencing operations, developer was cotenant of owners and owed them no more than an accounting; conversion claim included vague conclusory charges that operator committed unauthorized act of dominion over plaintiffs’ proportionate share of oil from the land, and inasmuch as operator adhered to §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t53c03s53-3-7" target="_self">53-3-7</a></cite> there was no question that operator had right to produce the well on condition that it account to plaintiffs for their proportionate shares of production therefrom, less development and production expenses.

       Section 53-3-7 permits only the recovery of the necessary expenses of development and operation of a forcibly pooled drilling unit. Interest expense (the cost of money) is one step removed from the “cost of development and operation” and, therefore, is not recoverable under the statute. Pursue Energy Corp. v.

     <p>
      Whenever the state oil and gas board has fixed for the purpose of preventing waste, as defined in Section 53-1-3, the total amount of oil or gas which may be produced in any pool in this state at an amount less than that amount which the pool can produce, the board shall allocate or apportion the allowable production among the producers in the pool on a reasonable basis so as to prevent reasonably avoidable drainage from each developed unit which is not equalized by counter-drainage, and so that each producer will have the opportunity to produce or receive his just and equitable share, as above set forth.
     </p>
     <p>
      After the effective date of any rule, regulation, or order of the state oil and gas board fixing the allowable production of oil or gas, or both, for any pool, no person shall produce from any well, lease, or property more than the allowable production which is applicable; nor shall such amount be produced in a different manner than that which may be authorized.
     </p>
     <p>
      The state oil and gas board shall require interested persons, firms or corporations to place uniform meters of a type approved by the board wherever the board may designate on all pipe lines, flow lines, gathering systems, barge terminals, loading racks, refineries, or other places deemed necessary or proper to prevent waste and the transportation of illegally produced oil or gas; such meters at all times shall be under the supervision and control of the board, and it shall be a violation of Sections 53-1-1 through 53-1-47, inclusive, and Sections 53-3-1 through 53-3-21, inclusive, for any person, firm or corporation to refuse to attach or install such meter when ordered to do so by the board.

Upon notice from the board to the operator of any pipe line connected to any such oil or gas well that the certificate of compliance with reference to such well has been cancelled by the board, the operator of such pipe line shall disconnect from such well and it shall be unlawful for the operator of such pipe line to transport oil or gas therefrom until a new certificate of compliance has been issued by the board. It shall be unlawful for the owner or operator of any well to produce oil or gas therefrom (except as to a temporary connection as hereinabove provided), unless there is in effect a certificate of compliance covering such well.

      The sale, purchase, or acquisition, or the transportation, refining, processing, or handling in any other way of illegal oil, illegal gas, or illegal product is hereby prohibited.
     </p>
     <p>
      Unless and until the state oil and gas board provides for certificates of clearance, or some other method, so that any person may have an opportunity to determine whether any contemplated transaction of sale, purchase, or acquisition, or of transportation, refining, processing, or handling in any other way, involves illegal oil, illegal gas, or illegal product, no penalty shall be imposed for the sale, purchase or acquisition, or the transportation, refining, processing, or handling in any other way, of illegal oil, illegal gas, or illegal product, except under circumstances hereinafter stated. Penalties shall be imposed by the board for each transaction prohibited in this section when the person committing the same knows that illegal oil, illegal gas, or illegal product is involved in such transaction or when such person could have known or determined such fact by the exercise of reasonable diligence or from facts within his knowledge. However, regardless of lack of actual notice or knowledge, penalties as provided in Section 53-1-47 shall apply to any sale, purchase, or acquisition, and to the transportation, refining, processing, or handling in any other way, without a certificate of clearance, of illegal oil, illegal gas, or illegal product, where administrative provision is made for identifying the character of the commodity as to its legality. It shall likewise be a violation for which penalties shall be imposed for any person to sell, purchase, or acquire, or to transport, refine, process, or handle in any other way any oil, gas or any product without complying with any rule, regulation, or order of the board relating thereto.

       § 53-3-19.
    Procedure for seizure and sale of illegal gas and oil as contraband.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Apart from, and in addition to, any other remedy or procedure which may be available to the state oil and gas board, or any penalty which may be sought against or imposed upon any person with respect to violations relating to illegal oil, illegal gas, or illegal product, all illegal oil, illegal gas and illegal product shall, except under such circumstances as are stated herein, be contraband and shall be seized and sold, and the proceeds applied as herein provided. Such sale shall not take place unless the court shall find, in the proceeding provided for in this paragraph, that the commodity involved is contraband. Whenever the board believes that illegal oil, illegal gas or illegal product is subject to seizure and sale, as provided herein, it shall, through the attorney general, bring a civil action in rem for that purpose in the circuit court of the county where the commodity is found, or the action may be maintained in connection with any suit or cross-action for injunction or for penalty relating to any prohibited transaction involving such illegal oil, illegal gas or illegal product. Any interested person who may show himself to be adversely affected by any such seizure and sale shall have the right to intervene in such suit to protect his rights.
     </p>
     <p>
      The action referred to above shall be strictly in rem and shall proceed in the name of the state as plaintiff against the illegal oil, illegal gas or illegal product mentioned in the complaint, as defendant, and no bond or bonds shall be required of the plaintiff in connection therewith. Upon the filing of the complaint, the clerk of the court shall issue a summons directed to the sheriff of the county, or to such officer or person as the court may authorize to serve process, requiring him to summon any and all persons (without undertaking to name them) who may be interested in the illegal oil, illegal gas, or illegal product mentioned in the complaint to appear and answer within thirty days after the issuance and service of such summons. The summons shall contain the style and number of the suit and a very brief statement of the nature of the cause of action. It shall be served by posting one copy thereof at the courthouse door of the county where the commodity involved in the suit is alleged to be located and by posting another copy thereof near the place where the commodity is alleged to be located. Copy of such summons shall be posted at least five days before the return day stated therein, and the posting of such copy shall constitute constructive possession of such commodity by the state. A copy of the summons shall also be published once each week for three weeks in some newspaper published in the county where the suit is pending or having a bona fide circulation therein. No judgment shall be pronounced by any court condemning such commodity as contraband until after the lapse of five days from the last publication of said summons. Proof of service of said summons, and the manner thereof, shall be as provided by general law.
     </p>
     <p>
      Where it appears by a verified pleading on the part of the plaintiff, or by affidavit, or affidavits, that grounds for the seizure and sale exist, the clerk, in addition to the summons, shall issue an order of seizure, which shall be signed by the clerk and bear the seal of the court. Such order of seizure shall specifically describe the illegal oil, illegal gas, or illegal product, so that the same may be identified with reasonable certainty. It shall direct the sheriff to whom it is addressed to take into his custody, actual or constructive, the illegal oil, illegal gas or illegal product, described therein, and to hold the same subject to the orders of the court. Said order of seizure shall be executed as a writ of attachment is executed. No bond shall be required before the issuance of such order of seizure, and the sheriff shall be responsible upon his official bond for the proper execution thereof. For his service hereunder, the sheriff shall receive a fee as in like cases of seizure of personal property and to be assessed as other cost in the cause.
     </p>
     <p>
      Sales of illegal oil, illegal gas or illegal product, seized under the authority of this section, and notice of such sales, shall be in accordance with the laws of this state relating to the sale of personal property under execution. For his services hereunder the sheriff shall receive a fee and expenses in like sales of personal property to be paid out of the proceeds of the sale or sales to be fixed by the court ordering such sale.
     </p>
     <p>
      The court may order that the commodity be sold in specified lots or portions, and at specified intervals, instead of being sold at one time. Title to the amount sold shall pass as of the date of the act which is found by the court to make the commodity contraband. The judgment shall provide for payment of the proceeds of the sale into the state oil and gas fund, after first deducting the costs in connection with the proceedings and sale, and after paying to any royalty owner intervening as an interested party in the suit, the value of his interest in the said oil or gas, provided he has established his title to the said oil or gas royalty interest. The amount sold shall be treated as legal oil, legal gas or legal product, as the case may be, in the hands of the purchaser, but the purchaser and the commodity shall be subject to all applicable laws, and rules, regulations and orders with respect to further sale or purchase or acquisition, and with respect to the transportation, refining, processing, or handling in any other way, of the commodity purchased.
     </p>
     <p>
      The producer, owner, or any other party contesting the validity of any such seizure and having an interest in securing the release of the seized oil, gas or other product, may obtain the release thereof upon furnishing a bond issued by a corporate surety company, duly qualified to do business in the state in an amount double the current market value of the oil, gas or other product held under seizure, which bond shall be conditioned and approved in the same manner as a replevin bond.
     </p>
     <p>
      Nothing in this section shall deny or abridge any cause of action a royalty owner, or a lien holder, or any other claimant, may have, because of the forfeiture of the illegal oil, illegal gas, or illegal product, against the person whose act resulted in such forfeiture. All oil, gas or other illegal product sold as provided in this section shall be sold in like cases of personal property sold under execution.

    Application for permit to drill in search of oil or gas.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Before any person shall commence the drilling of any well in search of oil or gas, the person shall file with the board his application for a permit to drill, accompanied by a certified plat and by a fee of Six Hundred Dollars ($600.00), payable to the State Oil and Gas Board. When two (2) or more separately owned tracts of land are embraced within the unit for which the permit is sought, the application shall affirmatively state whether there are separately owned tracts in the drilling unit for which the permit is sought, and if so, whether the person owning the drilling rights therein and the rights to share in the production therefrom have agreed to develop their lands as a drilling unit and to the drilling of the well, as contemplated by Section 53-3-7. If drilling operations have not commenced within one (1) year after date of issuance, the permit shall become void. If the application complies in all respects with the rules and regulations of the board relating thereto, a permit shall be issued promptly by the supervisor. The issuance of the permit shall constitute the establishment of the drilling unit as designated in the application and shall likewise constitute the approval of the well location set out in the permit. On good cause shown, the unit may be altered by the board after notice and hearing.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the application for permit does not comply in all respects with the rules and regulations of the board relating thereto, the application shall be disallowed and the supervisor shall promptly notify the applicant of the reason or reasons for the disallowance.

The method of testing used shall be one acceptable to the board. A report of each test so required shall be promptly furnished to the board on a form published by the board for such reports. Any operator may make such additional deliverability tests at any time and report such tests to the board in the same manner as required tests are reported. Deliverability shall be determined by the latest test information furnished to the board.

       § 53-3-39.
    Payment of interest on royalty proceeds which have not been disbursed.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Purchasers of oil or gas production from any oil or gas well shall be liable for the payment of interest on royalty proceeds which have not been disbursed to the royalty owners from and after one hundred twenty (120) days following the date of the first sale of oil or gas.
     </p>
     <p>
      The rate of interest shall be eight percent (8%) per annum and shall be computed from the date of one hundred twenty (120) days after such first sale; however, from and after July 1, 1992, the rate of interest shall be the greater of eight percent (8%) per annum or two percent (2%) above the federal discount rate in effect as of the second day of January of each year during which interest on such royalty proceeds is payable, except in those instances where the royalty proceeds cannot be paid because the title thereto is not marketable, in which case the rate of interest on a per annum basis shall be equal to the federal reserve discount rate in effect as of the second day of January of each year during which interest on the royalty proceeds is payable. The accrued interest shall be paid to the royalty owners at the time of the payment of the accrued royalty proceeds, such rate of interest to be displayed on the disbursement document. As used herein, “first sale” shall mean the first commercial sale of production after completion of the well and shall not include sales of oil or gas during initial testing prior to completion of the well.
     </p>
     <p>
      Whenever the disbursal of royalty proceeds is suspended for any reason whatsoever, the purchasers of production shall be liable for the payment of interest on the royalty proceeds which have been suspended. Except as otherwise provided, the rate of interest shall be eight percent (8%) per annum and shall be computed from the date that the royalty payments were halted or suspended; provided, however, that if such date is less than one hundred twenty (120) days after the first sale of oil or gas, then such interest shall be computed from the date of one hundred twenty (120) days after such first sale. From and after July 1, 1992, the rate of interest shall be the greater of eight percent (8%) per annum or two percent (2%) above the federal discount rate in effect as of the second day of January of each year during which interest on such royalty proceeds is payable, except in those instances where the royalty proceeds are suspended because the title thereto is not marketable, in which case the rate of interest on a per annum basis shall be equal to the federal reserve discount rate in effect as of the second day of January of each year during which interest on such proceeds is payable. The accrued interest shall be paid to the royalty owners at the time of the payment of the suspended royalty proceeds, such rate of interest to be displayed on the disbursement document.
     </p>
     <p>
      The purchaser of production from a well shall be exempt from the provisions of this section and the operator and/or the owner of the right to drill and to produce under an oil and/or gas lease shall be substituted for the purchaser herein where the operator and/or the owner and purchaser have entered into an arrangement where the royalty proceeds are paid by the purchaser to the operator and/or the owner who assumes responsibility of paying the proceeds to the royalty owners legally entitled thereto. Where the operator and/or the owner of the drilling rights are substituted herein for the purchaser, the interest provided for hereinabove shall accrue from the date set forth hereinabove or from the date of such operator and/or owner’s receipt of the proceeds of such production, whichever is the later date.
     </p>
     <p>
      Provided further, that as to royalty payments regularly disbursed in the normal course of business, nothing in this section shall be construed to require the payment of interest on royalty payments disbursed to the royalty owners no later than sixty (60) days after the end of the calendar month within which such royalty production was sold. Provided further, that whenever the aggregate of one hundred twenty (120) days’ accumulation of monthly proceeds payable to any royalty owner does not exceed One Hundred Dollars ($100.00), no interest shall accrue or be payable thereon, provided that the disbursement of such accumulated proceeds be made to the royalty owner no later than once each one-hundred-twenty-day period.
     </p>
     <p>
      For the purposes of this section, marketability of title shall be determined in accordance with real property law governing title to oil and gas interests as recognized at the time the royalty payments were suspended or not paid.
     </p>
     <p>
      The provisions of this section which require payment of interest on royalty proceeds which have not been disbursed may not be waived or reduced by a royalty owner entitled to such interest payment unless said royalty owner shall attest to a statement which shall be typed in bold print on a separate form and attached to the relevant division order contract as to the royalty owner’s interest. Such statement shall be set out as follows:
     </p>
     <p>
      I, (royalty owner’s name) hereby agree to waive the statutory right given me to receive interest on royalty proceeds as provided by Section 53-3-39, Mississippi Code of 1972, from (purchaser or operator and/or owner of right to drill), which is due me as evidenced from the attached division order contract. This is the day of , 20. (royalty owner’s signature)

       Under Mississippi law, as determined by Court of Appeals, lessors of mineral interest in gas were not entitled to royalties from nonrecoupable cash settlement of take-or-pay contract dispute between pipeline and lessee, given absence of specific lease language to that effect. Williamson v. Elf Aquitaine, Inc., 138 F.3d 546, 1998 U.S. App. LEXIS 6492 (5th Cir. Miss. 1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       Equitable considerations did not apply so as to entitle lessors of mineral interest in gas to royalties from nonrecoupable cash settlement of take-or-pay contract dispute between pipeline and lessee, inasmuch as lessors did not claim to be third-party beneficiaries of take-or-pay contracts, that settlement was in bad faith or less than arms-length transaction, or that, post-settlement, lessee failed to comply with its express marketing obligation under lease.

Any such substance, including recoverable or recovered natural gas liquids, which is transported to or in a natural gas pipeline or natural gas gathering system, or otherwise transported or sold for use as natural gas, or is transported or sold for the extraction of helium or natural gas liquids is gas production. Any such substance which is transported or sold to persons and for purposes not included in the foregoing natural gas definition is oil production.

       Specific perfomance was properly granted a natural gas district, owned by two towns, of a lease between the district and a gas company, where the company had failed to furnish a budget of intended extensions and additions which was vital to full performance of the contract, to which information the district was entitled in connection with its obligations and right to purchase the extensions and additions upon termination of the lease, and where damages would not provide an adequate remedy, the termination of the lease requiring from its very nature extensive preparations and considerable time in advance, so that the adjudication of the district’s rights in the lease could not wait the termination date without the risk of confusion and irreparable loss.

    Oil and Gas Board may order unit operation.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The State Oil and Gas Board may issue an order requiring such unit operation, if it finds that:
     </p>
     <p>
      Unit operation of the field or of any pool or pools, or of any portion or portions or combinations thereof within the field, is reasonably necessary in order to effectively carry on secondary recovery, pressure maintenance, repressuring operations, cycling operations, water flooding operations, or any combination thereof, or any other form of joint effort calculated to substantially increase the ultimate recovery of oil or gas or both, from the unit so formed, or to prevent waste as defined in Section 53-1-3; and
     </p>
     <p>
      One or more method of unitized operation as applied to such common source of supply or portion thereof is feasible and will prevent waste or will with reasonable probability result in the recovery of substantially more oil or gas, or both, from the unit so formed than would otherwise be recovered; and
     </p>
     <p>
      The plan of unitization and the agreements effectuating same are fair and reasonable under all of the circumstances and protect the rights of all interested parties; and
     </p>
     <p>
      The correlative rights of interested parties will be protected; and
     </p>
     <p>
      The estimated additional cost incident to conducting such operation will not exceed the value of the estimated additional recovery of oil and gas and such cost of unit operation shall not be borne by the royalty owners.
     </p>
     <p>
      The operators of such unit shall have drilled a sufficient number of wells to a sufficient depth and at such locations as may be necessary for the board to approve the boundaries of the unit and determine that the field, pool or pools have been reasonably developed according to a spacing pattern approved by the board. No field unitization shall be approved by the board until each drilling unit of the field has been drilled; however, the board is hereby authorized to waive the requirement that each and every drilling unit be drilled upon a finding of fact that it is not economically feasible for a specific drilling unit to be drilled.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The order issued by the State Oil and Gas Board shall be fair and reasonable under all of the circumstances and shall protect the rights of interested parties and shall include:
     </p>
     <p>
      A description of the geographical area and a description of the pool or pools, or of any portion or portions or combinations thereof affected which together constitute and are herein termed the “unit area.”
     </p>
     <p>
      A statement of the nature of the operations contemplated.
     </p>
     <p>
      A formula for the allocation among the separately owned tracts in the unit area of all the oil or gas, or both, produced and saved from the unit area, and not required in the conduct of such operation, which formula must expressly be found reasonably to permit persons otherwise entitled to share in or benefit by the production from such separately owned tracts to receive, in lieu thereof, their fair, equitable and reasonable share of the unit production or other benefits thereof. A separately owned tract’s fair, equitable and reasonable share of the unit production shall be that proportionate part of unit production that the contributing value of such tract for oil and gas purposes in the unit area and its contributing value to the unit bears to the total of all like values of all tracts in the unit, taking into account all pertinent engineering, geological and operating factors that are reasonably susceptible of determination.
     </p>
     <p>
      A provision for adjustment among the owners of the unit area (not including royalty owners) of their respective investment in wells, tanks, pumps, machinery, materials, equipment and other things and services of value attributable to the unit operations. The amount to be charged unit operations for any such item shall be determined by the owners of the unit area (not including royalty owners), but if said owners of the unit area are unable to agree upon the amount of such charges, or to agree upon the correctness thereof, the board shall determine them after due notice and hearing thereon, upon the application of any interested party. The amount charged against the owner of a separately owned tract shall be considered expense of unit operation chargeable against such tract. The adjustments provided for herein may be treated separately and handled by agreements separate from the unitization agreement. The expense of dry holes drilled within the unit area prior to the effective date of an order of the board, as determined by Section 53-3-107, shall not be chargeable as investment under subsection (c) of Section 53-3-109, unless such dry hole is used in the unit operation, in which event its value to the unit shall be charged as investment.
     </p>
     <p>
      A provision that the costs and expenses of unit operation, including investment past and prospective, shall be borne by the owner or owners (not entitled to share in production free of operating costs and who in the absence of unit operation would be responsible for the expenses of developing and operating) of each tract in the same proportion that such tracts share in unit production. Each owner’s interest in the unit area shall be responsible for his proportionate share thereof, and the unit operator shall have a lien thereon to secure payment of such share. When any owner fails to pay his part thereof when due and interest thereon at the legal rate, then all of such owner’s interest in the unit production and equipment may be foreclosed in the same manner and under the same procedures provided for the foreclosure of mortgages in chancery court.
     </p>
     <p>
      A transfer or conversion of any owner’s interest or any portion thereof, however accomplished after the effective date of the order creating the unit, shall not relieve the transferred interest of said operator’s lien on said interest for the cost and expense of unit operations, past or prospective.

     <p>
      The State Oil and Gas Board, after notice and hearing, by entry of new or amending orders, may from time to time enlarge the unit area by approving agreements adding to the unit operation a pool or pools or any portion or portions or combinations thereof not theretofore included, and extensions of existing pools. Any such agreement, in providing for allocation of production from the unit area, shall first allocate to each pool or portion thereof so added a portion of the total production of oil or gas, or both, from all pools affected within the unit area, as enlarged, such allocation to be based on the relative contribution which such added pool or portion or extensions thereof are expected to make, during the remaining course of unit operations, to the total production of oil or gas, or both, to the unit as enlarged. The production so allocated to each added pool or portion thereof shall be allocated to the separately owned tracts in the added unit area on the basis of the relative contribution of each such tract, as provided in paragraph (c) of Section 53-3-105. The remaining portion of unit production shall be allocated among the separately owned tracts within the previously established unit area in the manner provided by the unitization agreement. Orders promulgated under this paragraph shall become operative at 7:00 a.m. on the first day of the month next following the day on which the order becomes effective under the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section.
     </p>
     <p>
      An order promulgated by the board under paragraph (a) of this section shall not become effective unless and until (1) all of the terms and provisions of the plan of unitization and the unitization agreement relating to the extension or enlargement of the unit area or to the addition of a pool or portions thereof or extensions of existing pools to unit operations have been fulfilled and satisfied and evidence thereof has been submitted to the board, and (2) the extension or addition effected by such order has been agreed to in writing by the owners or lessees of at least seventy-five percent (75%) in interest on the basis of and in proportion to the surface acreage content of the area or pools or portions thereof or extensions of existing pools to be added to the unit operation by such order and also by at least seventy-five percent (75%) (exclusive of royalty interests owned by lessees or by subsidiaries or successors in title of any lessee) in interest of the royalty owners on the basis of and in proportion to the surface acreage content in the area or pools or portions thereof or extensions of existing pools to be added to the unit operation by such order, and evidence thereof has been submitted to the board, and (3) the owners of the existing unit have agreed in the manner provided in Section 53-3-107 or in accordance with the terms of the unitization agreement, to the extension or addition. In the event all of the above requirements are not fulfilled within twelve months from and after the date of such order, it shall be automatically revoked.
     </p>
     <p>
      After the operative date of an order promulgated under this section, costs and expenses of operation of the unit, as enlarged, shall be governed by paragraph (e) of Section 53-3-105. Adjustment among the owners of the unit area, as enlarged, (not including royalty owners) of their respective investments in wells, tanks, pumps, machinery, materials, equipment and other things and services of value attributable to the operation of the unit area, as enlarged, shall be governed by paragraph (d) of Section 53-3-105.

      The portion of unit production allocated to a separately owned tract within the unit area shall be deemed, for all purposes, to have been actually produced from such tract, and operations with respect to any tract within the unit area shall be deemed for all purposes to be the conduct of operations for the production of oil or gas, or both, from each separately owned tract in the unit area. However, when an oil, gas and mineral lease contains land partially within and partially without said unit area, the unit agreement and production from the unit shall have no force and effect on lands lying outside of such unit area and failure of the lessee or lessees thereof to drill and develop such lands lying outside said unit area within one (1) year or during the term of the lease, whichever is a longer period of time, from the date of determination of the unit area by the state oil and gas board shall render such lease or leases on lands lying outside said unit area void and of no force and effect, unless otherwise held by production other than from unit production.

      The use of an underground reservoir, stratum or formation as a reservoir for the storage of natural gas or compressed air as an appliance or appurtenance in connection with the conveying, transmission or distribution of natural gas or compressed air is hereby authorized, provided that the State Oil and Gas Board shall first enter an order, after notice and hearing pursuant to the provisions of Sections 53-1-19 through 53-1-31, inclusive, approving any such proposed underground storage of natural gas or compressed air upon finding as follows:
     </p>
     <p>
      That the underground stratum or formation sought to be used as a reservoir for the injection, storage and withdrawal of natural gas or compressed air is suitable and feasible for such use and in the public interest, and is not an oil reservoir capable of commercial production;
     </p>
     <p>
      That a majority interest of all rights of the surface interest and a majority interest of all interests in the underground stratum or formation have consented to such use in writing;

       “SECTION 1. The Legislature finds that the exploration and production of oil and gas for the energy needs of the state and the nation is of vital concern and that a serious problem of theft of the production increases both the cost to the public and the danger to the public on the roads of the state. Therefore, it is the intent of the Legislature to impose certain requirements upon the transportation of oil and any substance containing any quantity of crude petroleum.”

      <p>
       The Department of Environmental Quality may consider adverse affects on public highways or roads in acting upon a permit application for a surface mining operation and may base a denial of such a permit upon its findings.
   Richardson, December 16, 1998, A.G. Op. #98-0773.
      </p>
      <p>
       The regulations on surface mining as set forth in the Mississippi Surface Mining and Reclamation Law, Sections 53-7-1 et seq., do not affect the authority of a municipality or county to regulate land use by restricting such activities to zones or districts deemed appropriate by the governing authorities. Snyder, Oct. 6, 2000, A.G. Op. #2000-0577.
      </p>

       A county board of supervisors, exercising authority under County Home Rule, cannot adopt an ordinance with county-wide applicability regulating and restricting the removal or mining of dirt within a specific distance of public roads and road rights-of-way; however, a county may petition the Board of Mississippi Geological, Economic and Topographical Survey for relief and, in addition, may recover civilly for damages to roads caused by undermining and/or excavation of adjacent lands.

       § 53-9-3.
    Legislative findings and declarations.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The Legislature finds and declares that:
     </p>
     <p>
      The State of Mississippi, instead of the federal government, should regulate surface coal mining in this state because the terrain, climate, biologic, chemical and other physical conditions of the state differ from those of other states subject to regulation of mining operations;
     </p>
     <p>
      Extraction of coal from the earth can be accomplished by various methods of mining, including surface mining;
     </p>
     <p>
      Coal mining operations presently contribute significantly to the energy requirements of the state and nation, and surface coal mining constitutes one (1) method of extraction of the resource;
     </p>
     <p>
      Many surface mining operations result in disturbances of surface areas that burden and adversely affect commerce and the public welfare by destroying or diminishing the utility of land for commercial, industrial, residential, recreational, agricultural and forestry purposes, by causing erosion and landslides, by contributing to floods, by polluting water, by destroying fish and wildlife habitats, by impairing natural beauty, by damaging the property of citizens, by creating hazards dangerous to life and property, by degrading the quality of life in local communities, and by counteracting governmental programs and efforts to conserve soil, water and other natural resources;
     </p>
     <p>
      The expansion of coal mining to meet the energy needs of the state and nation makes even more urgent the establishment of appropriate standards to minimize damage to the environment and to productivity of the soil and to protect the health and safety of the public;
     </p>
     <p>
      Surface mining and reclamation technology are now developed so that effective and reasonable regulation of surface coal mining operations by the state in accordance with the requirements of this chapter is an appropriate and necessary means to minimize, so far as practicable, the adverse social, economic and environmental effects of those mining operations;
     </p>
     <p>
      Surface mining and reclamation standards are essential to insure the ability of the state to improve and maintain adequate standards on coal mining operations within its borders;
     </p>
     <p>
      The impacts from unreclaimed land disturbed by surface coal mining operations impose social and economic costs on residents in nearby and adjoining areas, as well as impair environmental quality;
     </p>
     <p>
      Surface coal mining operations contribute to the economic well-being, security and general welfare of the state and nation and should be conducted in an environmentally sound manner;
     </p>
     <p>
      This chapter is necessary to prevent or mitigate adverse environmental effects of surface coal mining operations; and
     </p>
     <p>
      The provisions of the 2001 amendments to this chapter are to provide for and implement a state program for abandoned mine reclamation which complies with the provisions of Subchapter IV of the federal Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977, 30 USCS 1231 through 1243.

    Purpose.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      It is the purpose of this chapter:
     </p>
     <p>
      To assume for the state exclusive jurisdiction over the regulation of surface coal mining and reclamation operations within the state under Section 503 of the federal act;
     </p>
     <p>
      To develop, implement and enforce a program which, at a minimum, will achieve the purposes of the federal act and the regulations promulgated under that act;
     </p>
     <p>
      To assure that the rights of surface landowners and other persons with a legal interest in the land or appurtenances thereto are fully protected from those operations;
     </p>
     <p>
      To assure that surface coal mining operations are not conducted where reclamation as required by this chapter is not feasible;
     </p>
     <p>
      To assure that surface coal mining operations are conducted in a manner protective of the environment;
     </p>
     <p>
      To assure that adequate procedures are undertaken to reclaim surface areas as contemporaneously as possible with the surface coal mining operations;
     </p>
     <p>
      To assure that appropriate procedures are provided for public participation in the development, revision and enforcement of regulations, standards, reclamation plans or programs established by the state under this chapter;
     </p>
     <p>
      To assure that the coal supply essential to the energy requirements of the state and nation and to their economic and social well-being is provided, and to strike a balance between protection of the environment and agricultural productivity and the need of the state and nation for coal as an essential source of energy; and
     </p>
     <p>
      To, wherever necessary, exercise the full reach of state constitutional powers to insure the protection of the public interest through effective control of surface coal mining operations.

       The applicant shall file with the department, in the manner and form as required by the commission, a bond for performance payable to the commission and conditional upon faithful performance of the requirements of this chapter and the permit. The bond shall be filed before the issuance of a permit. The bond shall cover that area of land within the permit area upon which the operator will initiate and conduct surface coal mining and reclamation operations within the initial term of the permit. The permit area shall be readily identifiable by appropriate marks on the site. As succeeding increments of surface coal mining and reclamation operations are to be initiated and conducted within the permit area, the permittee shall file with the department an additional bond or bonds to cover those increments in accordance with this section. The amount of the bond required for each bonded area shall depend upon the reclamation requirements of the permit and shall reflect the probable difficulty of reclamation, giving consideration to factors such as topography, geology of the site, hydrology and revegetation potential. The amount of the bond shall be determined by the permit board after consultation with the state geologist. The amount of the bond shall be sufficient to assure the completion of the reclamation plan if the work had to be performed by the department in the event of forfeiture, and in no case shall the bond for the entire area under one (1) permit be less than Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000.00).

       Liability under the bond shall be for the duration of the surface coal mining and reclamation operation and for a period which coincides with the operator’s responsibility for revegetation requirements in regulations promulgated under Section 53-9-45. The bond shall be executed by the operator and a corporate surety licensed to do business in this state. The operator may elect to deposit the following in lieu of the surety bond: cash, negotiable bonds of the United States government or the state, or negotiable certificates of deposit or a letter of credit of any bank organized or transacting business in the state and insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation or a similar federal banking or savings and loan insurance organization. The cash deposit or market value of the securities shall be equal to or greater than the amount of the bond required for the bonded area.

       In accordance with any conditions established by the commission in regulations promulgated under this chapter, the permit board may accept the bond of the applicant itself without separate surety if the applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the permit board the existence of a suitable agent to receive service of process, a history of financial solvency and continuous operation sufficient for authorization to self-insure or bond that amount.

     <p>
      To encourage advances in mining and reclamation practices or to allow postmining land use for industrial, commercial, residential or public use, including recreational facilities, the commission, with the approval of the United States Secretary of the Interior or the secretary’s designee, may authorize departures in individual cases on an experimental basis from the environmental protection performance standards promulgated under Sections 53-9-45 and 53-9-47. Those departures may be authorized if:
     </p>
     <p>
      The experimental practices are at least as environmentally protective during and after mining operations as those required by promulgated standards;
     </p>
     <p>

         When the commission or an authorized representative of the department has reason to believe that a violation of this chapter or any regulation or order of the commission or permit board or any condition of a permit has occurred, the commission may cause a written complaint to be served upon the alleged violator. The complaint shall specify the section, regulation, order or permit alleged to be violated and the facts alleged to constitute the violation and shall require the alleged violator to appear before the commission at a time and place specified in the order to answer the complaint. The time of appearance before the commission shall be not less than twenty (20) days from the date of the mailing or service of the complaint, whichever is earlier.

         The commission shall afford an opportunity for a formal hearing to the alleged violator at the time and place specified in the complaint or at another time or place agreed to in writing by both the department and the alleged violator, and approved by the commission. On the basis of the evidence produced at the formal hearing, the commission shall enter an order which in its opinion will best further the purposes of this chapter and shall give written notice of that order to the alleged violator and to any other persons who participated as parties at the formal hearing or who made written request for notice of the order. The commission may assess penalties as provided in this section.

         Except as otherwise expressly provided, any notice or other instrument issued by or under authority of the commission may be served on any affected person personally or by publication, and proof of that service may be made in the same manner as in case of service of a summons in a civil action. The proof of service shall be filed in the office of the commission. Service may also be made by mailing a copy of the notice, order, or other instrument by certified mail, directed to the person affected at the person’s last known post-office address as shown by the files or records of the commission.

       When the commission determines that any person has violated this chapter or any regulation promulgated under this chapter, order of the commission issued under this chapter or condition or limitation of a permit issued under this chapter, the commission, after notice and opportunity for a formal hearing as provided in this section, unless expressly waived by the violator, may assess that person a civil penalty not to exceed Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars ($25,000.00) per violation. Each day of a continuing violation may be deemed a separate violation for purposes of penalty assessments. If a cessation order is issued under Section 53-9-69, the commission shall assess a civil penalty under this section. In determining the amount of the penalty, the commission shall consider the permittee’s history of previous violations at the particular surface coal mining operation; the seriousness of the violation, including any irreparable harm to the environment and any hazard to the health or safety of the public; whether the permittee was negligent; demonstrated good faith of the permittee charged in attempting to achieve rapid compliance after notification of the violation; and other factors set forth in Section 49-17-43.

The executive director shall forward any money submitted for placement in an escrow account in accordance with regulations promulgated by the commission. If, through administrative or judicial review of the violation or proposed penalty, the commission or a court of appropriate jurisdiction determines that no violation occurred or that the amount of the penalty should be reduced, the executive director shall within thirty (30) days remit the appropriate amount to the person with any interest earned on the money while in escrow. Failure to forward the proposed penalty amount to the executive director within thirty (30) days shall result in a waiver of all legal rights to contest the violation or the amount of the penalty. When all opportunities for administrative and judicial review have been exhausted, a failure to pay the civil penalty shall result in forfeiture of the bond or deposit in an amount not to exceed the amount of the penalty imposed. The commission may promulgate regulations regarding a waiver from the requirement to post a penalty payment bond upon a showing by the operator of an inability to post the bond.

The permit board, after adequate inspection and evaluation of the reclamation work involved, shall decide whether or not to release all or part of the bond or other collateral and shall notify the permittee in writing of its decision. If the permit board’s decision is not to release all or part of the bond or other collateral, the permit board shall state in writing the reasons for its decision and recommend corrective actions necessary to secure the release.

No part of the bond or other collateral shall be released under this paragraph if the lands to which the release would be applicable are contributing suspended solids to streamflow or runoff outside the permit area in excess of the requirements set by the regulations promulgated under Section 53-9-45, or until soil productivity for prime farmlands has returned to equivalent levels of yield as nonmined land of the same soil type in the surrounding area under equivalent management practices as determined from the soil survey performed in accordance with the regulations promulgated under Section 53-9-25. If a silt dam is to be retained as a permanent impoundment under the regulations promulgated under Section 53-9-45, the portion of bond or other collateral may be released under this paragraph if provisions for sound future maintenance by the operator or the landowner have been made with and approved by the permit board.

The failure of any person to submit comments within the time required shall not preclude action by the permit board. Any request for a public hearing concerning the bond release application shall be made in writing within thirty (30) days after the last publication of the notice described in subsection (1) of this section.

The last public hearing notice shall be published at least seven (7), but no more than fourteen (14) days before the scheduled public hearing date.

     <p>
      The Legislature finds and declares that:
     </p>
     <p>
      Within the state, mining constitutes a significant aspect of the state’s economy.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Interstate Mining Compact was established in 1966 to provide a forum for states having significant mining to exchange ideas on mining technology, conservation, and reclamation practices and to generate consensus policies for use as desired by member states and for input at the congressional and federal regulatory level of government.
     </p>
     <p>
      Membership in the Compact by the state will provide the Governor, as the representative of the state on the Interstate Mining Compact Commission, direct input on significant mining issues and policies and access to ideas and sources of information, not otherwise available, which may enable the state to initiate progressive or desired policies and mining control techniques that will be to the benefit of the citizens of Mississippi and the mining industry in the state.
     </p>
     <p>
      The purposes of the Interstate Mining Compact are recognized to be to:
     </p>
     <p>
      Advance the protection and restoration of land, water, and other resources affected by mining.
     </p>
     <p>
      Assist in the reduction, elimination, or counteracting of pollution or deterioration of land, water, and air attributable to mining.
     </p>
     <p>
      Encourage, with due recognition of relevant regional, physical, and other differences, programs in each of the party states which will achieve comparable results in protecting, conserving, and improving the usefulness of natural resources, to the end that the most desirable conduct of mining and related operations may be universally facilitated.
     </p>
     <p>
      Assist the party states in their efforts to facilitate the use of land and other resources affected by mining, so that such use may be consistent with sound land use, public health, and public safety, and to this end to study and recommend, wherever desirable, techniques for the improvement, restoration, or protection of such land and other resources.
     </p>
     <p>
      Assist in achieving and maintaining an efficient and productive mining industry and in increasing economic and other benefits attributable to mining.

      Any interested person adversely affected by any provision or section of this chapter within the jurisdiction of the board or by any rule, regulation or order made by the board thereunder, or by any act done or threatened thereunder, may obtain court review and seek relief by appeal to the Chancery Court of the First Judicial District of Hinds County, Mississippi, or the chancery court of the county in which the land involved, or any part thereof, is situated. The term “interested person” shall be interpreted broadly and liberally and shall include all mineral and royalty owners, mineral lessees, if any, and the owners of surface on which injection or re-injection wells and other surface equipment connected with a geologic sequestration facility is or will be situated. Any interested party may appeal to the chancery court of the county in which the land involved or any part thereof is situated, if appeal is demanded within thirty (30) days from the date that the rule, regulation or order of the board is filed for record in the office of the board.
     </p>
     <p>
      The appeal may be taken by filing notice of the appeal with the board, whereupon the board shall, under its certificate, transmit to the court appealed to all documents and papers on file in the matter, together with a transcript of the record, which documents and papers together with said transcript of the record shall be transmitted to the clerk of the chancery court of the county to which the appeal is taken.
