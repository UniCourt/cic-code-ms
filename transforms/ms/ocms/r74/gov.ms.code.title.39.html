     </h3>
     <p>
      There is hereby created a legislative reference bureau, for the use of the members of the legislature, the governor, and the various departments, institutions and agencies of this state, as well as for a limited service for such citizens of this state as may desire to avail themselves of its reference facilities. The legislative reference bureau shall be under the joint jurisdiction of the house management committee and the senate contingent expense committee of the legislature.
     </p>
     <p>
      The purpose of the said legislative reference bureau shall be:
     </p>
     <p>
      To assist the legislature of this state in the proper performance of its constitutional functions by providing its members with impartial and accurate information and reports concerning the legislative problems which come before them, and by providing digests showing the practices of other states and of foreign nations in dealing with similar problems;
     </p>
     <p>
      To secure information for the legislators of this state by cooperating with the legislative reference services in other states, and with the interstate reference bureau maintained by the American legislators’ association and by the council of state governments;
     </p>
     <p>
      To furnish the members of the legislature of this state, copies of the legislation of other states, uniform laws, model bills, textbooks on the preparation of legislative measures, and such other information and material as may be of value to them in the preparation of bills for introduction into the legislature of this state.
     </p>
     <p>
      The legislative reference bureau shall have a director, who shall be hired jointly by the house management committee and the senate contingent expense committee, and the duties of the director shall be prescribed jointly by the house management committee and the senate contingent expense committee.
     </p>
     <p>
      The legislative reference bureau shall be maintained out of the contingent funds of each house of the legislature, with an equal amount to be contributed by each house.

     <p>
      It is hereby declared to be the policy of this state to allow and promote the establishment and development of free public library service throughout this state as a part of its provisions for public education. “Public library” shall mean a library which provides customary services, without charge, to all the residents of a county, city or region and is supported whole or in part by public funds. Reasonable reimbursements may be collected for special library services provided these are determined in advance and in writing by the administrative board of trustees.
     </p>
     <p>
      The board of supervisors of any county in the State of Mississippi, or other governing bodies of the counties of this state, and municipalities and towns, through their governing bodies, may establish and maintain or aid in establishing and maintaining free public libraries for the use of the citizens of the respective counties, municipalities or towns, either separately or in connection with free public libraries already established therein. For said purpose said governing body may acquire the necessary real estate either by purchase, gift or donation and may erect the necessary buildings thereon.

       Pursuant to Miss. Code Section 39-3-15, management and control of municipal public library is vested in board of trustees; therefore, board of trustees has responsibility to establish policy and procedures for preservation and exhibition of rare or scholarly books and papers. Ellis, Apr. 29, 1993, A.G. Op. #93-0299.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trustees who were in office on July 1, 1988 are eligible to serve two consecutive terms, which includes any time they served in office before July 1, 1988, in accordance with 39-3-15(6). McCartney, August 10, 1993, A.G. Op. #93-0549.
      </p>
      <p>
       While Section 39-3-15(6) enumerates certain qualifications and limitations on board membership, there is no statutory directive that dictates term length for regional board membership for systems supported by less than five counties, nor is there any provision under Chapter 3, Title 39 of the Mississippi Code that prohibits appointment of county library board member to concurrent service on regional library board. Williams, Feb. 1, 1994, A.G. Op. #93-0714.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pursuant to Section 39-3-8 the terms of the trustees are calculated from the time they were originally appointed, even though the city and the county did not formally execute a contract establishing a joint city/county library until January 12, 1994. Section 39-3-15(6) limits terms of trustees in counties of over 20,000 to two consecutive terms of office. Wegener, October 25, 1996, A.G. Op. #96-0682.
      </p>
      <p>
       The director of a library can, with the authorization, may change a part-time position to a full-time one and is not bound by legal duty to offer any particular position to a former employee. Hurst, Nov. 21, 1997, A.G. Op. #97-0713.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trustees of libraries in counties of over twenty thousand population are limited to two full consecutive terms of office, but service by a trustee in a predecessor’s unexpired term is not included in this calculation.

       There is no requirement that advisory boards of trustees within a regional library system be or remain as signatories to the agreement by the governmental entities creating the regional system. Williams, Apr. 1, 2005, A.G. Op. 05-0100.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once a regional library system is established, and an administrative board of trustees is appointed, the membership and terms of membership of remaining boards of trustees within the system must be consistent with the requirements of Section 39-3-15, absent any provision which may provide otherwise.

      The Mississippi Library Commission, upon request, shall give advice to all schools, public and other libraries, and to all communities which may propose to establish them, as to the best means of establishing and maintaining such libraries, the selection of books, cataloging and other details of library management. It may also purchase and operate traveling libraries, and circulate such traveling libraries within the state among communities, libraries, schools, colleges, universities, library associations, study clubs, charitable and penal institutions free of cost, except for transportation, and establish county and regional libraries and use any funds, separate and apart from the general library commission funds, which might come into its custody from any source, for such purpose, and for the purpose of establishing, stimulating, increasing, improving and equalizing library service in the various counties within the state, under such rules for safekeeping, preservation, care, handling of the books and allocation of the funds as may be fixed by the commission. It may publish such lists and circulars of information as it shall deem necessary, and it may also conduct a summer school of library instruction and a clearinghouse for periodicals for free gifts to local libraries. The commission shall each year obtain from all libraries in the state reports showing the condition, growth, development and manner of conducting such libraries, together with such other facts and statistics regarding the same as may be deemed of public interest by the commission, and it shall be the duty of the board of the Mississippi Library Commission to make an annual report to the Legislature of the facts of public interest and value in relation to the work of the commission. The Mississippi Library Commission shall adopt rules and regulations relative to the allocation of state aid funds to public library systems.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The Interstate Library Compact is hereby enacted into law and entered into by this state with all states legally joining therein in the form substantially as follows:
     </p>
     <p>
      INTERSTATE LIBRARY COMPACT
     </p>
     <p>
      Article I. Policy and Purpose
     </p>
     <p>
      Because the desire for the services provided by libraries transcends governmental boundaries and can most effectively be satisfied by giving such services to communities and people regardless of jurisdictional lines, it is the policy of the states party to this compact to cooperate and share their responsibilities; to authorize cooperation and sharing with respect to those types of library facilities and services which can be more economically or efficiently developed and maintained on a cooperative basis, and to authorize cooperation and sharing among localities, states and others in providing joint or cooperative library services in areas where the distribution of population or of existing and potential library resources make the provision of library service on an interstate basis the most effective way of providing adequate and efficient service.
     </p>
     <p>
      Article II. Definitions
     </p>
     <p>
      As used in this compact:
     </p>
     <p>
      “Public library agency” means any unit or agency of local or state government operating or having power to operate a library.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Private library agency” means any nongovernmental entity which operates or assumes a legal obligation to operate a library.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Library agreement” means a contract establishing an interstate library district pursuant to this compact or providing for the joint or cooperative furnishing of library services.
     </p>
     <p>
      Article III. Interstate Library Districts
     </p>
     <p>
      Any one or more public library agencies in a party state in cooperation with any public library agency or agencies in one or more other party states may establish and maintain an interstate library district. Subject to the provisions of this compact and any other laws of the party states which pursuant hereto remain applicable, such district may establish, maintain and operate some or all of the library facilities and services for the area concerned in accordance with the terms of a library agreement therefor. Any private library agency or agencies within an interstate library district may cooperate therewith, assume duties, responsibilities and obligations thereto, and receive benefits therefrom as provided in any library agreement to which such agency or agencies become party.
     </p>
     <p>
      Within an interstate library district, and as provided by a library agreement, the performance of library functions may be undertaken on a joint or cooperative basis or may be undertaken by means of one or more arrangements between or among public or private library agencies for the extension of library privileges to the use of facilities or services operated or rendered by one or more of the individual library agencies.
     </p>
     <p>
      If a library agreement provides for joint establishment, maintenance or operation of library facilities or services by an interstate library district, such district shall have power to do any one or more of the following in accordance with such library agreement:
     </p>
     <p>
      1. Undertake, administer and participate in programs or arrangements for securing, lending or servicing of books and other publications, any other materials suitable to be kept or made available by libraries, library equipment or for the dissemination of information about libraries, the value and significance of particular items therein, and the use thereof.
     </p>
     <p>
      2. Accept for any of its purposes under this compact any and all donations, and grants of money, equipment, supplies, materials, and services, (conditional or otherwise) from any state or the United States or any subdivision or agency thereof, or interstate agency, or from any institution, person, firm or corporation, and receive, utilize and dispose of the same.
     </p>
     <p>
      3. Operate mobile library units or equipment for the purpose of rendering bookmobile service within the district.
     </p>
     <p>
      4. Employ professional, technical, clerical, and other personnel, and fix terms of employment, compensation and other appropriate benefits; and where desirable, provide for the inservice training of such personnel.
     </p>
     <p>
      5. Acquire, hold, and dispose of any real or personal property or any interest or interests therein as may be appropriate to the rendering of library service.
     </p>
     <p>
      6. Construct, maintain and operate a library, including any appropriate branches thereof.
     </p>
     <p>
      7. Do such other things as may be incidental to or appropriate for the carrying out of any of the foregoing powers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Article IV. Interstate Library Districts, Governing Board
     </p>
     <p>
      An interstate library district which establishes, maintains or operates any facilities or services in its own right shall have a governing board which shall direct the affairs of the district and act for it in all matters relating to its business. Each participating public library agency in the district shall be represented on the governing board which shall be organized and conduct its business in accordance with provision therefor in the library agreement. But in no event shall a governing board meet less often than twice a year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any private library agency or agencies party to a library agreement establishing an interstate library district may be represented on or advise with the governing board of the district in such manner as the library agreement may provide.
     </p>
     <p>
      Article V. State Library Agency Cooperation
     </p>
     <p>
      Any two or more state library agencies of two or more of the party states may undertake and conduct joint or cooperative library programs, render joint or cooperative library services, and enter into and perform arrangements for the cooperative or joint acquisition, use, housing and disposition of items or collections of materials which, by reason of expense, rarity, specialized nature, or infrequency of demand therefor would be appropriate for central collection and shared use. Any such programs, services or arrangements may include provision for the exercise on a cooperative or joint basis of any power exercisable by an interstate library district and an agreement embodying any such program, service or arrangement shall contain provisions covering the subjects detailed in Article VI of this compact for interstate library agreements.
     </p>
     <p>
      Article VI. Library Agreement
     </p>
     <p>
      In order to provide for any joint or cooperative undertaking pursuant to this compact, public and private library agencies may enter into library agreements. Any agreement executed pursuant to the provisions of this compact shall, as among the parties to the agreement:
     </p>
     <p>
      1. Detail the specific nature of the services, programs, facilities, arrangements or properties to which it is applicable.
     </p>
     <p>
      2. Provide for the allocation of costs and other financial responsibilities.
     </p>
     <p>
      3. Specify the respective rights, duties, obligations and liabilities of the parties.
     </p>
     <p>
      4. Set forth the terms and conditions for duration, renewal, termination, abrogation, disposal of joint or common property, if any, and all other matters which may be appropriate to the proper effectuation and performance of the agreement.
     </p>
     <p>
      No public or private library agency shall undertake to exercise itself, or jointly with any other library agency, by means of a library agreement any power prohibited to such agency by the constitution or statutes of its state.
     </p>
     <p>
      No library agreement shall become effective until filed with the compact administrator of each state involved, and approved in accordance with Article VII of this compact.
     </p>
     <p>
      Article VII. Approval of Library Agreements
     </p>
     <p>
      Every library agreement made pursuant to this compact shall, prior to and as a condition precedent to its entry into force, be submitted to the attorney general of each state in which a public library agency party thereto is situated, who shall determine whether the agreement is in proper form and compatible with the laws of his state. The attorneys general shall approve any agreement submitted to them unless they shall find that it does not meet the conditions set forth herein and shall detail in writing addressed to the governing bodies of the public library agencies concerned the specific respects in which the proposed agreement fails to meet the requirements of law. Failure to disapprove an agreement submitted hereunder within ninety days of its submission shall constitute approval thereof.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the event that a library agreement made pursuant to this compact shall deal in whole or in part with the provision of services or facilities with regard to which an officer or agency of the state government has constitutional or statutory powers of control, the agreement shall, as a condition precedent to its entry into force, be submitted to the state officer or agency having such power of control and shall be approved or disapproved by him or it as to all matters within his or its jurisdiction in the same manner and subject to the same requirements governing the action of the attorneys general pursuant to paragraph (a) of this article. This requirement of submission and approval shall be in addition to and not in substitution for the requirement of submission to and approval by the attorneys general.
     </p>
     <p>
      Article VIII. Other Laws Applicable
     </p>
     <p>
      Nothing in this compact or in any library agreement shall be construed to supersede, alter or otherwise impair any obligation imposed on any library by otherwise applicable law, nor to authorize the transfer or disposition of any property held in trust by a library agency in a manner contrary to the terms of such trust.
     </p>
     <p>
      Article IX. Appropriations and Aid
     </p>
     <p>
      Any public library agency party to a library agreement may appropriate funds to the interstate library district established thereby in the same manner and to the same extent as to a library wholly maintained by it and, subject to the laws of the state in which such public library agency is situated, may pledge its credit in support of an interstate library district established by the agreement.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subject to the provisions of the library agreement pursuant to which it functions and the laws of the states in which such district is situated, an interstate library district may claim and receive any state and federal aid which may be available to library agencies.
     </p>
     <p>
      Article X. Compact Administrator
     </p>
     <p>
      Each state shall designate a compact administrator with whom copies of all library agreements to which his state or any public library agency thereof is party shall be filed. The administrator shall have such other powers as may be conferred upon him by the laws of his state and may consult and cooperate with the compact administrators of other party states and take such steps as may effectuate the purposes of this compact. If the laws of a party state so provide, such state may designate one or more deputy compact administrators in addition to its compact administrator.
     </p>
     <p>
      Article XI. Entry Into Force and Withdrawal
     </p>
     <p>
      This compact shall enter into force and effect immediately upon its enactment into law by any two states. Thereafter, it shall enter into force and effect as to any other state upon the enactment thereof by such state.
     </p>
     <p>
      This compact shall continue in force with respect to a party state and remain binding upon such state until six months after such state has given notice to each other party state of the repeal thereof. Such withdrawal shall not be construed to relieve any party to a library agreement entered into pursuant to this compact from any obligation of that agreement prior to the end of its duration as provided therein.
     </p>
     <p>
      Article XII. Construction and Severability
     </p>
     <p>
      This compact shall be liberally construed so as effectuate the purposes thereof. The provisions of this compact shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this compact is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any party state or of the United States or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If this compact shall be held contrary to the constitution of any state party thereto, the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining states and in full force and effect as to the state affected as to all severable matters.

       There is created in the State Treasury a special fund to be known as the “Mississippi History Trust Fund.” The Mississippi Department of Archives and History may solicit and accept donations, bequests, devises, gifts and grants of money from individuals, organizations, and corporations to be deposited in the Mississippi History Trust Fund. All funds deposited in the Mississippi History Trust Fund shall be expended upon appropriation by the Legislature, solely for the purpose of collecting, preserving, protecting, researching and interpreting the State of Mississippi’s historic resources and for promoting the appreciation of those resources.

       The Mississippi Department of Archives and History, with the advice of the Office of the State Treasurer, is authorized to establish a comprehensive investment plan for the purposes of the Mississippi History Trust Fund and to invest any funds in the trust fund in any instrument, obligation, security or property that constitutes legal investments and holdings. The comprehensive investment plan shall specify the investment policies to be used by the department in its administration of the funds in the trust fund. The department may authorize investments in any investment vehicle authorized for the Mississippi Prepaid Affordable College Tuition (MPACT) Program under Section 37-155-9. However, the restrictions in Section 37-155-9 as to percentages of the total fund that may be invested in any category of authorized investment shall not apply to the Mississippi History Trust Fund.

       Notwithstanding any state law to the contrary, the department shall invest or cause to be invested the funds in the trust fund in a manner reasonable and appropriate to achieve the objectives of the trust fund, exercising the discretion and care of a prudent investor in similar circumstances with similar objectives. The department shall give due consideration to the risk, expected rate of return, term or maturity, diversification of total investments, liquidity and anticipated investments in and withdrawals from the trust fund. The department shall acquire all investments at prices not exceeding the prevailing market values for those securities.
      </li>
      <li id="t39c05s39-5-24ol14">
       Any limitations set forth in this section shall be applicable only at the time of purchase and shall not require the liquidation of any investment at any time. All investments shall be marked clearly to indicate ownership by the trust fund and, to the extent possible, shall be registered in the name of the trust fund.
      </li>
      <li id="t39c05s39-5-24ol15">
       Subject to the terms, conditions, limitations and restrictions set forth in this section, the department may sell, assign, transfer and dispose of any of the securities and investments of the trust fund if the sale, assignment or transfer has the approval of a majority of the entire Board of Trustees of the Mississippi Department of Archives and History. The department may employ or contract with investment managers, evaluation services, or other such services as determined by the department to be necessary for the effective and efficient operation of the trust fund.
      </li>

      <li id="t39c05s39-5-24ol17">
       The department, with the advice of the Office of the State Treasurer, may establish criteria for investment managers, mutual funds or other such entities to act as contractors or consultants to the department. The department may contract, either directly or through those contractors or consultants, to provide such services as may be a part of the comprehensive investment plan or as may be deemed necessary or proper by the department, including, but not limited to, providing consolidated billing, individual and collective record keeping and accounting, and asset purchase, control and safekeeping.

      <p>
       In view of the fact that surplus property owned by a city was a protected Mississippi landmark, the city could place covenants on the property restricting its use to the uses set out in the notice of sale and such covenants could continue forever; further, the city could take into consideration in awarding the bid for the sale of the property the proposed use of the property, the scope of the proposed rehabilitation of the structure, and the time period for beginning and completing rehabilitation efforts as well as the monetary bid offered.

     <p>
      Any site located upon private lands which is determined by majority vote of the board to be of sufficient archaeological, historical or architectural significance may be designated by the board as a Mississippi landmark. It is specifically provided, however, that no such site shall be so designated upon private land without the written consent of the landowner or landowners in recordable form sufficiently describing the site so that it may be located. Upon such designation the consent of the landowner shall be recorded in the deed records of the county in which the land is located. Any such site upon private land shall be marked by at least one (1) marker, approved by the board, bearing the words “Mississippi Landmark” for each five (5) acres of area.

      Upon majority vote of the board any Mississippi landmark on public or private land may be determined to be of no further historical, archaeological, or architectural significance, or not of sufficient significance to warrant its further classification as such, and upon such determination it may be removed from such designation. In the case of sites located on private land that have theretofore been designated by instrument of record, the board is authorized to cause to be executed and recorded in the deed records of the county where such site is located an instrument setting out such determination and releasing the site from the provisions thereof.

      The board shall be authorized to enter into contracts with other state agencies or institutions and with qualified private institutions, corporations, or individuals for the discovery and salvage of treasure imbedded in the earth, sunken or abandoned ships or wrecks of the sea, parts thereof and their contents. Such contracts are to be on forms approved by the attorney general. The contracts may provide for fair compensation to the salvager in terms of a percentage of the reasonable cash value of the objects recovered, or at the discretion of the board, of a fair share of the objects recovered. The amount constituting a fair share shall be determined by the board, taking into consideration the circumstances of each such operation. The reasonable cash value may be determined by contract provision providing for appraisal by qualified experts or by representatives of the contracting parties and their representative or representatives. Such contract shall provide for the termination of any right in the salvager or permittee thereunder upon the violation of any of the terms thereof. Superior title to all objects recovered shall be retained by the State of Mississippi unless and until it is released to the salvager or permittee by the board. No person, firm, or corporation may conduct such salvage or recovery operation herein described without first obtaining such contract. All such contracts shall specify, among other things, the location, nature of the activity, and the time period covered thereby, and when executed are to be recorded by the person, firm, or corporation obtaining such contract, in the office of the chancery clerk in the county or counties where such operations are to be conducted, prior to the commencement of such operation.

     <p>
      The board shall be authorized to conduct surveys to identify Mississippi landmarks on or under all lands and waters belonging to the State of Mississippi, or any county, city or political subdivisions of the state and to excavate or study all Mississippi landmarks. The board shall be further authorized to identify and excavate historic, architectural, or archaeological sites on private property, however, it is specifically provided that no such survey may be undertaken on private land without consent of the landowner and that no excavation may be undertaken on private land without the landowner’s written consent.

      <li id="t39c07s39-7-22ol11">
       In the early stages of planning and always prior to the letting of bids for public construction, public improvement of any nature, or the transfer of public property to private ownership, state agencies, local governments and all their political subdivisions shall notify the board of the planned action on a form supplied by the board. The board may survey the affected area, property, structure, or building, to determine if potential Mississippi landmarks will be affected, or if significant sites, buildings, or structures on nonpublic lands will be affected.
      </li>
      <li id="t39c07s39-7-22ol12">
       If the department determines that significant historic, architectural, or archaeological sites, buildings, structures, locations, or remains will be adversely affected by the public construction or improvement, the proposed public construction or improvement may not be commenced until the department has issued the permit herein required, and has performed all necessary investigations, recording and/or salvage of the site, location or remains. All investigation, recording and salvage work shall be performed as expeditiously as possible so that no public construction project will be unduly impaired, impeded or delayed.
      </li>
      <li id="t39c07s39-7-22ol13">
       If in the course of performing public construction or improvements, historic, prehistoric or archaeological sites, locations, remains or objects are discovered, the department shall be notified and its concurrence shall be requested in continuing the construction or improvement. Upon receipt of this notice, the department shall survey the area to confirm whether the area contains historic, prehistoric, or archaeological data which should be preserved in the public interest. The survey shall be conducted as expeditiously as possible. If, as a result of the survey, it is determined that (a) this data exists in the area, (b) the data has exceptional historic, prehistoric or archaeological significance and should be collected and preserved in the public interest, and (c) it is feasible to collect and preserve the data, the department shall perform the necessary work to collect and preserve the data. This work shall be performed as expeditiously as possible. When it is not feasible to collect the data, the agency shall make all reasonable attempts to avoid the site before proceeding. If in the board’s opinion the site possesses unusual significance, and is unique to such a degree that the landmark is, or is likely to be, the sole representative of a type or period, the board may prohibit further construction which would destroy or irreparably harm the landmark.

      <p>
       While the commission has statutory authority pursuant to this section to study and survey resources, to recommend to the city adoption of ordinances designating districts, landmarks and landmark sites, and to recommend subdistricts, the commission does not have statutory authority to grant or deny certificates of appropriateness for constructing, altering or demolishing buildings, to employ staff, or to make contracts with technical personnel.

   Any ordinance that the governing authorities of a city adopt must comply with the provisions of §§<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t39c13s39-13-1" target="_self">39-13-1</a></cite> et seq., governing the area of local historic preservation; an ordinance making the preservation commission advisory only and providing that all decisions as to designations under the statute will lie solely with the board of aldermen is not in compliance. Carter, Sept. 27, 2002, A.G. Op. #02-0493.

       A local historic preservation commission established under Sections 39-13-1 et seq. cannot be solely an advisory body. Nowak, Apr. 28, 2006, A.G. Op. 06-0143.

    Definitions.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The following words and phrases shall have the meanings ascribed herein unless the context clearly indicates otherwise:
     </p>
     <p>
      “Alteration” means any change in the exterior appearance or materials of a landmark or a structure within a historic district or on a landmark site.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Certificate of appropriateness” means an official signed and dated governmental document issued by either a local historic preservation commission or a governing authority to permit specific work in a historic district or at a landmark site or landmark which has been reviewed and approved.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Construction” means work which is neither alteration nor demolition. Essentially, it is the erection of a new structure which did not previously exist, even if such a structure is partially joined to an existing structure.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Demolition” means the intentional removal of a structure within a local historic district or on a landmark site or which has been designated as a landmark.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Demolition by neglect” means substantial deterioration of a historic structure that results from improper maintenance or a lack of maintenance.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Design review guidelines,” if adopted by a local historic preservation commission, shall be in a written form designed to inform local property owners about historical architectural styles prevalent in a community and to recommend preferred treatments and discourage treatments that would compromise the architectural integrity of structures in a historic district or on a landmark site or individually designated as landmarks.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Historic landmark” means a structure of exceptional individual significance and typically is a structure which could not be included within a local historic district.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Historic preservation commission” means a municipal or county body established to advise a local government on matters relating to historic preservation, including the designation of historic districts, landmarks and landmark sites, and which may be empowered to review applications for permits for alteration, construction, demolition, relocation or subdivision for structures in historic districts or on landmark sites or designated as landmarks.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Historic district” means a group of two (2) or more tax parcels and their structures, and may be an entire neighborhood of structures linked by historical association or historical development. It is not necessary that all structures within a historic district share the same primary architectural style or be from the same primary historical period. A historic district may also include both commercial and residential structures, and may include structures covered by two (2) or more zoning classifications. A historic district may include both contributing and noncontributing structures.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Landmark site” means a location where a primary architectural or historical resource formerly stood or a significant historic event took place or an important archeological resource remains.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Period of greatest historic significance for a landmark” means the time period during which the landmark had been essentially completed but not yet altered. It is also the period during which the style of architecture of the landmark was commonplace or typical. If a landmark also achieved historical importance in part because of designed landscape features, the period of greatest historic significance includes the time period during which such landscape features were maintained.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Relocation” means the moving of a structure to a new location on its tax parcel or the relocation of such a structure to a new tax parcel.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Structure” means a man-made object and typically will be visible because of portions which exist above grade. Structures built during the historic period, 1700 forward, may in some instances not be visible above grade if they are cellars, cisterns, icehouses or similar objects which by their nature are intended to be built into the ground. A structure includes both interior components and visible exterior surfaces, as well as attached elements such as signs and related features such as walks, walls, fences and other nearby secondary structures or landmark features.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Subdistricts” means discrete areas within a larger historic district within which separate design guidelines are appropriate and that may be created to recognize different zoning classifications or historic development patterns which have caused adjacent historic areas to develop at different times.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Subdivision” includes any change in the boundaries of a single tax parcel, whether the change results in expansion or reduction or a boundary relocation.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Substantial deterioration” means structural degradation of such a nature that water penetration into a historic structure can no longer be prevented, or structural degradation that causes stress or strain on structural members when supports collapse or warp, evidence of which includes defective roofing materials, broken window coverings and visible interior decay.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Survey of resources” means the documentation, by historical research or a photographic record, of structures of historical interest within a specified area or jurisdiction or of existing structures within a proposed historic district.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Unauthorized demolition” means the deliberate demolition of a historic structure without prior review and approval by a local historic preservation commission or a governing authority to which such a commission has made a recommendation.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Unreasonable economic hardship” means the definition under constitutional standards used to determine whether a “taking” exists.

    Authority to create local historic preservation commissions; authority and procedure for establishment of districts and designation of landmarks.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The governing authority of each municipality and county, either independently or jointly with the governing authority of an adjacent municipality or county, or both, is hereby empowered, in its discretion, to enact ordinances providing for the creation of one or more local historic preservation commissions to advise on the establishment and location of potential historic districts and the designation of potential historic landmarks and landmark sites within the jurisdictional area of the governing authority. The governing authorities of each municipality and county, either independently or jointly with the governing authorities of an adjacent municipality, may enact ordinances for the establishment of such local historic districts, historic landmarks and landmark sites within the jurisdictional area of the governing authorities as these authorities shall choose to designate. Each such ordinance shall be adopted after investigation of the historical, architectural, archaeological and cultural significance of the buildings, structures, features, sites and surroundings of such districts, landmarks or landmark sites and after having held public hearing thereon. Notice of such public hearing, specifying the boundaries of any proposed historic district and the location of proposed historic landmarks and landmark sites shall be published once a week for at least three (3) consecutive weeks in at least one (1) newspaper published in such municipality or county. The first publication of such resolution shall be made not less than twenty-one (21) days prior to the date fixed in such resolution for the public hearing and the last publication shall be made not more than seven (7) days prior to such date. If no newspaper be published in such municipality or county, then such notice shall be given by publishing the resolution for the required time in some newspaper having a general circulation in such municipality or county.
     </p>
     <p>
      An ordinance to establish a local historic preservation commission may precede an ordinance to designate one or more local historic districts and one or more landmarks or landmark sites. Whenever governing authorities enact such an ordinance creating a historic preservation commission before an ordinance or ordinances designating one or more local historic districts and one or more landmarks or landmark sites, the local historic preservation commission shall review such potential local historic districts or potential landmarks or landmark sites and make a recommendation to the governing authorities before such designation.

      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Before it may designate one or more historic districts, or simultaneously with such designation, the governing body of any county or municipality, individually or jointly, shall establish a historic preservation commission to preserve, promote and develop the historical resources of such county or municipality in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. The historic preservation commission shall have the following powers:
     </p>
     <p>
      The commission shall conduct or cause to be conducted a continuing study and survey of resources within the county or municipality or combination thereof.
     </p>
     <p>
      The commission shall recommend to the county or municipality or combination thereof the adoption of ordinances designating historic districts, landmarks and landmark sites.
     </p>
     <p>
      The commission may recommend that the county or municipality or combination thereof recognize subdistricts within any historic district in order that the commission may adopt specific guidelines for the regulation of properties within such a subdistrict.
     </p>
     <p>
      The commission shall review applications proposing construction, alteration, demolition or relocation of any resource or subdivision of tax parcels designated as landmarks or landmark sites contained within a historic district. The document granting such an application shall be known as a certificate of appropriateness. No commission may deny a certificate of appropriateness for demolition if denial of such a certificate would cause unreasonable economic hardship to an owner.
     </p>
     <p>
      The commission shall use as a basis for its decisions on applications for certificates of appropriateness the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation and Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings as well as any more specific design review guidelines adopted by the commission or the governing authority of the county or municipality or combination thereof.
     </p>
     <p>
      The commission, at the discretion of the governing authority, may grant or deny the certificates of appropriateness in whole or in part and may grant certificates of appropriateness contingent upon the acceptance by the applicant of specified conditions.
     </p>
     <p>
      The commission shall not consider interior arrangements of buildings and structures except that it may when requested by the Department of Archives and History to advise the department on questions relating to the interiors of publicly owned historic buildings. Interior arrangements not to be considered by the commission shall include floor plans, architectural details and finishes, but the commission may consider interior structural elements visible through doors or windows if they become deteriorated because of demolition by neglect. Such interior structural elements may include walls, floors and ceilings, as well as other supporting elements of a composite structure.
     </p>
     <p>
      The commission may, by local ordinance, review proposed governmental actions affecting governmentally owned structures included within local historic districts, located on landmark sites or designated as landmarks.
     </p>
     <p>
      The commission, subject to the consent of and requirements of the county or municipality or combination thereof, may apply for, receive, hold and spend funds from private and public sources in addition to appropriations made by the county or municipality or combination thereof for the purpose of carrying out the duties of the commission.
     </p>
     <p>
      The commission, subject to the consent of and the requirements of the county or municipality or combination thereof, may employ such staff or contract with technical experts or other persons as may be required for the performance of its duties and may obtain the equipment, supplies and other materials necessary for its effective operation.
     </p>
     <p>
      The commission, solely in the performance of its official duties and only at reasonable times, may enter upon private land for the examination or survey thereof. No member, employee or agent of the commission shall enter any private dwelling or structure without the express consent of the owner of record or occupant thereof.
     </p>
     <p>
      A municipality, by ordinance, may specify that color changes are outside the jurisdiction of the commission.
     </p>
     <p>
      Such commission shall consist of not fewer than five (5) nor more than nine (9) residents of the county or municipality, or combination thereof, establishing the commission who shall be appointed by the governing authority with due regard to proper representation in such fields as history, architecture, urban planning, archaeology and law. All members of the commission shall serve at the will and pleasure of the governing authority appointing them and shall serve staggered terms. The precise method of appointment, and general terms of appointment, shall be specified in a local ordinance. If a documented good faith effort has been made unsuccessfully by the governing authority to locate residents of the county or municipality to serve on the commission, the governing authority may appoint individuals who own property within the boundary of the county or municipality, or both, or are in the service of an employer located within the boundary of the county or municipality, or both. The commission annually shall elect from its membership a chairman and a vice chairman and may employ such qualified staff personnel and counsel as it deems necessary. The commission shall retain as evidence of its discussions and decisions a complete set of minutes and may additionally create tape recordings or transcripts of its meetings. In addition, the commission shall retain copies of all applications filed with it including supporting documentation that may be added during open public meetings to supplement an original application or comment thereon. The commission shall advise the governing authority as to the designation of historic districts and the designation of historic landmarks and landmark sites. If any governing authority, in its discretion, chooses to divide the duties and responsibilities of the commission into no more than two (2) commissions or boards, each commission or board shall be established as directed in this section.

    Notification to Department of Archives and History of proposed designation of historic district or local historic preservation commission; comments by department concerning proposed district or commission.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      No historic district or districts shall be designated until the Mississippi Department of Archives and History has been notified by certified letter by the governing authority of a municipality or county and invited to make recommendations concerning the proposed district boundaries. The Mississippi Department of Archives and History may comment by letter, telephone, e-mail or in person through designated staff. The boundary of a historic district or landmark or landmark site may follow the formal legal description of a tax parcel or parcels or, because of historical justification or topographical conditions, may deviate from such formal legal descriptions. When a boundary deviates from formal legal descriptions, there must be written justification for such a deviation in any local designating ordinance.
     </p>
     <p>
      When a municipality or county has already created by ordinance a local historic preservation commission, that commission shall jointly notify both the governing authority of the municipality or county and the Mississippi Department of Archives and History that a historic district is being proposed and recommended and shall provide to the Mississippi Department of Archives and History the dates of the next two (2) public meetings of the governing authority at which action on the designation of such a district might be taken so that the Mississippi Department of Archives and History may comment in a timely manner. Failure of the Mississippi Department of Archives and History to comment by the date of the second such meeting shall relieve the municipality or county of any responsibility for awaiting and responding to such analysis, and the body may at any time thereafter take any necessary action to create the proposed historic district.
     </p>
     <p>
      When a municipality or county has not previously created by ordinance a local historic preservation commission and the governing authority proposes to create such a commission, the governing authority must give the Mississippi Department of Archives and History an opportunity to comment on the proposed provisions for such an ordinance, unless such ordinance is substantially identical to any model local historic preservation ordinance which has been recommended and promulgated by the Mississippi Department of Archives and History. Whenever the Mississippi Department of Archives and History is invited to comment on the terms of a proposed local historic preservation ordinance, failure of the department to comment within forty-five (45) days after a written request for comments has been received shall relieve the governing authority of any responsibility to wait further for such comments.

      The governing authority of any county or municipality, individually or jointly, is authorized to make appropriations to a historic preservation commission, in any amount that it may determine necessary for the expenses of the operation of such commission. A governing authority may apply to participate in the Certified Local Government Program of the National Park Service, which is administered in Mississippi by the Department of Archives and History and may on behalf of a local historic preservation commission apply for funding from the Department of Archives and History to supplement funds available from the governing authority itself. Said governing authorities shall not be empowered to acquire by eminent domain any historic preservation properties unless such properties are needed for governmental purposes other than historic preservation.

    Designation of historic districts, landmarks, and landmark sites; procedures; vote of historic preservation commission; public hearing; vote of local governing authority to adopt or reject designation.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      A governing authority may provide by local ordinance the procedures to be followed to designate historic districts, landmarks and landmark sites. Such an ordinance may provide that a governing authority may designate such properties upon the recommendation of a local historic preservation commission.
     </p>
     <p>
      A potential historic district or landmark or landmark site may be proposed for designation by either a majority of the members of a local historic preservation commission or an owner of a potential landmark or landmark site or an organization which has as one of its central purposes the promotion of historic preservation objectives. If in private ownership, a landmark site must include significant surviving landscape features to qualify for designation unless its primary significance is archeological, and new construction after review and approval, shall be built to fit into such landscape features rather than replace them or shall be designed to avoid insofar as possible an archeological resource rather than replace it. If in public ownership, a local historic preservation commission shall discourage new construction on a site of great significance to the entire community unless the new construction can be located on a portion of the site which will permit a continuing understanding of its historical character and will avoid damage to surviving landscape features or an archeological resource.
     </p>
     <p>
      Once a nomination has been filed with an existing historic preservation commission or the governing authority of a municipality or county proposing to create such a commission and designate one or more local properties, a decision on whether to proceed with the designation must be made within six (6) months.
     </p>
     <p>
      When a historic preservation commission already exists within a community, a majority of the commission’s members must vote in favor of any proposed designation in order for the file supporting the designation to be sent forward to the local governing authority for its consideration. No file purporting to justify a proposed designation may be forwarded to a governing authority unless the commission’s recommendation includes a map that clearly delineates boundaries for the proposed designation, a verbal description and justification of the proposed boundaries and a written statement of significance for the historic district or landmark or landmark site proposed for designation. Unless justification is contained in a designating ordinance, the boundary for any historic landmark shall include an entire tax parcel and may include adjoining tax parcels that were historically linked to the primary parcel during the period of greatest historic significance for the landmark structure.
     </p>
     <p>
      The local governing authority must conduct at least one public hearing on the proposed designation and notice of the public hearing must be published weekly for at least three (3) consecutive weeks in a local newspaper authorized to publish legal notices.
     </p>
     <p>
      The local governing authority must take action on the proposed designation within sixty (60) days of the public hearing, either to adopt a designating ordinance or to reject the proposed designation.
     </p>
     <p>
      As quickly as would be reasonably possible, a local historic preservation commission must notify other municipal agencies and any appropriate county or state agencies of the designation of a historic district, landmark or landmark site. The commission must maintain in its official files an updated list and map of local designations and provide copies of such a map to other governmental agencies within one (1) week of the preparation of a new version of the map.

    Issuance of certificates of appropriateness for certain construction, alteration, demolition or relocation of structures within a historic district or landmark property.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      A local historic preservation commission, if so empowered by a local ordinance or a local government acting upon the advice of a local historic preservation commission, may approve an application and issue a certificate of appropriateness if it finds that a proposed construction, alteration, demolition, subdivision or relocation is consistent with the design review guidelines established by the commission, would be compatible with the character of a historic district or landmark or landmark site and does not compromise the historic and architectural integrity of the historic district, landmark or landmark site. A governing authority may require that a property owner post a bond to guarantee satisfactory completion of a relocation project. Any local historic preservation ordinance shall specify whether partial demolition shall be considered an alteration or demolition, as it may not be both.
     </p>
     <p>
      Whenever a local historic preservation commission shall deny or recommend denial of a certificate of appropriateness, the commission must state the reasons for such denial in writing. Thereafter, an applicant may resubmit a new application at any time, except that an applicant must wait six (6) months whenever an application for a certificate of appropriateness is denied for a landmark property of statewide or national significance and notice of any second or subsequent application must be sent to the Mississippi Department of Archives and History as well as to the local historic preservation commission.
     </p>
     <p>
      A governing authority may require that denial of a certificate of appropriateness shall be binding upon a local building inspector or the agency responsible for issuing building permits and shall prevent the issuance of other building permits for the same parcel until a certificate of appropriateness is approved. A certificate of appropriateness may be required for work which does not require a building permit. A certificate of appropriateness may be evidenced by either a written and dated letter to an owner or applicant or such a letter accompanied by a signed and dated stamp on the face of any and all architectural or project drawings prepared for a project. A governing authority may provide by ordinance that a certificate of appropriateness shall expire at the end of a specified time period if work has not begun.

       § 39-13-15.
    Demolition by neglect; demolition of historic landmark or landmark site without review and approval by historic preservation commission.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The governing authority of any county or municipality, individually or jointly, may enact local legislation governing “demolition by neglect,” defined as improper maintenance or lack of maintenance of any property in a historic district, or any historic landmark or landmark site, which results in substantial deterioration of such a property and threatens its continued stability and preservation. The governing authority of any county or municipality, individually or jointly, is further authorized, in its discretion, to fine any property owner who has been found to own a property that has been determined to be threatened by demolition by neglect as defined herein. Such property owner, from the date such property is found to be in demolition by neglect by the governing authority until such repairs are made to remove the danger to the property, shall be in violation of the provisions of this section.
     </p>
     <p>
      In addition to the powers specified in Section 21-19-11(1), a governing authority, if the Historic Preservation Division of the Department of Archives and History concurs, may make repairs necessary to correct demolition by neglect, and the cost of such repairs shall become a lien against the property in accordance with Section 21-19-11(3).
     </p>
     <p>
      If a property in a historic district or a historic landmark or landmark site is demolished without review and approval by a local historic preservation commission, the governing authority may require that the owner rebuild on the site using as much of the original building material as possible, but in general following the same form. A governing authority may specify by ordinance that unauthorized demolition of a portion of a structure shall not serve as justification for a demolition permit whenever it can be shown that restoration or rehabilitation would still be feasible.
     </p>
     <p>
      Whenever a structure or structures is demolished without review and approval by a local historic preservation commission, the governing authority may require that no permit be issued for any structure or structures proposed for the same parcel which would require a footprint larger than the footprint of the demolished structure or structures.
     </p>
     <p>
      If a historic landmark or landmark site of statewide or national significance is demolished without review and approval by a local historic preservation commission, the governing authority may require that no permit for any construction on the parcel from which the landmark or landmark site has been removed may be issued for a period of up to twenty-four (24) months.

      The governing authorities of each municipality and county may stabilize the economy of the areas within the boundary of such municipality or county through the continued use, preservation and revitalization of key historic and architectural resources. It is recognized that the protection and enhancement of such attractions help to attract tourists and visitors, and that the further development of local heritage tourism programs supports and stimulates local business and industry. This chapter permits governing authorities to strengthen civic pride and ensure cultural stability through neighborhood conservation and historic preservation activities. This chapter establishes a review process for the preservation and appropriate redevelopment of the key historic and architectural resources of a governing authority and creates procedures which ensure adequate public notice before the creation of local historic preservation commissions or the designation of local historic districts, landmarks and landmark sites.

       Pursuant to Section 39-15-1, a City has authority to expend $100,000.00 to match funds of the Arts Council to restore and renovate a building for the purposes of the Arts Council, i.e., development, promotion and coordination of the arts. Mims, November 8, 1996, A.G. Op. #96-0750.

       The City of Brookhaven may make a contribution of $60,000.00 to the Brookhaven Trust to secure matching funds for the renovation and repair of the Mary Jane Lambton Auditorium, a Mississippi landmark, if the governing authorities of the city finds that the contribution would support the development, promotion, and coordination of the arts within the municipality pursuant to the statute.

      </p>
      <p>
       While a county or municipality may condition a donation upon the availability of matching funds by evidencing an intent to expend the funds, the funds may not actually be spent until the matching funds are actually available. The pertinent inquiry is not how much time is reasonable before matching funds are secured, but whether, when the public funds are expended, the matching funds are in fact “available.” Brooks,

      A museum may terminate a loan for unclaimed property in its possession as follows:
     </p>
     <p>
      The museum shall make a good faith and reasonable search for the identity and last known address of the lender from the museum records and other records reasonably available to museum staff. If the museum identifies the lender and the lender’s last known address, the museum shall give actual notice to the lender that the loan is terminated pursuant to subsection (b) of this section. If the identify or the last known address of the lender remains unknown after the search, the museum shall give notice by publication pursuant to subsection (c) of this section.
     </p>
     <p>
      Actual notice of termination of a loan of unclaimed property shall take substantially the following form. The museum shall send a letter by restricted certified mail to the lender at the lender’s last known address giving a notice of termination of the loan, which shall include the following information:
     </p>
     <p>
      Date of notice of termination;
     </p>
     <p>

     </p>
     <p>
      A statement that within ninety (90) days of the date of the notice of termination, the lender is required to remove the property from the museum or contact the designated official in the museum in writing to preserve the lender’s interests in the property and that failure to do so will result in the loss of all rights in the property pursuant to Section 39-19-11.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the museum is unable to identify sufficient information to send actual notice pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, or if a signed return receipt of a notice sent by restricted certified mail under subsection (b) of this section is not received by the museum within thirty (30) days after the notice is mailed, the museum shall publish the notice of termination of loan containing all the information available to the museum as provided in subsection (b)(i) through (v) of this section at least twice, sixty (60) or more days apart, in a publication of general circulation in the county in which the museum is located, and the county of the lender’s last known address, if known.

       “SECTION 1. The Legislature of the State of Mississippi finds and declares that:
      </p>
      <p>
       “(a) During the period from 1933 to 1945, six million (6,000,000) Jews and millions of other Europeans were murdered in Nazi concentration camps as part of a carefully orchestrated program of cultural, social and political genocide known as the Holocaust;
      </p>
      <p>
       “(b) All people should remember the horrible atrocities committed at that time and other times in human history as the result of bigotry and tyranny, and therefore should continually rededicate themselves to the principles of human rights and equal protection under the laws of a democratic society;
      </p>
      <p>
       “(c) It is desirable to educate our citizens about the events leading up to the Holocaust and about the organizations and facilities that were created and used purposefully for the systematic destruction of human beings;
      </p>
      <p>
       “(d) Holocaust history is the proper concern of all people, particularly students enrolled in the schools, colleges and universities of the State of Mississippi;
      </p>
      <p>
       “(e) Programs, workshops, institutes, seminars, exhibits, and other teacher-training activities for the study of the Holocaust have taken place during recent years at various middle schools, high schools, colleges and universities in this state; and
      </p>
      <p>
       “(f) It is desirable to create a permanent state commission, which as an organized body and on a continuous basis, will survey, design, encourage and promote implementation of Holocaust education and awareness programs in Mississippi, and will be responsible for organizing and promoting the memorialization of the Holocaust on a regular basis throughout the state.”

       “SECTION 3. It is the intent of the Legislature that both of the museums for which funding is provided under Section 2 of this act be open and operational to the public in the year 2017, the Bicentennial Year for the admission of Mississippi to statehood. It is understood that funding authorized under Section 2 of this act will not be sufficient to fully fund the planning, construction, furnishing and equipping of both museums. It is the further intention of the Legislature that a substantial portion of the cost of the acquisition, fabrication and installation of the exhibits for each museum shall be paid from funds derived from private, local and/or federal sources. Upon completion of the construction of the building structures of each museum, subsequent authorizations of funding from the Legislature for the museums will include specific requirements that a significant portion of the funds to be used for the acquisition, fabrication and installation of such exhibits be derived from such alternative sources.”
