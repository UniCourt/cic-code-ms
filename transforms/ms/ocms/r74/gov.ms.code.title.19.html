       § 19-2-11.
    State Auditor to determine whether counties have implemented countywide system of road administration, central purchasing system, inventory control system, and countywide personnel administration; notice to counties; certificate of noncompliance; penalties; appeals.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      It shall be the duty of the State Auditor to examine annually the books, records, accounts and other documents of each county and to perform such investigations as may be necessary to determine (a) if the county has actually adopted and put into operation the practice of constructing and maintaining all of the roads and bridges of the county as a unit, when and as required in Section 19-2-3, with all of the construction and maintenance machinery and other equipment, construction and maintenance funds and other construction and maintenance facilities available to the county for highway use placed under the administration of the county road manager for use in any part of the county regardless of beat lines and to the best interest of the county as a whole, (b) if the county has established and implemented, and is maintaining, a central purchasing system for all equipment, heavy equipment, machinery, supplies, commodities, materials and services as required by Section 31-7-101, (c) if the county has established and implemented, and is maintaining, the inventory control system required by Section 31-7-107, and (d) if the county has adopted and implemented a system of countywide personnel administration as required by Section 19-2-9. If upon his examination the Auditor determines that a county is not in substantial compliance with the requirements described in (a), (b), (c) and (d) above, he shall file a certified written notice with the clerk of the board of supervisors notifying the board of supervisors of his intention to issue a certificate of noncompliance to the State Tax Commission and to the Attorney General thirty (30) days immediately following the date of the filing of such notice unless within such period the county substantially complies with the requirements described in (a), (b), (c) and (d) above. If after thirty (30) days from the giving of the notice the county, in the opinion of the State Auditor, has not substantially complied with the requirements described in (a), (b), (c) and (d) above, the Auditor shall issue his certificate of noncompliance to the board of supervisors, State Tax Commission and the Attorney General. Thereafter, the State Tax Commission shall withhold all allocations and payments to the county that would otherwise be payable under Sections 27-65-75(4), 27-5-101(b)(vi) and 65-33-45, until such time as the Tax Commission and the Attorney General receive from the State Auditor written notice of cancellation of the certificate of noncompliance. However, all of such funds as are withheld from the county during the first ninety (90) days following issuance of a certificate of noncompliance under this subsection shall accrue to the account of that county and shall be subsequently allocated and paid to that county as otherwise provided by law if within such ninety-day period the board of supervisors, the State Tax Commission and the Attorney General receive written notice from the State Auditor of cancellation of the certificate of noncompliance. The State Auditor shall not unreasonably delay the issuance of a written notice of cancellation of a certificate of noncompliance but shall promptly issue a written notice of cancellation of certificate of noncompliance upon an affirmative showing by the county that it has come into substantial compliance. If the State Auditor has not issued a written notice of cancellation of the certificate of noncompliance within ninety (90) days after issuance of a certificate of noncompliance, all such funds as have been withheld and accrued to the county during such period, along with all monthly allocations which accrue but are withheld from the county following such ninety-day period for failure of the county to comply, shall be forfeited and reallocated among all other counties in the state that are eligible for such funds in accordance with the same formula for calculating original allocations among counties.
     </p>
     <p>
      There shall be no administrative appeal from any action of the State Auditor under this subsection in issuing or failing to issue any certificate of noncompliance or notice of cancellation of a certificate of noncompliance; however, if a civil action is filed for and on behalf of any county which is aggrieved by any action of the State Auditor under this section within ninety (90) days after issuance to the county of a certificate of noncompliance, any money as would otherwise be reallocated to other counties under this section shall be held in escrow pending final determination of the civil action.

       If upon audit, examination or investigation, the State Auditor determines that an individual member of a county board of supervisors is not in substantial compliance with the provisions of law that require the county to operate on a countywide system of road administration, as described in Section 19-2-3, then the State Auditor shall give, by United States Certified Mail, return receipt requested, written notification to the supervisor of such noncompliance. If within thirty (30) days after receipt of the notice, such supervisor, in the opinion of the State Auditor, remains in noncompliance, the Auditor may institute civil proceedings in the chancery court of the county in which the supervisor serves. The court, upon hearing, shall decide the issue and, if it determines that such supervisor is not in substantial compliance, shall order the supervisor to immediately and thereafter comply. Violations of any order of the court shall be punishable as for contempt. In addition, the court, in its discretion, may impose a civil penalty in an amount not to exceed Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000.00) upon the supervisor, for which he shall be liable in his individual capacity, for any such noncompliance that the court determines as intentional or willful.

       A member of the board of supervisors violates the statute if he or she instructs the county road manager or county administrator to hire, terminate, transfer, or demote a county employee under their jurisdiction. Brooks, July 28, 2000, A.G. Op. #2000-0339.

     <p>
      Each county shall be divided into five (5) districts, with due regard to equality of population and convenience of situation for the election of members of the boards of supervisors, but the districts as now existing shall continue until changed. The qualified electors of each district shall elect, at the next general election, and every four (4) years thereafter, in their districts one (1) member of the board of supervisors. Subject to the provisions of Section 23-15-285, the board, by a three-fifths (3/5) vote of all members elected, may change the districts, the boundaries to be entered at large in the minutes of the proceedings of the board. Provided, however, that such changed boundaries shall in as far as possible conform as to natural, visible artificial boundaries, such as streets, highways, railroads, rivers, lakes, bayous or other obvious lines of demarcation, except county lines and municipal corporate limits.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the boundaries of the districts are changed by order of the board of supervisors as provided in this section, the order shall be published in a newspaper having general circulation in the county once each week for three (3) consecutive weeks.

       Primary claim advanced by plaintiff in state court action, that voting malapportionment which allegedly violated one-person, one-vote standard guaranteed by Article 3, Section 14, was sufficient to stand as independent ground for challenging election procedure, and federal issue under Voting Rights Act could collaterally attach to such claim. Republican Party of Adams County v. Adams County Election Com., 775 F. Supp. 978, 1991 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15410 (S.D. Miss. 1991).

      <p>
       <p>
   Supervisors’ plan for the reapportionment of voting districts for the election of county officials by single-member districts in Hinds County, Mississippi is unconstitutional since it will have the effect of perpetuating the denial of blacks to the political process proven to have existed before the adoption of the plan where the plan fragmented a geographically concentrated minority voting community in a way that tended to dilute the voting strength of the minority. Kirksey v. Board of Supervisors, 554 F.2d 139, 1977 U.S. App. LEXIS 13164 (5th Cir. Miss.), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">434 U.S. 968</cite>, <cite class="s_court">98 S.

      </p>
      <p>
       While trial court properly determined that at-large election of county supervisors in which each candidate was required to be resident of one of five grossly malapportioned districts was violative of one man-one vote rule, it erred in postponing the granting of relief for the four year period of the term of office of supervisors who were to be elected some five months after date of its order; supervisors elected at regularly scheduled election shall hold office pending submission and approval of adequate redistricting plan and election of supervisors thereunder. Keller v. Gilliam, 454 F.2d 55, 1972 U.S. App. LEXIS 12059 (5th Cir. Miss. 1972).

   A Mississippi county governed for 100 years by a board of supervisors consisting of the supervisors of each of the county’s five constituent towns, leading to a local governmental structure in which overlapping public services are provided by the towns and the county working in close cooperation, but malapportioned because of population variations among the towns, is not unconstitutionally reapportioned by a districting plan following town lines, giving one county legislator to the county’s smallest town, and determining the number of legislators for each other town by the number of times its population exceeds the population of the smallest town, even though the result is an 11.9 percent deviation from voting equality. Abate v. Mundt, <cite class="us_code">403 U.S. 182</cite>, <cite class="s_court">91 S. Ct. 1904</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">29 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 399, 1971 U.S. LEXIS 1708 (U.S. 1971).

      <p>
       Where the citizens of a county in Mississippi commenced a class action to require the county board of supervisors to redistrict the county, and later moved to dismiss their class action on the basis that they then preferred that the court order the holding of elections on an at-large basis, the court acted within its discretion in denying the motion to dismiss and in enjoining the members of the board to divide the county into 5 districts with nearly equal population, since a federal chancellor possess the discretion to require the use of such a device in lieu of or as an alternative to forced proportional redistricting in order to achieve compliance with the one-man, one-vote constitutional command. Sheffield v. Itawamba County Bd. of Supervisors, 439 F.2d 35, 1971 U.S. App. LEXIS 11752 (5th Cir. Miss. 1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where existing malapportioned county supervisors districts had been declared invalid and the case had been remanded to the trial court for further proceedings expeditiously conducted, the trial court erred in failing to explore the possibility of conducting new elections without waiting for the expiration of the terms of the supervisors holding office. Taylor v. Monroe County Board of Supervisors, 421 F.2d 1038, 1970 U.S. App. LEXIS 11212 (5th Cir. Miss. 1970).
      </p>
      <p>
       The word “now,” as it appeared in the paragraph of Code 1942, § 2870 providing that the section should not be construed to affect any supervisor now holding office, meant the year of the passage of the act. Taylor v. Monroe County Board of Supervisors, 421 F.2d 1038, 1970 U.S. App. LEXIS 11212 (5th Cir. Miss. 1970).
      </p>
      <p>
       County board of supervisors’ order, pursuant to 1966 amendment to Code 1942, § 2870, directing the election of county supervisors by the county at large instead of by districts constituted a change in procedure, where in all previous elections supervisors had been elected on a district basis, and the board’s order was ineffective and unenforceable in absence of the approval secured from either the attorney general of the United States or the United States District Court for the District of Columbia as required by § 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 as amended. Moore v. Leflore County Board of Election Comm'rs, 351 F. Supp. 848, 1971 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11196 (N.D. Miss. 1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where county board of supervisors’ order, pursuant to 1966 amendment to Code 1942, § 2870, directing the election of county supervisors by the county at large instead of by districts constituted a change in procedure, it could not be successfully argued that the failure of the United States Attorney General to object to the at-large elections in 1967, when his office sent observers into Leflore County to observe the elections first hand and they made no objections to the change procedure, constituted acquiescence tantamount to an implied approval under § 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, as amended. Moore v. Leflore County Board of Election Comm'rs, 351 F. Supp. 848, 1971 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11196 (N.D. Miss. 1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       Since there had been no showing that anyone had previously requested the redistricting of the malapportioned supervisors districts, and there was no showing that black voters would be prejudiced by the at-large election, then, notwithstanding the fact that the change in election procedure whereby supervisors were elected by the county at large instead of by districts was ineffective because of the failure to secure the requisite approval pursuant to § 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, as amended, the court would authorize the at-large election subject to submission of a redistricting plan which would bring population disparities in districts to within constitutionally acceptable ratios. Moore v. Leflore County Board of Election Comm'rs, 351 F. Supp. 848, 1971 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11196 (N.D. Miss. 1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where federal court permitted the election of supervisors by the county at large instead of by districts notwithstanding that the change in election procedure had not been approved pursuant to § 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, as amended, but the permission to hold the election was subject to the submission of a redistricting plan which would bring the population disparities in the supervisors districts within constitutionally acceptable ratios, supervisors elected at the pending election would serve only for the period of time necessary for the arrangement of a new election and until their successors had been legally chosen and qualified. Moore v. Leflore County Board of Election Comm'rs, 351 F. Supp. 848, 1971 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11196 (N.D. Miss. 1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       Order of county board of supervisors directing election of supervisors by vote from county at large, rather than by district, under authority of 1966 amendment to this section [Code 1942, § 2870], constituted change in voting standard, practice, or procedure requiring approval under § 5 of Voting Rights Act (42 USCA § 1973c) and was without effect pending compliance with that act; scheduled at-large election from presently malapportioned districts may proceed as scheduled, but supervisors so elected shall serve only provisionally, and for period of time needed to formulate and submit to court plan for redistricting which will bring population disparities to within constitutionally acceptable ratios and to arrange for new, special election to choose their successors.

       A petition filed by electors against the board of supervisors of a county, requesting an election to decide the issue as to whether the boundary lines of the districts of the county supervisors should be changed “or whether the supervisors should run countywide” was fatally defective, as presenting an alternative action not authorized by the statute.

   Section 5 of the Federal Voting Rights Act of 1965 [42 USC § 1973c] which prevents the enforcement of “any voting qualification or prerequisite to voting, or standard, practice or procedure with respect to voting” different from that in force or effect on Nov. 1, 1964, unless the state or political subdivision complies with one of the section’s approval procedures, applied to the 1966 amendment to this section [Code 1942, § 2870], authorizing the board of supervisors of each county to adopt an order providing that all board members be elected at large by all qualified voters of the county.

   Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (42 USC § 1973c) is applicable to the 1966 amendment of this section [Code 1942, § 2870], and approval of that amendment cannot be implemented until the approval of the attorney general of the United States has been obtained. Allen v. State Bd. of Elections, <cite class="us_code">393 U.S. 544</cite>, <cite class="s_court">89 S. Ct. 817</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">22 L.

      </p>
      <p>
       In view of the fact that the attorney general of the United States, by letter dated May 21, 1969, advised the attorney general of Mississippi that an objection was interposed to the implementation of the 1966 and 1968 amendments to this section [Code 1942, § 2870], these amendments may not be implemented and are not presently in force. (Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, 42 USC § 1973c.) Dyer v. Love, 307 F. Supp. 974, 1969 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10958 (N.D. Miss. 1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       The board of supervisors of Washington County does not have statutory power or authority to provide for or order at-large elections of its members. Dyer v. Love, 307 F. Supp. 974, 1969 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10958 (N.D. Miss. 1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       The board of supervisors of Washington County should be required to change and/or alter the board of supervisors’ districts of the county in such manner as will provide equality of population among the districts as of the time the change or alteration is made. Dyer v. Love, 307 F. Supp. 974, 1969 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10958 (N.D. Miss. 1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       The responsibility for changing and altering supervisors’ districts rests upon the board, and the board should accept this responsibility and come forward with a plan which makes constitutional standards; should the board fail to come forward with such a plan the district court may consider alternative plans presented by others. Dyer v. Love, 307 F. Supp. 974, 1969 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10958 (N.D. Miss. 1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       The rule requiring equal apportionment must be held to apply to a governing body which has the broad powers, duties, and responsibilities of the Mississippi county board of supervisors, and when the right to an equal voice in selecting the members of that body is diluted and denied by gross misapportionment, the Fourteenth Amendment affords an avenue of relief. Dyer v. Rich, 259 F. Supp. 741, 1966 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9587 (N.D. Miss. 1966).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where one supervisor’s district of a county contained over 63 percent of the entire population of the county while the population of the other four districts ranged from approximately three percent to 10 percent of the county’s population, such gross imbalance in the population of the several supervisor’s districts constituted a case of invidious discrimination and was violative of the “one person, one vote” rule. Dyer v. Rich, 259 F. Supp. 741, 1966 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9587 (N.D. Miss. 1966).
      </p>
      <p>
       The “one person, one vote” rule applies to the apportionment by population of county supervisors’ districts, for the board of supervisors is a constitutional agency vested with vast authority and responsibility by the legislature and is the effective governing body of a county. Martinolich v. Dean, 256 F. Supp. 612, 1966 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9898 (S.D. Miss. 1966).
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that a board of supervisors fails to select the jury from districts proportionately does not authorize the quashing of the venire, nor the indictment. Ladner v. State, 197 So. 2d 257, 1967 Miss. LEXIS 1524 (Miss. 1967).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   This section [Code 1942, § 2870] affords an adequate remedy at law precluding the issuance of an injunction against holding an election of supervisors until the county shall be redistricted. Glass v. Hancock County Election Com., 250 Miss. 40, 156 So. 2d 825, 1963 Miss. LEXIS 534 (Miss. 1963), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">378 U.S. 558</cite>, <cite class="s_court">84 S.

   Candidate for county supervisor was a resident of another county, and thus ineligible for office under residency requirements of Miss. Const. Art. VI, § 176 and Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t19c03s19-3-3" target="_self">19-3-3</a></cite>, because there was no showing that he maintained a permanent residence in the county of his candidacy, notwithstanding that the candidate grew up in that county, claimed ownership of property there, regularly visited his mother there, had registered to vote and voted there, and had other contacts to that county. Young v. Stevens, 968 So. 2d 1260, 2007 Miss. LEXIS 347 (Miss. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       Low-income voters have standing to challenge constitutionality of provision that candidate for membership on county board of supervisors must be freeholder; adoption of freeholder requirement to assure quality of those elected as members of board of supervisors creates arbitrary classification based on economic factors and is unconstitutional as denial of equal protection. Williams v. Adams County Bd. of Election Comm'rs, 608 F. Supp. 599, 1985 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19835 (S.D. Miss. 1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       The trial court improperly denied relief in a suit to enjoin the use of certain county election districts on the ground that they perpetuated dilution of black voting strength where the unresponsiveness of officials to the needs of black citizens and the residual effects of past discrimination were evidenced by, inter alia, the poll tax, the literacy requirement, the property requirement for county officers, and the electoral mechanism of majority vote requirements. United States v. Board of Supervisors, 571 F.2d 951, 1978 U.S. App. LEXIS 11515 (5th Cir. Miss. 1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       Prima facie right of officer armed with election by people, certificate of his election, regular on its face, and commission therefor, after due qualification, is superior to rights of one claiming to hold over into new term on ground of disqualification of newly elected officer, even though it may finally be determined in a contest that the newly elected officer has not been elected, or is ineligible to hold office. Yates v. Summers, 177 Miss. 252, 170 So. 827, 1936 Miss. LEXIS 259 (Miss. 1936).
      </p>
      <p>
       Equity court held without jurisdiction to try by injunction right to office of county supervisor of either hold-over officer or of newly elected officer who had a certificate of election, regular on its face, and commission therefor, and who had duly qualified. Yates v. Summers, 177 Miss. 252, 170 So. 827, 1936 Miss. LEXIS 259 (Miss. 1936).
      </p>
      <p>
       Newly elected member of board of supervisors did not waive claim to office, as against incumbent holding over on ground that newly elected member was ineligible, by accepting appointment from governor after injunctive writ had been served. Yates v. Summers, 177 Miss. 252, 170 So. 827, 1936 Miss. LEXIS 259 (Miss. 1936).

       A member of the board of supervisors must be a resident freeholder of the district from which he is chosen, but while holding said office he may be out of the district part of the time if he continues to maintain a home therein.

      Each member of the board of supervisors, before entering upon the duties of his office, shall give bond, with sufficient surety, to be payable, conditioned and approved as provided by law, in a penalty equal to five percent (5%) of the sum of all the state and county taxes shown by the assessment rolls and the levies to have been collectible in the county for the year immediately preceding the commencement of the term of office of said member; however, such bond shall not exceed the amount of One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000.00). Furthermore, any taxpayer of the county may sue on such bond for the use of the county, and such taxpayer shall be liable for all costs in case his suit shall fail. No member of the board shall be surety for any other member.

       Authorization by board of supervisors of district of county was not required before bringing suit by district attorney on behalf of the county or district against a member of the board for loss resulting from his unauthorized action in permitting county’s construction equipment to be used for benefit of private individuals. Shumpert v. Lee County, 197 Miss. 513, 20 So. 2d 82, 1944 Miss. LEXIS 316 (Miss. 1944).
      </p>
      <p>
       Liability of members of county board of supervisors on official bonds is consequential, not direct, and such liability is to indemnify county against any loss proximately caused by illegal act. GULLY v. BEW, 170 Miss. 427, 154 So. 284, 154 So. 721, 1934 Miss. LEXIS 107 (Miss. 1934).
      </p>
      <p>
       Members of county board of supervisors lending county sinking funds on security of trust deeds in manner violating code sections held not liable for making the loans, since, in making appropriations, board members acted judicially. GULLY v. BEW, 170 Miss. 427, 154 So. 284, 154 So. 721, 1934 Miss. LEXIS 107 (Miss. 1934).
      </p>
      <p>
       Members of county boards of supervisors held not liable for failure to collect promptly illegal loans of county sinking funds made by prior board, there being no charge that subsequent boards knew loans were unauthorized or that foreclosure of trust deeds securing them would yield insufficient proceeds or that borrower was insolvent. GULLY v. BEW, 170 Miss. 427, 154 So. 284, 154 So. 721, 1934 Miss. LEXIS 107 (Miss. 1934).
      </p>
      <p>
       Statute respecting loan by county supervisors of sixteenth section township funds imposes its own liability for violating statute, and statute regarding supervisors’ bonds does not apply where supervisors do not comply with statutory directions. Gully v. McClellan, 170 Miss. 405, 153 So. 524, 1934 Miss. LEXIS 91 (Miss. 1934).
      </p>
      <p>
       That official bond of member of board of supervisors was payable to county, instead of to state, as required by statute, did not exempt surety from liability thereon, since bond inured to benefit of persons whom law designated it to secure, regardless of named obligee of bond. State use of Russell v. McRae, 169 Miss. 169, 152 So. 826, 1934 Miss. LEXIS 26 (Miss. 1934).
      </p>
      <p>
       District attorney suing for county could recover from members of board of supervisors on statutory bond given as security for illegal acts. Walton v. Colmer, 169 Miss. 182, 147 So. 331, 148 So. 635, 1933 Miss. LEXIS 3 (Miss. 1933).
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no liability on the bonds of members of the board of supervisors for allowances made to objects authorized by law, although in making such allowances they disregarded certain directions with reference thereto. Miller v. Tucker, 142 Miss. 146, 105 So. 774, 1925 Miss. LEXIS 35 (Miss. 1925).
      </p>
      <p>
       A supervisor is not liable for injuries caused by a defective bridge in his district, as he is not charged with the duty of actually repairing the highway. Lee v. Styles, 95 Miss. 623, 49 So. 259 (Miss. 1909).
      </p>
      <p>
       A bond given by a member of the board of supervisors and duly approved by the proper officers was valid and binding, although the officers made an incorrect calculation of the amount of the penalty. State ex rel. Mitchell v. Smith, 87 Miss. 551, 40 So. 22 (Miss. 1905).
      </p>
      <p>
       Court will take judicial knowledge that term of office of a member began on the first Monday of January of a certain year, and that all the taxes which were collectible for the year immediately preceding had not in fact at that date been collected. State ex rel. Mitchell v. Smith, 87 Miss. 551, 40 So. 22 (Miss. 1905).

      <p>
       Under the rule that where a special and particular statute deals with a special and particular subject, its particular terms as to that special subject control over general statutes dealing with the subject generally, the newly elected members of a county board of supervisors could not claim authority under Code 1942, §§ 2872, 2944, 2955, 4392, or 4394, to bring suit against the defeated members of the board and their sureties for allegedly illegally expended amounts, in view of the fact that Code 1942, § 9118-10 is specifically directed toward recovery of sums expended contrary to the mandate of the county budget law, and the state auditor is expressly authorized to sue for such recovery. Lincoln County v. Entrican, 230 So. 2d 801, 1970 Miss. LEXIS 1565 (Miss. 1970).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although a supervisor’s official bond specified a penalty in a sum less than that required by the provisions of Code 1942, § 2872, both the supervisor and his surety were actually bound to the full amount of the statutorily fixed penalty. State v. Moody, 198 So. 2d 586, 1967 Miss. LEXIS 1268 (Miss. 1967).
      </p>
      <p>
       The right of a taxpayer to bring suit on behalf of a county or the public is only such as is authorized by statute; the power extends only to suits for money paid to an object not authorized by law, and not for paying out money to an object authorized by law in violation of statutory directions. Mississippi Road Supply Co. v. Hester, 185 Miss. 839, 188 So. 281, 1939 Miss. LEXIS 158 (Miss. 1939), but see, Canton Farm Equipment, Inc. v. Richardson, 501 So. 2d 1098, 1987 Miss.

       When a member of the board is elected as president, such president is elected for a term of four years, and unless he resigns or his office is vacated in some way the board would not be authorized to elect another member president. Ops Atty Gen 1937-39, p 57.

       There is no provision for a roll call of the members of the board of supervisors. However, if a member wants his vote recorded for or against any proposition, he is at liberty and is entitled to do so. Ops Atty Gen 1939-41, p 76.

      <p>
       The president of the board of supervisors has the same right to vote as any other member of the board. He has no additional rights. He may vote when the other members vote, or if the other members tie he may vote, or he may vote to cause a tie. However, he has only one vote on any one question. When a quorum of the board is present and one or more members fail to vote, and the other members vote for the proposition, it should be declared carried. Ops Atty Gen 1939-41, p 76.

The board of supervisors shall meet on the first Monday of each month. However, when such meeting date falls on a legal holiday, then the said meeting shall be held on the succeeding day.

       Two regular monthly meetings may be held by board of supervisors in a county divided into two court districts, when legislative act dividing county into two court districts requires holding of alternate meetings, but does not require holding of alternate monthly meetings. Caruthers v. Panola County, 205 Miss. 403, 38 So. 2d 902, 1949 Miss. LEXIS 438 (Miss. 1949).
      </p>
      <p>
       It is not necessary that minutes of every regular meeting of board of supervisors in second district of county divided into two court districts affirmatively adjudicate fact to be that board has theretofore elected to hold and has given notice of its intention to hold two regular meetings in each month, and its acts, as reflected by its minutes, are not void by board’s failure to so adjudicate at each and every meeting. Caruthers v. Panola County, 205 Miss. 403, 38 So. 2d 902, 1949 Miss. LEXIS 438 (Miss. 1949).
      </p>
      <p>
       Presumption in absence of proof to contrary that public officers perform their duty in manner required by law applies to meetings of boards of supervisors and burden is upon person challenging legality thereof to show that meeting is illegal. Caruthers v. Panola County, 205 Miss. 403, 38 So. 2d 902, 1949 Miss. LEXIS 438 (Miss. 1949).
      </p>
      <p>
       Lack of authority in board of supervisors of county divided into two court districts to hold regular meetings in second district on second Monday in each month is not shown by failure of minutes of meeting of board to affirmatively show board had theretofore so elected, as burden of establishing invalidity of meeting is upon party asserting it to show board had not in fact so elected. Caruthers v. Panola County, 205 Miss. 403, 38 So. 2d 902, 1949 Miss. LEXIS 438 (Miss. 1949).
      </p>
      <p>
       Petitioner for writ of certiorari to review proceedings of board of supervisors of county divided into two court districts has right to show that board has never adopted order for holding of regular meetings in second district on second Monday of each month and on failure to make such showing he cannot contend orders of board of supervisors are void because they fail to show lawful authority for holding meetings at which orders were adopted.

     <p>
      At regular meetings for the transaction of business, the board of supervisors may sit for a period not longer than ten days in any one month. At meetings for the transaction of business under the revenue laws, the board may continue in session as long as business may require. However, in counties having a population of more than forty thousand, and in counties having two court districts, the board may continue in session at any other regular meeting than revenue meetings for a period not longer than twelve days in any one month. Furthermore, the board of supervisors may recess from time to time, subject to the limitation herein provided, to convene on a day fixed by an order of the board entered on its minutes, and may transact any business coming before it for consideration.

       The provision for the recessing of meetings applies with equal force to regular meetings as to meetings for the transaction of business under the revenue laws. In re Validation of $30,000 Road & Bridge Bonds, 242 Miss. 125, 133 So. 2d 267, 1961 Miss. LEXIS 538 (Miss. 1961).
      </p>
      <p>
       A board of supervisors must state in its minutes and order the business to be transacted at an adjourned meeting only if it is one to be held after final adjournment of the regular monthly meeting, irrespective of whether the full time allotted for the regular monthly meeting has expired. In re Validation of $30,000 Road & Bridge Bonds, 242 Miss. 125, 133 So. 2d 267, 1961 Miss. LEXIS 538 (Miss. 1961).
      </p>
      <p>
       That a board’s minutes state that a meeting was “adjourned”, rather than recessed, does not bring into operation the requirement that the business to be transacted must be stated, where it is apparent that there was a suspension rather than a termination of the meeting.

       This section [Code 1942, § 2877] and Code 1942, §§ 9786, 9789 and 9791, dealing with the assessments of property for purposes of taxation and revenue are in pari materia and must be construed together and, if possible, read into each other, so as to make a consistent whole.

       Manifest intention of Legislature in enacting Code 1942, § 2877, permitting board of supervisors to remain in session as long as business requires, Code 1942, § 9786, providing board shall complete equalization at least ten days before August meeting, Code 1942, § 9789, providing that board shall meet on first Monday of August to hear objections, and Code 1942, § 9791, providing that if board fails to perform any duty in reference to assessment roll at time required by law, duty shall be performed at later date, is to require completion of equalization of assessments at least ten days before sitting of board of supervisors to hear objections to assessments and to give taxpayer period of ten days in which to examine roll and determine whether his assessment is fair, equal and uniform, and determine whether he desires to file any objection thereto; and subject to these rights of taxpayer, it is intention of legislature that board should have full opportunity and full power to validly, equally and uniformly assess all property so as to constitute valid assessment to the end that revenue by taxation might be forthcoming to meet necessary expenses of government.

      <p>
       Where the board of supervisors continued in session in under this section in equalizing assessments until July 27, and gave notice that objections to assessments would be heard on August 6, such assessment was valid notwithstanding Code 1942, § 9786, providing that the board should complete equalization of taxes at least ten days before the August meeting, and Code 1942, § 9789, providing that board should hold a meeting on first Monday of August to hear objections to assessments, which fell on August 3rd, since the latter two sections had to be read in connection with Code 1942, § 9796, which provides that if the board fails to perform its duty in reference to assessment poll on time, the duty should be performed later.

      <p>
       Under Code 1942, §§ 9786, 9789, 9791, and this section [Code 1942, § 2877], when it is necessary for board of supervisors to continue in session in equalizing assessments until July 27th because business requires it, board is authorized to hear objections to assessments on August 6th, although first Monday of August is on 3rd, when proper notice is given by board at its July meeting of hearing of objections on August 6th.

       The board of supervisors can meet for transaction of business under the revenue law and recess from day to day without signing minutes for any day’s meeting, and, provided minutes are signed on last day, terms of both Code 1942, §§ 2877 and §§ 2886 are literally complied with.

       Failure of president of board of supervisors, meeting to transact business under revenue law, to sign minutes of board for July 13, recessing to convene on July 15, does not invalidate order of board, entered on July 15, approving real property assessment roll, minutes for July 15 being duly signed, and it is only unsigned minutes of July 13 which are invalidated.

       Where a county, which had become the purchaser of land upon foreclosure of a deed of trust held by it, and had received a deed thereto from a subsequent trustee, but had obtained no title because the substitution of the trustee was not made a matter of record as required by statute, sold the land under an order of the board of supervisors, which was void in that the order had been made at a special meeting, the call for which failed to make provision, either expressly or impliedly, for taking up the matter of the sale and conveyance of the land, a later valid foreclosure of the trust deed and the purchase by the county did not inure to the benefit of the would-be purchaser under the void sale by the board, so as to render her title good, since such would-be purchaser had been affected with notice of the illegality of the first foreclosure and the conveyance following it made to her, and persons dealing with members of the board of supervisors, who are trustees for the public and bound by the limitations fixed by law on their powers, must take notice of their powers and cannot acquire rights where they are acting beyond their authority.

       A board of supervisors must state in its minutes and order the business to be transacted at an adjourned meeting only if it is one to be held after final adjournment of the regular monthly meeting, irrespective of whether the full time allotted for the regular monthly meeting has expired.

       Where the order for a three-day adjournment of a board of supervisors’ meeting specified no particular business that would be taken up and considered at the adjourned meeting, action taken at the adjourned meeting regarding equalization of tax assessments was void.

      <p>
       Boards of supervisors can bind counties, or districts therein, only when acting within their authority and in the mode and manner by which this authority is to be exercised under the statutes, and their contracts and every other substantial action taken by them must be evidenced by entries on their minutes, and can be evidenced in no other way.

       Minutes of county board of supervisors are the exclusive evidence of what the board has done. Martin v. Newell, 198 Miss. 809, 23 So. 2d 796, 1945 Miss. LEXIS 251 (Miss. 1945); Smith v. Board of Sup'rs, 124 Miss. 36, 86 So. 707, 1920 Miss. LEXIS 492 (Miss. 1920).

       The statutory requirement for the president of the board to sign the minutes before the final adjournment of the term is mandatory, where the board is equalizing assessment rolls, which can only be initiated at the July meeting, and such tax matters required by law to be transacted only at the July meeting cannot be ratified by signing or approving the July minutes at the August meeting.

       The board of supervisors can meet for transaction of business under the revenue law and recess from day to day without signing minutes for any day’s meeting, and, provided minutes are signed on last day, terms of both Code 1942, §§ 2877 and 2886 are literally complied with.

       Failure of president of board of supervisors, meeting to transact business under revenue law, to sign minutes of board for July 13, recessing to convene on July 15, does not invalidate order of board, entered on July 15, approving real property assessment roll, minutes for July 15 being duly signed, and it is only unsigned minutes of July 13 which are invalidated.

       Entry on the minutes of county board of supervisors at its August meeting, that “all minutes of the regular and continued July, 1930 meetings were read and approved,” constituted sufficient proof that the president of the board did not sign the minutes of the July meeting before the final adjournment of that meeting as required by this section [Code 1942, § 2886], in view of the practice of the board to have the minutes of a meeting read and approved at the succeeding meeting.

       Where equalization of taxes could only be initiated at July meeting of county board of supervisors after examination and notice to the taxpayers ordered at that meeting to appear at the August meeting to present objections, failure of the president of the board to sign the minutes of the July meeting before final adjournment as required by this section [Code 1942, § 2886] invalidated the act of the board at the July meeting relating to tax assessments, and consequently tax sale and patent predicated thereon were void, notwithstanding that the minutes of the July meeting were approved and signed at the August meeting, since such tax matters required by law to be transacted only at the July meeting could not be ratified by signing the July minutes at the August meeting.

Sumners, Nov. 10, 2000, A.G. Op. #2000-0648.
      </p>

      <p>
       There is no authority for a board of supervisors to donate office space for use by a congressman or other non-county governmental agency based on a board finding that the donation will go to an entity that will directly benefit the county or the community. Griffin, Aug. 30, 2002, A.G. Op. #02-0470.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because fire protection is a governmental function or “county affair” and is also a “matter of county police” subject to regulation under Section 19-3-41 it is suggested that a county may enter an order acknowledging established service areas and the recognized volunteer organizations which provide fire protection within those areas; further, the county may regulate who and when persons can attach to a public water system, and may establish rules regarding which file protection providers have superior control over a fire scene. Morrow, Nov. 8, 2002, A.G. Op. #02-0570.

      <p>
       For a county board of supervisors too enter into a partnership agreement with a private, nonprofit corporation in a program to enter into a partnership agreement for the purpose of applying for a Child Care and Development Block Grant, the board must first make two factual determinations: (1) that the grant is authorized by federal law, rule, or regulation; and, (2) that the program permits provision of services by contracting with a private, nonprofit corporation. Entrekin, Jan. 23, 2004, A.G. Op. 03-0436.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no statutory authority for a district attorney to charge a collection fee for the collection of delinquent criminal fines.

      <p>
       Boards of supervisors have no implied powers and all of their acts must be authorized by law and they can exercise only such powers as are expressly conferred by statute, or which are necessarily implied.
   State ex rel. Patterson v. Board of Supervisors, 233 Miss. 240, 102 So. 2d 198, 1958 Miss. LEXIS 378 (Miss. 1958).
      </p>
      <p>
       Since publication of notice of an election to determine whether a power district should be established is a fundamental requirement of the statute, such jurisdictional fact must be specifically adjudicated in the minutes of the board of supervisors, and cannot be supplied by inference or other information outside the minutes of the board. Mississippi Power & Light Co. v. Mississippi Power Dist., 230 Miss. 594, 93 So. 2d 446, 1957 Miss. LEXIS 402 (Miss. 1957).
      </p>
      <p>
       An order of the board of supervisors purporting to create an electric power district, which failed to affirmatively adjudicate that any notice of the election was published, and, if so, how, where and when it was published, was void. Mississippi Power & Light Co. v. Mississippi Power Dist., 230 Miss. 594, 93 So. 2d 446, 1957 Miss. LEXIS 402 (Miss. 1957).
      </p>
      <p>
       Boards of supervisors can bind counties, or districts therein, only when acting within their authority and in the mode and manner by which this authority is to be exercised under the statutes, and their contracts and every other substantial action taken by them must be evidenced by entries on their minutes, and can be evidenced in no other way. Board of Sup'rs v. Dawson, 208 Miss. 666, 45 So. 2d 253, 1950 Miss. LEXIS 283 (Miss. 1950).
      </p>
      <p>
       Persons dealing with board of supervisors must take notice of its powers, and cannot acquire rights beyond authorized powers. De Soto County v. Stranahan, Harris & Oatis, 159 Miss. 23, 131 So. 640, 1931 Miss. LEXIS 12 (Miss. 1931).
      </p>
      <p>
       The board of supervisors must conform to the statutory method in performing their constitutional duties. Board of Sup'rs v. Snellgrove, 103 Miss. 898, 60 So. 1023, 1912 Miss. LEXIS 245 (Miss. 1912).
      </p>
      <p>
       And such authority and powers must be exercised within the limits of the county from which the members of the board are elected. Board of Sup'rs v. Snellgrove, 103 Miss. 898, 60 So. 1023, 1912 Miss. LEXIS 245 (Miss. 1912).
      </p>
      <p>
       The powers and authority of the board of supervisors is limited strictly to those conferred by statute. Adams v. First Nat'l Bank, 103 Miss. 744, 60 So. 770, 1912 Miss. LEXIS 225 (Miss. 1912).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defects in the proceedings and judgments of a board of supervisors not jurisdictional in their nature are unavailing in a collateral proceeding to defeat the action of the board. Hinton v. Board of Sup'rs, 84 Miss. 536, 36 So. 565 (Miss. 1904).

       The School bus turnaround statute authorizes a political entity to use taxpayer money to grade, gravel, repair or maintain private property for a public purpose. Section 19-3-42 expressly provides that the school board must make a written request to the board of supervisors for such work. There is no statutory authority for the school board to delegate this responsibility to an individual employee. Houston, March 1, 1996, A.G. Op. #96-0061.

       The board of supervisors of any county may establish policies that set forth the timing for receiving requests from the school board for work on bus turnarounds; the establishment and adoption of these policies must appear in the minutes of the meeting; alternatively, a county board of supervisors may simply continue to handle such requests as they come before the board on an as-needed basis.

      <p>
       The demolition of a structure and the hauling off of debris from such a structure does not meet the meaning of maintaining public school grounds or maintaining school driveways found in the statute; demolition and hauling off demolition debris go hand in hand, and such actions are in the nature of work upon buildings, not grounds.

       A county board of supervisors lacks statutory authority to make appropriate repairs and/or to maintain private gravel or shell roads or driveways to private residences for private school bus turnarounds; however, a lawfully established and maintained public school bus turnaround could also be utilized by a private school bus upon consent of the private landowner.

   A county board of supervisors has a duty under §§<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t19c03s19-3-41" target="_self">19-3-41</a></cite> and 43 to provide adequate court facilities for each county. Encompassed therein is the duty to provide a courtroom free of such noise as substantially interrupts court proceedings. If the legislative branch fails to furnish the absolute essentials required for the operation of an independent and effective court, then no court affected thereby should fail to act. County boards of supervisors are subject to appropriate court orders requiring them to furnish adequate courtroom facilities when they adamantly fail or refuse to do so. Hosford v. State, 525 So. 2d 789, 1988 Miss. LEXIS 217 (Miss. 1988).

       Where old courthouse burned and sheriff and board of supervisors designated another building as temporary courthouse, tax sale could be validly held only at the door of the temporary courthouse, and tax sale held in front of concrete steps at ruins of old courthouse, which was not visible from the temporary courthouse, was void.

      <li id="t19c03s19-3-44ol11">
       The board of supervisors of any county in which there are two (2) judicial districts may provide alternate facilities for the courts of one judicial district when the courthouse of such district is in a condition of disrepair due to damage or construction. Such alternate facilities may be located in the other judicial district of the county and may be located in the courthouse of such other judicial district, but nothing contained herein shall be construed to require such facilities to be located in said courthouse if, in the discretion of the board of supervisors, some other location is preferred.

       A contract which attempts to “irrevocably” employ private persons “to make the necessary investigations to ascertain the correct amount of the taxes and moneys which may be due and owing to the county of Issaquena and various taxing districts by the State of Mississippi and to collect said moneys,” etc., and to pay a sum equal to twenty per cent of all amounts found to be due and collected, held absolutely null and void. Ops Atty Gen, 1933-35, p 44.
      </p>
      <p>
       The board of supervisors is not authorized to employ counsel for the purposes mentioned in said contract. Ops Atty Gen, 1933-35, p 44.
      </p>
      <p>
       The board of supervisors is not authorized to employ an auditor to make the investigations mentioned in said contract. Ops Atty Gen, 1933-35, p 44.
      </p>
      <p>
       Each member of the board of supervisors who votes to allow the claim on account thereof would be liable on his official bond for the amount so paid. Ops Atty Gen, 1933-35, p 44.
      </p>
      <p>
       The board of supervisors may pay out not exceeding one per cent of the amount of the bonds issued to the attorney representing the board in the issuance and sale of said bonds. The amount paid the bond attorney for passing on the validity of such bonds would not be included in the amount. Ops Atty Gen, 1937-39, p 87.
      </p>
      <p>
       This section applies to interest bearing notes issued by the county as well as to bonds. It applies to all notes and bonds issued by the board of supervisors of the county; that is, where the board of supervisors issues bonds for a school district, road district, or other taxing district, they could employ an attorney to perform the duties required. In such cases the fee should be paid out of the proceeds of the bond issue rather than the general county fund, or other funds. Ops Atty Gen, 1937-39, p 119.
      </p>
      <p>
       The board of supervisors would not be authorized to employ additional advisory counsel if the amount paid such extra counsel plus the amount paid the regularly retained attorney exceed $600.00. Ops Atty Gen, 1939-41, p 118.
      </p>

      <p>
       Miss. Code Section 19-3-47(1)(c) provides express authority for county boards of supervisors to employ and, subject to limitations enumerated in statute, to compensate one or more attorneys in matter of issuance of bonds and drafting of orders and resolutions in connection therewith; attorney so employed who in fact provides such services may be attorney who is also separately employed as board’s regular attorney; and, maximum compensation limitations imposed by Miss. Code Section 19-3-47(1)(c) do not apply to payment of professional fees to bond counsel of national repute whose opinion is required by bond buyers or who is retained to promote marketability of bond issue; nor does it apply to professional fees of state bond attorneys. Walters, Jan. 14, 1993, A.G. Op. #982-0984.
      </p>
      <p>
       Additional compensation paid to the board attorney should be paid from the county general fund. However, if such additional service performed by the attorney involves a road fund, then payment for those services should come from the road fund involved. Hemphill, February 23, 1995, A.G. Op. #95-0068.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 19-3-47 requires the board to document on the minutes the necessity and duties of special counsel prior to the making of an appointment.

      <p>
       While a county is authorized pursuant to Section 19-3-47(1)(b) to employ counsel where it is determined that the matter is one in which the county is interested, there is no authority for a county to donate funds to pay private legal fees. Rather, the county can expend money for legal fees for representation of the county itself when, for instance, it is a party in a legal proceeding. Walters, November 8, 1996, A.G. Op. #96-0738.
      </p>
      <p>
       Provided the employment was made prior to services being rendered, a board of supervisors could employ counsel and pay the lawful fees and expenses incurred in a particular case. Southerland, May 17, 2002, A.G. Op. #02-0270.
      </p>
      <p>
       A county board of supervisors may not pay the board attorney on an hourly basis for all his services. In the event the board finds that there are special cases or circumstances which are not within the scope of the duties of the regular board attorney and that additional legal services are reasonable and necessary for conducting the county’s business, it has discretion to hire either the board attorney or another attorney on an hourly fee contract to attend to those additional legal needs. Flanders, May 7, 2004, A.G. Op. 04-0186.

      </p>
      <p>
       County boards of supervisors are authorized by Section 19-3-47(1)(b) to employ counsel in all civil cases in which the county is interested, which includes employing counsel to represent a county official who has been sued individually. Coleman, Oct. 20, 2006, A.G. Op. 06-0520.

       Members of a county board of supervisors are empowered to employ counsel and defend themselves when sued in causes arising out of their official position where they have a colorable defense and present the defense in good faith; however, where there is no reasonable basis for a defense and/or where the board members proceed in bad faith, they act ultra vires and have no power to expend public funds for defense, and, in such cases, the court should order that any such defense be at their own expense and that any public funds expended be reimbursed.

     <p>
      When a fine shall be imposed upon any person by the board of supervisors, by virtue of any provision of law, the board shall cause the person to be summoned to appear at a succeeding meeting to show cause why the judgment for such fine shall not be made final. If sufficient cause be not shown at the return-day of the summons, the judgment shall be made final, with costs, and the clerk shall issue a capias pro finem therefor, as for fines in the circuit court, which shall be made returnable at the next regular meeting of the board. If good cause be shown, the board may set aside the fine, upon payment of costs. The clerk and sheriff shall be entitled to like fees, for services, as upon similar proceedings in the circuit court.

      Unless otherwise specifically required by law, the board of supervisors of any county shall upon the filing of a petition touching any matter affecting the entire county and over which it has jurisdiction, signed by twenty-five per cent. of the qualified electors of the county, either pass an order putting said proposition in force and effect or immediately submit the same to a vote of the qualified electors of the county, after giving thirty days’ notice of said election, said notice to contain a statement of the proposition to be voted on at said election. If said election shall result in favor of the proposition petitioned for, the board of supervisors, shall pass the necessary order, to put the said proposition in force and effect. In the event the election shall result against the proposition submitted, no other election shall be held on the same, or substantially the same proposition within twelve months of the date of the prior election. This section shall not, however, apply to the creation of taxing districts.

      <p>
       The practice of boards of supervisors to seek certification from their respective county circuit clerks as to the number of signatures of qualified electors appearing on such petitions prior to the adjudication of the sufficiency of those petitions is, in most if not all cases, necessary to protect the integrity of the process since circuit clerks are the custodians of the registration records.

       A county board of supervisors had proper jurisdiction to call an election under the statute where no solid waste plan had been approved and no contract had been finalized and the board’s minutes contained an opinion of the Attorney General that the board did in fact have jurisdiction to call an election. Miss. Waste of Hancock County, Inc. v. Bd. of Supervisors, 818 So. 2d 326, 2001 Miss. LEXIS 43 (Miss. 2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       A county board of supervisors acted properly under the statute when it suspended contract negotiations with the appellant regarding a privately owned waste facility and called for a special election. Miss. Waste of Hancock County, Inc. v. Bd. of Supervisors, 818 So. 2d 326, 2001 Miss. LEXIS 43 (Miss. 2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 19-3-55 does not require a matter to be spread on the board of supervisors’ minutes in order for the board to act on a petition. Leigh v. Board of Supervisors, 525 So. 2d 1326, 1988 Miss. LEXIS 265 (Miss. 1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       Under the provisions of Code 1942, § 3018 the board of supervisors has authority to pass the necessary order to place the question of a beer referendum on the record on the ballot and, conversely, the board has authority to reject an election resulting from fraud or mistake. Thornton v. Wayne County Election Com., 272 So. 2d 298, 1973 Miss. LEXIS 1528 (Miss. 1973).
      </p>
      <p>
       A board of supervisors may not call an election at county expense to determine by an unofficial vote the will of the electorate “just for their information”. Gill v. Woods, 226 So. 2d 912, 1969 Miss. LEXIS 1334 (Miss. 1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a board of supervisors entered no order determining the necessary jurisdictional prerequisites required by law, an order calling an election was void and all steps taken thereafter were void. Gill v. Woods, 226 So. 2d 912, 1969 Miss. LEXIS 1334 (Miss. 1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       A board of supervisors has no authority to act on a petition for an election until it has determined by an order spread on its minutes that it has jurisdiction of the matter, that the petition complied with the statute, and that the requisite number of electors had signed the petition; and in so doing the board acts judicially. Gill v. Woods, 226 So. 2d 912, 1969 Miss. LEXIS 1334 (Miss. 1969).

Hoyle v. State, 216 Miss. 330, 62 So. 2d 380, 1953 Miss. LEXIS 641 (Miss. 1953), but see Dantzler v. State, 542 So. 2d 906, 1989 Miss. LEXIS 197 (Miss. 1989).

       In the absence of the 30-day notice required by this section [Code 1942, § 3018], an election ordered by a board of supervisors was void. Gill v. Woods, 226 So. 2d 912, 1969 Miss. LEXIS 1334 (Miss. 1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       Notice of local option election on question of outlawing wine and beer, given for thirty days in newspaper published and circulated in county, is correct and proper notice of election, as notice required to be given of such election is governed by this section (Code 1942, § 3018) and not by § 3294, Code of 1942. Duggan v. Board of Sup'rs, 207 Miss. 854, 43 So. 2d 566, 1949 Miss. LEXIS 396 (Miss. 1949).
      </p>
      <p>
       The contemplated method of giving notice is by publication in a newspaper. Henry v. Board of Sup'rs, 203 Miss. 780, 34 So. 2d 232, 1948 Miss. LEXIS 321 (Miss. 1948).
      </p>
      <p>
       Final order of board of supervisors from which appeal will lie in the exclusion of light wines and beer in the county, is the order showing affirmatively an adjudication as to the sufficiency of the notice of the election and publication according to law, that the notice contained a statement of the proposition to be voted on at the election and that the report of the election commissioners disclosed that a majority of those voting in the election had voted in favor of exclusion. Costas v. Board of Sup'rs, 196 Miss. 104, 15 So. 2d 365, 1943 Miss. LEXIS 6 (Miss. 1943).
      </p>
      <p>
       Objection that notice for election hereunder, for the exercise of local option in the county, was signed by the president and clerk of the board of supervisors instead of by the election commissioners of the county, was without merit where the notice given was sufficient in form and substance, and pursuant thereto the election commissioners proceeded to hold the election and certify the result thereof as required by law. Sides v. Board of Sup'rs, 190 Miss. 420, 200 So. 595, 1941 Miss. LEXIS 64 (Miss. 1941).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the board of county supervisors directed the election commissioners to give the notice required in respect to an election for local option and also directed the clerk to give the required notice but he failed to do so, and the notice by the commissioner specifically referred to the order of the board as the authority by which it was given, the notice was sufficient as against the contention that the notice must be given by the board of supervisors; it was not necessary that two notices should be given or that the notice should appear in more than one public newspaper of the county. Barron v. Board of Sup'rs, 184 Miss. 376, 185 So. 806, 1939 Miss. LEXIS 43 (Miss. 1939).
      </p>
      <p>
       A special election for local option in a county was found to be in all respects legal, where the order of the board of supervisors in passing upon the sufficiency of the petition for a special election recited that it was signed by more than 20 per cent of the qualified voters of the county, and the board’s order after the election recited that due and proper notice was given as required by statute and proper proof of publication had been made and filed. Day v. Board of Sup'rs, 184 Miss. 611, 185 So. 251, 1939 Miss. LEXIS 16 (Miss. 1939).
      </p>
      <p>
       The manner of publication of notice for local option election is controlled by general statute requiring 30 days’ notice of election on any matter affecting the entire county. Martin v. Board of Supervisors, 181 Miss. 363, 178 So. 315, 1938 Miss. LEXIS 80 (Miss. 1938).
      </p>
      <p>
       Six weeks’ publication of notice of local option election, effected by order of clerk of board of supervisors rather than of election commissioners, without board’s issuing commission to election commissioners directing the commissioners to hold election, was proper irrespective of applicability of general statute authorizing board of supervisors to call election, where election commissioners actually held the election in conformity with law. Martin v. Board of Supervisors, 181 Miss. 363, 178 So. 315, 1938 Miss. LEXIS 80 (Miss. 1938).

Coleman v. Thompson, 216 Miss. 867, 63 So. 2d 533, 1953 Miss. LEXIS 708 (Miss. 1953).

       An order by the board of supervisors adjudicating the sufficiency of the petition and ordering an election, after a secret session from which interested parties and their attorneys were excluded, and a final judgment of the board excluding wine and beer from a county, pursuant to such election, are without authority of law and a denial of due process. Miles v. Board of Sup'rs, 33 So. 2d 810 (Miss. 1948).
      </p>
      <p>
       In determining the sufficiency of a petition to exclude wine and beer from a county as regards the necessary number of signatures of qualified voters, the registration books are not conclusive evidence that the persons registered are qualified electors. Miles v. Board of Sup'rs, 33 So. 2d 810 (Miss. 1948).
      </p>
      <p>
       Adjudication of county board of supervisors as to sufficiency of signatures to petition for an election to determine whether traffic in light wines and beers should be excluded from the county, was interlocutory, and entire cause, including that issue, must on pertinent and competent protest be adjudicated by the board upon trial before the final judgment could be entered in the case. Costas v. Board of Sup'rs, 198 Miss. 440, 22 So. 2d 229, 1945 Miss. LEXIS 213 (Miss. 1945).
      </p>
      <p>
       Fact that some citizens not in privity with present protestants had appeared before county board of supervisors and contested sufficiency of petition for an election to determine whether traffic in light wines and beer should be excluded from county, on ground that petition did not contain the required 20 per cent of the qualified electors when the board adjudicated the petition to be sufficient, did not estop other taxpayers from subsequently contesting the petition on the same grounds, where the present protestants had no notice of the hearing on the original petition and did not participate therein, since the hearing on the original petition did not close the question as to the sufficiency of the petition. Costas v. Board of Sup'rs, 198 Miss. 440, 22 So. 2d 229, 1945 Miss. LEXIS 213 (Miss. 1945).
      </p>
      <p>
       With respect to the requirement that upon filing of petition the board shall “immediately submit the same to a vote,” the board may delay its decision in order to afford an opportunity to itself and others to examine and verify the petitions and to check their sufficiency. Costas v. Board of Sup'rs, 196 Miss. 104, 15 So. 2d 365, 1943 Miss. LEXIS 6 (Miss. 1943).

       The action of a county board of supervisors in terminating federal funds to the sheriff’s department because of racial discrimination and other misconduct was within the discretion afforded the board by this section. Smith v. Cooper, 454 F. Supp. 548, 1978 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18107 (N.D. Miss. 1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       Wherever county is authorized to build bridge and statute does not provide for specific tax or fund for payment, board of supervisors may levy tax on property of county to pay for bridge and may appropriate money for that purpose. Panola County v. Sardis, 171 Miss. 490, 157 So. 579, 1934 Miss. LEXIS 248 (Miss. 1934).
      </p>
      <p>
       A judgment plaintiff may by mandamus compel the county to pay the judgment out of the general funds if there be sufficient money therein and may compel the board to make a levy sufficient to pay same where there are no funds available. Town of Crenshaw v. Jackson, 122 Miss. 711, 84 So. 912, 1920 Miss. LEXIS 471 (Miss. 1920).
      </p>
      <p>
       The members of the board incur liability by voting money to an object not authorized by law, but not by an irregularity in voting it to an authorized object. Paxton v. Baum, 59 Miss. 531, 1882 Miss. LEXIS 152 (Miss. 1882).
      </p>
      <p>
       An order of the board appropriating money to any object not authorized by law affords no protection to the person receiving the money. Howe v. State, 53 Miss. 57, 1876 Miss. LEXIS 36 (Miss. 1876), but see Harrison County v. Gulfport, 557 So. 2d 780, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 44 (Miss. 1990).

      The board of supervisors of any county shall have the power to adopt reasonable ordinances for the regulation of transient vendors not inconsistent with the provisions of Sections 75-85-1 through 75-85-19. However, such board of supervisors shall not have the power to declare residential solicitations by transient vendors who are citizens of the State of Mississippi, or who are agents of corporations domiciled in the State of Mississippi, or who are agents of foreign corporations qualified to do business in the State of Mississippi, to be a public nuisance or a misdemeanor, unless such transient vendors are not in compliance with Sections 75-85-1 through 75-85-19 or local regulations. Before transacting any business all transient vendors shall furnish to the county wherein such business is to be transacted, a good and sufficient penal bond in an amount not to exceed Two Thousand Dollars ($2,000.00) conditioned that if such transient vendor shall comply with all of the provisions of the county ordinances relating to transient vendors such obligation shall be void, otherwise, to remain in full force and effect. Any ordinance adopted by the board of supervisors of any county under the provisions of this section shall be applicable throughout the entire county, including any areas within any municipalities in such county, unless there is in effect or is subsequently adopted by the municipality its own ordinance under the provisions of Section 29-19-35, in which case the municipal ordinance shall control as to the area within such municipality.

       § 19-3-85.
    Authority of board to dispose of lost, stolen, abandoned or misplaced personal property.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The board of supervisors of any county, upon the receipt or recovery of any lost, stolen, abandoned or misplaced personal property by the sheriff or other law enforcement officers of the county, shall cause to be posted, in three (3) public places in the county, notice that such property has been received or recovered. Such notice shall contain an accurate and detailed description of such property and, if the board of supervisors is advised as to who owns the property, a copy of the notice shall be mailed to such person or persons in addition to being posted as required in this section. The owner may recover the property by filing a claim with the board of supervisors and establishing his right to the property. The board may require bond of the person claiming the property before delivering it to him. Parties having adverse claims to the property may proceed according to law.
     </p>
     <p>
      If no person claims the property within one hundred twenty (120) days from the date the notice is given, the board of supervisors shall cause the property to be sold at public auction to the highest bidder for cash after first posting notice of the sale in three (3) public places in the county at least ten (10) days before the date of the sale. The notice shall contain a detailed and accurate description of the property to be sold and shall be addressed to the unknown owners or other persons interested in the property to be sold. The notice shall also set forth the date, time and place the sale is to be conducted and shall designate the sheriff to make the sale.
     </p>
     <p>
      However, lost, stolen, abandoned or misplaced motor vehicles and bicycles may be sold in the manner provided in the preceding paragraph after the expiration of ninety (90) days from their receipt or recovery by law enforcement officers of the county.
     </p>
     <p>
      The sheriff, promptly upon completion of the sale, shall deliver to the chancery clerk a copy of the notice authorizing the sale, a list of the property sold, the amount paid for each item, the person to whom each item was sold, and all monies received from such sale. The clerk then shall deposit the monies into the county treasury and the proceeds of the sale shall be first applied to the necessary costs and expenses of the sale, with the remainder to be credited to the special supplemental budget of the sheriff to be expended by the sheriff for any law enforcement purpose upon approval of the board of supervisors. The chancery clerk shall file the information concerning the sale among the other records of his office. If, within ninety (90) days after the date of the sale, any person claims to be the owner of the property sold, the board, upon satisfactory proof of ownership, shall pay to such person the amount for which the property was sold, and the board may require of such person a bond in such cases as the board deems advisable. No action shall be maintained against the county or any of its officers or employees or the purchaser at the sale for any property sold or the proceeds therefrom after the expiration of ninety (90) days from the date of the sales as authorized in this section.

       § 19-3-106.
    Authority of district to issue revenue bonds.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The board of commissioners of any cooperative service district may, pursuant to a favorable majority vote of the board of supervisors of each participating county, and for good cause shown therefor, authorize the cooperative service district to issue its revenue bonds payable from and secured by a pledge of all or any part of revenues under any contract or contracts it enters into under Sections 19-3-101 through 19-3-115, Mississippi Code of 1972, and/or from the avails of any tax imposed or appropriation made to support the district. The bonds shall not be or constitute an indebtedness of any participating county or municipality within the meaning of any constitutional, statutory or charter limitation of indebtedness but shall be payable solely from the revenues derived by the cooperative service district under any contract or contracts it enters into under Section 19-3-101 through 19-3-115, Mississippi Code of 1972, and/or from the avails of any tax imposed or appropriation made to support the district. Neither the full faith and credit nor taxing power of any participating county, municipality, or of the state or any political subdivision thereof, is pledged to the payment of the principal of, the interest on, or premium, if any, of the bonds. Such bonds shall be in such form and denomination as prescribed by the board of commissioners of the district. Such bonds may be serial or term; redeemable, with or without premium, or nonredeemable; registered or coupon bonds with registration privileges as to either principal and interest, principal only, or both; shall bear interest at a rate or rates to be determined pursuant to the sale of the bonds; and shall be payable at such time or times and shall mature at such time or times not exceeding twenty-five (25) years from their date, and at such place or places as shall be prescribed in the bond resolution authorizing their issuance; provided, however, that any bond issue to be awarded and sold to the United States of America or any agency thereof shall mature at such time or times, not to exceed thirty-five (35) years, as shall be prescribed in the ordinance authorizing their issuance. Any provisions of the general laws to the contrary notwithstanding, any bonds and interest coupons issued pursuant to the authority of this subsection shall possess all the qualities of negotiable instruments. The bonds and the interest coupons shall be executed in such manner and shall be substantially in the form prescribed in the authorizing resolution. In case any of the officers whose signatures or countersignatures appear on the bonds or interest coupons shall cease to be such officers before delivery of such bonds, such signatures or countersignatures shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes the same as if they had remained in office until such delivery. No bond shall bear more than one (1) rate of interest; each bond shall bear interest from its date to its stated maturity date at the interest rate specified in the bid; all bonds of the same maturity shall bear the same rate of interest from date to maturity; all interest accruing on such bonds so issued shall be payable semiannually or annually, except that the first interest coupon attached to any such bond may be for any period not exceeding one (1) year.
     </p>
     <p>
      No interest payment shall be evidenced by more than one (1) coupon and neither cancelled nor supplemental coupons shall be permitted; the lowest interest rate specified for any bonds issued shall not be less than seventy percent (70%) of the highest rate specified for the same bond issue. Such bonds shall not bear a greater overall maximum interest rate to maturity than that allowed in Section 75-17-103, Mississippi Code of 1972. Each interest rate specified in any bid must be in multiples of one-eighth of one percent (1/8 of 1%) or in multiples of one-tenth of one percent (1/10 of 1%). If serial bonds, such bonds shall mature annually, and the first maturity date thereof shall not be more than five (5) years from the date of such bonds. Such bonds shall be legal investments for trustees and other fiduciaries, and for savings banks, trust companies and insurance companies organized under the laws of the State of Mississippi. The bonds and interest coupons shall be exempt from all state, county, municipal and other taxation under the laws of the State of Mississippi. Such bonds shall be sold at public or private sale upon such terms as the board of commissioners of the district may determine, not inconsistent with the provisions of this subsection, but no sale shall be made at a price so low as to require the payment of interest on the money received therefor at more than that allowed in Section 75-17-103, Mississippi Code of 1972, computed with relation to the absolute maturity of the bonds, in accordance with standard tables of bond values, excluding from such computation the amount of any premium to be paid on redemption of any bonds prior to maturity.
     </p>
     <p>
      All bonds issued pursuant to this subsection shall be validated as provided in Sections 31-13-1 through 31-13-11, Mississippi Code of 1972.
     </p>
     <p>
      Proceeds from the sale of bonds issued pursuant to this subsection may be invested, pending their use, in such certificates of deposit as are specified in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or the trust indenture securing them, and the earnings on such investments applied as provided in such resolution or trust indenture.
     </p>
     <p>
      All bonds issued pursuant to this subsection are declared to be legal and authorized investments for banks, savings banks, trust companies, building and loan associations, savings and loan associations, insurance companies, fiduciaries, trustees and for the sinking fund of municipalities, villages, school districts or any other political corporation or subdivision of the State of Mississippi. Such bonds shall constitute a district indebtedness within the meaning of Section 19-3-107, Mississippi Code of 1972.

       Section 19-3-81(1)(b) implies, upon resolution of the board of supervisors, that the sheriff’s department is authorized to perform the necessary paperwork for depositing the proceeds from the operation of an “Inmate Canteen Fund” into the county treasury; however, the board of supervisors, as a condition precedent to the establishment of the facility by resolution spread on the minutes, can authorize the county administrator to account for the fund; in any case, the sheriff has sole authority to make expenditures from the fund, in the sound exercise of his discretion and in accordance with the terms of the statute.

       Sections 19-4-1 and 19-4-7 permit the board of supervisors to delegate to the county administrator their duty to approve travel by county employees under Section 25-3-41; however, giving advance approval to certain classes of employees, rather than individual employees, to attend unspecified training classes during a particular month or similar time period, does not satisfy the requirements of Section 25-3-41.

      [With regard to any county that is required to operate on a countywide system of road administration as described in Section 19-2-3, this section shall read as follows:]
     </p>
     <p>
      The board of supervisors of each county shall appoint some person other than a member of such board to serve as county administrator. The board of supervisors may appoint the chancery clerk of the county as county administrator if the chancery clerk agrees to serve as county administrator, or the board may appoint as county administrator some other person who has knowledgeable experience in any of the following fields: work projection, budget planning, accounting, purchasing, cost control or personnel management. If the chancery clerk is appointed to serve as county administrator, the board of supervisors, with the approval of the chancery clerk, may appoint the chancery clerk also to serve as the county purchase clerk, an assistant purchase clerk, the inventory control clerk or any combination of such positions, but no chancery clerk who serves as county administrator shall also serve as the county road manager or a receiving clerk or an assistant receiving clerk for the county. If some person other than the chancery clerk is appointed to serve as county administrator, the board of supervisors may appoint such person also to serve as (a) inventory control clerk; (b) inventory control clerk and county road manager; or (c) inventory control clerk and county purchase clerk; but such person shall not serve as both county administrator and as a receiving clerk or an assistant receiving clerk for the county.
     </p>
     <p>
      Notwithstanding any provisions of this section to the contrary, in any county having a population of less than three thousand (3,000) according to the latest federal decennial census, the board of supervisors, with the approval of the chancery clerk, may appoint the chancery clerk also to serve as the county administrator, the county purchase clerk, an assistant purchase clerk, the receiving clerk, an assistant receiving clerk, and the inventory control clerk, or any combination of such positions.
     </p>
     <p>
      The county administrator, under the policies determined by the board of supervisors and subject to the board’s general supervision and control, shall administer all county affairs falling under the control of the board and carry out the general policies of the board in conformity with the estimates of expenditures fixed in the annual budget as finally adopted by the board or as thereafter revised by appropriate action of the board.
     </p>
     <p>
      The boards of supervisors of at least two (2) but no more than five (5) counties may, by agreement executed under the Interlocal Cooperation Act of 1974, employ the same person to serve them as county administrator; however, a chancery clerk may not be appointed to serve as administrator for more than one (1) county nor for any county other than the county for which he serves as chancery clerk.
     </p>
     <p>
      The State Auditor shall prescribe a course of continuing education for county administrators to keep them knowledgeable about their duties and responsibilities with respect to administering the affairs of the county. At least one (1) training session shall be held annually.

       Court held that a Mississippi county administrator occupied a critical managerial role in county government, and because his duties strongly influenced the public’s view of the elected board of supervisors, the board must be assured of his trust and loyalty and must be able to assume the confidentiality, when necessary, of their mutual dealings; thus, the administrator could be discharged for campaigning for board member’s political enemy without violating the administrator’s constitutional rights.

    Adoption of building and other related codes in certain counties.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The construction codes published by a nationally recognized code group which sets minimum standards and has the proper provisions to maintain up-to-date amendments are adopted as minimum standard guides for building, plumbing, electrical, gas, sanitary, and other related codes in Mississippi. Any county within the State of Mississippi, in the discretion of the board of supervisors, may adopt building codes, plumbing codes, electrical codes, sanitary codes, or other related codes dealing with general public health, safety or welfare, or a combination of the same, within but not exceeding the provisions of the construction codes published by nationally recognized code groups, by order or resolution in the manner prescribed in this section, but those codes so adopted shall apply only to the unincorporated areas of the county. However, those codes shall not apply to the erection, maintenance, repair or extension of farm buildings or farm structures, except as may be required under the terms of the “Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, ” and shall apply to a master planned community as defined in Section 19-5-10 only to the extent allowed in Section 19-5-10. The provisions of this section shall not be construed to authorize the adoption of any code which applies to the installation, repair or maintenance of electric wires, pipelines, apparatus, equipment or devices by or for a utility rendering public utility services, required by it to be utilized in the rendition of its duly authorized service to the public. Before any such code shall be adopted, it shall be either printed or typewritten and shall be presented in pamphlet form to the board of supervisors at a regular meeting. The order or resolution adopting the code shall not set out the code in full, but shall merely identify the same. The vote or passage of the order or resolution shall be the same as on any other order or resolution. After its adoption, the code or codes shall be certified to by the president and clerk of the board of supervisors and shall be filed as a permanent record in the office of the clerk who shall not be required to transcribe and record the same in the minute book as other orders and resolutions.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the board of supervisors of any county adopts or has adopted construction codes which do not have proper provisions to maintain up-to-date amendments, specifications in such codes for cements used in portland cement concrete shall be superseded by nationally recognized specifications referenced in any code adopted by the Mississippi Building Code Council.
     </p>
     <p>
      All provisions of this section shall apply to amendments and revisions of the codes mentioned in this section. The provisions of this section shall be in addition and supplemental to any existing laws authorizing the adoption, amendment or revision of county orders, resolutions or codes.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any code adopted under the provisions of this section shall not be in operation or force until sixty (60) days have elapsed from the adoption of same; however, any code adopted for the immediate preservation of the public health, safety and general welfare may be effective from and after its adoption by a unanimous vote of the members of the board. Within five (5) days after the adoption or passage of an order or resolution adopting that code or codes the clerk of the board of supervisors shall publish in a legal newspaper published in the county the full text of the order or resolution adopting and approving the code, and the publication shall be inserted at least three (3) times, and shall be completed within thirty (30) days after the passage of the order or resolution.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any person or persons objecting to the code or codes may object in writing to the provisions of the code or codes within sixty (60) days after the passage of the order or resolution approving same, and if the board of supervisors adjudicates that ten percent (10%) or more of the qualified electors residing in the affected unincorporated areas of the county have objected in writing to the code or codes, then in such event the code shall be inoperative and not in effect unless adopted for the immediate preservation of the public health, safety and general welfare until approved by a special election called by the board of supervisors as other special elections are called and conducted by the election commissioners of the county as other special elections are conducted, the special election to be participated in by all the qualified electors of the county residing in the unincorporated areas of the county. If the voters approve the code or codes in the special election it shall be in force and in operation thereafter until amended or modified as provided in this section. If the majority of the qualified electors voting in the special election vote against the code or codes, then, in such event, the code or codes shall be void and of no force and effect, and no other code or codes dealing with that subject shall be adopted under the provisions of this section until at least two (2) years thereafter.
     </p>
     <p>
      After any such code shall take effect the board of supervisors is authorized to employ such directors and other personnel as the board, in its discretion, deems necessary and to expend general county funds or any other funds available to the board to fulfill the purposes of this section.
     </p>
     <p>
      For the purpose of promoting health, safety, morals or the general welfare of the community, the governing authority of any municipality, and, with respect to the unincorporated part of any county, the governing authority of any county, in its discretion, is empowered to regulate the height, number of stories and size of building and other structures, the percentage of lot that may be occupied, the size of the yards, courts and other open spaces, the density or population, and the location and use of buildings, structures and land for trade, industry, residence or other purposes, but no permits shall be required except as may be required under the terms of the “Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973” for the erection, maintenance, repair or extension of farm buildings or farm structures outside the corporate limits of municipalities.

       The board of supervisors of any county is authorized to enter into one or more development agreements with the developer or developers of a master planned community in order to authorize, in addition to any other matters to which the board of supervisors may lawfully obligate the county, the master planned community, through a community self-governing entity created by the owners of the property, to administer, manage and enforce the land use restrictions and covenants, land use regulations, subdivision regulations, building codes and regulations, and any other limitations and restrictions on land and buildings provided in the master plan for the master planned community, in lieu of the real estate and property owners within the master planned community being subject to the county ordinances and regulations pertaining to buildings, subdivisions, zoning, the county’s comprehensive plan, and any other county ordinances and regulations pertaining thereto. Prior to entering into any such development agreement, the board of supervisors shall review the master plan for the master planned community and find that the provisions of the master plan providing for regulations, restrictions, covenants and limitations pertaining to building, subdivisions, zoning and comprehensive planning shall be comparable to, or greater than, similar provisions in the ordinances and regulations of the county. The term of such a development agreement may be not more than thirty (30) years or the number of years allowed in the county’s subdivision ordinance for terms of subdivision covenants, whichever is greater. The development agreement shall have attached to it a boundary survey made by a registered land surveyor, and upon approval of the development agreement by the board of supervisors, the boundary survey shall be recorded in the land records of the chancery clerk of the county. The recorded boundary survey shall serve as the description of the property within the master planned community which shall not be subject to the county’s zoning map, and the county’s zoning map shall simply recognize the territory described in such boundary survey as a “master planned community.” Whenever there may be a conflict between the county ordinances and regulations pertaining to buildings, subdivisions, zoning, the county’s comprehensive plan, and any other county ordinances and regulations pertaining thereto, and the provisions of such a development agreement, including the provisions of the master plan providing for regulations, restrictions, covenants and limitations pertaining to buildings, subdivisions, zoning and comprehensive planning, the provisions of the development agreement shall prevail if the provisions of the development agreement are comparable to or greater than similar provisions of county ordinances and regulations.

     <p>
      After December 31, 1992, the board of supervisors of any county in the state shall provide for the collection and disposal of garbage and the disposal of rubbish, and for that purpose is required to establish, operate and maintain a garbage and/or rubbish disposal system or systems; to acquire property, real or personal, by contract, gift or purchase, necessary or proper for the maintenance and operation of such system; to make all necessary rules and regulations for the collection and disposal of garbage and/or rubbish and, if it so desires, to establish, maintain and collect rates, fees and charges for collecting and disposing of such garbage and/or rubbish; and, in its discretion, to enter into contracts, in the manner required by law, with individuals, associations or corporations for the establishment, operation and maintenance of a garbage and rubbish disposal system or systems, and/or to enter into contracts on such terms as the board of supervisors thinks proper with any municipality, other county or region, enabling the county to use jointly with such municipality, other county or region any collection system, authorized rubbish landfill or permitted sanitary landfill operated by the municipality, other county or region. The board of supervisors shall designate by order the area to be served by the system. All persons in the county generating garbage shall utilize a garbage collection and disposal system. However, this provision shall not prohibit any person from managing solid waste generated by such person in any municipal solid waste management facility owned by the generator.
     </p>
     <p>
      As a necessary incident to such county’s power and authority to establish, maintain and collect such rates, fees and charges for collecting and disposing of such garbage and/or rubbish, and as a necessary incident to such county’s power and authority to establish, operate and maintain a garbage and/or rubbish disposal system or systems, the board of supervisors of such county shall have the authority to initiate a civil action to recover any delinquent fees and charges for collecting and disposing of such garbage and/or rubbish, and all administrative and legal costs associated with collecting such fees and charges, in the event any person, firm or corporation, including any municipal corporation, shall fail or refuse to pay such fees and charges for collecting and disposing of garbage and/or rubbish; provided that such board of supervisors may initiate such a civil action to recover such delinquent fees and charges whether or not such county has previously entered into a contract with such individual, firm or corporation, including a municipal corporation, relating to the establishment, operation and maintenance of such garbage and/or rubbish disposal system or systems; provided, further, that in a civil action to recover such delinquent fees and charges for collecting and disposing of such garbage and/or rubbish, and all administrative and legal costs associated with collecting such fees and charges, the county shall in all respects be a proper party to such suit as plaintiff and shall have the power to sue for and recover such unpaid fees and charges and all administrative and legal costs associated with collecting such fees and charges, from any person, firm or corporation, including a municipal corporation, as may fail, refuse or default in the payment of such fees and charges.

       County may contract with third party for billing and collection of garbage fees which are then promptly settled to county. Dyson, August 12, 1992, A.G. Op. #92-0608.
      </p>
      <p>
       County board of supervisors may provide for and levy rates, fees and charges for garbage collection and may make provisions for exemptions of certain classes of users provided it can do so in manner consistent with requirements of equal protection, due process and other constitutional mandates. Smith, August 26, 1992, A.G. Op. #92-0575.
      </p>
      <p>
       Surcharge on amount of ad valorem tax to fund garbage collection system should be collected as other property taxes are collected; rate of such surcharge is to be shown as line item on notice of ad valorem taxes on taxable property owed by the taxpayer. McLaurin, Oct. 21, 1992, A.G. Op. #92-0798.
      </p>
      <p>
       If garbage fee is surcharge on ad valorem taxes imposed pursuant to Section 19-5-21(2) rather than fee set under Section 19-5-17, tax collector has statutory duty to collect surcharge. McLaurin, Nov. 4, 1992, A.G. Op. #92-0855.

       County may, under current law, collect millage and fees to defray costs of operating solid waste collection and disposal system. Hemphill Nov. 3, 1993, A.G. Op. #93-0588.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no language in Section 19-5-21(2) that suggests surcharge must be levied by board of supervisors as matter of law; county could in exercise of its discretion levy surcharge, but it was not required to do so. Kilpatrick, Feb. 24, 1994, A.G. Op. #94-0012.
      </p>
      <p>
       A garbage fee would not be a tax for each industrial, commercial and multi-family residential generator of garbage that has otherwise contracted for the collection of garbage since the fees would be imposed with the consent or voluntary action of those generators. See Sections 19-5-17 and 19-5-21(2). Walley, August 14, 1995, A.G. Op. #95-0323.

       Severance taxes may not be used pursuant to Section 19-5-21(7) to defray the costs of the county garbage or rubbish collection or disposal system. Haque, August 2, 1996, A.G. Op. #96-0455.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under Section 19-5-21(7), no funds that are otherwise dedicated for a particular purpose may be expended by the county for costs associated with the garbage or rubbish collection or disposal system. Haque, August 2, 1996, A.G. Op. #96-0455.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any motor vehicle owned by a person who is delinquent in the payment of garbage fees is subject to distraint for non-payment of those fees; while payment of the fees is a prerequisite to the issuance of a car tag, if the tag is issued in error, it cannot be voided nor can the vehicle be subjected to distraint; however, the county may either sue the individual in justice court or place a lien on the individual’s property. Allen, January 30, 1998, A.G. Op. #97-0787.

       A county board of supervisors may, at any time during the fiscal year, amend its order setting solid waste fees and offer full or partial exemptions under subsection (4) of this section, although such amendment will only be prospective in effect.
   Barry, July 2, 1999, A.G. Op. #99-0330.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a county board of supervisors elects to levy ad valorem taxes pursuant to subsection (1)(g), the board may not grant partial or full exemption on certain classes of property that would otherwise be subject to the levy.
   Golding, April 21, 2000, A.G. Op. #2000-0213.
      </p>
      <p>
       A person may dispose of solid waste from his own household upon his own land only if he is a single-family generator and the county board of supervisors has so authorized; any person disposing of solid waste on his own land must nevertheless comply with all state and federal laws, rules and regulations governing such disposal.
   Caughman, March 10, 2000, A.G. Op. #99-0194.
      </p>
      <p>
       A county may utilize a combination of generator fees, charges, or ad valorem assessment not to exceed four mills to defray the cost of providing garbage services or, in lieu of any other fees or taxes, a county may charge an amount not to exceed six mills; however, in no case may a county through any combination of taxes, fees, and special funds exceed the actual costs estimated to operate the county garbage and rubbish collection and disposal system. Andrews, Aug. 31, 2001, A.G. Op. #01-0531.
      </p>
      <p>
       A county in its discretion may grant an exemption from garbage fees for schools, community hospitals, and other classes of generators. Johnson, Oct. 29, 2001, A.G. Op. #01-0555.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was no authority for the county to use solid waste disposal funds to defray the cost of a proposed E-911 Geographic Information Services System. Shepard, Mar. 29, 2002, A.G. Op. #02-0135.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (4) of this section clearly provides authority for a board of supervisors to determine whether to grant exemptions from garbage or rubbish collection fees. A prior opinion (Rutledge (Aug. 6, 2002) was based upon Section 21-27-27, which prohibits municipal governing authorities from providing free or discounted municipal services except to listed entities; the applicability of that opinion is limited to municipalities. Barry, July 25, 2003, A.G. Op. 03-0369.

       The language of this section clearly provides authority for a board of supervisors to determine whether to grant exemptions from garbage or rubbish collection fees for certain classes of generators, including individuals over the age of 65. Lowery, Mar. 19, 2004, A.G. Op. 04-0109.

       If a county levies up to 4 mills for garbage collection pursuant to subdivision (1)(a) of this section, then it may use the authority granted under subsection (4) of the section to exempt certain properties that do not generate garbage or pay for private garbage services such as farmland, commercial and/or industrial property. Hudson, Aug. 6, 2004, A.G. Op. 04-0343.

        OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL

      </h4>
      <p>
       Under Section 19-5-22(3), the county may suspend the ability of a waste generator to obtain an automobile license plate during the pendency of a bankruptcy. Walley, August 14, 1995, A.G. Op. #95-0323.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hearing may be held under this section to establish if garbage service was in fact provided to a person owing delinquent garbage fees and, based on the outcome of the hearing, if the individual should be removed from the delinquent list and have garbage service arranged. Barrett, Aug. 8, 1997, A.G. Op. #97-0474.
      </p>
      <p>
       A property owner is jointly and severally liable with the delinquent renter for the payment of garbage fees on property and, further, if the fees are not paid, the tax collector, after notice and hearing, may withhold the owner’s motor vehicle tag until payment, and the renter may also be held liable as long as he does not pay; a “generator” responsible with the owner for garbage fees includes all persons residing at an address for which garbage collection is provided and, if fees are delinquent, any person residing therein may, after notice and hearing, be deprived of his tag until the fees are paid. Robinson, January 30, 1998, A.G. Op. #98-0045.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any motor vehicle owned by a person who is delinquent in the payment of garbage fees is subject to distraint for non-payment of those fees; while payment of the fees is a prerequisite to the issuance of a car tag, if the tag is issued in error, it cannot be voided nor can the vehicle be subjected to distraint; however, the county may either sue the individual in justice court or place a lien on the individual’s property. Allen, January 30, 1998, A.G. Op. #97-0787.
      </p>
      <p>
       The statute authorizes a lien for the nonpayment of garbage fees, and these fees become a lien on the property by operation of law, meaning that a court order is not necessary; the chancery clerk should record these liens in a separate book and treat them in the same manner as special assessments are handled.
   Prichard, July 10, 1998, A.G. Op. #98-0386.
      </p>
      <p>
       A property owner is liable for the payment of delinquent garbage fees even if the generator lives on the property without paying rent, unless otherwise exempted.
   Robinson, April 2, 1999, A.G. Op. #99-0135.
      </p>
      <p>
       Board of supervisors may not place an annual assessment for garbage or rubbish fees on ad valorem tax statements. Smith, June 20, 2003, A.G. Op. 03-0258.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the case of the death of a property owner, the county should attempt to collect any delinquent fees from the generator if the generator does not pay a garbage fee as part of the lease agreement. Collection attempts would include withholding a motor vehicle road and bridge privilege license if garbage fees remain delinquent. However, if garbage fees are part of the lease agreement, then the county must attempt to collect those fees from the property owner’s estate. Hemphill, Apr. 16, 2004, A.G. Op. 04-0146.
      </p>
      <p>
       A county cannot enter into a written agreement with any person delinquent in their garbage fees to accept a partial payment up front and then the remainder in installments in exchange for releasing the hold on the motor vehicle tag. Hemphill, July 16, 2004, A.G. Op. 04-0269.
      </p>
      <p>
       In addition to accepting payment of non-delinquent garbage fees by installment, the county may accept payment of delinquent garbage fees in installments. Hemphill, July 16, 2004, A.G. Op. 04-0269.
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Due to the mandatory language in subdivision (4)(b) of this section, a county cannot allow a motor vehicle tag to be issued to the owner until all delinquent solid waste fees are paid. Therefore, the statute does not permit the county to issue the motor vehicle tag while the owner pays the delinquent fees in installments. Additionally, however, pursuant to subdivision (4)(a), the board of Supervisors may, but are not required to, notify the tax collector of any unpaid fees assessed under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t19c05s19-5-21" target="_self">19-5-21</a></cite>. Ray, Sept. 3, 2004, A.G. Op. 04-0430. And see Hemphill, July 16, 2004, A.G. Op. 04-0269.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (2) of this section does not prohibit the garnishment of wages. Abraham, Sept. 10, 2004, A.G. Op. 04-0418.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a board of supervisors follows the procedure prescribed by this section, the tax collector must refuse the sale of a tag until all assessed fees are paid. Jeanes, Sept. 24, 2004, A.G. Op. 04-0463.
      </p>
      <p>
       A county may contract with a county cooperative service district to provide garbage disposal and to bill and collect the fees for the garbage service. The services may be performed for either an annual or monthly fee. Hudson, Oct. 8, 2004, A.G. Op. 04-0480.
      </p>
      <p>
       Acceptance of delinquent garbage fees is not a statutorily prescribed duty of a tax collector. Dowdy, Mar. 11, 2005, A.G. Op. 05-0086.
      </p>
      <p>
       While a housing authority would clearly be exempt from a property tax for garbage collection, no authority can be found exempting housing authorities, or other public entities, from the payment of a fee imposed by the county to cover the cost of garbage collection. Turnage, June 2, 2006, A.G. Op. 06-0178.
      </p>
      <p>
       A housing authority’s failure to pay garbage fees results in a “lien” upon the property pursuant to Section 19-5-22(2), but it does not actually encumber the property such that the property could be sold to satisfy the lien. Rather, Section 19-5-22(4) prohibits the tax collector, upon receipt of a delinquency notice from the Board, from issuing a car tag to a vehicle owner who is delinquent in the payment of these fees, and, therefore, the county may refuse to issue a car tag to the authority. Turnage, June 2, 2006, A.G. Op. 06-0178.
      </p>
      <p>
       A county may institute legal proceedings against housing authority (and possibly the tenants) to collect garbage fees, in addition to implementing any other administrative procedures established by the county under Section 19-5-22(4). Turnage, June 2, 2006, A.G. Op. 06-0178.
      </p>
      <p>
       The attorney for the board of supervisors is not eligible to be appointed as garbage court judge for the county. Shepard, June 19, 2006, A.G. Op. 06-0245.
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Disallowing a property tax homestead exemption for failure to pay delinquent garbage bills constitutes an increase in taxes not authorized in statute, and therefore is prohibited by Miss.

Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t19c05s19-5-22" target="_self">19-5-22</a></cite> and 42 U.S.C.S. § 1983 because the initial requirement for either a procedural or substantive due process claim was proving the plaintiff had been deprived by the government of a liberty or property interest; otherwise, no right to due process could accrue.

      Any board of supervisors may, in its discretion, by appropriate resolution spread upon its minutes, offer a bounty not to exceed Five Dollars ($5.00) for each nutria, beaver or bobcat destroyed, where such board finds and determines that nutria, beaver or bobcats are in such quantities that the preservation of trees and other properties requires such bounties to be offered. Upon presentation to the sheriff of the complete tail of a nutria, beaver or bobcat, the sheriff shall execute a receipt therefor. Upon filing of such receipt with the chancery clerk, the amount of such bounty may be allowed by the board of supervisors as are other accounts against the county.
     </p>
     <p>
      There is further provided a bounty on beaver not to exceed Five Dollars ($5.00) for each beaver to be paid in the following manner: upon the presentation of the tail of any beaver, any conservation officer of the state shall issue a receipt in such form as prescribed by the Mississippi Commission on Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks to the person presenting such tail. The Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks shall redeem such receipts by paying to such person a sum not to exceed Five Dollars ($5.00) for each such receipt as bounty. The redemption of such receipts shall be paid only from funds especially appropriated for this purpose and it is expressly provided that no such bounty shall be paid from any regular receipts, funds and appropriations of the Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks.
     </p>
     <p>
      For the purposes of carrying out the purposes of this section, the Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks and the State Forestry Commission are authorized, empowered and directed, when requested by the board of supervisors or any property owner, to utilize funds, personnel and equipment under reasonable terms and conditions.
     </p>
     <p>
      No bounty shall be paid when funds, personnel or equipment of the Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks, the State Forestry Commission or the county are employed in capturing and killing such animals.

       § 19-5-63.
    Establishment of county extension department.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      It is declared to be the policy of this state to develop and promote agriculture, including the raising of livestock, and all enterprises and activities dependent upon the products of the soil, and in line with this policy, to make available to the citizens of this state useful and practical information on subjects relating to agriculture and home economics that research has discovered, to encourage the application of the same, and to obtain all the assistance and advantages that the federal government offers to provide.
     </p>
     <p>
      The board of supervisors of each county in this state may establish a county extension department in agriculture and home economics. The purpose of this department shall be to disseminate useful information among the farmers, farm women, and farm boys and girls, and to develop the agricultural resources and improve the farm homes of this state.
     </p>
     <p>
      The county extension departments shall be in charge of a county agent and such assistant county agents and home economics agents as the board of supervisors and the extension department of the Mississippi State University of Agriculture and Applied Science may deem adequate to the needs of the county. The board of supervisors upon the recommendation of the director of extension of said university and the approval of the United States Department of Agriculture shall appoint the county agent, assistant county agents and home economics agents, fix their salaries and other necessary expenses, and the amount so fixed shall be paid out of the general fund of the county, but may be supplemented by the extension department of said university and/or the United States Department of Agriculture.
     </p>
     <p>
      The board of supervisors shall provide office space for the county extension department; shall equip the said office with the necessary office equipment and furniture, and shall also furnish the necessary record books, maps, stationery, postage and other items incidental to the proper operation of the department. The board of supervisors shall also employ such clerical assistance for the department as in the judgment of the board will enable the department to efficiently perform the duties required of it by this section. All such expense shall be paid out of the general fund of the county, but may be supplemented by the extension department of the Mississippi State University of Agriculture and Applied Science and/or the United States Department of Agriculture.
     </p>
     <p>
      It shall be the duty of the county extension department to carry on farm and home demonstration work, boys and girls club work, organized production and cooperative marketing work, and all other phases of extension work under the joint supervision and control of the board of supervisors, the extension department of the Mississippi State University of Agriculture and Applied Science and the United States Department of Agriculture, under the provisions of the Smith-Lever act and other related acts of congress.
     </p>
     <p>
      The duties prescribed by the preceding paragraph shall be construed to include and emphasize actual work in the field as distinguished from executive or administrative tasks or office work. In order that the several county extension departments may fully comply with the requirements of this section and perform the duties required of them, the extension department of the Mississippi State University of Agriculture and Applied Science may, upon the approval of the director of extension and the United States Department of Agriculture, employ and pay the salary of an assistant county agent in any county in which the director of extension shall find the services of such assistant necessary and his appointment justified.
     </p>
     <p>
      The enumeration in the foregoing paragraphs of duties to be performed by agents appointed under this section shall not be taken as exclusive but such agents may perform any duties to accomplish the purposes of this section which they may be directed to perform by the extension department of the Mississippi State University of Agriculture and Applied Science with the approval of the United States Department of Agriculture the expense of which is covered in whole or in part by appropriations received from the federal government or any department thereof for agricultural extension work.

        OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL
       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       The Board of Supervisors of a county cannot grant any donations of public funds or county office and parking space to private non-sectarian charities that are not expressly statutorily enumerated. Walters, Mar. 18, 1992, A.G. Op. #91-0168.
      </p>
      <p>
       County board of supervisors has no apparent authority to contribute funds for utilities and insurance for building owned by city and leased to non-profit organization which uses it as community center. Cossar, Nov. 25, 1992, A.G. Op. #92-0889.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although a Drug Task Force may not make a donation of funds or property, the counties and cities making up the Task Force may contribute funds to a domestic violence shelter as they see fit under Sections 19-5-93(o) and 93-21-115. Pacific, June 28, 1995, A.G. Op. #95-0329.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 19-5-93 gives the board of supervisors of each county the discretionary authority to make donations for certain purposes; however, there appears to be no authority for the board to make a donation to a private nonprofit corporation. Meek, October 11, 1995, A.G. Op. #95-0644.
      </p>
      <p>
       The statute does not include the Boy Scouts or the Girl Scouts among the organizations to which county supervisors may donate funds.
   Carnathan, Oct. 27, 2000, A.G. Op. #2000-0649.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (q) specifically authorizes counties to make donations to any residential group home for abused, abandoned, or neglected children, and the authority to donate includes the authority to perform and donate the value of in-kind services. Smith, Mar. 9, 2001, A.G. Op. #01-0121.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a county-owned residential group home for children is closed, any funds existing which are not necessary to satisfy any debts related to its operation may, in the discretion of the county board of supervisors, be transferred to the non-profit corporation, either as consideration of the services to be provided, or as a donation. Barry, Nov. 9, 2001, A.G. Op. #01-0662.
      </p>
      <p>
       The authority to donate includes the authority to perform and donate in-kind services and, therefore, a county board of supervisors who contracted with a Mississippi nonprofit corporation to provide professional services as a residential group home, could use its equipment and labor to construct a private drive on the property of the nonprofit corporation to provide ingress/egress to it from a public street. Barry, Mar. 29, 2002, A.G. Op. #02-0143.
      </p>
      <p>
       A county board of supervisors lacks authority to approve a request for a grant submitted by a health service organization that is a proprietorship and not a governmental entity. Dulaney, Sept. 27, 2002, A.G. Op. #02-0563.
      </p>
      <p>
       Y-CAP, a division of the YMCA, is not a residential group home as defined by Section 19-5-93(q). Jewell, May 9, 2003, A.G. Op. 03-0206.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because the shelter established by Interfaith Hospitality is not a residential group home as defined by Section 19-5-93(q), therefore, a county board of supervisors does not have the authority to appropriate funds to that organization. Meadows, May 23, 2003, A.G. Op. 03-0221.
      </p>
      <p>
       A county board of supervisors does not have the authority under this section to appropriate funds to provide financial assistance to a homeless shelter operated by a private non-profit corporation. O’Donnell, July 18, 2003, A.G. Op. 03-0307.
      </p>
      <p>
       Assistance of a county board of supervisors in the demolition of a part of building and hauling away the debris to aid an early head start center is not a donation within the purview of subsection (p) of this section. Entrekin, July 18, 2003, A.G. Op. 03-0323.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no authority for a board of supervisors to make a donation to a private nonprofit corporation. McWilliams, Aug. 8, 2003, A.G. Op.03-0404.
      </p>
      <p>
       A board of supervisors could not assist a non-profit public purpose corporation
   in the removal of existing concrete slab foundations on their property. McWilliams, Aug. 22, 2003, A.G. Op. 03-0370.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing in the section authorizes contributions for a private community action agency. Welch, May, 6, 2004, A.G. Op. 04-0174.
      </p>
      <p>
       No authority is provided by this section for a county to donate funds to a park owned by a private, non-profit corporation. However, a county may lease property for a public park and/or contract for operations of a public park. Chamberlin, Aug. 13, 2004, A.G. Op. 04-0318.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where transfer of title to a building by a company to a county is followed by temporary retention of possession by the donating company, and the eighteen month possession of the building by the company is presumably far less than the building’s appraisal value, therefore, the possession of the building after transfer would not be an impermissible donation. Crow, Dec. 8, 2006, A.G. Op. 06-0583.

       Subject to the provisions of Section 19-9-111, the board of supervisors of any county in the State of Mississippi, in its discretion, by order duly entered on its minutes, may establish economic development districts comprising all of the county, or one or more supervisors districts of the county, or may establish such economic development districts in cooperation with one or more other counties or with municipalities or with other local and private economic development groups. The board of supervisors may do everything within its power to secure and further industrial development of the county or counties or district, to advertise the natural resources and possibilities of the same, and to maintain and support the same.
       <p>
        All monies collected for the support and maintenance of such economic development district, in accordance with the tax levy provided in Section 19-9-111, shall be placed in the county treasury to the credit of the county or district economic development fund and shall be expended as other public funds are expended, and in which event the employees of such economic development district shall be employees of the county and considered as such. In addition to such funds provided by taxation, the board of supervisors of such county may accept gifts, gratuities and donations from municipalities in such districts and from any persons, firms or corporations desiring to make such donations. Such appropriation, gift or donation shall also be placed in the county treasury and be expended in the support and maintenance of such district.
       </p>
       <p>
        At the option of such board of supervisors, or boards of supervisors if more than one (1) county is embraced in such economic development district, it may provide for the management of such economic development district by appointing not more than twenty-five (25) nor less than five (5) trustees, or if a multicounty district not more than five (5) trustees per participating county, who shall be qualified electors residing within such economic development district, to manage the affairs of such district, and in which event the funds made available by the county or counties for the support and maintenance of such economic development district may be expended by a majority vote of such trustees so appointed to manage such economic development district. Each trustee who is an officer of the economic development district shall qualify by giving bond, with sufficient surety, to be payable, conditioned and approved as provided by law, in a penalty equal to Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000.00), the premiums on all such surety bonds being paid by such economic development district. If this option is exercised and such districts operated and maintained under this paragraph, then in such event the employees of such economic development district shall not be considered as employees of the county for state retirement or any other purposes.
       </p>
       <p>
        All funds secured and expended under the provisions of this section shall be public funds and the Auditor of Public Accounts of the State of Mississippi shall audit the same as other public funds are now audited.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Subject to the provisions of Section 19-9-111, the board of supervisors of any county in the State of Mississippi, in its discretion, by order duly entered on its minutes, may establish economic development districts comprising all of the county, or one or more supervisors districts of the county, or may establish such economic development districts in cooperation with one or more other counties or with municipalities or with other local and private economic development groups. The board of supervisors may do everything within its power to secure and further industrial development of the county or counties or district, to advertise the natural resources and possibilities of the same, and to maintain and support the same.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any economic development district established under this section may, when suitable office space is not otherwise available, purchase and acquire title to real estate within the district and make any improvements thereon to provide the office space it considers necessary for efficient operation of such district. Provided, however, that no contract or agreement for the exclusive listing, sale or representation for sale of publicly owned property shall be entered into by such economic development districts with any real estate broker or brokers.
     </p>
     <p>
      (a) Any economic development district established under this section shall have the authority to acquire by gift, purchase or otherwise, and to own, hold, maintain, control and develop real estate situated within the county or counties comprising such district for the development, use and operation of industrial parks or other industrial development purposes. The district is further authorized and empowered to engage in works of internal improvement therefor including, but not limited to, construction or contracting for the construction of streets, roads, railroads, spur tracks, site improvements, water, sewerage, drainage, pollution control and other related facilities necessary or required for industrial development purposes or the development of industrial park complexes; to acquire, purchase, install, lease, construct, own, hold, equip, control, maintain, use, operate and repair other structures and facilities necessary and convenient for the planning, development, use, operation and maintenance of an industrial park or parks or for other industrial development purposes, including, but not limited to, utility installations, elevators, compressors, warehouses, buildings and air, rail and other transportation terminals and pollution control facilities.

     </p>
     <p>
      For the development of such projects, the board of supervisors of any county that establishes an economic development district under this section or that establishes an economic development district in cooperation with one or more other counties, or municipalities or other local and private economic groups, may, upon receipt of a resolution duly adopted by the trustees of such district, issue, secure and manage its bonds in the manner prescribed by Sections 19-9-5, 19-9-7, 19-9-9, 19-9-11, 19-9-13, 19-9-15, 19-9-17, 19-9-19, 19-9-21, 19-9-23, 19-9-25 and 19-9-29. Such bonds shall be sold in accordance with the provisions of Section 31-19-25. The full faith, credit and resources of the county shall be irrevocably pledged for the payment of the principal of and interest on the bonds issued under this section. Any income derived from the sale or lease of the property authorized to be acquired under this section shall be applied in one or more of the following manners: (a) the retirement of bonds authorized to be issued under this section; (b) further improvement or development of such industrial parks or other related industrial development activities; or (c) payment into the general fund of the county to be used for any lawful purpose. Any amounts so paid into the general fund shall be included in the computation of total receipts and subject to the restrictions of Section 27-39-321. The board of supervisors may covenant with or for the benefit of the registered owners of any bonds issued under this section with respect to the application of any or all of such income and shall, by resolution adopted before or promptly after receipt of any such income, determine, in its discretion subject only to the restrictions set forth above and any covenants made to or for the benefit of any registered owners of bonds issued under this section, the manner in which such income shall be applied.

       § 19-5-105.
    Cleaning private property; notice to property owner; hearing; lien.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      To determine whether property or a parcel of land located within a county is in such a state of uncleanliness as to be a menace to the public health, safety and welfare of the community, the board of supervisors of any county is authorized and empowered to conduct a hearing on its own motion, or upon the receipt of a petition requesting the board of supervisors to act signed by a majority of the residents eighteen (18) years of age or older, residing upon any street or alley, within reasonable proximity of any property alleged to be in need of cleaning, or within seven hundred fifty (750) feet of the precise location of the alleged menace situated on any parcel of land which is located in a populated area or in a housing subdivision and alleged to be in need of cleaning.
     </p>
     <p>
      Notice shall be provided to the property owner by:
     </p>
     <p>
      United States mail two (2) weeks before the date of the hearing mailed to the address of the subject property and to the address where the ad valorem tax notice for such property is sent by the office charged with collecting ad valorem tax; and
     </p>
     <p>
      Posting notice for at least two (2) weeks before the date of a hearing on the property or parcel of land alleged to be in need of cleaning and at the county courthouse or another place in the county where such notices are posted.
     </p>
     <p>
      The notice required by this section shall include language that informs the property owner that an adjudication at the hearing that the property or parcel of land is in need of cleaning will authorize the board of supervisors to reenter the property or parcel of land for a period of one (1) year after the hearing without any further hearing, if notice is posted on the property or parcel of land and at the county courthouse or another place in the county where such notices are generally posted at least seven (7) days before the property or parcel of land is reentered for cleaning. A copy of the required notice mailed and posted as required by this section shall be recorded in the minutes of the board of supervisors in conjunction with the hearing required by this section.
     </p>
     <p>
      If at such hearing the board of supervisors shall in its resolution adjudicate such parcel of land in its then condition to be a menace to the public health and safety of the community, the board of supervisors may, if the owner not do so himself, proceed to have the land cleaned by cutting weeds, filling cisterns, and removing rubbish, dilapidated fences, outside toilets, dilapidated buildings and other debris, and draining cesspools and standing water. Thereafter, the board of supervisors may at its next regular meeting by resolution adjudicate the actual cost of cleaning the land and may also impose a penalty not to exceed One Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($1,500.00) or fifty percent (50%) of the actual cost, whichever is more. The cost and any penalty shall become an assessment against the property. The “cost assessed against the property” means either the cost to the county of using its own employees to do the work or the cost to the county of any contract executed by the county to have the work done, and administrative costs and legal costs of the county.
     </p>
     <p>
      A county may reenter the property or parcel of land to maintain cleanliness without further notice of hearing no more than six (6) times in any twelve-month period with respect to removing dilapidated buildings, dilapidated fences and outside toilets, and no more than twelve (12) times in any twenty-four-month period with respect to cutting grass and weeds and removing rubbish, personal property and other debris on the land. The expense of cleaning the property shall not exceed an aggregate amount of Twenty Thousand Dollars ($20,000.00) per year, or the fair market value of the property subsequent to cleaning, whichever is less. The board of supervisors may assess the same penalty each time the property or land is cleaned as otherwise provided in this section.
     </p>
     <p>
      The penalty provided herein shall not be assessed against the State of Mississippi upon request for reimbursement under Section 29-1-145, nor shall a county clean a parcel owned by the State of Mississippi without first giving notice.
     </p>
     <p>
      The assessment authorized by this section shall be a lien against the property and may be enrolled in the office of the circuit clerk of the county as other judgments are enrolled, and the tax collector of the county shall, upon order of the board of supervisors, proceed to sell the land to satisfy the lien as now provided by law for the sale of lands for delinquent taxes. Furthermore, the property owner whose land has been sold pursuant to this section shall have the same right of redemption as now provided by law for the sale of lands for delinquent taxes. All decisions rendered under the provisions of this section may be appealed in the same manner as other appeals from county boards.

       General funds may be used to repair, operate and maintain equipment on the general county inventory, but the county may not use general funds to repair, operate, maintain or purchase equipment and trucks to collect and haul rubbish from ditches as part of the county’s rubbish disposal system. Bailey, Dec. 12, 1997, A.G. Op. #97-0738.

      <p>
       Subsection (1) clearly permits counties to meet the costs of garbage and rubbish collection services by any combination of generator fees, ad valorem taxes as statutorily authorized, or special funds as statutorily authorized. Snyder, March 17, 2000, A.G. Op. #2000-0136.

      <p>
       A municipality has the authority to enter into contracts with a county that would enable the municipality to utilize the county landfill, and as such, the municipality is authorized to pay a “tipping” fee, or “gate” fee for the use of that landfill; the power of a county to grant exemptions for certain classes of “generators” would not affect the authority of the municipality to pay such a fee, and, further, that the municipality is not a “generator” of garbage or rubbish would be of no relevance to the payment of any such fee charged by the county.

      A district embracing lands in more than one county may be created under the provision of Sections 19-5-151 through 19-5-207 by the following procedure if the portion of such district located in each county includes twenty percent (20%) or more of all of the lands to be embraced in a district:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t19c05s19-5-164ol11">
       The portion of a proposed district containing the largest area of land shall be first created into a district by the board of supervisors of the county in which such largest portion is situated, such county to be known as the “incorporating county.”
      </li>
      <li id="t19c05s19-5-164ol12">
       The resolution first creating such district shall include the exact boundaries of the lands situated in the incorporating county and shall include the exact boundaries of the contiguous area in other counties to be included in the district.
      </li>
      <li id="t19c05s19-5-164ol13">
       The resolution by the incorporating county shall designate the official name of the district and shall delineate the procedure by which appointment of the five (5) commissioners authorized by Section 19-5-167, Mississippi Code of 1972, shall be apportioned among the counties in which portions of such districts are located.
      </li>
      <li id="t19c05s19-5-164ol14">
       The resolution adopted by the board of supervisors of any county desiring to include contiguous lands into a district initially created as outlined above shall contain exact and identical provisions to those in the resolution by the board of supervisors of the incorporating county.
      </li>
      <li id="t19c05s19-5-164ol15">
       The board of supervisors of the incorporating county shall, within sixty (60) days after the adoption of a resolution or resolutions by the board of supervisors of adjoining counties to enter lands into the district, enter an order on its minutes acknowledging, affirming and adjudicating the incorporation of the district.
      </li>

       Any contiguous lands in an adjoining county, but not amounting to twenty percent (20%) or more of the total land area included in a district, may be served by a district created under the provisions of Sections 19-5-151 through 19-5-207 if a certificate of convenience and necessity to do so is issued by the Mississippi Public Service Commission. Provided, however, the provisions of Sections 19-5-189 and 19-5-191, Mississippi Code of 1972, shall not be applicable to any lands not a part of a district.

       Except as otherwise provided in this section, the powers of each district shall be vested in and exercised by a board of commissioners consisting of five (5) members to be appointed by the board of supervisors. Upon their initial appointment, one (1) of the commissioners shall be appointed for a term of one (1) year; one (1) for a term of two (2) years; one (1) for a term of three (3) years; one (1) for a term of four (4) years; and one (1) for a term of five (5) years; thereafter, each commissioner shall be appointed and shall hold office for a term of five (5) years. Any vacancy occurring on a board of commissioners shall be filled by the board of supervisors at any regular meeting of the board of supervisors, and the board of supervisors shall have the authority to fill all unexpired terms of any commissioner or commissioners. Notwithstanding the appointive authority herein granted to the board of supervisors, its legal and actual responsibilities, authority and function, subsequent to the creation of any district, shall be specifically limited to the appointive function and responsibilities outlined in Sections 19-5-179, 19-5-189 and 19-5-191, except that with fire protection districts, the board of supervisors shall have authority for dissolving, redefining and reconfiguring of such districts as may be appropriate to ensure the most appropriate and efficient fire protection coverage for the county’s citizens. The operation, management, abolition or dissolution of such district, and all other matters in connection therewith, shall be vested solely and only in the board of commissioners to the specific exclusion of the board of supervisors, and the abolition, dissolution or termination of any district shall be accomplished only by unanimous resolution of the board of commissioners, except that with fire protection districts, the board of supervisors shall have authority for the dissolving, redefining and reconfiguring of such districts when determined appropriate. However, if any area within the boundaries of a fire protection district created under Section 19-5-151 et seq., is annexed by a municipality, a reduction of the boundaries of the district to exclude such annexed area may be accomplished by the adoption of a resolution by a majority vote of the board of commissioners of that fire protection district. The county board of supervisors which has a fire protection district created under Section 19-5-151 et seq., may dissolve, redefine and reconfigure such district and, under Section 19-5-215 et seq., may create a fire protection grading district consisting of the same boundaries as the previously existing fire protection district or having amended boundaries as determined appropriate by the board of supervisors. Petition and election requirements of Sections 19-5-217 through 19-5-227 shall not apply where the board of supervisors dissolves a fire protection district and creates a fire protection grading district under this section. Except as otherwise provided herein, such board of supervisors or commissioners shall have no power, jurisdiction or authority to abolish, dissolve or terminate any district while the district has any outstanding indebtedness of any kind or character, unless arrangements are made for the assumption of any outstanding indebtedness by the subsequent district or by the county. If a fire protection district is dissolved in accordance with this subsection, the board of supervisors may continue to levy the same millage as was being levied within the boundaries of the previous fire protection district before its dissolution provided that a fire protection grading district is created, in accordance with Section 19-5-215 et seq.

Such districts then shall dissolve their respective boards of commissioners, transferring all records to the consolidated board of commissioners. A consolidated board of commissioners consisting of not less than five (5) members shall be appointed with equal representation from each participating district.

It shall be the duty of the tax collector of the county in which the district lies to collect such charges and pay the funds collected to the board of commissioners of the district for payment to interest and principal and to the retirement of bonds issued by the district in accord with the maturities schedule pertaining thereto.

     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t19c05s19-5-191ol11">
       Funds for debt service may be provided by charges assessed against the property abutting upon the sewer, or abutting upon the railroad and/or utility right-of-way, street, road, highway, easement or alley in which such sewer mains or water mains are installed according to the frontage thereof.
       <p>
        The board of commissioners of the district, after giving notice and hearing protests in the manner prescribed by Sections 21-41-5 and 21-41-7, Mississippi Code of 1972, shall by resolution spread upon its minutes define the services to be offered and the entire area to be benefited by each improvement; each such improvement may be designated as a project, or all such improvements may be designated as one project. However, if forty percent (40%) of the property owners or the owners of more than forty percent (40%) of the front footage of the property involved and actually residing on property owned by them and included within that part of any street, avenue, etc., ordered to be specially improved, or otherwise actually occupying property owned by them and included within that area designated as a project, shall file a protest, then the improvement shall not be made and the assessment shall not be made.
       </p>
       <p>
        The resolution shall direct that the cost to be assessed against each lot or parcel of land shall be determined by dividing the entire assessable cost of the project by the total number of front feet fronting on the street, easement or other right-of-way in which all of the mains embraced within the project are installed and multiplying the quotient by the total number of front feet in any particular lot or parcel of land fronting on the street, easement or other right-of-way in which sewer mains or water mains are installed. The result thereof shall be delivered by governing authorities of the district to the county board of supervisors as the amount of special tax to be assessed against each lot or piece of ground for the owner’s part of the total cost of the improvements.
       </p>
       <p>
        The resolution, at the discretion of the governing authorities of the district, may provide for the district to pay the assessment against any property abutting a sewer or water improvement, if the property whose assessment is being paid by the district is occupied by a contributor or consumer connected to the sewer or water system who is, or will be, paying service charges at the time the assessment roll maintained by the district is confirmed; provided, however, such payment shall not exceed an amount equal to that assessed against any one hundred twenty-five (125) feet of frontage of abutting property in a project.
       </p>
       <p>
        The resolution may, at the discretion of the governing authorities of the district, provide for the district to pay the assessment against any property abutting a section of sewer main or water main designated as necessary and essential to the overall operation of such system or systems; provided, however, no service shall be provided to any such abutting property until and unless all such payments made by the district are repaid to the district by the owners of such benefited property.

       <p>
        The resolution providing for assessments under the provisions of subsection (c)(2) of this section, at the discretion of the governing authorities of the district, may provide for the district to pay the assessment against any lot or parcel of ground not exceeding one (1) acre in size, if such property is occupied by a contributor or consumer connected to the sewer or water system who is, or will be, paying service charges at the time the assessment roll maintained by the district is confirmed.
       </p>
       <p>
        The resolution providing for assessment of benefited properties under this procedure shall provide for appropriate payment to debt service accounts by property owners not included in the original assessment roll but benefited by facilities installed with funds provided by such assessments at, or prior to, the time at which a nonassessed but benefited property is actually served by said facilities.

       A water district could not appropriately charge an impact fee to the owner of an apartment complex where the water district established all other rates and charges in 1985 and had not changed them up to the date of the trial in 1989, the water district had never charged another customer with an impact fee, the water district had adequate capacity to serve the apartment complex, and the water district established the fee (1) in the absence of a disparate classification of the apartment complex as a separate class of customer, (2) in the absence of an explanation of the fee’s purpose, and (3) in the absence of identification of any increased costs associated with the service provided to the apartment complex.

      Any area adjacent to any district created pursuant to Sections 19-5-151 through 19-5-207 and situated within the same county as the district, and not being situated within the corporate boundaries of any existing municipality, may be annexed to and become a part of such district by the same procedure prescribed in Sections 19-5-153 through 19-5-159 for the original creation of the district. All costs incident to the publication of notice and all other costs incident to the hearings, election and proceedings shall be paid by the district.

      The district shall have the exclusive right to provide any of the services for which it was created in the annexed territory; however, if any part of the annexed territory is then being served by another corporate agency with any such service, the district shall, at the option of the other corporate agency, either relinquish its prior right to serve the area occupied by the corporate agency or acquire by purchase the facilities of such corporate agency, together with its franchise rights to serve such area.

     </p>
     <p>
      an annual amount payable each year for a period of ten (10) years equal to the sum of twenty-five per cent (25%) of the revenues received from sales to consumers within the annexed area during the last twelve (12) months.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the option is for the district to purchase, upon notification thereof, the district shall be obligated to buy and pay for, and the corporate agency shall be obligated to convey to the district, all its service facilities and franchise rights in the annexed area, free and clear of all mortgage liens and encumbrances for the aforesaid cash consideration.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the annexed territory affects all of the properties and facilities of such other corporate agency, then all of such property constituting the entire system or facility of the corporate agency shall be acquired by the district in accordance with such terms and conditions as may be agreed upon, and the district shall have the authority to assume the operation of such entire system or facility and to assume and become liable for the payment of any notes, bonds or other obligations that are outstanding against said system or facility and payable from the revenues therefrom.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the district is notified to relinquish its prior right to serve the annexed area, the district shall grant the corporate agency a franchise to serve within the annexed territory; however, the corporate agency shall be entitled to serve only such customers or locations within the annexed area as it served on the date that such annexation became effective.

       Only process of changing fire protection grading district boundaries is by procedures outlined in Miss. Code Sections 19-5-215 et seq. Gildea, Mar. 12, 1993, A.G. Op. #93-0918.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only mechanism available for changing or modifying boundaries of a fire protection grading district are those set forth in Sections 19-5-215 et seq., and there are no provisions for “de-annexation” of territory in an existing fire protection grading district; however, a board of supervisors might want to consider abolishing a district and re-creating it with the desired boundaries.

       The Legislature finds and declares it to be in the public interest to reduce the time required for a citizen to request and receive emergency aid, and to raise the level of competence of local public safety and 911 telecommunicators by establishing a minimum standard of training and certification for personnel involved in the answering and dispatching of calls to law enforcement, fire and emergency medical services. The provision of a single, primary three-digit emergency number through which emergency services can be quickly and efficiently obtained will provide a significant contribution to law enforcement and other public service efforts by simplifying the notification of public service personnel. Such a simplified means of procuring emergency services will result in the saving of life, a reduction in the destruction of property, quicker apprehension of criminals and, ultimately, the saving of monies. Establishment of a uniform emergency number is a matter of concern and interest to all citizens of the state.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The emergency telephone system shall, when so authorized by a vote of a majority of the qualified electors of the county voting on the proposal in an election held for that purpose, be designed to have the capability of utilizing at least one (1) of the following three (3) methods in response to emergency calls:
     </p>
     <p>
      “District dispatch method,” which is a telephone service to a centralized dispatch center providing for the dispatch of an appropriate emergency service unit upon receipt of a telephone request for such services and a decision as to the proper action to be taken, including an E911 system.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Relay method,” which is a telephone service whereby pertinent information is noted by the recipient of a telephone request for emergency services and is relayed to appropriate public safety agencies or other providers of emergency services for dispatch of an emergency service unit.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Transfer method,” which is a telephone service which receives telephone requests for emergency services and directly transfers such requests to an appropriate public safety agency or other provider of emergency services.
     </p>
     <p>
      The board of commissioners shall select the method which it determines to be the most feasible for the county.

    Emergency telephone service charges; use of excess funds [Repealed effective July 1, 2021].

     </h3>
     <ol>
      <li id="t19c05s19-5-313ol11">
       The board of supervisors may levy an emergency telephone service charge in an amount not to exceed One Dollar ($1.00) per residential telephone subscriber line per month, One Dollar ($1.00) per Voice over Internet Protocol subscriber account per month, and Two Dollars ($2.00) per commercial telephone subscriber line per month for exchange telephone service. Any emergency telephone service charge shall have uniform application and shall be imposed throughout the entirety of the district to the greatest extent possible in conformity with availability of such service in any area of the district. Those districts which exist on the date of enactment of Chapter 539, Laws of 1993, shall convert to the following structure for service charge levy: If the current charge is five percent (5%) of the basic tariff service rate, the new collection shall be Eighty Cents ($.80) per month per residential subscriber line and One Dollar and Sixty Cents ($1.60) per month per commercial subscriber line. The collections may be adjusted as outlined in Chapter 539, Laws of 1993, and within the limits set forth herein.
      </li>
      <li id="t19c05s19-5-313ol12">
       If the proceeds generated by the emergency telephone service charge exceed the amount of monies necessary to fund the service, the board of supervisors may authorize such excess funds to be expended by the county and the municipalities in the counties to perform the duties and pay the costs relating to identifying roads, highways and streets, as provided by Section 65-7-143. The board of supervisors shall determine how the funds are to be distributed in the county and among municipalities in the county for paying the costs relating to identifying roads, highways and streets. The board of supervisors may temporarily reduce the service charge rate or temporarily suspend the service charge if the proceeds generated exceed the amount that is necessary to fund the service and/or to pay costs relating to identifying roads, highways and streets. Such excess funds may also be used in the development of county or district communications and paging systems when used primarily for the alerting and dispatching of public safety entities and for other administrative costs such as management personnel, maintenance personnel and related building and operational requirements. Such excess funds may be placed in a depreciation fund for emergency and obsolescence replacement of equipment necessary for the operation of the overall 911 emergency telephone and alerting systems.
      </li>
      <li id="t19c05s19-5-313ol13">
       No such service charge shall be imposed upon more than twenty-five (25) exchange access facilities or Voice over Internet Protocol lines per person per location. Trunks or service lines used to supply service to CMRS providers shall not have a service charge levied against them. Every billed service user shall be liable for any service charge imposed under this section until it has been paid to the service supplier. The duty of the service supplier to collect any such service charge shall commence upon the date of its implementation, which shall be specified in the resolution for the installation of such service. Any such emergency telephone service charge shall be added to and may be stated separately in the billing by the service supplier to the service user.
      </li>
      <li id="t19c05s19-5-313ol14">
       The service supplier shall have no obligation to take any legal action to enforce the collection of any emergency telephone service charge. However, the service supplier shall annually provide the board of supervisors and board of commissioners with a list of the amount uncollected, together with the names and addresses of those service users who carry a balance that can be determined by the service supplier to be nonpayment of such service charge. The service charge shall be collected at the same time as the tariff rate or, for nontariff services, at the time of payment, in accordance with the regular billing practice of the service supplier. Good faith compliance by the service supplier with this provision shall constitute a complete defense to any legal action or claim which may result from the service supplier’s determination of nonpayment and/or the identification of service users in connection therewith.
      </li>
      <li id="t19c05s19-5-313ol15">
       The amounts collected by the service supplier attributable to any emergency telephone service charge shall be due the county treasury monthly. The amount of service charge collected each month by the service supplier shall be remitted to the county no later than sixty (60) days after the close of the month. A return, in such form as the board of supervisors and the service supplier agree upon, shall be filed with the county, together with a remittance of the amount of service charge collected payable to the county. The service supplier shall maintain records of the amount of service charge collected for a period of at least two (2) years from date of collection. The board of supervisors and board of commissioners shall receive an annual audit of the service supplier’s books and records with respect to the collection and remittance of the service charge. From the gross receipts to be remitted to the county, the service supplier shall be entitled to retain as an administrative fee, an amount equal to one percent (1%) thereof. From and after March 10, 1987, the service charge is a county fee and is not subject to any sales, use, franchise, income, excise or any other tax, fee or assessment and shall not be considered revenue of the service supplier for any purpose.

      <li id="t19c05s19-5-313ol16">
       In order to provide additional funding for the district, the board of commissioners may receive federal, state, county or municipal funds, as well as funds from private sources, and may expend such funds for the purposes of Section 19-5-301 et seq.

       Levy authorized by Miss. Code Section 19-5-313 for emergency communications district requires approval of electorate; however, no provision suggests that levy cannot be lifted if board of supervisors determine such is in best interest of county; therefore, since board of supervisors may forego district altogether, and there appears to be no provision prohibiting dissolution of district, board of supervisors may resolve to abolish emergency communications district and levy. Downs, Apr. 28, 1993, A.G. Op. #93-0217.
      </p>
      <p>
       Miss. Code Section 19-5-313 authorizes board of supervisors to fund emergency telephone service by levying emergency telephone service charge; there is no statutory authority for board of commissioners to impose additional tariff upon city police department as condition for accessing police department to system. Ellis, May 4, 1993, A.G. Op. #93-0276.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pursuant to Miss. Code Section 19-5-313(6), city may, in its discretion, use general fund monies in support of Emergency 911 telephone service for city. Ellis, May 4, 1993, A.G. Op. #93-0276.
      </p>
      <p>
       Board of supervisors is authorized to fund emergency services district by levying emergency service charge under Miss. Code Section 19-5-313(1); in order to provide additional funding for district, board of commissioners may receive federal, state, county or municipal funds, as well as funds from private sources under Miss. Code Section 19-5-313(6); there is no statutory authority for emergency communications commission to charge privately-owned ambulance service for dispatching ambulances owned by the ambulance service, nor is there any statutory authority for emergency communications commission to charge fees to service providers who have access to Emergency-911 system. Brown, June 4, 1993, A.G. Op. #93-0364.
      </p>
      <p>
       Excess funds generated by the emergency telephone service charge may be used under the authority of Section 19-5-313(2) to fund the implementation of a computerized address location system which will primarily be used for alerting and dispatching public safety entities to the proper location. Haque, March 15, 1995, A.G. Op. #95-0093.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no provision authorizing the County E-911 Commission to purchase and hold title to land and buildings. However, excess E-911 funds may be used by the board of supervisors for the purposes set forth in Section 19-5-313. Austin, May 10, 1995, A.G. Op. #95-0250.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 19-5-313 provides for the dispensation of the revenues generated under the Act. The county board of supervisors has sole authority to direct the expenditure of any excess funds generated. Ellis, June 15, 1995, A.G. Op. #95-0046.
      </p>
      <p>
       The expenditure of the excess funds generated from the emergency telephone service charge would not be subject to approval of the board of commissioners. The expenditure of additional funding received by the board of commissioners from sources other than the emergency telephone service charge may be spent by the commissioners for E-911 purposes. See Section 19-5-313. Expenditure of these funds would require approval of the board of commissioners. Henderson, August 23, 1995, A.G. Op. #95-0578.
      </p>
      <p>
       Based on Section 19-5-313(2), if the proceeds generated by the emergency telephone service charge exceed the amount necessary to fund the E-911 service, the board of supervisors may authorize such excess funds to be expended for identifying roads, highways and streets. This would include the erection of signs and the maintenance of such signs. Everett, May 17, 1996, A.G. Op. #96-0315.
      </p>
      <p>
       Emergency telephone service charge funds may be expended on the salaries of E-911 operators. Walters, March 13, 1998, A.G. Op. #98-0139.
      </p>
      <p>
       Emergency communications districts must deposit all funds received in the county depository, but such districts may have their own accounts therein; thus, a county emergency communications district could have its own separate account in the country treasury and could handle its own funds, provided that security therefor was obtained by the Chancery Clerk pursuant to Section 27-105-315.

       The purchase of defibrillators for use at emergency scenes does not fit within the statutorily established uses for excess E-911 funds. Munn, Oct. 12, 2001, A.G. Op. #01-0645.
      </p>
      <p>
       A board of commissioners may not provide the district dispatch method for the sheriff’s department and a different method, relay or transfer, for the city emergency responders, such as police, fire, and ambulance services. Thomas, Apr. 26, 2002, A.G. Op. #02-0083.
      </p>
      <p>
       A municipality may not create its own E-911 system and directly receive the E-911 calls that originate within the municipal limits when the municipality is within an E-911 district. Thomas, Apr. 26, 2002, A.G. Op. #02-0083.
      </p>
      <p>
       An E-911 district is funded by telephone surcharges, and the governing authorities of a city in an E-911 district and the county in their discretion may provide additional funds; however, neither the county nor the city is obligated to provide additional funding beyond the telephone surcharge for an E-911 district. Thomas, Apr. 26, 2002, A.G. Op. #02-0083.
      </p>
      <p>
       When a board of commissioners is set up and equipment purchases are made for an E-911 program, the equipment becomes the property of the county rather than that of the board or municipality that is to use it. Peterson, May 10, 2002, A.G. Op. #02-0203.
      </p>
      <p>
       A nominal charge (approximately $5.00) cannot be imposed by an E-911 office as a prerequisite for obtaining utility services in the county. Trapp, Jr., May 17, 2002, A.G. Op. #02-0251.
      </p>
      <p>
       A county cannot obtain and sell to the public E-911 house number signs (to permit the efficient operation of the E-911 system). Trapp, Jr., May 17, 2002, A.G. Op. #02-0251.
      </p>
      <p>
       The board of commissioners for an E-911 district has no authority to acquire and hold real property; the only statutory authority to acquire and hold property under the E-911 scheme rests with the board of supervisors. Regan, Sept. 13, 2002, A.G. Op. #02-0537.
      </p>
      <p>
       Portion of E-911 funds used for the construction, maintenance, and repair of a building jointly occupied between E-911 services and other services may only relate to that portion of the building occupied by the E-911 services; the entire expense of a building which will also house other agencies may not be paid for with E-911 funds. Welch, Nov. 15, 2002, A.G. Op. #02-0654.
      </p>
      <p>
       Provided that the E-911 board of commissioners determined that the Road Naming and Addressing Officer is a part of management personnel, maintenance personnel or related to operational requirements, as stated in the statute, then that position may be paid from excess E-911 funds. Worthy, Nov. 15, 2002, A.G. Op. #02-0669.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the board of commissioners of an E-911 district determines that identifying and naming roads is necessary to assist the board in fulfilling its statutory mandate, then the board may pay the costs associated with this function. Thomas, Mar. 28, 2003, A.G. Op. #03-0005.
      </p>
      <p>
       The E-911 charge of $2.00 may be levied on each of two telephone lines of the location of the internet service provider. The E-911 district may give a refund to the internet service provider for any over charges for E-911 services in the past which can be documented and which are not barred by the statute of limitations. Clanton, Oct. 17, 2003, A.G. Op. 03-0380.
      </p>
      <p>
       The telephone service charge generated pursuant to subsection (1) of this section may not be used to purchase outdoor warning sirens. Souderes, Apr. 9, 2004, A.G. Op. 04-0122.
      </p>
      <p>
       Excess E-911 funds may only be used for the purposes set forth in Section 19-5-313(2). Carroll, Sept. 8, 2006, A.G. Op. 06-0390.

       From and after July 1, 1993, a service charge of Five Cents (5¢) shall be placed on each subscriber service line within the State of Mississippi. This service charge shall apply equally to both private and business lines and shall apply to all service suppliers operating within the State of Mississippi. This subscriber service charge level shall be reviewed periodically to determine if the service charge level is adequate or excessive, and adjustments may be made accordingly.
      </li>
      <li id="t19c05s19-5-357ol12">
       Every billed service user shall be liable for any service charge imposed under this section until it has been paid to the service supplier. The duty of the service supplier to collect any such service charge shall commence upon the date of its implementation. Any such minimum standards telephone service charge shall be added to, and may be stated separately in, the billing by the service supplier to the service user.
      </li>
      <li id="t19c05s19-5-357ol13">
       The service supplier shall have no obligation to take any legal action to enforce the collection of any emergency telephone service charge. However, the service supplier shall annually provide the Board of Emergency Telecommunications Standards and Training with a list of the amount uncollected, together with the names and addresses of those service users who carry a balance that can be determined by the service supplier to be nonpayment of such service charge. The service charge shall be collected at the same time as the tariff rate in accordance with the regular billing practice of the service supplier. Good faith compliance by the service supplier with this provision shall constitute a complete defense to any legal action which may result from the service supplier’s determination of nonpayment and/or the identification of service users in connection therewith.

A return, in such form as prescribed by the Department of Revenue, shall be filed with the Department of Revenue, together with a remittance of the amount of service charge collected payable to the special fund. The service supplier shall maintain records of the amount of service charge collected for a period of at least three (3) years from date of collection. From the gross receipts to be remitted to the special fund, the service supplier shall be entitled to retain as an administrative fee, an amount equal to one percent (1%) thereof. This service charge is a state fee and is not subject to any sales, use, franchise, income, excise or any other tax, fee or assessment, and shall not be considered revenue of the service supplier for any purpose. All administrative provisions of the Mississippi Sales Tax Law, including those which fix damages, penalties and interest for nonpayment of taxes and for noncompliance with the provisions of such chapter, and all other duties and requirements imposed upon taxpayers, shall apply to all persons liable for fees under the provisions of this chapter, and the Commissioner of Revenue shall exercise all the power and authority and perform all the duties with respect to taxpayers under this chapter as are provided in the Mississippi Sales Tax Law except where there is a conflict, then the provisions of this chapter shall control.

These funds shall be applied on a first-come first-served basis, which shall be determined by the date of application. All city, county and state public safety telecommunicators, including those employed by city and/or county supported ambulance services and districts, shall be eligible to receive these funds to meet minimum standards training requirements. No “for-profit” ambulance, security or fire service company operating in the private sector shall be qualified to receive these minimum standards training funds unless the company is on contract with a local government to provide primary emergency response. Law enforcement officers, fire and emergency medical personnel who are used as part-time or “fill-in” telecommunicators shall also be eligible to receive funding for this minimum standards training, provided they serve at least eight (8) hours per month as a telecommunicator. However, emergency medical personnel who are used as part-time or “fill-in” telecommunicators and are employed by any for-profit ambulance company operating in the private sector shall be eligible to receive funding for the minimum standards training, provided they serve at least twenty (20) hours per week as a telecommunicator.

       The Board of Emergency Telecommunications Standards and Training shall be authorized to reimburse any public safety agency or emergency medical service for meals, lodging, travel, course fees and salary during the time spent training, upon successful completion of such course. Funds may also be expended to train certain individuals to become certified instructors of the various courses included in these minimum standards in order to conduct training within the State of Mississippi.

       County Board of Supervisors may purchase amount of land necessary for purpose of operating county central maintenance shop for repair of county’s road equipment and various other county vehicles and for purpose of using land at same time as county barn for two of county’s road districts; whether ten (10) acres is required is question of fact. Downs, August 23, 1990, A.G. Op. #90-0602.
      </p>
      <p>
       Miss. Code Section 19-7-1 provides for acquisition of real estate by counties and for guidance as to where such office may be located; words “county facilities” includes offices for supervisors. McKenzie, Feb. 1, 1993, A.G. Op. #92-0982.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Board of Supervisors determine, consistent with fact, that additional public parking spaces are needed for county buildings and county business, Board may entertain lease of private property for such purposes. Gex Nov. 22, 1993, A.G. Op. #93-0733.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a determination is made by the board of supervisors that additional public parking is needed for the county courthouse, then the board may lease private property for such purposes. See section 19-3-40. Dickerson, March 2, 1995, A.G. Op. #95-0080.
      </p>
      <p>
       A beat system county board of supervisors may provide itself with offices at the county seat in the courthouse, but not elsewhere. In the individual districts, the board of supervisors may only establish stations for the working of public roads together with necessary buildings therefor. See Section 65-7-91. Greathree, April 26, 1996, A.G. Op. #96-0181.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 19-7-1 authorizing the board to purchase real estate for a courthouse and other governmental purposes would also allow a county to lease such buildings. If the work is not being performed by the county, it is not required to be contracted for by public bids. The county may not pay more than fair market value for the lease of the building. Gex, June 7, 1996, A.G. Op. #96-0305.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a board of supervisors finds that the business of the county requires the purchase of a building for office space for county employees, that a particular tract and building is suitable for the needs of the county, and that the purchase price therefor is at or below the fair market value thereof, such board of supervisors may then pursuant to section 19-3-40 utilize public funds to purchase and equip such building for usage as office space by county employees. Shaw, Dec. 19, 1997, A.G. Op. #97-0802.

       Quitman County may acquire property from a school district that it will in turn convey to an economic development district which will lease the property to a private assisted living facility because the conveyance will promote the general welfare goals of the statute. Scripper, March 20, 1998, A.G. Op. #98-0129.
      </p>
      <p>
       A county board of supervisors may only establish and construct a jail upon land owned by the county itself in fee simple, and may not establish and construct a jail upon land belonging to an economic development district even though the economic development district was created by and is a subdivision of the county. Smith, April 7, 2000, A.G. Op. #2000-1080.
      </p>
      <p>
       When a board of supervisors purchases real or personal property for the county’s use or for a department of the county, a deed for real property or a certificate of title or bill of sale for personal property should use
   language such as “[name of] County, a political subdivision of the State of Mississippi”, or some other such similar language.

       A board of supervisors has the authority to lease private property to locate a communications tower. The terms of the lease may provide for the county to maintain, work or construct such roads as are necessary or convenient to provide the county access to the leased premises. However, there is no authority for a county to maintain private roads that are not necessary for county purposes in exchange for consideration of any sort. Munn, Dec. 12, 2003, A.G. Op. 03-0623.

       Land which was never used for county purposes until purchased by county for purpose of immediate conveyance to the state for a state park, and which, after such conveyance to the state, was used by the county as contemplated in its purchase, did not “cease” to be used for county purposes within the meaning of this section, and consequently board of supervisors did not have express authority to convey to private party the oil and other minerals in part of such land, even though in the conveyance to the state the county had reserved to itself all the oil and other mineral rights in such lands.

       The board is authorized to advertise for bids for the purchase of trucks. Such bids may contain the provision to the effect that a trade in of an old truck, describing it, was desired. The highway department advertises for motor vehicles with or without trade ins and in this way it is free to accept any bid which it considers the lowest and best bid under the circumstances.

   A county board of supervisors has a duty under §§<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t19c03s19-3-41" target="_self">19-3-41</a></cite> and 43 to provide adequate court facilities for each county. Encompassed therein is the duty to provide a courtroom free of such noise as substantially interrupts court proceedings. If the legislative branch fails to furnish the absolute essentials required for the operation of an independent and effective court, then no court affected thereby should fail to act. County boards of supervisors are subject to appropriate court orders requiring them to furnish adequate courtroom facilities when they adamantly fail or refuse to do so. Hosford v.

    Counties conveying land for state park may lease retained mineral interests.

     <p>
      Any county which has acquired and conveyed or may hereafter acquire and convey any land for state park purposes and has retained or does retain the mineral rights thereunder may lease the same for oil, gas and other minerals either jointly or severally.
     </p>
     <p>
      Such lease or leases may be made only after legal advertisement for bids therefor have been published once a week for three consecutive weeks in some newspaper having a general circulation in the county. It shall be necessary to describe the property in the advertisement by its popular name and by giving a definite legal description by metes and bounds. Said lease, with the legal description of the property set out therein, shall be executed to the highest and best bidder therefore on all the tract involved and shall contain a provision therein that no part of the property involved in said lease shall be dropped during the lifetime of said lease, which shall not be for a longer period than ten years, unless production in commercial quantities results, and that if the delay rentals are not paid on all the property then said lease in its entirety shall become null and void. No lease shall become effective after its acceptance by the board of supervisors until the same shall have the written approval of the state mineral lease commission and the Mississippi Board of Park Examiners affixed thereto.
     </p>
     <p>
      From the proceeds arising from the execution of the original lease there shall be paid all cost of advertising herein required and other expenses necessary and incident to the execution thereof, and any balance then remaining on hand and accruing thereafter as a result of the rents, profits and income accruing from the lease shall be used, first, to build necessary bridges in the particular park property affected and, second, any balance then remaining on hand shall be used to call or pay any county-wide bonds now or hereafter outstanding and, third, if there be no outstanding county-wide bonds, then such balance shall be paid into the general funds of the county.
     </p>
     <p>
      Whenever production in commercial quantities is made on any property involved in such lease, the lessee shall not be required to pay delay rentals thereafter so long as such production continues.
     </p>
     <p>
      The proceeds to be paid to the county from the production of the oil, gas or other minerals shall be subject to all severance taxes imposed by law, just the same as if the county was an individual or corporation.
     </p>
     <p>
      The lessee shall be liable for all damages to property incurred by any operation in carrying out the terms of said lease.
     </p>
     <p>
      Nothing in this section shall in any way be construed to limit, abrogate, or otherwise restrict any right, title, or interest in the State of Mississippi.

       § 19-7-31.
    Law libraries.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The board of supervisors of each county in the state shall have power, by an appropriate order or orders on its minutes, to establish and maintain in the county courthouse or other suitable public building adjacent or near thereto, a public county law library under such rules, regulations and supervision as it may from time to time ordain and establish, and to that end, the board may accept gifts, grants, donations or bequests of money, furniture, fixtures, books, documents, maps, plats or other property suitable for that purpose.
     </p>
     <p>
      The board of supervisors shall have power to exchange or sell duplicate volumes or sets of any such books or furniture, and in case of sale, to invest the proceeds in other suitable books or furniture. The board may also purchase or lease from time to time additional books, furniture, or equipment for the public law library.
     </p>
     <p>
      For the purpose of providing suitable quarters for the public law library, the board of supervisors may, in its discretion, expend such sums as may be deemed necessary or proper for that purpose, and may also employ a suitable person as librarian and pay the law librarian such salary as the board, in its discretion, may determine. The board may employ additional librarians or other employees on either a part-time or full-time basis and may pay these additional employees as the board, in its discretion, may determine. The board of supervisors, in their discretion, may contract with the county or municipal library for any staff or facilities as they deem necessary for the overall management and operation of the county law library. The board of supervisors may contract with the State Law Library for law library services that may be offered by the State Law Library.
     </p>
     <p>
      In case the public law library is so established, all books, documents, furniture and other property then belonging to the county library, as provided for in Section 19-7-25, shall be transferred to and become part of the public law library, and all books, documents and publications donated by the state to the county library shall also become a part of the public law library. In that case, Sections 19-7-25 and 19-25-65, relating to the county library, shall be superseded in that county for as long as the public law library is maintained in the county.
     </p>
     <p>
      The board of supervisors of any such county, in its discretion, may levy, by way of resolution, additional court costs not exceeding Two Dollars and Fifty Cents ($2.50) per case for each case, both civil and criminal, filed in the chancery, circuit and county courts or any of these in the county, and may levy, by way of resolution, additional court costs not exceeding One Dollar and Fifty Cents ($1.50) per case for each case, both civil and criminal, filed in the justice courts of the county, for the support of the library authorized in the county. If the additional court costs authorized in this section are levied, the clerk or judge of those courts shall collect those costs for all cases filed in his court and forward same to the chancery clerk, who shall deposit the same in a special account in a county depository for support and maintenance of the library, and the chancery clerk shall be accountable for those funds. However, no such levy shall be made against any cause of action the purpose of which is to commit any person with mental illness, alcoholic or narcotic addict to any institution for custodial or medical care, and no such tax shall be collected under this subsection on any cause of action that the proper clerk handling same deems to be in its very nature charitable and in which cause the clerk has not collected his own legal fees.
     </p>
     <p>
      To accomplish the purposes of this section, the board of supervisors may enter into such arrangement or arrangements with the county bar association of any such county as may seem advisable for the care and operation of the law library, and the board may receive and consider, from time to time, such recommendations as the bar association may deem appropriate regarding the library.
     </p>
     <p>
      The board of supervisors of each county in which there are two (2) judicial districts, in its discretion, may maintain a law library in each judicial district. In those counties the board, in its discretion, may pay from the county general fund or from the special fund authorized in this section all the costs authorized in this section, provided that the board shall not spend in each judicial district less than the amount of the special court costs authorized in this section and collected in each such district.
     </p>
     <p>
      The governing authorities of any municipality, in their discretion, by resolution duly adopted and entered on their official minutes, may levy additional court costs not exceeding One Dollar and Fifty Cents ($1.50) per case for each conviction in the municipal court of the municipality, for the support and maintenance of the county law library in the county within which the municipality is located. The additional costs shall be collected by the clerk of the court, forwarded to the chancery clerk of the county for deposit in a special account in the county depository, and expended for support and maintenance of the county law library in the same manner and in accordance with the same procedure as provided for costs similarly collected in the chancery, circuit, county and justice courts of the county.

      However, any county in the state which shall have experienced washed-out or collapsed bridges on the public roads of the county for any cause or reason may hereafter issue bonds for bridge purposes as now authorized by law in an amount which, when added to the then outstanding general obligation bonds of such county, shall not exceed either (a) twenty percent (20%) of the assessed value of the taxable property within such county according to the last completed assessment for taxation or (b) fifteen percent (15%) of the assessment upon which taxes were levied for its fiscal year ending September 30, 1984, whichever is greater.
     </p>
     <p>
      Provided further, in computing such indebtedness, there may be deducted all bonds or other evidences of indebtedness heretofore or hereafter issued, for the construction of hospitals, ports or other capital improvements which are payable primarily from the net revenue to be generated from such hospital, port or other capital improvement, which revenue shall be pledged to the retirement of such bonds or other evidences of indebtedness, together with the full faith and credit of the county. However, in no case shall any county contract any indebtedness payable in whole or in part from proceeds of ad valorem taxes which, when added to all of the outstanding general obligation indebtedness, both bonded and floating, shall exceed either (a) twenty percent (20%) of the assessed value of all taxable property within such county according to the last completed assessment for taxation, or (b) fifteen percent (15%) of the assessment upon which taxes were levied for its fiscal year ending September 30, 1984, whichever is greater. Nothing herein contained shall be construed to apply to contract obligations in any form heretofore or hereafter incurred by any county which are subject to annual appropriations therefor, or to bonds heretofore or hereafter issued by any county for school purposes, or to bonds issued by any county under the provisions of Sections 57-1-1 through 57-1-51, or to any indebtedness incurred under Section 55-23-8, or to bonds issued under Section 57-75-37 or to any other indebtedness incurred under 57-75-37(4).

       The preamble to Laws, 1989, ch. 499, effective from and after October 1, 1989, provides as follows:
      </p>
      <p>
       “WHEREAS, the Mississippi Department of Natural Resources (DNR), pursuant to the requirements of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act and amendments thereto, has placed numerous municipalities within the state under administrative orders to construct, replace, renovate or improve wastewater treatment and collection facilities which shall comply with the minimum standards under the federal law; and
      </p>
      <p>
       “WHEREAS, many municipalities have initiated projects funded through a combination of federal, state and local funds made available through a revolving loan fund administered by the Department of Natural Resources; and
      </p>
      <p>
       “WHEREAS, the refunds in the revolving loan fund have either been exhausted or encumbered and no such funds are currently available to the numerous municipalities that have not initiated projects to comply with the federal law; and
      </p>
      <p>
       “WHEREAS, failure to comply with the deadlines mandated by the DNR administrative orders, which deadlines are generally in 1991, could result in severe monetary fines and penalties imposed under the federal law; and
      </p>
      <p>
       “WHEREAS, the Legislature feels that this specific situation is of an emergency nature and that an immediate, viable and economical funding mechanism is necessary to allow affected municipalities to issue bonds without regard to the statutory debt limitation for compliance purposes;”

    Notice of intention to issue bonds; calling of election.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Before issuing any bonds for any of the purposes enumerated in Sections 19-9-1, 19-9-3, the board of supervisors shall adopt a resolution declaring its intention so to do, stating the amount of bonds proposed to be issued and the purpose for which the bonds are to be issued, and the date upon which the board proposes to direct the issuance of such bonds. Such resolution shall be published once a week for at least three consecutive weeks in at least one newspaper published in such county. The first publication of such resolution shall be made not less than twenty-one days prior to the date fixed in such resolution for the issuance of the bonds, and the last publication shall be made not more than seven days prior to such date. If no newspaper be published in such county, then such notice shall be given by publishing the resolution for the required time in some newspaper having a general circulation in such county and, in addition, by posting a copy of such resolution for at least twenty-one days next preceding the date fixed therein at three public places in such county. If twenty per cent (20%), or fifteen hundred (1500), whichever is less, of the qualified electors of the county, supervisors district, or road district, as the case may be, shall file a written protest against the issuance of such bonds on or before the date specified in such resolution, then an election on the question of the issuance of such bonds shall be called and held as is provided in Sections 19-9-13, 19-9-15. If no such protest be filed, then such bonds may be issued without an election on the question of the issuance thereof, at any time within a period of two years after the date specified in the above mentioned resolution. However, the board of supervisors, in its discretion, may nevertheless call an election on such question, in which event it shall not be necessary to publish the resolution declaring its intention to issue such bonds as herein provided.

       Validation proceedings are the exclusive remedy for raising objections in connection with the issuance and sale of bonds, except those which could be or should be raised before the board of supervisors or municipal authorities, and such objections cannot be properly raised in a suit for an injunction. Chambers v. Perry, 183 So. 2d 645, 1966 Miss. LEXIS 1432 (Miss. 1966).

       The choice given by this provision between calling a bond election in the first instance, and publishing notice of intention to issue bonds, does not imply a similar choice in the case of bonds issued under Code 1942, § 7129-51. In re Validation of $500,000 Public Improv.General Obligation Bonds, 247 Miss. 448, 152 So. 2d 698, 1963 Miss. LEXIS 315 (Miss. 1963).

       Where, owing to the withdrawal of names, a protest which must be filed on or before a specified date lacks the requisite number of signers, such number cannot be made up by the filing of protests subsequent to that date, while the sufficiency of the protest is being investigated.

       In determining whether required number of qualified electors had petitioned for election to determine whether county board bonds should be issued, the board of supervisors acts judicially. Coleman v. Thompson, 216 Miss. 867, 63 So. 2d 533, 1953 Miss. LEXIS 708 (Miss. 1953).

       Persons who have signed a petition calling for election to determine whether county road bonds should be issued and the petition has been filed with the board of supervisors, have the right to take their names off at any time before final action by the board.

       § 19-9-19.
    Maturities, interest, and signatures.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      All bonds issued by a county shall mature annually, with all maturities not longer than twenty (20) years, with not less than one-fiftieth (1/50) of the total issue to mature each year during the first five (5) years of the life of such bonds, not less than one-twenty-fifth (1/25) of the total issue to mature each year during the succeeding ten-year period of the life of such bonds, and the remainder to be amortized, as to principal and interest, into approximately equal annual payments, one (1) payment to mature each year for the remaining life of such bonds. However, in cases where bonds shall be issued or dated subsequent to the date fixed for making the county tax levy in the year in which such bonds are to be issued, the first maturity date of not less than one-fiftieth (1/50) of the total issue, may be fixed for any period not exceeding two (2) years from the date of the bonds with the same schedule of subsequent maturities as hereinabove set forth. Such bonds shall not bear a greater overall maximum interest rate to maturity than that allowed in Section 75-17-101, Mississippi Code of 1972. No bond shall bear more than one (1) rate of interest; each bond shall bear interest from its date to its stated maturity date at the interest rate specified in the bid; all bonds of the same maturity shall bear the same rate of interest from date to maturity; all interest accruing on such bonds so issued shall be payable semiannually or annually, except that the first interest coupon attached to any such bond may be for any period not exceeding one (1) year.
     </p>
     <p>
      No interest payment shall be evidenced by more than one (1) coupon and neither cancelled nor supplemental coupons shall be permitted; the lowest interest rate specified for any bonds issued shall not be less than seventy percent (70%) of the highest interest rate specified for the same bond issue. The interest rate of any one (1) interest coupon shall not exceed the maximum interest rate allowed on such bonds.
     </p>
     <p>
      Each interest rate specified in any bid must be in multiples of one-eighth of one percent (1/8 of 1%) or in multiples of one-tenth of one percent (1/10 of 1%), and a zero rate of interest cannot be named. The denomination, form, and place, or places, of payment of such bonds shall be fixed in the resolution or order of the board of supervisors issuing such bonds. Such bonds shall be executed by the manual or facsimile signature of the president of the board of supervisors, or the vice president in the absence or disability of the president, and countersigned by the manual or facsimile signature of the clerk thereof, with the official seal of the county affixed thereto. At least one (1) signature on each bond shall be a manual signature, as specified in the issuing resolution. The coupons may bear only the facsimile signatures of such president, or vice president and clerk. No bonds shall be issued and sold under the provisions of sections 19-9-1 to 19-9-31 for less than par and accrued interest.

      The proceeds of any bonds issued by a county shall be placed in the county treasury or depository, if there be one, as a special fund, and shall be used for no other purpose than that for which such bonds were authorized to be issued. If the board of supervisors of such county, or any member thereof, or any other officer, shall wilfully divert or aid or assist in diverting any such fund, or any part thereof, to any purpose other than that for which such bonds were authorized to be issued, then such person shall be guilty of a felony and, upon conviction, shall be punished by imprisonment in the state penitentiary for a term not exceeding five years and, in addition, he shall be liable personally and on his official bond for the amount so diverted. Any member of such board of supervisors may escape the penalty provided for above by requesting and having his vote recorded in the negative on any illegal diversion of the proceeds of such bonds.

       § 19-9-27.
    Borrowing in anticipation of taxes.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The board of supervisors of any county may borrow money in anticipation of taxes for the purpose of defraying the expenses of such county, and may issue negotiable notes of the county therefor, to mature not later than April 1 of the year succeeding the year in which they are issued. The amount of money herein authorized to be borrowed shall not be in excess of twenty-five percent (25%) of the estimated amount of taxes collected and to be collected under the last preceding annual tax levies for the particular fund for which said money is borrowed. The board of supervisors may borrow said money, as hereinbefore provided, from any available fund in the county treasury, or from any other source, and such loan shall be repaid in the manner herein provided. The notes herein authorized shall bear interest at a rate to be fixed by the board, not to exceed that allowed in Section 75-17-105, Mississippi Code of 1972, and such notes shall be payable at any place to be named by the board of supervisors. Any notes or obligations issued in excess of the amount authorized to be issued under the provisions of this section shall be void. Money may be borrowed in anticipation of ad valorem taxes under the provisions of this section, regardless of whether or not such borrowing shall create an indebtedness in excess of statutory limitations.
     </p>
     <p>
      For the payment of such loan, the board of supervisors shall either pledge the levy of a special tax each year sufficient to pay the amount borrowed for use that year, with interest, or shall pledge that such notes shall be paid out of the first money collected from taxes for the year in which they are issued. The aforesaid special tax, if necessary, may be in excess of the rate of taxation otherwise limited by law. The notes herein authorized shall not be issued until the board of supervisors shall have published notice of its intention to issue same; said notice to be published once each week for three (3) weeks in some newspaper having a general circulation in such county, but not less than twenty-one (21) days, nor more than sixty (60) days, intervening between the time of the first notice and the meeting at which said board proposes to issue such notes. If, within the time of giving notice, twenty percent (20%), of fifteen hundred (1500), whichever is less, of the qualified electors of the county shall protest or file a petition against the issuance of such notes, then such notes shall not be issued unless authorized by a three-fifths (3/5) majority of the qualified electors of such county, voting at an election to be called and held for that purpose.

       Board of supervisors did not exceed statutory limits in obtaining a tax anticipation note because it was not required to borrow only from estimated ad valorem taxes, and the borrowing in anticipation of tax statute was broad enough to allow counties to borrow against total anticipated ad valorem tax revenues from the preceding annual tax levy. Moreover, an in pari materia argument was unavailing in light of testimony that the numbers utilized by the board were based on the total ad valorem revenues in the general operating fund from the preceding annual tax levies.

     <ol>
      <li id="t19c09s19-9-28ol11">
       Any county that shall have received a binding commitment from the United States of America, or any agency thereof, or the State of Mississippi, or any agency thereof, for a grant or loan may borrow money in anticipation or receipt of funds from such confirmed grant or loan unless prohibited by federal or state law or by the terms of the agreement concerning such grant or loan and may assign and pledge as security for such interim financing the proceeds of any such grant or loan. The board of supervisors may borrow said money, as hereinbefore provided, from any available fund in the county treasury, excepting the funds or accounts described in Sections 27-39-323 and 27-39-329(2)(b), or may borrow said money from any other source, and such loan shall be repaid from the first available federal funds received by the county in the manner and subject to the same terms as herein provided.
      </li>
      <li id="t19c09s19-9-28ol12">
       Such interim financing shall be upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed upon by the issuing county and the party advancing such interim funds or the purchaser of the obligations evidencing such indebtedness; provided, however, that the principal on any such loan, including interfund loans, shall be repaid within a reasonable time after receipt of funds from the United States of America, or from the State of Mississippi, or any agency thereof, the anticipation of which gave rise to said interim financing, and provided that the interest rate on such interim financing shall not exceed that allowed in Section 75-17-107, Mississippi Code of 1972.
      </li>
      <li id="t19c09s19-9-28ol13">
       In borrowing money under the provisions hereof, it shall not be necessary to publish notice of intention so to do or to secure the consent of the qualified electors, either by election or otherwise. Such borrowing may be authorized by resolution of the board of supervisors of the issuing county and may be evidenced by a negotiable note or notes in such form as may be prescribed in such resolution. The indebtedness incurred under this section shall not be considered when computing any limitation of indebtedness of the issuing county established by law.
      </li>
      <li id="t19c09s19-9-28ol14">
       Such borrowing, whether or not evidenced by a negotiable note or notes, may be placed or sold at public or private sale for such price and in such manner and from time to time as may be determined by the issuing county and the issuing county may pay all expenses, premiums and commissions which its board of supervisors may deem necessary or advantageous in connection with the issuance thereof.
      </li>
      <li id="t19c09s19-9-28ol15">
       Such borrowing shall be limited to the sum of: (a) the amount of the confirmed grant or loan; (b) the amount of interest payable on such interim financing; and (c) the reasonable cost of incurring such indebtedness or issuing the note or notes evidencing such indebtedness. All moneys borrowed under the authority of this section, including any interfund loans, shall be secured by and repaid from the grant or loan proceeds, earnings on the investment of the grant or loan proceeds and the proceeds of the interim financing, and from any other proceeds, revenues or earnings received by the issuing county in connection with such grant or loan or with the interim financing, and may be further secured by and repaid from available revenues of a county-owned utility.
      </li>
      <li id="t19c09s19-9-28ol16">
       In the event grant or loan proceeds pledged to the repayment of the interim financing have not been received in time to pay at maturity all or a portion of the principal of and interest on the indebtedness incurred pursuant to this section, the issuing county may borrow additional moneys pursuant to this section in anticipation of the aforesaid grant or loan proceeds in order to pay at maturity the outstanding principal and interest on the indebtedness previously incurred, provided that the indebtedness originally incurred shall be promptly repaid upon receipt of proceeds of such subsequent borrowings. The issuing county may enter into agreements with one or more lenders obligating such lenders to provide such additional financing upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed upon by the issuing county and the lenders.

       This section, without reference to any other statute, when dealing with grant or loan anticipation notes, shall be deemed to be full and complete authority for the borrowing of such funds and the issuance of a note or notes to evidence such indebtedness, and shall be construed as an additional and alternative method therefor, and none of the present restrictions, requirements, conditions or limitations of law applicable to the issuance or sale of bonds, notes or other obligations by the issuing county in this state shall apply to the borrowing of funds under this section, and no proceedings shall be required for the borrowing of such funds other than registration and those provided for and required herein, and all powers necessary to be exercised in order to carry out the provisions of this section are hereby conferred.

       § 19-9-29.
    Investment of surplus funds.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Whenever any county shall have on hand any bond and interest funds, any funds derived from the sale of bonds, special funds, or any other funds in excess of the sums which will be required to meet the current needs and demands of no more than seven (7) business days, the board of supervisors of such county shall invest such excess funds in the following manner:
     </p>
     <p>
      Such excess funds shall be invested for periods of from fourteen (14) days to one (1) year in interest-bearing time certificates of deposit with or through county depositories serving in accordance with Section 27-105-303 which are willing to accept the same, at a negotiated rate of interest. The negotiated rate of interest shall be at the highest rate possible at the date of purchase or investment for such time certificates of deposit or interest-bearing accounts, but such rate of interest shall not be less than the rate of interest paid to the general public on passbook savings. The rate of interest established herein shall be the minimum rate of interest and there shall be no maximum rate of interest.
     </p>
     <p>
      The balance, if any, of such excess funds shall be invested in interest-bearing time certificates of deposit for the same maturity periods and at the same rate of interest as prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section in or through state depositories located in such county which are willing to accept the same, to the same extent as such depositories are eligible for invested state funds.
     </p>
     <p>
      To the extent that the board of supervisors finds that such excess funds cannot be invested pursuant to paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section for the stated maturity of from fourteen (14) days to one (1) year, the board of supervisors may invest such funds in any bonds or other direct obligations of the United States of America, the State of Mississippi, or any county, municipality or school district of this state, if such county, municipal or school district bonds have been approved by a reputable bond attorney or have been validated by a decree of the chancery court, or the board of supervisors may invest such funds, together with any other funds required for current operation, in obligations issued or guaranteed in full as to principal and interest by the United States of America which are subject to a repurchase agreement with a county or state depository, or the board of supervisors may deposit such funds in interest-bearing accounts with a county or state depository. Such bonds or obligations purchased may have any maturity date, provided that they shall mature or be redeemable prior to the time that the funds so invested will be needed for expenditure.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any excess funds invested in certificates of deposit or interest-bearing accounts with county or state depositories under this section shall be secured in the manner required by Section 27-105-315. The proceeds of such certificates of deposit shall be immediately reinvested on the date of maturity in accordance with paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this section, unless the board of supervisors determines that such funds are required for current operation.
     </p>
     <p>
      When bonds or other obligations have been purchased, the same may be sold or surrendered for redemption at any time, except certificates of deposit which must mature, by order or resolution of such board of supervisors. The president of the board of supervisors, when authorized by such order or resolution, shall have the power and authority to execute all instruments and take such other action as may be necessary to effectuate the sale or redemption thereof. When such bonds or other obligations are sold or redeemed, the proceeds thereof, including accrued interest thereon, shall be paid into the same fund as that from which the investment was made and shall in all respects be dealt with as are other monies in such fund. Except as hereinafter provided, any interest derived from the investments authorized in this section may, as an alternative, be deposited into the general fund of the county. Any interest derived from the investment of sums received under the terms of the federal State and Local Fiscal Assistance Act of 1972, and any subsequent revisions or reenactments of that act, shall be paid into the same fund as that from which the investment was made. Any interest derived from the investment of school bond funds shall be handled as provided in Section 37-59-43. Any interest derived from investment of other bond proceeds or from investment of any bond and interest fund, bond reserve fund or bond redemption sinking fund shall be deposited either in the same fund from which the investment was made or in the bond and interest fund established for payment of the principal or interest on the bonds. Any interest derived from special purpose funds which are outside the function of general county government shall be paid into that special purpose fund.

       Funds being dedicated to the defeasance of general obligation bonds may be invested for times extending beyond one year pursuant to Section 19-9-29(c), if the board of supervisors finds that they cannot be invested for a period of fourteen days to one year under the arrangements made for the defeasance of the bonds.

       The members of the Board of Commissioners of the Delta Correctional Facility Authority may only receive such compensation, including per diem compensation, as is permitted by the Board of Supervisors of Leflore County; no duty is imposed upon the Chencery Clerk of Leflore County to insure that DCFA receives interest upon its funds upon deposit, nor is a duty imposed upon a financial institution to pay interest upon public funds when the governing authorities have not insured that the account containing public funds is interest bearing; and the duty insure that securities are pledged for deposited funds of DCFA is upon the board of supervisors, or the president and clerk of the board of supervisors in case the board is not in session. Abraham, January 23, 1998, A.G. Op. #98-0021.

       Section 19-9-29 is a general law specifying the manner of investing and the types of investments into which surplus county funds may be placed, and, therefore, Section 19-3-40 does not permit boards of supervisors to invest otherwise. Griffith, April 7, 2000, A.G. Op. #2000-0173.

      The board of supervisors of each and every county of the state shall at all times keep within the sum named in its said budget and within the annual revenue, always seeking to lessen expenditure instead of exceeding revenue and budget estimates. The amount appropriated and authorized to be expended for any item contained in such budget must not exceed the amount actually estimated for such item, and the total amount appropriated and authorized to be expended from any fund, except for capital outlay, election expenses and payment of emergency warrants and interest thereon, or for extraordinary court expenses, shall not exceed the total amount actually estimated for all purposes. The total expenditures authorized to be made from any fund shall exclude reserves added thereto, and the total shall not, in any event, exceed the aggregate of the cash balance, excluding reserves, in such funds at the close of the fiscal year immediately preceding, plus the amount of estimated revenues to accrue to such fund, as determined and fixed in the manner herein provided, and the amount which may be raised for such fund by a lawful tax levy during the current fiscal year.

       When it shall appear to the board of supervisors that collection of anticipated revenues from taxation and/or other sources for any fund or funds of any county will be more than the amounts estimated, or when it appears that such revenues will be less than estimated, the board of supervisors may revise the budget of expenses at any regular meeting during the fiscal year by increasing or decreasing the items of said budget in proportion to the increase or decrease in the anticipated revenue collections and/or other sources of funds. When it shall appear to the board of supervisors that some item of the budget is in excess of the requirements of said item, and that the amount budgeted to such item will not be needed during the fiscal year, the board may, at any regular meeting, transfer funds to and from items within the budget when and where needed, but no such transfer shall be made from fund to fund, or from item to item, which will result in the expenditure of any money for a purpose different from that for which the tax was levied.

       This section [Code 1942, § 9118-15] was enacted to prevent the depletion of the road funds by outgoing members of the board of supervisors during the last few months of their terms of office. Board of Sup'rs v. Parks, 220 Miss. 403, 71 So. 2d 197, 1954 Miss. LEXIS 455 (Miss. 1954).

       A county is not liable for public work done under the authority of a single member of the board, for under this section [Code 1942, § 2924] all contracts for such work must be made by the board as a board in open session and be evidenced by entries on its minutes.

       Where the statute required the approval of the county board of supervisors of construction contracts entered into by a county port commission, neither the port commission nor the county would be liable for the payment of the cost of contract changes and additions which had not been approved by the supervisors in the manner required by law.

       Advertisement stating that county would receive bids for road machinery, for two weeks in two issues of newspaper only, was a violation of statute requiring three weeks’ advertisement, and under the provision of this section [Code 1942, § 2924] declaring all contracts made in violation of law void, the contract for such road machinery was void.

     <p>
      [For contracts executed prior to July 1, 1984, the following provisions apply:]
     </p>
     <p>
      The board of supervisors shall never make a payment to any contractor for building or repairing a bridge, or for doing any work on a public road, public building or other public work, where the contract price exceeds Two Hundred Dollars ($200.00) but is less than One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00), without first having the same inspected and accepted by a committee, and having the certificate of the committee, under oath filed and entered on the minutes of the board. Such committee shall be appointed by the board of supervisors for that purpose and shall consist of at least two (2) members of the board of other districts than the one in which the work is done. The board shall not be bound by the acceptance of the committee, and shall never pay for the work in such cases until the specifications therefor are complied with and the work completed. In all cases of public work let by the board of supervisors where the contract price exceeds One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00), the board may contract so as to provide for making partial payments to the contractor therefor as the work progresses. In no case shall the retained amount of such partial payments be less than two and one-half percent (2 1/2 %) nor more than ten percent (10%) of the value of the work done and material used in the performance of the contracts, such value to be estimated by some competent person employed by the board to superintend such work, and not until the superintendent shall furnish to the board such estimate, in writing, on his oath as to the correctness of such estimate, which estimate, with the oath annexed thereto, shall be filed with and recorded in the minutes of the board; provided, however, the amount retained by the prime contractor from each payment due the subcontractor shall not exceed the percentage withheld by the board of supervisors from the prime contractors. Before such person employed by the board shall enter upon the discharge of the duty of supervising such work, and before he shall furnish any estimate as to the value of the work done, he shall enter into bond in such penalty as may be fixed by the board, with sufficient sureties, to be approved by the board, and conditioned for the faithful performance of his duties as superintendent of such work, which bond shall be filed and preserved by the board, and shall be liable to suit thereon in the name of the county, for any misfeasance or malfeasance on the part of such superintendent touching the performance of his duties. The board shall not be bound by the estimate of such superintendent, nor shall the making of any partial payments on any public work, as above provided, be construed as an acceptance of the work and materials so inspected by such superintendent. The board shall not make the final payment on any such works or building without first having the same inspected as a whole and accepted by a committee of the board, as hereinbefore provided, and until the specifications are complied with and the work completed.

    Purchase of road equipment.

     </h3>
     <p>
      [With regard to any county that is exempt from the provisions of Section 19-2-3, this section shall read as follows:]
     </p>
     <p>
      A board of supervisors purchasing tractors, trucks and other machinery or equipment for constructing, reconstructing and maintaining the public roads shall not pay, or agree or contract to pay, more therefor than the then prevailing manufacturer’s retail list price at the factory, plus freight and sales tax, any federal excise tax, and a reasonable service and assembly charge. The board may provide for the payment of all or any portion of such price over the useful life of the property as determined according to the most recent asset depreciation range (ADR) guidelines for the Class Life Asset Depreciation Range System established by the Internal Revenue Service pursuant to the United States Internal Revenue Code and regulations thereunder or comparable depreciation guidelines with respect to any equipment not covered by ADR guidelines; provided, however, that no installment contract described in this sentence may be executed by the board during the last year of the board’s term of office. All such deferred payments shall be represented by notes of the county, or a separate road district or supervisors district thereof, as the case may be, to be dated at or after the time of delivery of the machinery, bearing interest at a rate not exceeding that allowed in Section 75-17-105, from date until paid, and payable to the seller of the machinery, or the purchaser of the notes, out of the road fund of the county or district. All such notes for any purchase shall be payable on the fifteenth day of June or the fifteenth day of December, the first to be payable not more than one (1) year after date. Said notes shall be signed by the president of the board, and countersigned by the clerk thereof, under the seal of the county. Said notes may be validated in the manner provided by law, and may be delivered to the seller of the machinery, or to any person who will purchase the same at a lower rate of interest than said seller is willing to accept, or at a like rate of interest plus a premium, any money received from a sale of such notes to be applied to the payment of the balance due on said machinery, and any surplus to be paid into the road fund of the county or district, as the case may be. On the first business day of each month in which any such note matures, the clerk shall docket the principal amount of such note, with interest thereon to maturity, as a claim against the county, in favor of the last known holder of such note, and the board shall allow the same at its regular meeting held that month without further presentation, proof or demand, to be paid as other claims in its proper order.

      In all advertisements for bids for road machinery or equipment under this section, the board of supervisors shall insert in such advertisements a statement as to whether or not the road machinery or equipment purchased is to be paid for in cash, or is to be purchased upon installment payments as authorized herein. All indebtedness incurred under the provisions hereof may be incurred by the board without the necessity of calling an election thereon, receiving a petition therefor, or giving notice of the intention of the board to incur such indebtedness. However, no indebtedness shall be hereafter incurred under the provisions of this section which, when added to the amount of notes incurred hereunder which are then outstanding shall require the use in the retirement of such notes in any one (1) year of more than fifty percent (50%) of the amount available to the county, separate road district, or supervisors district, as the case may be, for the maintenance of roads and bridges for the preceding fiscal year. The amount available for the maintenance of roads and bridges shall be deemed to be the sum of the amounts produced by the county’s or district’s share of the state gasoline and motor vehicle privilege license tax, less that amount required by law to be set aside for the payment of bonds, together with the amount produced by the road and/or bridge ad valorem tax levy for such county or district, as the case may be. Nothing herein, however, shall be construed to invalidate any indebtedness previously incurred and now outstanding.

      When any county, separate road district, or supervisors district has heretofore incurred, or shall hereafter incur an indebtedness under the provisions of this section for the purchase of road machinery or equipment, it shall be the duty of the chancery clerk of such county to deduct each month from the distribution of the state gasoline tax which would otherwise be paid to such county or district (but not from the amount required by law to be set aside for the payment of bonds) a proportionate amount of the sum which will be due as the principal of and interest upon the next installment to be paid on such indebtedness, it being the intention of this section to provide that if the indebtedness be payable in semiannual installments then there shall be set aside each month out of said distribution of state gasoline tax one-sixth ( 1/6) of the amount which will be necessary to pay the principal of and any interest upon the next installment to become due, and that a like method of computation shall be followed in all cases in determining the amount to be so set aside. All amounts so deducted under the provisions of this section shall be kept in a separate fund of the county, separate road district, or supervisors district, as the case may be, and shall be expended for no other purpose than the payment of the principal and interest of said indebtedness until the same be paid. Should said separate fund so created not be sufficient for the payment of the next maturing installment of principal and interest when the same becomes due, there shall be transferred thereto from the road and bridge fund such amount as will make the separate fund sufficient for the purpose.

      If any person, firm, corporation or association, or any agent or employee thereof, shall willfully claim and receive any amount from any county, separate road district, or supervisors district, as the purchase price of, or as any installment upon the purchase price of, any road machinery or equipment where the provisions of this section have not been complied with, or if any member of the board of supervisors shall knowingly vote for the payment of any unauthorized claim for the purchase price, or any installment upon the purchase price, of any road machinery or equipment, then such person, firm, corporation, association or member of the board of supervisors, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction, shall be punished by a fine not exceeding double the amount of such unauthorized claim, or by imprisonment in the county jail for not more than six (6) months, or by both such fine and imprisonment.

       A seller of road equipment to the county was not entitled to the statutory damages where an appeal by the county was unsuccessful in absence of a statute that would make the county liable for such damages. Covington County v. Mississippi Road Supply Co., 59 So. 2d 325 (Miss. 1952).

      <p>
       A county could not deny liability for the purchase price of road machinery purchased by it for a supervisor’s district, on the ground that the supervisor’s district became insolvent, where the county offered no proof to show that the obligations of the supervisor’s district at date of purchase exceeded the anticipated revenue, but where the proof showed that the district had sufficient funds to have paid for the road machinery in question. Covington County v. Mississippi Road Supply Co., 213 Miss. 583, 57 So. 2d 318, 1952 Miss. LEXIS 400 (Miss.), modified, 59 So. 2d 325 (Miss. 1952).

       A county is in no position to contend after having used road machinery for approximately one year and a half, that it had then become secondhand machinery and that the machinery had become in a bad state of repair. Covington County v. Mississippi Road Supply Co., 213 Miss. 583, 57 So. 2d 318, 1952 Miss. LEXIS 400 (Miss.), modified, 59 So. 2d 325 (Miss. 1952).

       Issuance of a note by county to pay for road machinery was not invalid because the note was an attempt to create an interest bearing debt in violation of Code 1942 § 4320, as amended by ch. 473, Laws of 1946, because no election was held, inasmuch as the statute authorizing the purchase did not require election as condition precedent to issuance of interest bearing note for a purchase price.

      [With regard to any county that is required to operate on a countywide system of road administration as described in Section 19-2-3, this section shall read as follows:]
     </p>
     <p>
      A board of supervisors purchasing tractors, trucks and other machinery or equipment for constructing, reconstructing and maintaining the public roads may provide for the payment of all or any portion of the price thereof over the useful life of the property as determined according to the most recent asset depreciation range (ADR) guidelines for the Class Life Asset Depreciation Range System established by the Internal Revenue Service pursuant to the United States Internal Revenue Code and regulations thereunder or comparable depreciation guidelines with respect to any equipment not covered by ADR guidelines; provided, however, that no installment contract described in this sentence may be executed by the board during the last year of the board’s term of office. All such deferred payments shall be represented by notes of the county, to be dated at or after the time of delivery of the machinery, bearing interest at a rate not exceeding that allowed in Section 75-17-105, from date until paid, and payable to the seller of the machinery, or the purchaser of the notes, out of the road fund of the county. All such notes for any purchase shall be payable on June 15 or December 15, the first to be payable not more than one (1) year after date. Said notes shall be signed by the president of the board, and countersigned by the clerk thereof, under the seal of the county. Said notes may be validated in the manner provided by law, and may be delivered to the seller of the machinery, or to any person who will purchase the same at a lower rate of interest than said seller is willing to accept, or at a like rate of interest plus a premium, any money received from a sale of such notes to be applied to the payment of the balance due on said machinery, and any surplus to be paid into the road fund of the county. On the first business day of each month in which any such note matures, the clerk shall docket the principal amount of such note, with interest thereon to maturity, as a claim against the county, in favor of the last known holder of such note, and the board shall allow the same at its regular meeting held that month without further presentation, proof or demand, to be paid as other claims in its proper order.

       In an action by mechanic’s administrator for repairs made to road machinery of the county, where the repairs were necessary and the charges were reasonable, the administrator was entitled to the entire amount of his claim. Carroll County v. Shook, 216 Miss. 232, 62 So. 2d 311, 1953 Miss. LEXIS 628 (Miss. 1953).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section [Code 1942, § 2939] was intended to authorize the repair of road machinery owned by the county or any district thereof, and the employment “at any time” of the labor necessary for that purpose, and to purchase the repair parts needed therefor.

       The amount charged by a repairman for labor done and performed and parts furnished and the repair of road machinery is subject to the approval of board of supervisors as to whether the charges are reasonable before the claim shall be made.

       It is permissible under this section [Code 1942, § 2939] that a county or a supervisor’s district which owns road machinery and equipment may have the same repaired by employing labor for that purpose, and the law does not require that the employment of labor for repair work on road machinery shall be on competitive bids, following the usual advertisement of an intention to have such property repaired for use, or forbid a contract with a repairman until at the next meeting of the board.

     <p>
      All claims filed for allowance by a board of supervisors which are based upon a sale or sales of any personal property shall be sufficiently itemized to show in detail the kind, quantity and price of the articles sold. Claims covering the sale of lumber shall be itemized so as to show in detail the grade or grades thereof, the amount of each different size of lumber covered by said invoice or statement, together with the total number of feet of each different grade and size, and the price per thousand feet at which it is sold, stated separately for each different grade and size. Each itemized invoice or statement so filed shall be accompanied by either (1) a receipt, in like detail, properly dated, and signed by a public officer, agent or employee authorized to accept delivery of such property, or, (2) a bill of lading or shipping receipt issued by a common carrier making delivery of such property, the rules of which carrier require a receipt to be given by the consignee on delivery, or (3) an affidavit of the seller, his agent or employee, showing how, where, when, and to whom delivery of such property was made. Where an affidavit is filed as proof of delivery, if delivery was by mail, the affidavit must have attached thereto a post office registry or insurance receipt, and if delivery was made by car, truck, or other public or private conveyance or means, the affidavit must state the name and address of the party actually making the delivery, and the make and license number of any car or truck used therein, as well as the other matters above required. The person so mailing or making actual delivery of such property shall, for the purpose of making such affidavit only, be considered an agent or employee of the seller. It is expressly provided, however, that no claim not first filed with the clerk of the board of supervisors shall be allowed until the seller has filed such claim in accordance with the requirements of this section.

      The clerk of the board of supervisors shall be supplied with, and shall keep as a record of his office, a book to be styled “The Docket of Claims,” in which he shall enter monthly all demands, claims and accounts against the county presented to him during the month. The docket shall provide spaces for the name of the claimant, the number of the claim, the amount of the claim, and on what account. All demands, claims and accounts filed against the county shall be preserved by the clerk as a permanent record, and numbered to correspond with the warrants to be issued therefor, if allowed. Immediately upon being notified of any judgment being rendered against the county, the clerk shall docket the same as a claim for allowance and payment as provided by law. Any claimant who has filed a claim with the clerk of the board of supervisors in the manner provided in Section 19-13-25 whose said claim is not allowed because of the failure of such clerk to keep the docket of claims as herein required, shall be entitled to recover the amount of such claim from such clerk on his official bond. Failure of the clerk to keep the docket of claims as herein required shall render such clerk liable to the county in the amount of Five Hundred Dollars ($500.00), and the Auditor of Public Accounts, upon information to the effect that such claims docket has not been kept, shall proceed immediately against such clerk for the collection of said penalty.

When conclusive proof has been made or submitted to the board and there is no evidence of contributory negligence on the part of the owner and the board is satisfied that the said owner has suffered such loss, then the board of supervisors shall pay to such owner out of the general county funds, such amount as will compensate him for his loss or damage. If the board of supervisors shall refuse to pay such claims, or any part of them, the owner shall have the right of action against the county where such damage occurred.

Such payments shall be made from the county road and bridge funds.

   Although §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t19c13s19-13-51" target="_self">19-13-51</a></cite> partially abrogates the sovereign immunity of the board of supervisors of any county in its capacity as “overseer” of the roads, ferries and bridges within its jurisdiction, a county board’s qualified immunity remains intact for discretionary decisions of the board as a whole with regard to the general condition and state of maintenance of county roads and bridges.

       Individual member of county board of supervisors is not liable for motorist’s personal injuries and damages proximately caused by an accident resulting from allegedly negligent maintenance and repair of a county road. State use of Brazeale v. Lewis, 498 So. 2d 321, 1986 Miss. LEXIS 2752 (Miss. 1986), overruled,

State use of Brazeale v. Lewis, 498 So. 2d 321, 1986 Miss. LEXIS 2752 (Miss. 1986), overruled,

      <p>
       In making the determination as to which roads within his district should be the better maintained would be a discretionary matter with the individual member of the county board of supervisors and, absent some personal tort committed by him, he would be immune from liability for damages caused by alleged negligence in the maintenance of the roads.

    Preservation of essential public records of county governments; admissibility in evidence of copies of original records.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The Legislature declares that records containing information essential to the operation of government and to the protection of the rights and interests of persons should be protected against the destructive effect of all forms of disaster whether fire, flood, storm, earthquake, explosion or other disaster, and whether such occurrence is caused by an act of nature or man, including an enemy of the United States. It is, therefore, necessary to adopt special provisions for the preservation of essential records of counties, and this section shall be liberally construed to effect its purposes. However, it is the express intention of this section that the provisions herein contained are not mandatory but are permissive only and shall authorize preservation of records as herein contemplated within the discretion of the governing authorities of the counties of the state and in accordance with a records control schedule approved by the Local Government Records Committee as provided in Section 25-60-1.
     </p>
     <p>
      The board of supervisors of any county is hereby authorized and empowered in its discretion to preserve essential records, or any portion thereof, of the county deemed by the board of supervisors to be an essential record necessary to the operation of government in an emergency created by disaster or containing information necessary to protect the rights and interests of persons or to establish and affirm the powers and duties of governments in the resumption of operations after the destruction or damage of the original records.
     </p>
     <p>
      The board of supervisors of any county is authorized and empowered in its discretion to make and enter into contracts and agreements with any person, firm or corporation to make and prepare copies or duplicates of records, and, subject to the standards established by the Department of Archives and History, to provide for and enter into contracts concerning the safekeeping and preservation of copies or duplicates at points of storage at a location approved by the Local Government Records Committee.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the event that the original record or records shall have been destroyed, the copy or reproduction shall be deemed to be an original record for all purposes and shall be treated as an original record in all courts or administrative agencies for the purpose of its admissibility in evidence. An enlargement or facsimile of a reproduction is likewise admissible in evidence if the original reproduction is in existence and available for inspection under direction of court.
     </p>
     <p>
      The board of supervisors of any such county is authorized and empowered, in its discretion, to appropriate and expend monies out of the available funds of the county for the purposes of this section.

       § 19-15-3.
    Reproduction of certain county records; destruction of originals.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Whenever any county records, documents, files or papers whatsoever are required by law to be preserved and retained, or which are necessary or desirable to be preserved or retained, the board of supervisors of the county shall have the power and authority, in its discretion, to destroy or dispose of any records, documents, files or papers after having reproductions made thereof as hereinafter provided and in accordance with a records control schedule approved by the Local Government Records Committee as provided in Section 25-60-1.
     </p>
     <p>
      Whenever the board of supervisors of any county shall desire to destroy or dispose of any records, documents, files or papers, the board shall first cause the same to be reproduced under standards established by the Department of Archives and History using microfilm, microfiche, data processing, computers, magnetic tape, optical discs or other medium. If the county where records and the like are to be destroyed or disposed of does not have or own the necessary equipment to reproduce same, the board of supervisors shall be authorized and empowered to enter into a contract for the reproduction thereof, which contract may be for a period of not more than twelve (12) months from the date thereof. The contract shall be awarded to the lowest and best bidder after the board of supervisors shall have advertised its intentions of awarding such contract by publication of a notice thereof once each week for at least three (3) consecutive weeks in some newspaper published or having a general circulation in such county.
     </p>
     <p>
      After reproduction of the records and the like shall have been made, the board of supervisors shall have the power and authority to destroy and dispose of the originals thereof after spreading upon its minutes certification that the reproductions are true and correct copies and disposal is in accordance with a records control schedule approved by the Local Government Records Committee as provided in Section 25-60-1; the reproductions shall thereafter be preserved, retained and stored by the board of supervisors as a record of the county, and provision shall be made for preserving, examining and using them. Any reproductions or copy of any original record or other documents shall be deemed to be the original record for all purposes and shall be admissible as evidence in all courts or administrative agencies. A facsimile, exemplification or certified copy thereof shall, for all purposes set forth herein, be deemed to be a transcript, exemplification or certified copy of the original record.
     </p>
     <p>
      The board of supervisors of any county is hereby authorized to pay all expenses incurred in reproducing records and the like and in making provision for the preservation, retention and storage of the reproductions from the general fund of the county.
     </p>
     <p>
      When any of the records and the like of which reproductions are made under the provisions of this section are declared by law or are by their nature confidential and privileged records, then the reproduction thereof shall likewise be deemed to be confidential and privileged to the same extent as the original records and the like.
     </p>
     <p>
      Nothing herein shall be construed to require the keeping and preservation of any records and documents which are not required by law or a records control schedule to be kept and preserved, or which it is not desirable or necessary to keep and preserve, and in all cases where records and the like are authorized by law to be destroyed or disposed of, they may be disposed of as authorized by a records control schedule approved by the Local Government Records Committee as provided in Section 25-60-1.

       It is not necessary to file with the clerk plans and specifications of an abstract of title to land in the county before purchasing same or contracting therefor as such contracts do not come within the purview of Code 1906, § 320.

       In ordering an abstract of titles prepared or in purchasing same, it is not necessary for the minutes of the board to recite that in the opinion of the board the interests of the county would be subserved thereby.

       Under the provisions of this section [Code 1942, § 2902], as amended, and Code 1906, and § 320 the board of supervisors is authorized to provide an abstract of title to lands in the county and cause it to be kept up to date at all times, and in such case chancery clerks may charge abstract fees.

       A constable has no official obligation to accompany a citizen to retrieve personal property unless a complaint has been filed with a court of competent jurisdiction and the court has ordered the constable to accompany the citizen; however, a constable has the duty to keep the peace and may at any time respond to a breach or attempted breach of the peace; a constable may, therefore accompany the citizen as a service, but without a court order, the constable has no official obligation prior to a confrontation occurring.

       Based on Sections 25-7-27(e) and 19-19-7, a constable has a duty to attend both the criminal and civil cases in justice court in his district. However, a constable may be compensated with a per diem as provided under Section 25-3-69 when the constable serves as a bailiff in civil cases only. No similar provision exists that would provide compensation to the constable for serving as bailiff in a criminal case. Thompson, September 6, 1996, A.G. Op. #96-0606.
      </p>
      <p>
       A constable should attend justice court; however, the constable should only serve as bailiff for justice court if ordered to do so by the justice court judge since justice court judges may choose whom they wish to serve as bailiff of their court, which may include a constable from another district within the county or a deputy sheriff if the sheriff, with permission of the judge, assigns such a deputy to bailiff duty.

   County attorney may not represent in any way, shape, form, or fashion any person or firm which has been, is or may potentially be subject to investigation for wrongdoing; only advice county attorney may ethically give such person is to get another lawyer. County attorney who accepts employment in civil matter which attorney knows involves issues and parties that will likely later become subject of criminal proceeding will be publicly reprimanded and be required to pay costs of disciplinary proceeding.

       Mere change of venue does not terminate the duty of a prosecutor; thus in a prosecution for murder, the trial court properly overruled defendants’ objection to the participation of a district attorney from the Ninth Judicial District, where the indictment was returned against defendants in the Ninth District but where venue was changed to the Fourteenth District on defendants’ motion.

       A circuit judge acting unilaterally in ex parte fashion without notice to the district attorney and without request of the grand jury lacked authority to bar the district attorney or his associates from a grand jury hearing which investigated a report that the district attorney had failed to investigate and prosecute certain crimes.

       Where, during the course of a homicide trial, the district attorney became ill and unable to continue with the prosecution of the case, appointment of a county prosecuting attorney, who had assisted in the trial from the beginning, to continue the trial, was not error, such appointment being not only authorized by law but the logical and appropriate thing to be done under the circumstances.

   The statutory scheme embodied in Code 1942, §§ 1202, 1803, 1832, 1839, 2435, 2535, and 3915 clearly embraces sufficient safeguards for fair jury trial in justice of the peace courts, composed of a fair cross-section of the citizens of the community, completely without regard to race or sex, and the justice must conform his judgment to the verdict of such a jury.

     <p>
      A person shall not be eligible to the office of sheriff who shall, at the time of the election, be a defaulter to the state, or any county or municipality thereof, or to the United States. Any person who is not a qualified elector, or who denies the existence of a Supreme Being, shall not be eligible to said office. A sheriff shall be eligible to immediately succeed himself in office.
     </p>
     <p>
      Prior to taking the oath of office and entering into the performance of the duties and obligations of sheriff, or as soon after his election as possible, each sheriff-elect, excluding those who have previously served as sheriff, or have had at least five (5) years’ experience as a full-time enforcement officer, or have previously successfully completed a course of training at the Mississippi Law Enforcement Officers’ Academy or the Jackson Police Academy, shall, at the expense of the county, attend and complete an appropriate curriculum in the field of law enforcement at the Mississippi Law Enforcement Officers’ Academy. Any sheriff exempted from attendance because of previous service as sheriff or having five (5) years’ full-time law enforcement experience must have served as sheriff or obtained such experience within a period of ten (10) years prior to the date of his taking the oath of office. Any sheriff exempted from attendance because of successful completion of a course of training at either of the aforementioned academies must have completed such course within five (5) years prior to the date of his taking the oath of office. No sheriff, excluding those specified as being exempt from the initial course in this section, shall until he has attended said Academy be entitled to payment of salary after the first one (1) year in office if he fails to attend said academy as herein provided within one (1) year after his taking office. All sheriffs shall, on a periodic basis, attend additional advanced courses in law enforcement in order that they will be properly informed and trained in the modern, technical advances of law enforcement.
     </p>
     <p>
      Prior to July 1, 1973, or as soon thereafter as permitted by vacancies at the Mississippi Law Enforcement Officers’ Academy, either the sheriff or one (1) deputy sheriff in each county having two (2) or more full-time deputies shall, at the expense of the county, attend and complete an appropriate curriculum in the field of narcotics and dangerous drugs at the Mississippi Law Enforcement Officers’ Academy. In the event that a new sheriff is elected who has not previously received such training or at least one (1) of his deputies has not previously received such training, or if for any other reason neither the sheriff nor any of the deputy sheriffs in a county shall have received such training, then the sheriff shall promptly notify the director of the Mississippi Law Enforcement Officers’ Academy and either the sheriff or a deputy sheriff, as soon thereafter as permitted by vacancies at the academy, shall, at the expense of the county, attend and complete an appropriate curriculum in the field of narcotics and dangerous drugs.

       Coroner is not inherently and independently clothed with powers of peace officers generally or of a sheriff specifically. Millwood v. State, 198 Miss. 485, 23 So. 2d 496, 1945 Miss. LEXIS 219 (Miss. 1945).
      </p>
      <p>
       Coroner per se is not a peace officer, but only performs the functions of a peace officer under certain conditions, and then only those of a displaced sheriff for a temporary period under the conditions set out in this section [Code 1942, § 3906].

      </p>
      <p>
       In determining when a coroner may lawfully execute a search warrant for the search and seizure of intoxicating liquor, this section [Code 1942, § 3906], prescribing occasions on which a coroner may perform the duties of a sheriff, must be read in connection with statute (Code 1942, § 2614) pertaining to issuance of search warrants for search and seizure of intoxicating liquor.

      </p>
      <p>
       A search warrant for the search and seizure of intoxicating liquor may properly be delivered to the coroner where the warrant is addressed to a sheriff who falls within any of the disqualifications and exceptions listed in this section [Code 1942, § 3906], but in dealing with the writ the coroner performs the functions of the sheriff and not those of the coroner.

       § 19-25-13.
    Budgeting and financing of sheriffs’ departments.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The sheriff shall, at the July meeting of the board of supervisors, submit a budget of estimated expenses of his office for the ensuing fiscal year beginning October 1 in such form as shall be prescribed by the Director of the State Department of Audit. The board shall examine this proposed budget and determine the amount to be expended by the sheriff in the performance of his duties for the fiscal year and may increase or reduce that amount as it deems necessary and proper.
     </p>
     <p>
      The budget shall include amounts for compensating the deputies and other employees of the sheriff’s office, for insurance providing protection for the sheriff and his deputies in case of disability, death and other similar coverage, for travel and transportation expenses of the sheriff and deputies, for feeding prisoners and inmates of the county jail, and for any other expenses that may be incurred in the performance of the duties of the office of sheriff. In addition, the budget shall include amounts for the payment of premiums on bonds and insurance for the sheriff and his deputies which, in the opinion of the board of supervisors, are deemed necessary to protect the interests of the county or the sheriff and his deputies. The amounts may include official bonds and any bonds required of his deputies by the sheriff; liability insurance; insurance against false arrest charges; insurance against false imprisonment charges; theft, fire and other hazards insurance; and hospitalization insurance as provided for in Sections 25-15-101 and 25-15-103. The board may authorize the reimbursement of the sheriff and deputies for the use of privately owned automobiles or other motor vehicles in the performance of official duties at the rate provided by law for state officers and employees, or may authorize the purchase by the sheriff of such motor vehicles and such equipment as may be needed for operation of the sheriff’s office, the vehicles and equipment to be owned by the county. In counties that have elected to purchase the motor vehicles and the equipment for the operation of the sheriff’s office, if a sheriff or deputy shall be required in the performance of his official duties, in the event of an emergency, to use his privately owned automobile or other motor vehicle, the board of supervisors may, in its discretion, authorize the reimbursement for that use at the rate per mile provided by law for state officers and employees. This shall not be construed as giving an officer a choice of whether to use his own or the county’s vehicle, but shall be construed so as not to penalize an officer who must use his own vehicle because the county’s vehicle was not available.
     </p>
     <p>
      The board of supervisors, in its discretion, may include in its annual budget for the sheriff’s office an amount not to exceed One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00), which may be expended by the sheriff to provide food, water and beverages for the sheriff, the sheriff’s deputies, state, national and local law enforcement officers, emergency personnel, county employees and members of the general public who the sheriff requests to assist him and his office while in the performance of search and rescue missions, disasters or other emergency operations.
     </p>
     <p>
      The board of supervisors may acquire one or more credit cards that may be used by the sheriff and his deputies to pay expenses incurred by them when traveling in or out of state in the performance of their official duties. The chancery clerk or county purchase clerk shall maintain complete records of all credit card numbers and all receipts and other documents relating to the use of those credit cards. The sheriff shall furnish receipts for the use of the credit cards each month to the chancery clerk or purchase clerk who shall submit a written report monthly to the board of supervisors, which report shall include an itemized list of all expenditures and use of the credit cards for the month, and the expenditures may be allowed for payment by the county in the same manner as other items on the claims docket. The issuance of a credit card to a sheriff or his deputy under the provisions of this section shall not be construed to authorize the sheriff or deputy sheriff to use the credit card to make any expenditure that is not otherwise authorized by law.
     </p>
     <p>
      The board of supervisors is hereby authorized and empowered, in its discretion, to appropriate and pay a sum not to exceed One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00) annually as a clothing allowance to each plainclothes investigator employed by the sheriff’s office of that county. The board of supervisors of any county bordering on the Gulf of Mexico and having a population of more than thirty-one thousand seven hundred (31,700) but less than thirty-one thousand eight hundred (31,800) according to the 1990 Federal Census may appropriate and pay a sum not to exceed One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00) annually as a clothing allowance to the administrator of the county jail.
     </p>
     <p>
      The board of supervisors shall, at its first meeting of each quarter beginning on October 1, January 1, April 1 and July 1, appropriate a lump sum for the sheriff for the expenses of his office during the current quarter. The quarterly appropriation shall be one-fourth (1/4) of the amount approved in the annual budget unless the sheriff requests a different amount. Except in case of emergency, as provided in the county budget law, the appropriation for the quarter beginning in October of the last year of the sheriff’s term shall not exceed one-fourth (1/4) of the annual budget.
     </p>
     <p>
      The sheriff shall file a report of all expenses of his office incurred during the preceding month with the board of supervisors for approval at its regular monthly meeting in a form to be prescribed by the Director of the State Department of Audit, and upon filing thereof, and approval by the board, the clerk of the board shall issue warrants in payment thereof but not to exceed the budget appropriation for that quarter. Any appropriated funds that are unexpended at the end of the fiscal year shall remain in the county general fund.
     </p>
     <p>
      The budget for the sheriff’s office may be revised at any regular meeting by the board of supervisors. Upon recommendation of the sheriff, the board may at any regular meeting make supplemental appropriations to the sheriff’s office.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any fees previously required to be paid by a sheriff shall be paid by the board of supervisors by including the estimates therefor in the sheriff’s budget. All fees and charges for services heretofore collected by sheriffs shall be collected by the sheriff and paid monthly into the general fund of the concerned county. However, any fees heretofore collected by those sheriffs from the county shall not be paid.

   This section mandates sheriffs to include liability insurance expenses in their budgets, but does not require a board of supervisors to obtain that liability insurance for the sheriff; pursuant to §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t19c07s19-7-8" target="_self">19-7-8</a></cite> [repealed], a board of supervisors has discretion to obtain liability insurance. Thus, in a personal injury action arising out of a collision with an auto driven by sheriff’s deputy, plaintiff could not recover from the individual members of a board of supervisors on the basis that they had a duty to obtain liability insurance covering the vehicles in the sheriff’s office, since that duty was discretionary, not mandatory, and since approval of the sheriff’s budget did not impose a ministerial duty upon the board to obtain such insurance.

The appointment, with the certificate of the oath, shall be filed and preserved in the office of the clerk of the board of supervisors. All sheriffs shall be liable for the acts of their deputies, and for money collected by them. The circuit court, after a notice and a hearing, shall have power to remove such deputies and also bailiffs, upon a showing that the public interest will be served thereby. Each deputy sheriff shall be at least twenty-one (21) years of age, a qualified elector of the State of Mississippi, and shall not have been convicted of a felony. Prior to appointing any person a deputy sheriff, the sheriff shall determine that the proposed appointee is of good moral character and is capable of fairly and impartially enforcing the law of the State of Mississippi.

       Sheriff’s deputy who has been convicted of felony does not possess qualification to hold office of deputy sheriff under Miss. Code Section 19-25-19 which requires that each deputy sheriff “shall not have been convicted of a felony”; where individual is convicted, but conviction is later reversed on appeal, there is no legal authority or responsibility for county to pay compensatory damages in form of back pay. Griffith, Apr. 14, 1993, A.G. Op. #93-0178.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under Miss. Code Section 19-25-19, local governing authorities may enter into employment contracts and adopt work schedule policies providing for time-and-half pay for their employees. Pope, Apr. 14, 1993, A.G. Op. #93-0069.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under state law an individual serving as constable would not be required to resign or take a leave of absence from his employment as a deputy sheriff. However, a deputy sheriff serves at the pleasure of the sheriff and can be removed by the sheriff at pleasure. Malone, January 23, 1995, A.G. Op. #95-0017.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are no statutory provisions in the Mississippi Code which set an age restriction for either a jailer or a dispatcher, and there is no requirement that a jailer or dispatcher be a deputy sheriff. However, the Board of Emergency Telecommunications Standards and Training has implemented a regulation requiring all dispatchers to be at least eighteen years old. See Section 19-25-19. Tullos, February 7, 1996, A.G. Op. #96-0018.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under Section 19-25-35 and 19-25-19, a sheriff has ultimate authority over a deputy appointed by him, even if that deputy is assigned as a bailiff. The sheriff has the authority to transfer or terminate a deputy at will. Best, March 29, 1996, A.G. Op. #96-0166.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under Section 19-25-19, a deputy who is serving as bailiff may be removed from office at will by the sheriff or may be removed from office by a circuit judge after notice and a hearing, if the public interest will be served. There is no statutory provision that gives the court the authority to “veto” or invalidate a sheriff’s decision to transfer a deputy serving as bailiff. Best, March 29, 1996, A.G. Op. #96-0166.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 45-5-9 only applies to “extra deputies” and not to regularly appointed, full-time deputies as set forth in Section 19-25-19. McWilliams, June 21, 1996, A.G. Op. #96-0376.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regular deputies appointed under Section 19-25-19 do not need to post bond unless required to do so by the sheriff under Section 19-25-13. With the exception of the bond requirements of Section 19-25-13, only those deputies appointed under Section 45-5-9 and designated as “extra deputies” are statutorily mandated to be bonded. McWilliams, June 21, 1996, A.G. Op. #96-0376.
      </p>
      <p>
       The statute allows a sheriff to hire a deputy sheriff to perform specific duties, i.e. service of process.
   Simmons, August 28, 1998, A.G. Op. #98-0505.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is the sheriff’s duty to appoint bailiffs, subject to the power of the board of supervisors should he fail in this regard, and subject to the power of the court to appoint riding bailiffs and to remove bailiffs for cause.
   Evans, November 25, 1998, A.G. Op. #98-0687.
      </p>
      <p>
       Notwithstanding the statute, Chapter 802 of Local and Private Laws of the State of Mississippi, 1990, allows the Civil Service Commission established for the Hancock County Sheriff’s Office to make rules and regulations with regard to the appointment, discharge, or retention of full-time deputy sheriffs and, as such, the sheriff-elect is bound to follow those rules and regulations. Peterson, Dec. 3, 1999, A.G. Op. #99-0650.
      </p>
      <p>
       Insofar as Chapter 802 of Local and Private Laws of the State of Mississippi, 1990, is in direct conflict or specifically provides for an alternative outcome, the statute is superseded; however, portions of the statute that are not affected by the local and private legislation remain in force. Peterson, Dec. 3, 1999, A.G. Op. #99-0650.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any individual who is not certified, meeting the standards as set by the Board on Law Enforcement Officers Standards and Training, may not serve as a law enforcement officer or part-time law enforcement officer.
   Byrd, Dec. 17, 1999, A.G. Op. #99-0665.
      </p>
      <p>
       A sheriff has discretion to set the compensation of his deputies, which may include a supplement based on the number of warrants served, subject to the budget for the sheriff’s office approved by the county board of supervisors. Carter, Oct. 6, 2000, A.G. Op. #2000-0576.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is incumbent upon a sheriff to ensure that any person appointed by him to be a deputy sheriff meets the statutory requirements; the Board on Law Enforcement Officers Standards and Training should also be consulted with regard to any requirements that must be met before the deputy may be certified as a law enforcement officer. Page, Mar. 21, 2003, A.G. Op. #03-0087.
      </p>
      <p>
       A sheriff has exclusive authority and control over his employees and this authority includes hiring, firing, disciplinary rules and regulations as well as other general operations of his office. Tolar, Mar. 28, 2003, A.G. Op. #03-0046.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only way to ensure that all members of a multi-jurisdictional drug task force have full law enforcement authority in the entire area encompassed by the agreement is for each participating sheriff to deputize any agents of the task force that do not currently possess independent law enforcement authority in that county. Stephens, Feb. 27, 2004, A.G. Op. 04-0074.
      </p>
      <p>
       A sheriff could appoint the county animal control officer to be a deputy for the purpose of handling any situation regarding a rabid or vicious animal. However, that if such officer is declared a deputy sheriff, she would be an agent of the sheriff and the sheriff would be responsible for her actions. Jewell, Aug. 20, 2004, A.G. Op. 04-0290.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only officials who have the authority to assign work to deputy sheriffs are the sheriff himself and any officers subordinate to the sheriff to whom the sheriff has specifically delegated the authority to make work assignments to the employees of the sheriff’s office. Simmons,

       Sheriff, rather than a circuit court, was to make hiring, firing, and compensation changes affecting bailiffs, as bailiffs were deputies of the sheriff. A circuit court order and order and opinion stating that bailiffs fell under the authority of the judiciary rather than the sheriff were void in part to the extent that they directly violated the Mississippi Constitution and statutory law. Lewis v. Hinds County Circuit Court, 158 So.3d 1117, 2015 Miss. LEXIS 102 (Miss. 2015).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Dismissal of the employee’s action after he was terminated was proper because it was determined that the sheriff was the person who in fact terminated the employee; thus, the employee’s contention that the commander terminated him in violation of Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t19c25s19-25-19" target="_self">19-25-19</a></cite> was without merit. Clanton v. DeSoto County Sheriff's Dep't, 963 So. 2d 560, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 30 (Miss. Ct. App. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   In a prosecution for simple assault upon a law enforcement officer, the trial court did not err in finding that the victim was a “law enforcement officer” acting within the scope of his duties at the time of the offense, even though he had not attended the law enforcement training academy as required by §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.45.html#t45c06s45-6-3ol1c" target="_blank">45-6-3(c)</a></cite>, since he was a “de jure deputy sheriff” where he was appointed by the sheriff pursuant to §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t19c25s19-25-19" target="_self">19-25-19</a></cite> to act as a jailer, and he was wearing a signed identification card and a uniform at the time of the offense. Amerson v. State, 648 So. 2d 58, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 596 (Miss. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       No reversible error was found in trial judge excluding testimony directed toward identity of person who actually served summons; one acting generally as deputy sheriff, under written appointment from sheriff, although not having qualified according to law, is de facto officer and between third parties his actions are valid; and, in absence of proof to contrary, it is presumed that person whose name was appended to return on writ as special deputy was duly authorized as such. Pointer v. Huffman, 509 So. 2d 870, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2583 (Miss. 1987).

      </p>

       A suit may be maintained against a surety bond of a sheriff in an action separate from a suit in tort against the sheriff. United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co. v. State, 254 Miss. 812, 182 So. 2d 919, 1966 Miss. LEXIS 1578 (Miss. 1966).
      </p>
      <p>
       Removal of deputy by sheriff under authority of this section [Code 1942, § 4235] renders moot the validity of a court order removing the deputy. Ex parte Castle, 248 Miss. 159, 159 So. 2d 81, 1963 Miss. LEXIS 387 (Miss. 1963).
      </p>
      <p>
       A deputy sheriff and his surety are not liable to the sheriff for embezzlement of funds by another deputy appointed by the sheriff, even though he might have discovered the embezzlement. Wittman v. Harrod, 246 Miss. 832, 152 So. 2d 717, 1963 Miss. LEXIS 511 (Miss. 1963).
      </p>

       Deputy authorized to sell land for taxes and to execute a deed therefor. Jones County Land Co. v. Fox, 120 Miss. 798, 83 So. 241, 1919 Miss. LEXIS 132 (Miss. 1919).

       Position of deputy sheriff an office and hence appointee must be qualified elector. State ex rel. Baker v. Nichols, 106 Miss. 419, 63 So. 1025, 1913 Miss. LEXIS 148 (Miss. 1913).
      </p>
      <p>
       A person is not disqualified to act as deputy sheriff in levying an execution because he is agent for plaintiff in collecting the judgment and is to receive a commission on the collection, and it is error to quash a levy because of such fact. Badley v. Ladd, 70 Miss. 688, 12 So. 832, 1893 Miss. LEXIS 35 (Miss. 1893).
      </p>
      <p>
       One acting generally as a deputy sheriff, under written appointment from the sheriff, although not having qualified according to law, is a de facto officer and as between third parties his actions are valid. Alabama & V. R. Co. v. Bolding, 69 Miss. 255, 13 So. 844, 1891 Miss. LEXIS 170 (Miss. 1891).
      </p>
      <p>
       The authorization of a special deputy to do a special act must be by the sheriff in writing; but such appointment need not, as in the case of a regular deputy, be filed with the clerk of the board of supervisors. In the absence of proof to the contrary, it will be presumed that a person whose name is appended to a return on a writ as a special deputy was duly authorized as such; it is unnecessary that his appointment should be on the writ. Nelson v. Nye, 43 Miss. 124, 1870 Miss. LEXIS 12 (Miss. 1870).

       Sheriff qualified as a person with “authority to address the problem,” and his knowledge of the alleged harassment was imputed to the County. Seibert v. Jackson County, — F. Supp. 3d —, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 102632 (S.D. Miss. Aug. 5, 2015).
      </p>
      <p>
       Despite the statutory grant of vicarious liability of the sheriff for the acts of deputies, such vicarious or respondeat superior liability did not apply in actions under 42 U.S.C.S. § 1983. Henley v. Edlemon, 297 F.3d 427, 2002 U.S. App. LEXIS 14850 (5th Cir. Miss. 2002).

       Sheriff may not be held vicariously liable, in civil rights action under 42 USCS § 1983, for excessive force used by sheriff’s deputies in shooting incident. Coon v. Ledbetter, 780 F.2d 1158, 1986 U.S. App. LEXIS 28012 (5th Cir. Miss. 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Sheriff who is not liable under 42 USCA § 1983 for deputy’s conduct in making illegal arrest and detention because sheriff is not personally involved in arrest or detention and because there is no causal connection between act by sheriff and violations of federal rights of person arrested and detained may nonetheless be held liable for damages under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t19c25s19-25-19" target="_self">19-25-19</a></cite>. Dennis v. Warren, 779 F.2d 245, 1985 U.S. App. LEXIS 25634 (5th Cir. Miss. 1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       When a deputy sheriff negligently uses an automobile furnished him for official use and used by virtue of or under color of his office, or in his official position as deputy sheriff, then the sheriff is liable to a person injured as a proximate result thereof; thus, a cause of action against the sheriff was stated by plaintiff in a personal injury action who alleged that her car was struck head-on by a car driven by a deputy sheriff acting officially in the course of his employment and driving his car negligently. Poole v. Brunt, 338 So. 2d 991, 1976 Miss. LEXIS 1635 (Miss. 1976).
      </p>
      <p>
       A sheriff’s bond is liable for the acts of a deputy sheriff acting within the scope of his authority, and where the deputy caused a wrongful death the sheriff and his surety are liable. United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co. v. State, 254 Miss. 812, 182 So. 2d 919, 1966 Miss. LEXIS 1578 (Miss. 1966).
      </p>
      <p>
       A deputy sheriff is not acting by virtue, or under color, of his office, so as to render the sheriff liable for his acts, where, having taken a person into custody for the purpose of questioning him, he tells another, who has intervened on behalf of such person, that the latter is not under arrest, the discussion finally leading to the shooting of the inquiring party by the deputy. State use of Dew v. Lightcap, 181 Miss. 893, 179 So. 880, 1938 Miss. LEXIS 129 (Miss. 1938).
      </p>
      <p>
       Limitation of one year held inapplicable in action against sheriff and surety for damages by reason of having been shot and wounded by deputy. State use of Smith v. Smith, 156 Miss. 288, 125 So. 825, 1930 Miss. LEXIS 161 (Miss. 1930).

       Sheriff’s admission he had appointed one injuring plaintiff as deputy held admissible against sheriff and sureties. McCoy v. Key, 155 Miss. 64, 123 So. 873, 1929 Miss. LEXIS 260 (Miss. 1929).
      </p>
      <p>
       Sheriff and bond liable for acts of de facto deputies acting within general scope of authority. Dean v. Brannon, 139 Miss. 312, 104 So. 173, 1925 Miss. LEXIS 160 (Miss. 1925).
      </p>
      <p>
       A misdemeanant who was unjustifiably shot by a deputy in attempting to arrest him under a warrant, or in attempting to prevent his escape after arrest, can maintain an action for damages against the sheriff on his official bond. Brown v. Weaver, 76 Miss. 7, 23 So. 388, 1898 Miss. LEXIS 54 (Miss. 1898).
      </p>
      <p>
       The action of the plaintiff in a judgment in naming a person to act as deputy and requesting his appointment to execute the writ is not such interference as will relieve the sheriff and his bondsmen from liability to the plaintiff for the negligence of the deputy resulting in the loss of goods levied and left in his charge. State use of Barnett v. Dalton, 69 Miss. 611, 10 So. 578, 1891 Miss. LEXIS 80 (Miss. 1891).

      </p>
      <p>
       This section [Code 1942, § 4235] which gives the circuit court the power to remove deputies and also bailiffs, necessarily implies that there must be some cause or ground underlying the removal and that such fact must have a direct bearing upon the kind of service the deputy is supposed to render to the public and the court.

     <p>
      in counties with a total population of more than twenty-five thousand (25,000), and not more than thirty-five thousand (35,000), the sheriff shall regularly employ a minimum of three (3) deputies having law enforcement duties;
     </p>
     <p>
      in counties with a total population of more than fifteen thousand (15,000), and not more than twenty-five thousand (25,000), the sheriff shall regularly employ a minimum of two (2) deputies having law enforcement duties;
     </p>
     <p>
      in all other counties, the sheriff shall regularly employ a minimum of one (1) deputy sheriff having law enforcement duties.
     </p>
     <p>
      In those counties comprised of two (2) judicial districts having a total population of thirty-five thousand (35,000) or more, there shall be not less than two (2) deputies in the judicial district in which the sheriff does not reside, one (1) of whom shall be the chief deputy in charge of the office, all of whom shall be subject to the direction of the sheriff. In those counties comprised of two (2) judicial districts having a total population of less than thirty-five thousand (35,000), there shall be at least one (1) deputy in the judicial district in which the sheriff does not reside who shall be subject to the direction of the sheriff.
     </p>
     <p>
      Each deputy sheriff who shall have law enforcement duties shall, at the expense of the county, attend and complete an appropriate curriculum in the field of law enforcement at the Mississippi Law Enforcement Officers’ Academy within one (1) year from the date of his appointment, excluding those who have previously served as sheriff, or have had at least five (5) years’ experience as a full-time law enforcement officer, or have previously successfully completed a course of training at the Mississippi Law Enforcement Officers’ Academy or at the Jackson Police Academy. Any deputy sheriff exempted from attendance at the initial course as herein provided because of previous service as sheriff or having five (5) years’ full-time law enforcement experience must have served as sheriff or obtained such experience within a period of ten (10) years prior to the date of his taking the oath of office. Any deputy sheriff exempted from attendance because of successful completion of a course of training at either of the aforementioned academies must have completed such course within five (5) years prior to the date of his taking the oath of office. Each deputy sheriff shall thereafter, on a periodic and continuing basis, attend additional advanced courses in law enforcement at said Academy in order that each deputy sheriff will be properly informed and trained in the modern, technical advances in the field of law enforcement.

       Once sheriff brings to attention of court that criminal fee is owed to county, this being done by making return on process, sheriff would not be liable under Subsection (3) of Section 25-7-19; sheriff must keep prisoner under terms set out in order of commitment issued by court and can not require that prisoner serve additional time or work additional days in order to pay off court cost and jail fees not included in the court’s order of commitment.

       Sheriff, rather than a circuit court, was to make hiring, firing, and compensation changes affecting bailiffs, as bailiffs were deputies of the sheriff. A circuit court order and order and opinion stating that bailiffs fell under the authority of the judiciary rather than the sheriff were void in part to the extent that they directly violated the Mississippi Constitution and statutory law.

       A sheriff’s duties with respect to operating a jail and keeping prisoners confined were discretionary in nature and, therefore, the sheriff was entitled to the protection of qualified immunity in a suit to recover for the wrongful death of a victim who was murdered by escaped inmates.

       State statutory scheme permitting temporary detention of mentally ill person in jail followed by physical and psychological examination within 24 hours of issuance of writ to take custody, and placing duty on sheriff to keep safe prisoners entrusted to his care, adequately meet procedural due process requirements for purposes of summary judgment motion in federal civil rights action by executor of estate of mentally ill person who died while in jail awaiting examination.

       Without existence of special relationship between sheriff and victim of homicide by jail escapees or sheriff and victim’s survivors, survivors have no cause of action against sheriff because sheriff’s duty is general public duty.

       Sheriff has no authority to release from jail prisoner who has been placed in custody of sheriff by court order without procuring court order allowing release; sheriff who releases prisoner, without court order, on basis of alleged mental and physical problems requiring hospitalization of prisoner, may be held in contempt of court.

       Sheriff who has previously obeyed court orders in releasing prisoners and recording ordered releases on jail docket but who subsequently allows convicted murderer and person convicted of possession with intent to sell controlled substances to leave jail on weekends, without court order and without making jail docket entry to document absence of prisoners, has overstepped bounds of authority and is guilty of criminal contempt. Coleman v. State, 482 So. 2d 219, 1986 Miss. LEXIS 2356 (Miss. 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       It is within the sound discretion of the trial judge to permit the sheriff to remain in the courtroom during the trial of a case, although he is a witness; and a conviction will not be reversed because of the ruling of the trial judge on that question unless it manifestly appears that there has been an abuse of discretion.

       There is no liability on the part of a sheriff and his deputy for imprisoning an individual in accordance with the order of the chancellor, though the chancellor’s order may have been illegal in that he was without authority to issue it.

   Since the functions of the sheriff are confined to his own county, except in the case of the pursuit of an escaping offender, there can be no recovery on a sheriff’s bond for the alleged unlawful treatment of one accused of crime apprehended in another state where such treatment and the event complained of occurred in such other state.

       No reversible error was found in trial judge excluding testimony directed toward identity of person who actually served summons; one acting generally as deputy sheriff, under written appointment from sheriff, although not having qualified according to law, is de facto officer and between third parties his actions are valid; and, in absence of proof to contrary, it is presumed that person whose name was appended to return on writ as special deputy was duly authorized as such.

       On payment by sheriff or his sureties of damages for failure to execute process, original judgment and execution vests in sheriff or sureties, and they may recover thereon; it is not contrary to public policy for sheriff to purchase execution and judgment when motion is made against him for failure to execute it.

       A sheriff holding an attachment writ against a corporation may refuse the demand of the plaintiff to levy it on the property of the individuals who compose it and manage its affairs, and by so doing he does not incur liability to the plaintiff. And this is so notwithstanding it may be shown that if the levy had been made the property might thereafter in a chancery proceeding have been subjected to the demand of the plaintiff.

       In a suit under the section [Code 1942, § 4241], on the sheriff’s bond for failing to return executions, the validity of the executions must be decided by the court, not the jury. In such cases, if the executions be valid, the amount of the judgments furnish prima facie the measure of recovery, and it devolves upon the defendants to show the insolvency of the execution-debtors.

       § 19-25-41.
    Liability of sheriff for failure to return execution.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      If any sheriff or other officer properly authorized to act for him, shall fail to return any execution to him directed, on the return day thereof, the plaintiff in execution shall be entitled to recover judgment against the sheriff or other officer, and his sureties, for the amount of the execution and all costs, with lawful interest thereon until the same shall be paid, and with five percent (5%) on the full amount of the judgment as damages, to be recovered by motion before the court to which the execution is returnable, on five days’ notice first being given thereof. However, after the sheriff or other officer, or the sureties, shall have paid the amount of money and damages recovered, then the original judgment and execution shall be vested in the officer or his sureties paying the recovery and damages, for his or their benefit, and execution may issue on the original judgment, in the name of the plaintiff, for the use and benefit and at the cost and charges of the officer or his sureties in whom the judgment may be so vested. Nothing herein contained shall affect any other remedy against officers for failing to return executions, and the remedy given by this section shall apply in favor of county treasuries, clerks, and other officers and witnesses, for the recovery of all jury taxes, fees, and costs, with interest and damages thereon, in the same manner as to plaintiffs in execution. In any proceeding against a sheriff or other officer for failing to return any process, proof that the process was put in the post office, duly addressed to him, and that the postage was paid thereon, shall be prima facie evidence of the receipt thereof by the officer.

       This statute [Code 1942, § 4242] is highly penal so that very slight circumstances are held to exempt officers from its operation, and one seeking to recover hereunder must bring his case clearly within its terms. W. T. Rawleigh Co. v. Causey, 195 Miss. 842, 16 So. 2d 397, 1944 Miss. LEXIS 331 (Miss. 1944).

       Plaintiff was properly denied its motion for judgment against a sheriff and his surety arising out of the failure to levy execution against defendant, where the deputy sheriff was as diligent as possible in trying to levy on the writ of execution inasmuch as he made eight or 10 trips and contacted all he knew to secure information about property on which the levy possibly could have been made. Nitto Denko America, Inc. v. ABCD Tapes, 419 So. 2d 204, 1982 Miss. LEXIS 2139 (Miss. 1982).
      </p>
      <p>
       Mere fact that the seal was placed on a writ of execution upon that part of the document containing the cost bill instead of upon the body of the writ proper, did not render it invalid, so as to excuse sheriff’s failure to return the writ on return day. W. T. Rawleigh Co. v. Howell, 196 Miss. 489, 18 So. 2d 134, 1944 Miss. LEXIS 218 (Miss. 1944).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the sheriff wrote to a judgment creditor in Illinois two weeks before the first day of the court, demanding a bond to indemnify him against liability for levying an execution and advising such creditor that the execution would be held unexecuted until such bond was furnished, and the creditor failed to answer, two weeks was not an unreasonable time for the sheriff to wait for the creditor to furnish the bond so as to charge the sheriff with liability for failure to return the execution on the return day thereof. W. T. Rawleigh Co. v. Foxworth, 194 Miss. 205, 11 So. 2d 919, 1943 Miss. LEXIS 56 (Miss. 1943).
      </p>
      <p>
       In an action against a former sheriff and his successor, and their sureties, to recover under this section [Code 1942, § 4242] for their failure to return a writ of execution on return day thereof pursuant to its command, the judgment creditor was not entitled in a court of law to a discovery from the sheriffs respectively, as to which of them was liable. W. T. Rawleigh Co. v. Hester, 190 Miss. 329, 200 So. 250, 1941 Miss. LEXIS 53 (Miss. 1941).
      </p>
      <p>
       There could be no recovery in a proceeding to recover the statutory liability for failure to make return of a writ of execution on return day thereof pursuant to its command against a former sheriff who resigned before such return day, predicated upon his failure to deliver the writ to his successor. W. T. Rawleigh Co. v. Hester, 190 Miss. 329, 200 So. 250, 1941 Miss. LEXIS 53 (Miss. 1941).
      </p>
      <p>
       A former sheriff and his sureties were not liable for failure to return a writ of execution on return day pursuant to its command, where the violation did not take place while he was in office because of his resignation before the return day thereof. W. T. Rawleigh Co. v. Hester, 190 Miss. 329, 200 So. 250, 1941 Miss. LEXIS 53 (Miss. 1941).
      </p>
      <p>
       In proceeding against sheriff for failure to return execution on its return day, evidence held insufficient to meet sheriff’s burden of proving his allegation that he withheld execution until after return day at direction, or by agreement, of judgment creditors. Everett v. Duckworth, 179 Miss. 516, 176 So. 387, 1937 Miss. LEXIS 56 (Miss. 1937).
      </p>
      <p>
       Officers will be exempted from the operation of statute making such officers liable to execution plaintiff for failure to return execution by very slight circumstances, including any act done by such execution plaintiff which directly or indirectly contributes to the omission of duty complained of. Crawford v. Bank of Seminary, 178 Miss. 129, 172 So. 750, 1937 Miss. LEXIS 199 (Miss. 1937).
      </p>
      <p>
       Execution plaintiff who gave sheriff execution to levy and, after sheriff refused to levy unless bond were posted, took the papers back and made no further demand for levy held to have lost, by accepting return of the papers, his statutory rights to recover the original judgment from the sheriff, irrespective of either party’s mistake of law or fact, since plaintiff thereby prevented such sheriff from subsequently correcting his error. Crawford v. Bank of Seminary, 178 Miss. 129, 172 So. 750, 1937 Miss. LEXIS 199 (Miss. 1937).
      </p>
      <p>
       Admission by husband-agent of judgment creditor before time for return of execution that nothing could be made thereon relieved sheriff from statutory penalty. Watson v. Boyett, 151 Miss. 726, 118 So. 629, 1928 Miss. LEXIS 372 (Miss. 1928).
      </p>
      <p>
       It was said in
   Morehead v. Holliday, 1 S & M 625, that up on the failure to return the execution upon its return day the sheriff was liable absolutely and without exception. In Cox v. Ross, 56 M 481, it is intimated that the act of God, physical impossibility, or the like, would excuse; while it is now decided that if the plaintiff contribute, directly or indirectly, to the omission of duty complained of, he cannot succeed.

      <p>
       <p>
   The trial court properly found that there were insufficient circumstances to relieve a sheriff of liability for his failure to return a special writ of execution by the return date, as required by §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t19c25s19-25-41" target="_self">19-25-41</a></cite>, and thus the sheriff was liable to the judgment creditor for the value of the eight specific personal items enumerated in the writ of execution. Bonds v. Bonds, 453 So. 2d 1020, 1984 Miss. LEXIS 1795 (Miss. 1984).
      </p>
      <p>
       A successor sheriff is not liable for damages for failure to return executions on the return date, where the executions were delivered to former sheriff who retained them in his possession and never placed the execution in the hands of the successor sheriff after her qualification as sheriff. Parks v. Herrington, 213 Miss. 317, 56 So. 2d 836, 1952 Miss. LEXIS 367 (Miss. 1952).
      </p>
      <p>
       The rule is that where a process or writ is placed in the hands of a sheriff or constable for service or execution, he is liable if he fails to return the same within the time which is allowed by law for the making of his return thereon, and the fact that a return is made after the expiration of such time does not relieve him of liability for his default; but in order to enforce such liability, it must be shown that the writ was actually placed in his hands for execution, and that he actually failed to return it on the return date. W. T. Rawleigh Co. v. Hester, 190 Miss. 329, 200 So. 250, 1941 Miss. LEXIS 53 (Miss. 1941).
      </p>
      <p>
       Notation by deputy sheriff on execution that it was executed on certain date, held that execution was set aside on subsequent date held not return in conformity to statute. McIntosh v. Munson Road Machinery Co., 167 Miss. 546, 145 So. 731, 1933 Miss. LEXIS 82 (Miss. 1933).
      </p>
      <p>
       Clerk’s failure to properly indorse date of filing sheriff’s return of execution will not render sheriff liable for statutory penalty. Jeffreys v. Alexander, 151 Miss. 447, 118 So. 301, 1928 Miss. LEXIS 326 (Miss. 1928).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence as to whether execution was returned by sheriff on or before return day held to raise issue of fact for chancellor. Jeffreys v. Alexander, 151 Miss. 447, 118 So. 301, 1928 Miss. LEXIS 326 (Miss. 1928).
      </p>
      <p>
       Parol evidence is admissible to show that indorsement or file mark of clerk on sheriff’s return of execution was erroneous. Jeffreys v. Alexander, 151 Miss. 447, 118 So. 301, 1928 Miss. LEXIS 326 (Miss. 1928).
      </p>
      <p>
       It is in the discretion of the court to allow the officer to amend his return, even after motion, if no intervening rights have been acquired by virtue or upon the faith of the original return. Howard v. Priestly, 58 Miss. 21, 1880 Miss. LEXIS 84 (Miss. 1880).
      </p>
      <p>
       Returning an execution nulla bona too soon is not within the statute. Tapp v. Bonds, 57 Miss. 281, 1879 Miss. LEXIS 70 (Miss. 1879).
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that the sheriff had the execution in his pocket, or in his desk in the court room, with the proper indorsement on it of how he had executed it, was not a return of the process, although the plaintiff in execution was an attorney of the court, and could easily have obtained the execution by applying at the sheriff’s desk, and may have known this. Beall v. Shattuck, 53 Miss. 358, 1876 Miss. LEXIS 79 (Miss. 1876).
      </p>
      <p>
       It is unnecessary for the return of the officer to show affirmatively the failure to levy. Garrett v. Hamblin, 19 Miss. 219, 1848 Miss. LEXIS 174 (Miss. 1848).
      </p>
      <p>
       The indorsement of a return on an execution is not prima facie evidence that it was returned on the return day. The return of the execution into the office of the clerk is a fact in pais. Izod v. Addison, 6 Miss. 432, 1841 Miss. LEXIS 18 (Miss. 1841).

      <p>
       On collateral attack, judgment must be void to avail sheriff of relief from his liability for failure to return execution, although motion to quash execution is made. McIntosh v. Munson Road Machinery Co., 167 Miss. 546, 145 So. 731, 1933 Miss. LEXIS 82 (Miss. 1933).
      </p>
      <p>
       That judgment by default was rendered when there was plea on file and was set aside by court at subsequent term did not relieve sheriff from liability for failure to return execution, such judgment being valid as against collateral attack. McIntosh v. Munson Road Machinery Co., 167 Miss. 546, 145 So. 731, 1933 Miss. LEXIS 82 (Miss. 1933).
      </p>
      <p>
       No liability where the judgment is void. Union Motor Car Co. v. Cartledge, 133 Miss. 318, 97 So. 801, 1923 Miss. LEXIS 153 (Miss. 1923).
      </p>
      <p>
       Liability cannot be avoided on the ground judgment was invalid, such defense being a collateral attack. Green v. Taylor, 111 Miss. 232, 71 So. 375, 1916 Miss. LEXIS 276 (Miss. 1916).

       Testimony of circuit clerk that it was his custom to deliver executions to sheriff’s office at the time of issuance, although he could not remember the exact time of delivery, when aided by presumption that the clerk did his duty and delivered the execution to the sheriff, was sufficient to establish prima facie case that the execution was actually delivered to the sheriff before its return date. W. T. Rawleigh Co. v. Causey, 195 Miss. 842, 16 So. 2d 397, 1944 Miss. LEXIS 331 (Miss. 1944).
      </p>
      <p>
       Movant, seeking judgment against sheriff and sureties on his official bond for failure of the sheriff to return an execution by the return date thereof, must show prima facie a delivery in fact of the execution to the sheriff before its return date. W. T. Rawleigh Co. v. Causey, 195 Miss. 834, 16 So. 2d 395, 1944 Miss. LEXIS 330 (Miss. 1944).
      </p>
      <p>
       In proceedings to obtain judgment against sheriff for failure to file execution before return day thereof, presumption that circuit clerk delivered writ of execution to sheriff with reasonable promptness following issuance thereof was neutralized by presumption of law that if sheriff had received the writ before return day, he would have returned it within the time provided by law, in the absence of any testimony on the subject by the clerk or showing of sheriff’s docket in which he is required to show when such writ is received. W. T. Rawleigh Co. v. Causey, 195 Miss. 834, 16 So. 2d 395, 1944 Miss. LEXIS 330 (Miss. 1944).
      </p>
      <p>
       While this section [Code 1942, § 4242] does not require either allegation or proof of damages sustained, nevertheless, it is necessary hereunder to allege and prove that the sheriff violated his duty while in office by not making a return on the writ of the return day thereof. W. T. Rawleigh Co. v. Hester, 190 Miss. 329, 200 So. 250, 1941 Miss. LEXIS 53 (Miss. 1941).

       A movant under this section [Code 1942, § 4242], seeking to charge a former sheriff and his successor, and their sureties, with liability for failure to return a writ of execution on return day pursuant to its command, could not maintain an equitable bill to discover which of them was liable since a person is not obligated to reveal information in such a bill which may subject him to a forfeiture or penalty. W. T. Rawleigh Co. v. Hester, 190 Miss. 329, 200 So. 250, 1941 Miss. LEXIS 53 (Miss. 1941).
      </p>
      <p>
       Allegations of a motion to charge a former sheriff and his successor, and their sureties, with statutory liability for failure to make return of a writ of execution on return day thereof, to the effect that movant did not know when or how the writ of execution was delivered from the former sheriff to his successor, if the same was delivered, and that the defendants refused to inform movant thereof and movant was unable to obtain such information otherwise, were insufficient on demurrer, since if it be presumed that the former sheriff delivered the writ to his successor in accordance with his statutory duty in the event of resignation, the presumption of equal dignity that his successor would have returned the writ in time if he had received it in time would also apply, together with the presumption that the successor gave the resigning sheriff a receipt as required by law which movant would be entitled to inspect, or movant could have inspected the public records of the sheriff’s office to ascertain the facts which such records are presumed to disclose as to when a succeeding sheriff received process. W. T. Rawleigh Co. v. Hester, 190 Miss. 329, 200 So. 250, 1941 Miss. LEXIS 53 (Miss. 1941).

       The motions are determinable in the court to which the process is returnable, and an application to change the venue to the county of the sheriff’s residence should be disallowed. Tapp v. Bonds, 57 Miss. 281, 1879 Miss. LEXIS 70 (Miss. 1879).

      </p>

       No other process is necessary than service of notice of the motion; and it is unnecessary to set out the bond in the motion, but it is sufficient to describe it and state the sureties. Lewis v. Garrett's Adm'rs, 6 Miss. 434, 1841 Miss. LEXIS 19 (Miss. 1841).

       After a sheriff and his sureties have appeared and contested a motion on its merits, it is too late to object to the regularity of the notice or the sufficiency of the motion itself. Izod v. Addison, 6 Miss. 432, 1841 Miss. LEXIS 18 (Miss. 1841).

      A sheriff or other officer properly authorized to act for him shall not return an execution or attachment for not performing a decree in chancery to the office whence it issued without noting thereon how he has executed the same, unless by the express direction, in writing, of the plaintiff, his agent or attorney.

When any execution shall be settled, or the money due thereon received, wholly or in part, by an officer, he shall make a statement of the amount thereof on the execution, including his own fees and commissions, and return the same with the execution.

     <p>
      If any sheriff or other officer properly authorized to act for him, shall collect, by virtue of an execution or attachment, the whole or a part of the money which, by the writ, he is required to levy, and shall not immediately pay the same to the party entitled thereto, or his attorney, on demand made; or if any sheriff or other officer properly authorized to act for him, shall voluntarily, and without authority, omit to execute such process, or to levy the money therein mentioned, or do or omit anything which would entitle the plaintiff to recover from the sheriff or other officer by any action the debt, damages, or costs in the execution mentioned; then, in either of said cases, the sheriff or other officer and his sureties shall be liable to pay to the plaintiff in the execution or attachment, or to any person entitled to the money, or a part thereof, the full amount of the money due upon the execution or attachment, with twenty-five percent (25%)damages, and lawful interest until paid, to be recovered with costs by motion before the court to which the execution is returnable, on five days’ notice of the motion to the sheriff or other officer and his sureties. In case the sheriff or other officer have received only a part of the money due by the execution or attachment, and be not otherwise liable for the whole amount thereof, the recovery shall be limited to the amount received, with damages and interest. The court, at the request of either party, in case any matters of fact shall be in issue between them, shall cause a jury to be impaneled to try the same, and if the verdict be against the sheriff or other officer, judgment shall be entered up, with damages and costs, as above directed.

       Where a debtor’s trailer was placed in the constructive possession of the sheriff by the direction of the creditor bank which caused execution to issue against the trailer, but actual possession was not taken by the sheriff because the bank did not wish to incur the expense of removing the trailer to another place of storage, the loss resulting from the subsequent removal of the trailer to parts unknown was not chargeable to the sheriff or to his surety, the circumstance that the default of the sheriff was occasioned by the request of the bank being sufficient to exempt the sheriff from the operation of this highly penal statute.

    Liability of sheriff for false return on any process.

     </h3>
     <p>
      If a sheriff or other officer properly authorized to act for him, make a false return on any process whatever, he shall, for every such offense, be liable to pay the sum of Five Hundred Dollars ($500.00) to the plaintiff named in the process, such sum being recoverable against the officer and his sureties, or the officer alone, by motion before the court to which the process is returnable, after five days’ notice of such motion to the officer and his sureties. If the returns alleged to be false do not appear on the face of the record to be so, the court shall, at the request of either party, impanel a jury to ascertain whether the return be false or not, on an issue joined under the direction of the court. If the jury find that the return is false, judgment shall be entered for the said sum against the officer and his sureties, with costs.

       This section [Code 1942, § 4245] is highly penal, and very slight circumstances will exempt officers from its operation, and one seeking to recover the penalty thereunder must bring his case clearly within its terms. W. T. Rawleigh Co. v. Brantley, 197 Miss. 244, 19 So. 2d 808, 1944 Miss. LEXIS 292 (Miss. 1944).
      </p>
      <p>
       Making of a “false return” to writ of execution within meaning of this section [Code 1942, § 4245] implies conduct on the part of the officer which stigmatizes his representation of fact as a dishonest one, calculated to deceive another by a suppression of truth, the return being a mere artifice employed to suppress the truth for the purpose of deception. W. T. Rawleigh Co. v. Brantley, 197 Miss. 244, 19 So. 2d 808, 1944 Miss. LEXIS 292 (Miss. 1944).
      </p>
      <p>
       Statement in sheriff’s return on writ of execution that “after diligent search and inquiry I have failed to find anything in my county upon which I could levy” is not equivalent to a statement that none of the defendants had any property, real or personal, so as to render return a “false return” within the meaning of this section [Code 1942, § 4245], it being shown that one of the defendants owned a tract of land, especially where, on the day before making the return, the sheriff, who knew about the land, informed the attorney of the judgment creditor that the defendant claimed a homestead exemption and that the property was subject to a mortgage, the existence and quantity of the land being clearly understood by both the sheriff and the attorney. W. T. Rawleigh Co. v. Brantley, 197 Miss. 244, 19 So. 2d 808, 1944 Miss. LEXIS 292 (Miss. 1944).
      </p>

       The section is penal, and is against the officer committing the act. The sheriff is not liable to this penalty for the act of his deputy. The state can maintain the motion in a proper case. State v. Nichols, 39 Miss. 318, 1860 Miss. LEXIS 47 (Miss. 1860).

       Under this section [Code 1942, § 4248] the duty is imposed upon a sheriff, at the expiration of his term of office or on resigning, to deliver a writ of execution to his successor, if it is unexecuted at that time.

      <p>
       There could be no recovery in a proceeding to recover the statutory liability for failure to make return of a writ of execution on return day thereof pursuant to its command against a former sheriff who resigned before such return day, predicated upon his failure to deliver the writ to his successor.

      <p>
       Allegations of a motion to charge a former sheriff and his successor, and their sureties, with statutory liability for failure to make return of a writ of execution on return day thereof, to the effect that movant did not know when or how the writ of execution was delivered from the former sheriff to his successor, if the same was delivered, and that the defendants refused to inform movant thereof and movant was unable to obtain such information otherwise, were insufficient on demurrer, since if it be presumed that the former sheriff delivered the writ to his successor in accordance with his statutory duty in the event of resignation, the presumption of equal dignity that his successor would have returned the writ in time if he had received it in time would also apply, together with the presumption that the successor gave the resigning sheriff a receipt as required by law which movant would be entitled to inspect, or movant could have inspected the public records of the sheriff’s office to ascertain the facts which such records are presumed to disclose as to when a succeeding sheriff received process.

    Duty of sheriff to keep the peace.

     </h3>
     <p>
      It shall be the duty of every sheriff to keep the peace within his county, by causing all offenders in his view to enter into bonds, with sureties, for keeping the peace and for appearing at the next circuit court, and by committing such offenders in case of refusal. He shall certify and return said bonds to the court. It shall be his duty to quell riots, routs, affrays and unlawful assemblages, and to prevent lynchings and mob violence, and wherever necessary he shall call to his aid the power of the county. Any person who shall fail, neglect or refuse to respond to the call of the sheriff for such aid shall be reported by the sheriff to the circuit court, and it shall be his duty to prosecute all such persons, who, upon conviction, shall be punished as for a misdemeanor. He shall pursue, apprehend, and commit to jail all persons charged with treason, felony, or other crimes. He may take bonds, with good and sufficient sureties, of any person whom he may arrest with or without a warrant for any felony that is bailable as a matter of law. He may fix the amount of such bonds, only in emergency circumstances. “Emergency circumstances” means a situation in which a person is arrested without a warrant and cannot be taken before a judicial officer for a determination of probable cause within a reasonable time, or within forty-eight (48) hours, whichever is the lesser, after the arrest.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any sheriff who wilfully fails, neglects or refuses to perform any of his duties as prescribed in this section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and prosecuted therefor, and upon conviction thereof he shall be removed from office.

       It is the duty of the sheriff to keep the peace within the county (Section 19-25-67) and no authority exists to provide greater protection to certain areas of the county in return for the residents of those areas making payments to the county to cover the costs of additional protection. Frierson, December 7, 1995, A.G. Op. #95-0793.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under Section 19-25-67, traffic laws may not apply to private roads however, the sheriff does have jurisdiction to enforce other laws such as drug violations on private property. A sheriff has jurisdiction over all crimes committed within his county. However, when patrolling private property, the sheriff must have legal authority to be present on the private property. Sollie, April 26, 1996, A.G. Op. #96-0247.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a justice court judge refers an affiant to a sheriff based upon a finding that probable cause does not exist in the affidavit or other evidence taken under oath to believe that a crime was committed or that the defendant committed the crime, then the sheriff has a duty to undertake such an investigation as the sheriff deems sufficient to determine whether sufficient probable cause exists and to then present the matter again to the appropriate judicial officer. Broadhead, July 3, 1997, A.G. Op. #97-0389.
      </p>
      <p>
       A sheriff’s jurisdiction is restricted to the boundaries of the county from which he is elected and, therefore, a sheriff does not have the authority to enforce state laws in an adjoining county.

   Since the functions of the sheriff are confined to his own county, except in the case of the pursuit of an escaping offender, there can be no recovery on a sheriff’s bond for the alleged unlawful treatment of one accused of crime apprehended in another state where such treatment and the event complained of occurred in such other state.

   The language of Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t19c25s19-25-67" target="_self">19-25-67</a></cite> gives sheriffs the discretionary authority to grant or deny the ability to write bail bonds as long as such action is not taken in an arbitrary and capricious fashion, but does not create a legitimate claim of entitlement in a bail bondsman to have his bonds accepted. Bonding v. Lee County, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 114124 (N.D. Miss. Dec. 8, 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       But if the capias be returnable instanter, it is not proper for the sheriff to take a bond; he should carry the prisoner to the court. Bourdeaux v. Warren County, 66 Miss. 231, 5 So. 227, 1888 Miss. LEXIS 94 (Miss. 1888).
      </p>
      <p>
       The sheriff’s power to take bond from a party arrested by him by virtue of process of the circuit court does not terminate until after the party has been legally discharged from his custody; and he can do so after a mistrial. State v. Brown, 32 Miss. 275, 1856 Miss. LEXIS 199 (Miss. 1856).
      </p>
      <p>
       When a bench warrant is issued in term time, returnable on a future day of the term, the sheriff may take bond for the appearance of the prisoner on that day. Moss v. State, 7 Miss. 298, 1842 Miss. LEXIS 41 (Miss. 1842).

   While Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t19c25s19-25-67" target="_self">19-25-67</a></cite> authorized a sheriff to take bonds, so long as they were accompanied by good and sufficient sureties, it did not require the sheriff to accept every bond offered with sufficient sureties, and the sheriff had limited discretion as to whether to accept or reject a bond tendered for the release of an accused; Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.99.html#t99c05s99-5-19" target="_blank">99-5-19</a></cite> supported this finding, in that it twice mentioned the person taking and approving a bail bond.

       § 19-25-69.
    Sheriff to have charge of courthouse, jail and protection of prisoners.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The sheriff shall have charge of the courthouse and jail of his county, of the premises belonging thereto, and of the prisoners in said jail. He shall preserve the said premises and prisoners from mob violence, from any injuries or attacks by mobs or otherwise, and from trespasses and intruders. He shall keep the courthouse, jail, and premises belonging thereto, in a clean and comfortable condition, and it shall be his duty to prosecute all persons who are guilty of injuring or defacing same. If, after a hearing by the Governor, held in accordance with due process of law, it shall be ascertained that the sheriff has wilfully failed, neglected or refused to preserve the courthouse, or the jail, or any prisoners lawfully in his custody from injuries by mob violence, then the Governor shall have the power and it shall be his duty to remove such sheriff from office.
     </p>
     <p>
      However, in the case of a jail owned jointly by a county and municipality, under the provisions of Section 17-5-1, Mississippi Code of 1972, after the appointment of a jailer, pursuant to Section 47-1-49, Mississippi Code of 1972, responsible for all municipal prisoners lodged in said jail, neither the sheriff nor his bondsmen shall be responsible for actual maintenance or operation of said jail, insofar as municipal prisoners are concerned.

       County board of supervisors can contract with private individuals or corporations to operate vending machines at courthouse for benefit of public; although sheriff is required to be custodian of courthouse, he may not be required to assume responsibility for maintenance of vending machine funds and/or equipment. Herring, June 21, 1990, A.G. Op. #90-0406.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although sheriff may not fire county employees who are not members of the sheriff’s department, sheriff may, under duty to care for and maintain courthouse, keep any persons, including such employees, from stealing courthouse property and exclude persons who are intoxicated on courthouse property from premises. Barrett, Sept. 18, 1992, A.G. Op. #92-0710.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sheriff should have such access to courthouse and offices in it as is necessary to preserve and keep them secure and clean, but should remember that officials with office space in courthouse have certain statutory duties and liabilities with regard to official records and monies kept in their offices; sheriff should afford these officials necessary safeguards to protect integrity of these records. Ford, Oct. 21, 1992, A.G. Op. #92-0800.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sheriff has custodial charge of courthouse and duty to keep it clean and comfortable; if he fails to do so, Governor has power and duty to remove such sheriff from office. Ford, Jan. 12, 1994, A.G. Op. #93-0959.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because the sheriff is charged with keeping the courthouse clean and comfortable, he/she has the authority to hire a janitor or a cleaning service; the compensation for such janitor or cleaning service will come from the sheriff’s budget. Tolar, Oct. 18, 2002, A.G. Op. #02-0601.
      </p>
      <p>
       A board of supervisors would not have the authority to hire a private security company to provide security for the courthouse rather than using the sheriff’s office; however, the board may authorize the sheriff to employ private security for the courthouse, and may amend his budget to provide therefor. Meadows, Feb. 14, 2003, A.G. Op. #03-0740.

      <p>
       The sheriff has exclusive control over jail employees, subject to the constraints of his budget as approved by the board of supervisors. Farmer, Feb. 6, 2004, A.G. Op. 04-0005.

       Sheriff, rather than a circuit court, was to make hiring, firing, and compensation changes affecting bailiffs, as bailiffs were deputies of the sheriff. A circuit court order and order and opinion stating that bailiffs fell under the authority of the judiciary rather than the sheriff were void in part to the extent that they directly violated the Mississippi Constitution and statutory law.

      </p>
      <p>
       A sheriff’s duties with respect to operating a jail and keeping prisoners confined were discretionary in nature and, therefore, the sheriff was entitled to the protection of qualified immunity in a suit to recover for the wrongful death of a victim who was murdered by escaped inmates. McQueen v. Williams, 587 So. 2d 918, 1991 Miss. LEXIS 715 (Miss. 1991), overruled,

       State statutory scheme permitting temporary detention of mentally ill person in jail followed by physical and psychological examination within 24 hours of issuance of writ to take custody, and placing duty on sheriff to keep safe prisoners entrusted to his care, adequately meet procedural due process requirements for purposes of summary judgment motion in federal civil rights action by executor of estate of mentally ill person who died while in jail awaiting examination. Boston v. Lafayette County, 743 F. Supp. 462, 1990 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9493 (N.D. Miss. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       Without existence of special relationship between sheriff and victim of homicide by jail escapees or sheriff and victim’s survivors, survivors have no cause of action against sheriff because sheriff’s duty is general public duty. Robinson v. Estate of Williams, 721 F. Supp. 806, 1989 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12092 (S.D. Miss. 1989).
      </p>

       Sheriff has no authority to release from jail prisoner who has been placed in custody of sheriff by court order without procuring court order allowing release; sheriff who releases prisoner, without court order, on basis of alleged mental and physical problems requiring hospitalization of prisoner, may be held in contempt of court. Coleman v. State, 482 So. 2d 221, 1986 Miss. LEXIS 2355 (Miss. 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Since the functions of the sheriff are confined to his own county, except in the case of the pursuit of an escaping offender, there can be no recovery on a sheriff’s bond for the alleged unlawful treatment of one accused of crime apprehended in another state where such treatment and the event complained of occurred in such other state.

       A sheriff was not liable for injuries sustained by the plaintiff in an automobile accident involving a prisoner in the county jail who was cited for driving under the influence and for driving without a license since the sheriff strictly adhered to the sentencing instructions given by the county justice court, which stated, “Sentence six months; let him go to work every day at 6:00 a.m. and return every evening.” Gant v.

    Sheriff to receive and keep prisoners from United States officers.

     </h3>
     <p>
      It shall be the duty of all sheriffs as jailors to receive and safely keep, until discharged by due course of law, all prisoners arrested or committed under legal process from the officers of the courts of the United States, if the officer or person delivering such prisoner shall secure to the sheriff as jailor the amount of subsistence, bedding, fuel, clothing, medicine and medical fees allowed by law in such cases. No sheriff as jailor shall receive or keep any such prisoner where the receiving or keeping of such prisoner would tax the capacity of the jail in his county to the extent that there would not be sufficient room in said jail to safely keep and care for state and county prisoners in his custody or where the receiving or keeping of said prisoner would render such jail unduly unsanitary or dangerous to the health of the prisoners confined therein.

       § 19-27-27.
    Maps and plats; recording.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Such map or plat shall be recorded in the office of the clerk of the chancery court of the county or counties where the land lies, and in the following manner. The proprietor shall cause to be made, by a competent person, on the same scale and on paper of the same size and quality as that on which the map or plat is required to be made, an exact duplicate of said map or plat, with the detailed description, and signed and acknowledged as the original is required to be. The said map or plat and the said duplicate shall be delivered to the clerk of the chancery court, who shall carefully examine the same, and, if he find that in any respect it fails to conform to the requirements of Sections 19-27-23, 19-27-25, he shall point out the deficiency to the person so presenting it, and return it to such person for correction. When such map or plat shall conform, or shall be made to conform, to the requirements of law, the clerk and the engineer, surveyor, or other person who made the same, shall carefully compare the duplicate with the map or plat, and, if correct, or when made correct, it shall be certified by the clerk and the engineer, surveyor, or other maker, stating therein that they have carefully compared the same with the map or plat (describing it), and that it is an exact duplicate thereof, and of the whole of such map or plat. The clerk shall then securely fasten the said duplicate in a book of the proper size for such paper, so that it shall not be folded, which book shall be securely bound and provided at the costs of the county, after the first map or plat is so presented. Such duplicate so fastened in said book shall be held and taken to be a record of the map or plat, with like effect as if the map or plat had been actually transcribed by the clerk in a book in his office. The clerk shall certify on the map or plat and note on the duplicate the time when it was recorded, and make a reference on the map to the book and page where recorded. The lines and distances of all such maps or plats shall be in yards, feet, and inches.

     <p>
      If the owner of any land which shall have been laid off, mapped, or platted as a city, town or village, or addition thereto, or subdivision thereof, or other platted area, whether inside or outside a municipality, shall be desirous of altering or vacating such map or plat, or any part thereof, he may, under oath, petition the chancery court for relief in the premises, setting forth the particular circumstances of the case and giving an accurate description of the property, the map or plat of which is to be vacated, or altered, and the names of the persons to be adversely affected thereby, or directly interested therein. The parties so named shall be made defendants thereto, and publication of summons shall be made one time in a newspaper published, or having a general circulation, in the county where the land is situated, and which publication shall clearly state the objects and purposes of the petition.
     </p>
     <p>
      At any time after the expiration of five days from said publication and the service of process upon the named defendants, the cause or proceeding shall be triable, and the court in term time or the chancellor in vacation may hear the petition and all objections from any person thereto, and may decree according to the merits of the case. However, where all adversely affected or directly interested persons join in said petition, the same may be finally heard and determined by the court or chancellor at any time. If the decree vacate, in whole or in part, or alter the map or plat, it shall be recorded as a deed, and a memorandum thereof noted on the record of the map or plat.

       State statute, which sets out procedure to be followed in order to change subdivision plat, does not dictate when or under what circumstances plat must be changed. Lacoste, May 9, 1991, A.G. Op. #91-0319.
      </p>
      <p>
       Miss. Code Section 19-27-3 sets out procedure to be followed in order to change subdivision plat; it does not dictate when or under what circumstances plat must be changed, so that one can convey portion of lot without giving conveyed portion separate lot number and without having conveyance marked off on subdivision plat; however, if external boundary of subdivision is to be changed, or if portion which is to be resubdivided is to be given separate lot number and be designated on plat, then official subdivision plat would necessarily have to be amended pursuant to Miss. Code 19-27-31. Gamble, May 12, 1993, A.G. Op. #93-0275.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under Section 19-27-31 jurisdiction over changes in subdivision plats is proper in the chancery court and not the board of supervisors. Thach, April 26, 1996, A.G. Op. #96-0205.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a property owner has obtained the written agreement of all affected parties, he may petition the board of supervisors for a change in the subdivision plat in which his property is located in accord with Section 17-1-23; otherwise, he should petition the chancery court pursuant to Section 19-27-31. Sherard, Feb. 9, 2001, A.G. Op. #2001-0041.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no requirement that an amended plat be filed every time a portion of a lot is conveyed by deed to another; in other words, one can convey a portion of a lot without giving the conveyed portion a separate lot number and without having the conveyance marked off on the subdivision plat. Mitchell, May 17, 2002, A.G. Op. #02-0254.

   Determination of those persons that must be named in the petition to alter or vacate a map or plat presented to the board of supervisors and who must agree in writing to the alteration is a question of fact that must be made by the board of supervisors. Furthermore, any scrivener’s error which would require the alteration of a lot line, must follow the procedures set forth in §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.17.html#t17c01s17-1-23" target="_blank">17-1-23</a></cite> or in the alternative, this section.

Anything outside or excluded from the stated purpose would not come under the facts and circumstances within §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t19c27s19-27-31" target="_self">19-27-31</a></cite>; accordingly, the chancery court would not have the jurisdiction, as otherwise granted by § 19-27-31, to approve the changes.

       <p>
   In a proceeding brought against a city to vacate a part of certain streets appearing in a municipal plat the chancery court properly overruled a general demurrer, denied certain affirmative defenses interposed by the city, and granted an interlocutory appeal from that decree, since a municipality does not have exclusive jurisdiction to close and vacate streets and alleys, particularly in situations where they have never been opened, and since the chancery court has authority under Code §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t19c27s19-27-31" target="_self">19-27-31</a></cite> to alter and vacate maps or plats, or any part thereof, under facts and circumstances coming within the statute, resulting in vacation fo the street or property affected.

       Where plaintiff in a suit brought chiefly to vacate a recorded map, fails to comply with this section [Code 1942, § 4283], and defendant failed to appear, and the court granted only a part of the relief prayed, the decree is invalid and not res judicata of the matter decided.

Prior to levying the tax specified by the railroad authority, the board of supervisors of each such county shall publish notice of its intention to levy same. The notice shall be published once each week for three (3) weeks in some newspaper having a general circulation in the county, but not less than twenty-one (21) days, nor more than sixty (60) days, intervening between the time of the first notice and the meeting at which said board proposes to levy the tax. If, within the time of giving notice, twenty percent (20%) or one thousand five hundred (1,500) of the qualified electors of the county, whichever is less, shall file a written protest against the levy of the tax, then the tax shall not be levied unless authorized by three-fifths (3/5) of the qualified electors of such county, voting at an election to be called and held for that purpose. If the tax levy fails to be authorized at an election held in a county included in the regional authority, then such tax levy shall not be made in any of the counties included in such regional authority.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Bonds authorized by resolution of the authority may be issued in one or more series and shall bear such date or dates, mature at such time or times, bear interest at such rate or rates, provided that the bonds of any issue shall not bear a greater overall maximum interest rate to maturity than that allowed in Section 75-17-103, be in such denomination or denominations, be in such form, either coupon or registered, carry such conversion or registration privileges, have such rank or priority, be executed in such manner, be payable in such medium of payment, at such place or places, and be subject to such terms of redemption (with or without premium) as such resolution, its trust indenture or mortgage may provide. No bond shall bear more than one (1) rate of interest; each bond shall bear interest from its date to its stated maturity date at the interest rate specified in the bid; all bonds of the same maturity shall bear the same rate of interest from date to maturity; all interest accruing on such bonds so issued shall be payable semiannually or annually, except that the first interest coupon attached to any such bond may be for any period not exceeding one (1) year.
     </p>
     <p>
      No interest payment shall be evidenced by more than one (1) coupon and neither cancelled nor supplemental coupons shall be permitted; the lowest interest rate specified for any bonds issued shall not be less than seventy percent (70%) of the highest interest rate specified for the same bond issue.
     </p>
     <p>
      Each interest rate specified in any bid must be in multiples of one-eighth of one percent (1/8 of 1%) or in multiples of one-tenth of one percent (1/10 of 1%). The denomination, form and place or places of payment of such bonds shall be fixed in the resolution or ordinance of the governing authorities issuing such bonds. Such bonds shall be executed by the manual or facsimile signature of the chairman and secretary of such authority, with the seal of the authority affixed thereto. At least one (1) signature on each bond shall be a manual signature, as specified in the resolution. The coupons may bear only the facsimile signatures of such chairman and secretary. No bonds shall be issued and sold under the provisions of this chapter for less than par and accrued interest.
     </p>
     <p>
      The bonds may be sold at not less than par at public sale held after notice published once at least five (5) days prior to such sale in a newspaper having a general circulation in the area of operation and in a financial newspaper published in the City of Jackson, Mississippi, or in the City of New York, New York. Such bonds may be sold at not less than par to the federal government at private sale without any public advertisement.
     </p>
     <p>
      In case any of the commissioners or officers of the authority whose signatures appear on any bonds or coupons shall cease to be such commissioners or officers before the delivery of such bonds, such signatures shall, nevertheless, be valid and sufficient for all purposes, the same as if such commissioners or officers had remained in office until such delivery. Any provision of any law to the contrary notwithstanding, any bonds issued pursuant to this chapter shall be fully negotiable.
     </p>
     <p>
      The determination of the authority, in the resolution authorizing the bonds, as to the classification of the railroad properties and facilities for which such bonds are authorized and as to the maximum period of usefulness shall be conclusive in any action or proceeding involving the validity of such bonds.

       § 19-29-35.
    Trust agreement securing bonds.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      In the discretion of the authority, the bonds may be further secured by a trust agreement by and between the authority and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank incorporated under the laws of the United States or the laws of any state in the United States. Any such trust agreement may pledge or assign income, fees or any other revenues and receipts to be received from a lessee or other user of railroad properties and facilities, whether or not they are related thereto. The bonds may be additionally secured by a mortgage, deed of trust or other security interest upon the railroad properties and facilities vesting in the trustee power to sell such project for the payment of indebtedness, power to operate a project and all other powers and authority for the further security of the bonds. The trust agreement may evidence a pledge of all or any part of the revenues to be derived from the project for the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the bonds as the same shall become due and payable and may provide for the creation and maintenance of reserves. Any such trust agreement or any resolution providing for the issuance of bonds may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the holders thereof as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of the law, including the duties of the authority and the lessee or other user in relation to the railroad properties and facilities and any construction, improvement, maintenance, repair, operation and insurance of same for which such bonds have been issued, and the custody, safekeeping, guarding and application of all moneys. Any such trust agreement may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee, and may restrict the individual right of action by bondholders as is customary in trust agreements or trust indentures securing bonds and debentures of corporations. In addition to the foregoing, any such trust agreement may contain such provisions as the authority may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders and may also contain provisions governing the issuance of bonds to replace lost, stolen or mutilated bonds. All expenses incurred by the authority in carrying out the provisions of such trust agreement may be treated as a part of the costs of the operation of the railroad properties and facilities with respect to which the bonds have been issued. Any trust agreement made in accordance with the provisions of this chapter may contain a provision that, in the event of a default in the payment of the principal of, redemption premium, if any, or the interest on the bonds issued in accordance with or relating to such agreement, or in the performance of any agreement contained in the proceedings, trust agreement or instruments relating to such bonds, such payment and performance may be enforced by mandamus or by the appointment of a receiver in equity with power to charge and collect rates, rents or contract payments and to apply the revenues from the project in accordance with such proceedings, trust agreement or instrument. Any mortgage or deed of trust to secure bonds issued in accordance with the provisions of this chapter may also provide that in the event of a default in the payment thereof or in the violation of any agreement contained in the mortgage or deed of trust, the property secured by the mortgage or deed of trust may be foreclosed and sold under proceedings in equity or in any other manner now or hereinafter permitted by law. Such mortgage or deed of trust may also provide that any trustee under such mortgage or deed of trust, or the holder of any of the bonds secured thereby, may become the purchaser at any foreclosure sale if it is the highest bidder therefor.
     </p>
     <p>
      The powers herein granted may be exercised whether or not a trust agreement is entered into and, if no trust agreement is entered into, such provisions as are above authorized may be set out in the resolution authorizing the bonds.

    Legislative findings.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The Legislature finds that:
     </p>
     <p>
      There is a need for uniform, focused and fair procedures in state law to provide a reasonable alternative for the establishment, power, operation and duration of independent districts to manage and finance basic public improvement services; and that, based upon a proper and fair determination of applicable facts, an independent district can constitute a timely, efficient, effective, responsive and economic way to deliver these basic services, thereby providing a solution to the state’s planning, management and financing needs for delivery of capital infrastructure in order to service projected growth without overburdening counties and municipalities and their taxpayers.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is the legislative intent and purpose to authorize a uniform procedure by general law to establish an independent special district as an alternative method to manage and finance basic services for public improvements through the levy and collection of special assessments. It is further the legislative intent and purpose to provide by general law for the uniform operation, exercise of power and procedure for termination of any such independent district. It is further the purpose and intent of the Legislature that a district created under this chapter not have or exercise any zoning or permitting power. It is further the purpose and intent of the Legislature that no debt or obligation of a district shall constitute a burden on any local government without its consent.

   A public improvement district (PID) has the authority to acquire existing infrastructure improvements from a developer for any of the purposes enumerated in this section.

This opinion presumes that there was no prior agreement or understanding between the developer and the PID or its members for the PID to purchase the improvements once constructed.
