       On June 26, 2015, the Supreme Court of the United States, in the case of
       <i>
        Obergefell v. Hodges
       </i>
       (2015 U.S. LEXIS 4250), held that under the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, same-sex couples have a fundamental right to marry, and that since same-sex couples can exercise the fundamental right to marry in all states, there is no lawful basis for a state to refuse to recognize a lawful same-sex marriage performed in another state on the ground of its same-sex character.

       Mississippi’s same-sex marriage ban violated the Fourteenth Amendment Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses as it deprived same-sex couples and their children of equal dignity under the law, and gay and lesbian citizens could not be subjected to second-class citizenship. Campaign for Southern Equal. v. Bryant, 64 F. Supp. 3d 906, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 165913 (S.D. Miss. 2014), aff'd, 791 F.3d 625, 2015 U.S. App. LEXIS 11581 (5th Cir. Miss. 2015), in part, 197 F.

       Same-sex couples had standing to challenge Mississippi’s same-sex marriage ban as they were all residents of Mississippi, where they were subject to laws which denied the first couple the right to marry and denied recognition of the second couple’s out-of-state marriage, and Mississippi law caused them other substantial harms affecting their and their children’s lives; a gay and lesbian advocacy group had standing to sue on behalf of its members, which allegedly suffered the same injuries as the couples, plus additional injuries. Campaign for Southern Equal. v. Bryant, 64 F. Supp. 3d 906, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 165913 (S.D. Miss. 2014), aff'd, 791 F.3d 625, 2015 U.S. App. LEXIS 11581 (5th Cir. Miss. 2015), in part, 197 F.

   A chancellor properly set aside a separate maintenance agreement where the parties’ marriage was void under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c01s93-1-1" target="_self">93-1-1</a></cite> because they were uncle and niece; equitable estoppel was not available, since the parties had equal access to all the facts and ample opportunity to investigate the legality of the marriage, and public policy prevented validation of the void marriage by the doctrine of estoppel.

       A circuit clerk may issue a marriage license to a couple who have met the statutory conditions precedent. Westbrook, January 16, 1998, A.G. Op. #98-0002.

       A medical certificate expires in 30 days for purposes of filing an application for a marriage license.
   Dunn, October 16, 1998, A.G. Op. #98-0638.
      </p>
      <p>
       If two applicants for a marriage license present the application and proper medical certificate dated within 30 days prior to the application and return after the 30 day period has expired to obtain the license, the circuit clerk may issue the license, and the applicants will not be required to obtain a new medical certificate and present a new application.

      <p>
       A circuit clerk must make the factual determination that a document does substantiate an applicant’s age and date of birth before a marriage license may be lawfully issued, and it is left to the discretion of the circuit clerk as to what steps are appropriate in making such determinations.

       Legal relationship of husband and wife may be created only in conformity with procedures authorized by statute. Pickens v. Pickens, 490 So. 2d 872, 1986 Miss. LEXIS 2503 (Miss. 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section [Code 1942, § 465] and paragraph (14) of Code 1942, § 6998-02, which defines “widow” for the purposes of the workmen’s compensation law, must be construed together. South Cent. Heating & Plumbing Co. v. Dependents of Campbell, 219 So. 2d 140, 1969 Miss. LEXIS 1413 (Miss. 1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where decedent and his alleged surviving widow, in good faith and with the bona fide intention of becoming man and wife, had entered into a ceremonial marriage in 1896 under a regular license, thinking that his first wife was dead, when, in fact, she did not die until 1923, such marriage became lawful and valid upon the death of the first wife, without any new or different understanding or intention between them, so that second wife was his lawful widow and their offspring became and were legitimate children, entitled to share in his estate with the offspring of the first marriage. Johnson v. Johnson, 196 Miss. 768, 17 So. 2d 805, 1944 Miss. LEXIS 255 (Miss. 1944).
      </p>
      <p>
       Marriage of parties who had right to marry without consent of anyone held not invalidated because of noncompliance with statute in that father of the wife, and a kinsman of the husband, had obtained the license for the marriage, in view of manifest purpose of statute to prevent runaway marriages by juveniles below the age of consent. Zeigler v. Zeigler, 174 Miss. 302, 164 So. 768, 1935 Miss. LEXIS 89 (Miss. 1935).

      <p>
       Cohabitation which had not ripened into a common law marriage prior to April 5, 1956 is wholly inoperative to vest marital rights to either party thereto. Pickens v. Pickens, 490 So. 2d 872, 1986 Miss. LEXIS 2503 (Miss. 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       A new agreement between persons who continued to cohabit after the removal of an impediment which rendered a ceremonial marriage invalid, is not necessary to a valid common-law marriage. In re Estate of Barker, 236 Miss. 436, 110 So. 2d 615, 1959 Miss. LEXIS 337 (Miss. 1959).
      </p>
      <p>
       If the parties are in good repute, cohabitation and reputation have more weight as proof of the common-law marriage. Butler's Estate v. McQuarters, 210 Miss. 86, 48 So. 2d 617, 1950 Miss. LEXIS 324 (Miss. 1950).
      </p>
      <p>
       A common-law marriage, that is an agreement between a man and woman who then and there become a husband and wife followed by cohabitation is recognized in this state. Butler's Estate v. McQuarters, 210 Miss. 86, 48 So. 2d 617, 1950 Miss. LEXIS 324 (Miss. 1950).
      </p>
      <p>
       There is strong presumption in favor of validity of ceremonial marriage as against prior alleged common law marriage. Whitman v. Whitman, 206 Miss. 838, 41 So. 2d 22, 1949 Miss. LEXIS 305 (Miss. 1949).
      </p>
      <p>
       Law favors marriage, and, when once solemnized according to forms of law, will not declare its nullity upon anything less than clear and certain testimony, especially after it has been dissolved by death of one of the parties. Whitman v. Whitman, 206 Miss. 838, 41 So. 2d 22, 1949 Miss. LEXIS 305 (Miss. 1949).

      <p>
       A common-law marriage in this state is as valid and binding as the statutory ceremonial marriage. D'Antonio v. State, 187 Miss. 648, 191 So. 281, 1939 Miss. LEXIS 78 (Miss. 1939).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence that a man and woman lived and cohabited together as man and wife for several months and openly proclaimed that relationship, constitutes a valid common-law marriage. D'Antonio v. State, 187 Miss. 648, 191 So. 281, 1939 Miss. LEXIS 78 (Miss. 1939).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence that the defendant had lived with a distant cousin for several months as man and wife and that they openly proclaimed that relationship, at a time prior to his ceremonial marriage to another, sustained a conviction for bigamy, notwithstanding the failure of the state to allege and prove ceremonial marriage as regards defendant’s first marriage. D'Antonio v. State, 187 Miss. 648, 191 So. 281, 1939 Miss. LEXIS 78 (Miss. 1939).
      </p>

       Attempted common-law marriage alleged to have been contracted in Mississippi before adoption of amendment providing that requirement should not invalidate any marriage good at common law was void. Olivari v. Clark, 175 Miss. 883, 168 So. 465, 1936 Miss. LEXIS 85 (Miss. 1936).
      </p>
      <p>
       Marriage valid at common law is recognized in Mississippi. Sykes v. Sykes, 162 Miss. 487, 139 So. 853, 1932 Miss. LEXIS 155 (Miss. 1932); Jourdan v. Jourdan, 181 Miss. 176, 179 So. 268, 1938 Miss. LEXIS 59 (Miss. 1938); D'Antonio v. State, 187 Miss. 648, 191 So. 281, 1939 Miss. LEXIS 78 (Miss. 1939); Butler's Estate v.

       Marriage arises from an agreement between a man and woman, qualified for such relation, to become husband and wife, followed by cohabitation, whether or not a license was obtained therefor. Sims v. Sims, 122 Miss. 745, 85 So. 73, 1920 Miss. LEXIS 474 (Miss. 1920).

       Decedent’s survivors sought to recover proceeds from a bank account that a joint tenant shared with decedent; because the two were cohabitating and were not married, a confidential relationship existed, which led to a presumption of undue influence.

       Where one party claims a valid common-law marriage but both of the parties to the claimed common-law marriage subsequently enter into ceremonial marriages without securing a divorce, such parties are estopped to claim there was a mutual agreement to become common-law husband and wife.

       Since the burden rested upon a wife, in attacking the validity of her second marriage, to establish by a search of the records in the city where her first husband had lived following their separation, or by other competent evidence, that there had been no divorce, in the absence of such showing the presumption of the validity of the wife’s ceremonial marriage to the second husband prevailed, thus defeating her claim as the common law dependent wife of an alleged third husband contracted during the second husband’s lifetime.

       It was not error to permit, in a manslaughter trial, the alleged common law husband of the defendant to testify against her for the reason that he had a living wife and could not contract another marriage, there being nothing in the record to show that the defendant and her alleged common law husband agreed to be man and wife under the common law rule, and, moreover, under the provisions of Code 1942, § 465.5, common law marriages had been abolished in Mississippi before defendant began to cohabit with the alleged common-law husband.

   The Universal Life Church is enough of a “religious body” and a minister of that church is enough of a “spiritual leader” to qualify to perform rights of matrimony under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c01s93-1-17" target="_self">93-1-17</a></cite>.

       Every presumption will be indulged in favor of the validity of a marriage solemnized according to the forms of law. Alabama & V. R. Co. v. Beardsley, 79 Miss. 417, 30 So. 660, 1901 Miss. LEXIS 57 (Miss. 1901); Ladner v. Pigford, 138 Miss. 461, 103 So. 218, 1925 Miss. LEXIS 64 (Miss. 1925).

       Presumption of validity attaching to a ceremonial marriage and the burden resting on one who assails it as bigamous to prove not only a former marriage but also that it was then subsisting, is supported by sound public policy.

      <p>
       Ceremonial marriage raises presumption that any former marriages of either party have been dissolved either by death or divorce and burden of overcoming such presumption rests on party asserting invalidity of subsequent marriage. Wallace v. Herring, 207 Miss. 658, 43 So. 2d 100, 1949 Miss. LEXIS 377 (Miss. 1949).
      </p>
      <p>
       Presumption arising from subsequent ceremonial marriage that prior marriages have been dissolved by divorce is one of the strongest presumptions known to law and will prevail unless overcome by competent evidence to contrary. Wallace v. Herring, 207 Miss. 658, 43 So. 2d 100, 1949 Miss. LEXIS 377 (Miss. 1949).
      </p>
      <p>
       There is strong presumption in favor of validity of ceremonial marriage as against prior alleged common law marriage. Whitman v. Whitman, 206 Miss. 838, 41 So. 2d 22, 1949 Miss. LEXIS 305 (Miss. 1949).
      </p>
      <p>
       Presumption of marriage from cohabitation and reputation is rebutted or overcome by proof of subsequent ceremonial or actual marriage, since presumption of validity of such marriage is stronger than presumption of previous marriage from cohabitation and reputation. Whitman v. Whitman, 206 Miss. 838, 41 So. 2d 22, 1949 Miss. LEXIS 305 (Miss. 1949).

      </p>
      <p>
       The presumption that a marriage solemnized according to law is valid is superior to the presumption of life. Sullivan v. Grand Lodge, K. P., 97 Miss. 218, 52 So. 360, 1910 Miss. LEXIS 231 (Miss. 1910); Ladner v. Pigford, 138 Miss. 461, 103 So. 218, 1925 Miss. LEXIS 64 (Miss. 1925).

       Law favors marriage, and, when once solemnized according to forms of law, will not declare its nullity upon anything less than clear and certain testimony, especially after it has been dissolved by death of one of the parties. Whitman v. Whitman, 206 Miss. 838, 41 So. 2d 22, 1949 Miss. LEXIS 305 (Miss. 1949).

       Acts and declarations of the parties, general repute in the family, and declarations of deceased relatives may be used to establish the fact of marriage. McAllum v. Spinks, 129 Miss. 237, 91 So. 694, 1922 Miss. LEXIS 13 (Miss. 1922).
      </p>
      <p>
       Testimony held sufficient to establish validity of a second marriage in the absence of opposing testimony that the first husband was not dead. Taylor v. Garrett, 101 Miss. 660, 57 So. 658, 1911 Miss. LEXIS 127 (Miss. 1911).
      </p>

       Where evidence shows that insured was not divorced from his first wife a second marriage was invalid. Sullivan v. Grand Lodge, K. P., 97 Miss. 218, 52 So. 360, 1910 Miss. LEXIS 231 (Miss. 1910).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where plaintiff lived with her first husband most of the time but not continuously in the county of their marriage until plaintiff’s second marriage, the jury may find, from the fact that the records of such county did not show a divorce and from other testimony, that there was no divorce from the first marriage. Colored Knights of Pythias v. Tucker, 92 Miss. 501, 46 So. 51, 1908 Miss. LEXIS 197 (Miss. 1908).
      </p>
      <p>
       The jury must determine whether the presumption of the validity of a second marriage was overcome by the evidence that no divorce had been obtained from the first. Colored Knights of Pythias v. Tucker, 92 Miss. 501, 46 So. 51, 1908 Miss. LEXIS 197 (Miss. 1908).

       Where the parties were separated several years and the husband won $ 2,600,000 in a lottery shortly before the divorce but did not disclose this, in the wife’s modification action for alimony and an equitable division of property, a remand was required for a determination under the applicable case law of whether the lottery ticket constituted marital property under Hemsley, and if so, for an equitable division pursuant to Ferguson; in light of the husband’s failure to disclose the winnings, and in light of Miss. Unif. Ch. Ct. R. 8.05, the chancery court also erred in denying the wife’s motion for contempt. Kalman v. Kalman, 905 So. 2d 760, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 1101 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).

       Father argued that the award of the marital home to the mother was an affront to basic principles of equity, primarily because of her adulterous relationship. However, the mother had primarily “maintained the marital home,” it was close to her extended family, and in fact, it had been given to the parties by the mother’s father; further, the father was awarded sole possession of his retirement benefits, and therefore, there was no inequity. Sandlin v. Sandlin, 906 So. 2d 39, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 1115 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).

       Mother asserted the chancellor erred in his division of the marital property because she was left with a deficit, that the father’s income was almost three times that of her own, and that she should have been awarded alimony. However, the denial of alimony certainly did not leave the mother destitute, the property division was otherwise equitable, and there was no error in the chancellor’s decision to deny alimony.

Burke v. Massachusetts Bonding & Ins. Co., 19 So. 2d 647 (La.App. 1 Cir. 1944), aff'd, 24 So. 2d 875, 1946 La. LEXIS 707 (La. 1946).

   Married couple’s motion for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 50 was denied with respect to the jury’s determination that the wife was not entitled to recover for loss of consortium under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c03s93-3-1" target="_self">93-3-1</a></cite> because, in light of the husband’s testimony, the jury had a basis to conclude that his ability to engage in the same leisure activities, such as fishing, he enjoyed before he became sick undercut his and his wife’s assertions that he was unable to engage in the same conjugal activities he pursued before he became sick. Further, the wife testified that the husband retained the ability to cook meals, mow the lawn, and so on, which provide a basis for the jury to conclude that normal aging explained his inability to engage in certain conjugal activities and that his activity level had not diminished to the extent that the couple claimed; and, while the wife pointed to many activities, including conjugal ones, that the husband no longer pursues, she did not provide testimony for determining a baseline with respect to the prior level of most of those activities, or when exactly they began to fade away. Jowers v. BOC Group, Inc., 608 F. Supp. 2d 724, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 28806 (S.D. Miss. 2009), vacated, in part, 617 F.3d 346, 2010 U.S. App. LEXIS 17862 (5th Cir. Miss. 2010).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Trial court erred in awarding a wife loss of consortium damages pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c03s93-3-1" target="_self">93-3-1</a></cite> because the evidence offered was insufficient to support the wife’s claim; she failed to show how her husband’s injuries affected his relationship with her such that she suffered a compensable injury. Coho Res., Inc. v. McCarthy, 829 So. 2d 1, 2002 Miss. LEXIS 208 (Miss. 2002).
      </p>
      <p>
       An action for loss of consortium survives the death of the party asserting it, and may be brought as any other action by the executor or administrator or personal representative of the deceased party. Flight Line, Inc. v. Tanksley, 608 So. 2d 1149, 1992 Miss. LEXIS 447 (Miss. 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       When a loss resulting from injury to a person may be recovered by either the injured person or another person, e.g., for loss of consortium, a judgment for or against the injured party has preclusive effect on any such other person’s claim for the loss to the same extent as upon the injured person. A judgment for or against any such other person precludes recovery by or on behalf of the injured person of any loss that could have been recovered in the first action. When a person with a family relationship to one suffering personal injury has a claim for loss to himself or herself resulting from the injury, the determination of issues in an action by the injured person to recover for his or her injuries is preclusive against the family member, unless the judgment was based on a defense that is unavailable against the family member in the second action. McCoy v. Colonial Baking Co., 572 So. 2d 850, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 714 (Miss. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       A defense available against a plaintiff in his or her personal injury action is available against the spouse’s derivative consortium action. Byrd v. Matthews, 571 So. 2d 258, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 698 (Miss. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       A loss of consortium action is derivative, and contributory negligence applies, because the action lies on account of injuries to the other spouse. Thus, an award to a wife for loss of consortium should have been reduced by the contributory negligence of her husband. Choctaw, Inc. v. Wichner, 521 So. 2d 878, 1988 Miss. LEXIS 120 (Miss. 1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       Exclusivity provisions of Workers’ Compensation Act preclude consortium claim by wife of injured claimant in actions falling within scope of Act. Stevens v. FMC Corp., 515 So. 2d 928, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2883 (Miss. 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       The loss of consortium is the loss of any or all of the wife’s rights to society, companionship, love, affection, aid, services, support, sexual relations and the comfort of her husband as special rights and duties growing out of the marriage covenant, the right to live together in the same house, to eat at the same table, and to participate together in the activities, duties and responsibilities necessary to make a home. Tribble v. Gregory, 288 So. 2d 13, 1974 Miss. LEXIS 1835 (Miss. 1974).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   The damages recoverable by a wife in an action for loss of consortium under Code 1972 §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c03s93-3-1" target="_self">93-3-1</a></cite> must be limited to avoid double recovery for the same damages by both husband and wife. Tribble v. Gregory, 288 So. 2d 13, 1974 Miss. LEXIS 1835 (Miss. 1974).
      </p>
      <p>
       Consortium does not consist alone of intangible mental and emotional elements, but may include services performed by the husband for the wife which have a monetary value. Tribble v. Gregory, 288 So. 2d 13, 1974 Miss. LEXIS 1835 (Miss. 1974).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   The recovery allowable under Code 1972 §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c03s93-3-1" target="_self">93-3-1</a></cite> is limited so as to eliminate recovery by the wife for loss of financial support by the husband, recovery for nursing services and recovery for pain and suffering of the husband because these are items that may be recovered by the husband in his suit. Tribble v. Gregory, 288 So. 2d 13, 1974 Miss. LEXIS 1835 (Miss. 1974).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where wife testified that she and her husband had had sexual relations about once a week before his injuries, but none since then, that she was deprived of his physical assistance in the usual and ordinary duties in and about the home and grounds, that they were not able to engage in activities after his injuries such as attending picture shows, church suppers, picnics and visiting friends, that her husband had a bed wetting problem, that without his assistance most of her time off from her job was spent in household duties, and that she was more nervous since the accident because of having to stay at home and wait on her husband, an award of $20,000 for loss of consortium was not so large that it evinced bias and prejudice on the part of the jury. Tribble v. Gregory, 288 So. 2d 13, 1974 Miss. LEXIS 1835 (Miss. 1974).

       Although wife can sue her husband, she has no cause of action in tort against him for injuries inflicted upon her by his negligence. Burke v. Massachusetts Bonding & Ins. Co., 19 So. 2d 647 (La.App. 1 Cir. 1944), aff'd, 24 So. 2d 875, 1946 La. LEXIS 707 (La. 1946).

       Wife, injured as result of alleged negligence of husband in automobile accident, could not maintain action against husband’s liability insurer, since tort claimant cannot maintain direct action against insurer but must first sue the insured, obtain judgment, and otherwise exhaust his remedies against the insured, and wife has no cause of action against husband for personal tort.

It shall not be lawful for the husband to rent the wife’s plantation, houses, horses, mules, wagons, carts, or other implements, and with them, or with any of her means, to operate and carry on business in his own name or on his own account, but all business done with the means of the wife by the husband shall be deemed and held to be on her account and for her use, and by the husband as her agent and manager in business, as to all persons dealing with him without notice, unless the contract between the husband and wife which changes this relation, be evidenced by writing, subscribed by them, duly acknowledged, and filed with the chancery clerk of the county where such business may be done, to be recorded as other instruments.

       The limitation of one year after receipt against proceedings to hold a husband or his representative accountable to his wife for the income or profits of her estate under this section [Code 1942, § 456], has no application to a proceeding by a widow to recover money in bank, being such income and profits deposited by her deceased husband in his own name, her purpose being the recovery of her own money and not the establishment of a claim against her husband’s estate.

       § 93-5-1.
    Causes for divorce.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Divorces from the bonds of matrimony may be decreed to the injured party for any one or more of the following twelve (12) causes:
     </p>
     <p>
      First. Natural impotency.
     </p>
     <p>
      Second. Adultery, unless it should appear that it was committed by collusion of the parties for the purpose of procuring a divorce, or unless the parties cohabited after a knowledge by complainant of the adultery.
     </p>
     <p>
      Third. Being sentenced to any penitentiary, and not pardoned before being sent there.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fourth. Willful, continued and obstinate desertion for the space of one (1) year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fifth. Habitual drunkenness.
     </p>
     <p>
      Sixth. Habitual and excessive use of opium, morphine or other like drug.
     </p>
     <p>
      Seventh. Habitual cruel and inhuman treatment, including spousal domestic abuse.
     </p>
     <p>
      Spousal domestic abuse may be established through the reliable testimony of a single credible witness, who may be the injured party, and includes, but is not limited to:
     </p>
     <p>
      That the injured party’s spouse attempted to cause, or purposely, knowingly or recklessly caused bodily injury to the injured party, or that the injured party’s spouse attempted by physical menace to put the injured party in fear of imminent serious bodily harm; or
     </p>
     <p>
      That the injured party’s spouse engaged in a pattern of behavior against the injured party of threats or intimidation, emotional or verbal abuse, forced isolation, sexual extortion or sexual abuse, or stalking or aggravated stalking as defined in Section 97-3-107, if the pattern of behavior rises above the level of unkindness or rudeness or incompatibility or want of affection.
     </p>
     <p>
      Eighth. Having mental illness or an intellectual disability at the time of marriage, if the party complaining did not know of that infirmity.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ninth. Marriage to some other person at the time of the pretended marriage between the parties.
     </p>
     <p>
      Tenth. Pregnancy of the wife by another person at the time of the marriage, if the husband did not know of the pregnancy.
     </p>
     <p>
      Eleventh. Either party may have a divorce if they are related to each other within the degrees of kindred between whom marriage is prohibited by law.
     </p>
     <p>
      Twelfth. Incurable mental illness. However, no divorce shall be granted upon this ground unless the party with mental illness has been under regular treatment for mental illness and causes thereof, confined in an institution for persons with mental illness for a period of at least three (3) years immediately preceding the commencement of the action. However, transfer of a party with mental illness to his or her home for treatment or a trial visit on prescription or recommendation of a licensed physician, which treatment or trial visit proves unsuccessful after a bona fide effort by the complaining party to effect a cure, upon the reconfinement of the party with mental illness in an institution for persons with mental illness, shall be regular treatment for mental illness and causes thereof, and the period of time so consumed in seeking to effect a cure or while on a trial visit home shall be added to the period of actual confinement in an institution for persons with mental illness in computing the required period of three (3) years confinement immediately preceding the beginning of the action. No divorce shall be granted because of mental illness until after a thorough examination of the person with mental illness by two (2) physicians who are recognized authorities on mental diseases. One (1) of those physicians shall be either the superintendent of a state psychiatric hospital or institution or a veterans hospital for persons with mental illness in which the patient is confined, or a member of the medical staff of that hospital or institution who has had the patient in charge. Before incurable mental illness can be successfully proven as a ground for divorce, it shall be necessary that both of those physicians make affidavit that the patient is a person with mental illness at the time of the examination, and both affidavits shall be made a part of the permanent record of the divorce proceedings and shall create the prima facie presumption of incurable mental illness, such as would justify a divorce based on that ground. Service of process shall be made on the superintendent of the hospital or institution in which the defendant is a patient. If the patient is in a hospital or institution outside the state, process shall be served by publication, as in other cases of service by publication, together with the sending of a copy by registered mail to the superintendent of the hospital or institution. In addition, process shall be served upon the next blood relative and guardian, if any. If there is no legal guardian, the court shall appoint a guardian ad litem to represent the interest of the person with mental illness. The relative or guardian and superintendent of the hospital or institution shall be entitled to appear and be heard upon any and all issues. The status of the parties as to the support and maintenance of the person with mental illness shall not be altered in any way by the granting of the divorce.
     </p>
     <p>
      However, in the discretion of the chancery court, and in those cases as the court may deem it necessary and proper, before any such decree is granted on the ground of incurable mental illness, the complainant, when ordered by the court, shall enter into bond, to be approved by the court, in such an amount as the court may think just and proper, conditioned for the care and keeping of the person with mental illness during the remainder of his or her natural life, unless the person with mental illness has a sufficient estate in his or her own right for that purpose.

      </h4>
      <p>
       Pursuant to
   Section 1-1-109, the Joint Legislative Committee on Compilation, Revision and Publication of Legislation corrected an error in the eighth sentence of the Twelfth clause. The word “an” preceding “hospital or institution” was changed to “a” so that “If the patient is in an hospital or institution” reads “If the patient is in a hospital or institution.” The Joint Committee ratified the correction at its August 5, 2008, meeting.

        Amendment Notes —
       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       The 2008 amendment substituted “party with mental illness,” “person/s with mental illness,” “mental illness” and “psychiatric hospital or institution or a veterans hospital for persons with mental illness” for references to “insanity,” “idiocy,” “insane party,” “the insane,” “state hospital or the veterans hospital for the insane” and “institution for the insane” throughout.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 2010 amendment substituted “Having mental illness or an intellectual disability” for “Mental illness or mental retardation” in the eighth clause.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 2017 amendment, in the Seventh cause, added “including spousal domestic abuse” at the end of the first paragraph, and added the second through fourth paragraphs.

       In a no-fault divorce, the record showed that the line of questioning at issue (primarily cross-examination of the husband), was not intended to establish that he had abandoned the wife by his leaving the marital home before the marriage, but was for the purpose of establishing time lines and the financial contributions of the parties. The questioning was also to determine how the payments of the wife’s vehicle were being made, not to establish fault; there was no indication that the husband’s having left the marital home was the driving factor in establishing the alimony award to the wife, and in any event, the fact that both spouses agreed to a divorce did not eliminate the consideration of the fault factor. Patterson v. Patterson, 917 So. 2d 111, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 432 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 921 So. 2d 1279, 2005 Miss. LEXIS 812 (Miss. 2005).

       A chancellor erred in granting a divorce where the chancellor concluded that the parties had not proved any grounds for divorce but they were not going to be able to live together, since a chancellor does not have the authority to grant a divorce unless the facts and the law warrant it. Lewis v. Lewis, 602 So. 2d 881, 1992 Miss. LEXIS 401 (Miss. 1992).

       The fact that a divorced plaintiff continued to live under the same roof with the defendant after filing the complaint is a heavy factor to be weighed in considering whether he or she has a valid cause, though it does not in and of itself compel a denial of divorce; it is conceivably possible for valid grounds for divorce to exist despite this. Lawyers representing persons seeking a divorce have the obligation to advise and warn them about the undesirability of continuing to live in the same household following the filing of the suit, and they have the obligation to seek and press for a temporary hearing before the chancellor to secure alimony pendente lite and temporary support money. Jethrow v. Jethrow, 571 So. 2d 270, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 700 (Miss. 1990).

   The problem with §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c05s93-5-2" target="_self">93-5-2</a></cite> is that it requires all financial matters incident to the divorce to be resolved by voluntary agreement. Section<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c05s93-5-2" target="_self">93-5-2</a></cite> blithely proceeds on the premise that parties having irreconcilable differences regarding their marriage will somehow be able to reconcile their differences on financial matters. What is needed is a simple amendment to §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c05s93-5-1" target="_self">93-5-1</a></cite> providing for a thirteenth ground for divorce: irreconcilable differences. That ground for divorce should be subject to proof as any other. The defendant’s denial should have no more effect than his or her denial in the case of any of the other 12 grounds for divorce. That one spouse out of blindness, obstinance or nostalgia refuses to recognize it hardly means that a marriage may not in fact be irretrievably broken. Most important, the defending spouse’s refusal to agree on financial matters would be no bar to the granting of a divorce because of irreconcilable differences. Wilson v. Wilson, 547 So. 2d 803, 1989 Miss. LEXIS 368 (Miss. 1989).

       There was no reversible error in the granting of a divorce on the grounds of habitual cruel and inhuman treatment rather than adultery, even though the court could just as easily have found grounds for divorce based on adultery as it did for habitual cruel and inhuman treatment, since any error was cured by the granting of the divorce.

       The chancery court acted beyond its statutory authority in awarding divorce on ground of irreconcilable differences where there was no written agreement of the parties regarding property rights, and husband had filed cross-complaint against wife whose complaint sought a divorce on grounds of adultery, habitual cruel and inhuman treatment, and, in the alternative, irreconcilable differences.

       Affidavits to bill for divorce, “that the causes for divorce stated in said bill are true as stated,” did not cover allegation in the bill as to the defendant’s non-residence and post-office address, since nonresidence is not a ground for divorce, and consequently there was no affidavit on which publication for the defendant could have been made.

       In a divorce action, a chancellor was well within her discretion in granting a divorce to a wife on the grounds of adultery, although the husband asserted that the wife also had adulterous affairs of her own, where there was abundant evidence of the husband’s adultery and where the husband failed to prove that the wife committed adultery prior to the parties’ separation. Dickerson v. Dickerson, 34 So.3d 637, 2010 Miss. App. LEXIS 202 (Miss. Ct. App. 2010).
      </p>
      <p>
       Divorce on the ground of adultery was properly granted because a tape recorded conversation between the husband and wife wherein the husband admitted to having engaged in two adulterous relationships was sufficient to support the chancellor’s finding that the wife proved adultery by clear and convincing evidence. Rodriguez v. Rodriguez, 2 So.3d 720, 2009 Miss. App. LEXIS 25 (Miss. Ct. App. 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a wife presented evidence that, inter alia, the husband and the husband’s secretary spent an excessive amount of time together, the husband let the secretary drive company vehicles, and the secretary began staying at the husband’s house shortly after the secretary left her own husband, it was not error to grant a divorce to the wife on the ground of uncondoned adultery by the husband, because the facts were sufficient to establish that the husband had an infatuation with the secretary sufficient to be an adulterous inclination and there was sufficient testimony that they had opportunities to consummate that inclination. Lister v. Lister, 981 So. 2d 340, 2008 Miss. App. LEXIS 288 (Miss. Ct. App. 2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       There was testimony that the husband and his female friend lived in the same apartment complex and that they spent a substantial amount of time together, and there was testimony that the girlfriend allegedly left the husband’s apartment in her robe, and that their vehicles were often parked side by side over night, though the identity of the girlfriend’s vehicle was controverted. The record also showed the chancellor focused on the lunches shared by the husband and his female friend, in which they would meet at the park, feed the ducks, and eat peanut butter and jelly sandwiches while discussing life’s problems; needless to say, the appellate court held the evidence presented did not rise above mere suspicion of adultery, and the chancellor’s grant of a divorce on said ground (where the parties had refused to agree to an irreconcilable differences divorce), and on the ground of habitual, cruel and inhuman treatment, where the record showed only repeated arguments between the couple, was reversed. Spence v. Spence, 930 So. 2d 415, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 547 (Miss. Ct. App. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a divorce case, while the chancellor failed to make specific findings of fact, there was sufficient evidence in the record, beginning with the wife’s admission of at least one act of extramarital intercourse, to support the grant of a divorce on the ground of adultery. In addition to the wife’s admission, the husband testified that the wife’s brother told him about the extramarital affair between his sister and another man, and the wife’s ex-sister-in-law testified that the wife and the other man had a relationship during the time the parties were living together. McClelland v. McClelland, 879 So. 2d 1096, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 760 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a husband admitted committing adultery, his wife was entitled to a divorce on the grounds of uncondoned adultery; that the husband’s adultery did not cause the wife to file for divorce was immaterial. Davis v. Davis, 832 So. 2d 492, 2002 Miss. LEXIS 390 (Miss. 2002).
      </p>
      <p>
       The wife’s own adultery did not prevent her from obtaining a divorce from the husband on the basis of his adultery where she testified that she did not meet her subsequent lover until after she and her husband had separated, that her “marriage was over,” and that her subsequent lover did nothing to contribute to the breakup of her marriage. Harmon v. Harmon, 757 So. 2d 305, 1999 Miss. App. LEXIS 677 (Miss. Ct. App. 1999).

       Adultery need not be causally related to the final separation of the parties to be a valid basis for granting a divorce. Talbert v. Talbert, 759 So. 2d 1105, 1999 Miss. LEXIS 240 (Miss. 1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence sustained a finding of adultery where (1) two witnesses testified to seeing the husband with a woman on various occasions, (2) a witness took photographs and video of the husband’s vehicle parked at the woman’s home overnight on two occasions, and (3) the husband admitted staying overnight with the woman but denied having sexual intercourse with her and maintained that they only talked about his marital problems.

       Adultery may be grounds for divorce based either on infatuation for particular person of the opposite sex or on spouse’s generally adulterous nature. Holden v. Frasher-Holden, 680 So. 2d 795, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 485 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       There must be evidence of spouse’s infatuation with another or of spouse’s generally adulterous nature before divorce may be granted on grounds of adultery. Holden v. Frasher-Holden, 680 So. 2d 795, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 485 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Spouse seeking divorce on grounds of adultery must show, by clear and convincing evidence, both an adulterous inclination and a reasonable opportunity to satisfy that inclination. Holden v. Frasher-Holden, 680 So. 2d 795, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 485 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Circumstantial evidence may be used to prove adultery, and, in light of secretive nature of adultery, spouse seeking divorce on those grounds need not present direct testimony as to the events at issue; nevertheless, the evidence must be logical, must tend to prove the facts charged, and must be inconsistent with a reasonable theory of innocence. Holden v. Frasher-Holden, 680 So. 2d 795, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 485 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Adultery may be shown either by evidence or by admissions. Holden v. Frasher-Holden, 680 So. 2d 795, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 485 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Divorce based on adultery was supported by evidence that husband telephoned “close friend,” that friend had stayed in husband’s travel trailer and kept her things there, that husband had stayed in friend’s home, that friend had addressed husband as her husband-to-be, that husband and friend had walked around a car show arm-in-arm, and that husband admitted that he and friend had kissed, hugged and danced, that he cared about her, and that marriage had been discussed. Holden v. Frasher-Holden, 680 So. 2d 795, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 485 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       The evidence was sufficient to provide clear and convincing proof of a husband’s adultery where he gave another woman numerous gifts, he admitted to sexual activity after leaving the wife, and he admitted that he loved the other woman, slept with her, lived with her, and kissed and embraced her, even though he maintained that his relationship with the woman was only one of friendship and that he was incapable of sexual intercourse because he was impotent. Brooks v. Brooks, 652 So. 2d 1113, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 152 (Miss. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       The evidence was insufficient to support the granting of a divorce on the ground of the wife’s adultery since the proof did not rise above mere suspicion of adultery where the evidence consisted primarily of photographs of the wife and her alleged paramour which were not inconsistent with a reasonable theory of innocence. McAdory v. McAdory, 608 So. 2d 695, 1992 Miss. LEXIS 600 (Miss. 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       A wife did not condone her husband’s adultery as a matter of law by continuing to live in the same house with him and sleep in the same bed while waiting for a second indiscretion as proof of adultery after the initial indiscretion, which was not conclusive. Cheatham v. Cheatham, 537 So. 2d 435, 1988 Miss. LEXIS 627 (Miss. 1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancellor was not manifestly wrong in granting divorce to husband on ground of adultery, which may be shown by either evidence or admissions, either of which is sufficient to support decree of divorce, where evidence showed wife had sexual intercourse with another man and her acts of adultery were uncondoned. Jordan v. Jordan, 510 So. 2d 131, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2628 (Miss. 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       Filing of second complaint by husband, grounded on wife’s adultery, which was inconsistent with first complaint based upon irreconcilable differences, constituted an effective withdrawal from and objection to the first complaint and, since wife had adequate notice, chancellor could grant divorce and custody of minor child to husband on second complaint, notwithstanding the parties’ earlier execution of child custody, child support, and property settlement agreements. McCleave v. McCleave, 491 So. 2d 522, 1986 Miss. LEXIS 2517 (Miss. 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       A wife’s constant association with a man other than her husband, her acceptance of valuable gifts from him, and her statement that she intended to marry this man if she could obtain a divorce from her husband and he from his wife, was sufficient when considered with other evidence to sustain a charge of adultery. Hodge v. Hodge, 186 So. 2d 748, 1966 Miss. LEXIS 1326 (Miss. 1966).
      </p>
      <p>
       Adultery on part of husband as ground of divorce is one involving moral turpitude and proof must be clear and convincing. McCraney v. McCraney, 208 Miss. 105, 43 So. 2d 872, 1950 Miss. LEXIS 232 (Miss. 1950).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where decree, in action by husband against wife first charging habitual cruel and inhuman treatment and later amended to charge adultery, failed to state the grounds upon which it was rendered, the supreme court would sustain the decree on the ground of adultery, where the evidence amply supported such charge. Winfield v. Winfield, 203 Miss. 391, 35 So. 2d 443, 1948 Miss. LEXIS 285 (Miss. 1948).
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact of adultery may be shown by proof or by admissions, the latter being sufficiently of record where a husband refused to answer a direct question whether it was true that he cohabited with a named co-respondent and his counsel stated that the allegation of adultery in the cross bill was not disputed.

       A chancellor erroneously evaluated the evidence of a husband’s alleged adultery under an incorrect quantum of proof where he found proof of adultery by a “preponderance of the evidence,” rather than the higher quantum of evidence, “clear and convincing evidence,” which is required to prove adultery.

      </p>
      <p>
       A chancellor did not err in denying a wife a divorce on the ground of adultery where the only evidence of the husband’s alleged “generally adulterous nature” was the wife’s testimony that he frequently cheated on her. Lewis v. Lewis, 602 So. 2d 881, 1992 Miss. LEXIS 401 (Miss. 1992).

      <p>
       Chancellor was not manifestly wrong in granting divorce to husband on ground of adultery, which may be shown by either evidence or admissions, either of which is sufficient to support decree of divorce, where evidence showed wife had sexual intercourse with another man and her acts of adultery were uncondoned.

      </p>
      <p>
       Where one spouse relies on circumstantial evidence as proof for allegations of adulterous activity on the part of the other spouse, he or she retains the burden of presenting satisfactory evidence sufficient to lead the trier of fact to the conclusion of guilt, but such evidence need not prove the alleged acts beyond a reasonable doubt. Dillon v. Dillon, 498 So. 2d 328, 1986 Miss. LEXIS 2749 (Miss. 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       Wife was entitled to a divorce on grounds of habitual cruel and inhuman treatment where wife testified that husband had hit her 15 or 20 times during course of their marriage, had cursed her on several occasions, had frequently questioned her fidelity to him, and had occasionally stayed out overnight, and wife’s testimony was supported in most important aspects by the testimony of the daughter and the son of the parties, where nothing in the record would substantiate a finding that the testimony of wife, son and daughter was incredible and unbelievable. Devereaux v. Devereaux, 493 So. 2d 1310, 1986 Miss. LEXIS 2627 (Miss. 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       Husband’s testimony, excluding that pertaining to alleged adultery, would not support a divorce on grounds of habitual cruel and inhuman treatment, where he testified that wife had cursed him on several occasions, that their sex life had decreased in frequency, that wife had been cold toward him since their reconciliation, and that he was suspicious of wife’s relation with another man. Moreover, with respect to the alleged adultery, since the alleged act occurred in the interim between an earlier divorce decree and the revocation of that decree, the wife was then a single woman and could not have committed adultery against her marital status with husband. Devereaux v. Devereaux, 493 So. 2d 1310, 1986 Miss. LEXIS 2627 (Miss. 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the husband’s evidence as to wife’s improper relationship with another man was sufficient to sustain the relief granted while, although she denied the existence of the circumstances complained about, the wife’s frank admissions were strong against her, the supreme court could not declare that the chancellor’s decree awarding the husband a divorce was manifestly wrong.

       Refusal to admit evidence of events occurring prior to wife’s previous suit which was dismissed following reconciliation and which was brought two years prior to the present action by the husband for divorce was not prejudicial even if erroneously rejected, since its probative value was not sufficient to support the cross bill or to effectively challenge the evidence supporting the original bill.

       Chancellor did not err in granting a wife a divorce on the ground of desertion because (1) the chancellor determined that the husband offered no testimony to contradict the wife’s assertion that the husband left the marital home and failed to return or resume any marital duties; and (2) the husband offered no proof that his failure to return to the home was the wife’s fault.

       Where, under conflicting evidence, it appeared that the wife had left her husband’s home in California under the guise of returning to the state to see a sick sister taking with her money which the parties had saved and borrowed to buy a home, and for three years the husband had provided the wife with funds for the support of the children, and that at no time did the wife say anything about returning to the husband although he would have received her back prior to the time of filing suit, and it was undisputed that the wife had been in the state for almost five years, the chancellor was justified in awarding husband a divorce on the ground of the wife’s wilful, continued, and obstinate desertion of her husband for more than 12 months, and in concluding that the wife was a bona fide resident of the state.

       In deciding whether to award a divorce to a husband on the ground of constructive desertion, the chancellor should have determined whether the husband sufficiently demonstrated that the wife’s conduct reasonably rendered the continuation of their marriage unendurable to the point that he was forced to leave and seek peace and safety elsewhere, and therefore the chancellor erred in denying a divorce on the ground of constructive desertion on the basis that the evidence was insufficient to show that the husband was “in fear of life, health, safety, or limb.” Benson v.

       In an action for divorce on grounds of constructive desertion, where the parties have been living apart under a separate maintenance decree granted to one of the parties, the plaintiff can show that, since the judgment for separate maintenance in favor of the defendant, the conditions have changed and the plaintiff has made efforts of reconciliation with the defendant with no avail, and hence the defendant is now a deserter and plaintiff is entitled to a divorce for desertion.

       Although the chancellor made no specific findings of fact, there was sufficient evidence in a divorce trial in the testimony from the wife and the husband’s parents to prove habitual drunkenness on the part of the husband.

       Chancellor did not err in dismissing the husband’s complaint for a divorce on the ground of habitual and excessive drug use as the record did not compel a finding that the wife’s use of prescription drugs was excessive in light of her serious health issues or that she misused the prescription drugs because the husband’s proof showed that the medication had been prescribed by a doctor for the wife’s very legitimate health problems; neither the pharmacy and medical records nor the testimony established that the wife had been diagnosed with an addiction to prescription pain medications or indicated that the wife’s drug use was excessive; and the evidence did not indicate that the wife was over-prescribed pain medication.

       Finding against the husband in his divorce action alleging habitual cruel and inhuman treatment and habitual and excessive use of opium, morphine, or other like drug, was inappropriate regardless of whether the affirmative defense of condonation was available to the wife because condonation of the wife’s drug use by sexual intercourse between the parties was conditioned on her ceasing to abuse drugs. The wife’s subsequent overdosing evidenced an intent not to abide by such condition. Ashburn v. Ashburn, 970 So. 2d 204, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 799 (Miss. Ct. App. 2007).

       Court properly granted a divorce on the ground of cruel and inhuman treatment because the wife was involved in a shoving match with the husband shortly after he had been so ill that she “thought he was having a heart attack.” Moreover, the court of appeals noted the impropriety of the wife’s act of forging the husband’s name to the savings bonds, cashing them without notifying him before doing so, and pretending to help him look for them afterward.

       Divorce was properly granted in favor of the wife where the husband’s habitual cruel and inhuman treatment was the precipitating cause of the deterioration of the parties’ marital relationship and the wife’s adultery occurred at least one year after she filed for divorce; the parties’ marital assets were equitably divided and the husband was held in contempt where he did not demonstrate his inability to make the monthly mortgage payments.

   Evidence was insufficient to support the trial court’s granting a divorce on the ground of habitual, cruel, and inhuman treatment because (1) in the course of the 19-year marriage, the wife cited to one isolated physical attack and verbal threat and the other accusations of the husband’s mean tricks, name-calling, and refusal to sleep with her fell more in the categories of mere unkindness, rudeness, and incompatibility than cruelty and (2) the corroborative evidence, which was required by Miss. Unif. Ch. Ct. R. 8.03, provided by the daughter was inconsistent with the wife’s testimony that the physical abuse was limited to the one choking incident; thus, the appellate court reversed and vacated the trial court’s judgment granting the wife a divorce based upon the statutory ground of habitual, cruel, and inhuman treatment pursuant to Miss.

       Trial court was manifestly in error in concluding that wife was subjected to habitual cruel and inhuman treatment, a statutory ground for divorce, insofar as husband would move out of their bedroom and return when he was ready to have sex with her, culminating in incident when husband grabbed wife in bedroom and requested sex, where both parties testified that husband never forced wife to have sex, wife testified that she did not seek any type of treatment for bad nerves that resulted from husband’s unpleasant behavior, and husband never hit wife or harmed her.

       In an action for divorce on the ground of the husband’s adultery, the husband’s counter-complaint for a divorce on the ground of habitual cruel and inhuman treatment was properly dismissed where the best that the husband could argue was that his wife was not congenial toward him, since more than “mere unkindness, rudeness, or incompatibility” is required to support the granting of a divorce on the ground of cruel and inhuman treatment.

       A chancellor erred in granting a divorce to both parties on the ground of habitual cruel and inhuman treatment, since the 2 parties to a divorce can not be both guilty and innocent of habitual cruel and inhuman treatment; in a situation where both parties are at fault, the chancellor must determine which party’s conduct was the proximate cause of the deterioration of the marital relationship and the divorce itself, and a divorce should be granted to the other party.

       In order that a divorce may be granted on grounds of habitual cruel and inhuman treatment, the treatment must be something more than mere unkindness or rudeness, something more than a mere incompatibility, want of affection, or lack of civil attention, it must be conduct so unkind as to be cruel, that is, so unreasonably harsh and servere as, naturally and reasonably, to inflict pain or suffering on the spouse.

       Cruel and inhuman treatment, unaccompanied by personal violence is such conduct only as endangers life, limb, or health, or creates reasonable apprehension of danger thereto, thereby rendering the continuance of the marital relation unsafe for the unoffending spouse or such unnatural of infamous conduct as would make the marital relation revolting to the unoffending spouse and render it impossible to discharge duties thereof.

       Mere marital unhappiness, no matter how intense it may be, caused or induced by ill treatment of one spouse by the other will not warrant divorce, unless it be of such a character, and so long persisted in, as actually to become dangerous to the life, limb or health of the other spouse, or to create a reasonable apprehension of such danger, and thus render further cohabitation unsafe for the unoffending spouse.

Ellzey v. Ellzey, 253 So. 2d 249, 1971 Miss. LEXIS 1213 (Miss. 1971).

       If the chancellor believed that the testimony showed that the defendant tried to shoot his wife, that incident alone was sufficient to establish the charge of cruel and inhuman treatment. Ellzey v. Ellzey, 253 So. 2d 249, 1971 Miss. LEXIS 1213 (Miss. 1971).

       Since a party can be granted a divorce based on incidents occurring after the parties have separated, there is no reason, on principle, why the fact that the parties have not been living together would render it legally impossible to establish cruel and inhuman treatment such as to justify a divorce. Day v. Day, 501 So. 2d 353, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2260 (Miss. 1987).

       Although wife, who was denied a divorce on her first complaint charging her husband with acts of cruel and inhuman treatment, could not relitigate the matter of the husband’s conduct prior to the dismissal of the first complaint, she was not precluded from litigating question of whether husband’s acts, if any, prior to the dismissal of first complaint aggregated with his acts after dismissal of first complaint, if any, constituted habitual cruel and inhuman treatment, even though the parties lived apart during the interim between the dismissal of the first complaint and filing of the second one.

       It is common sense that abuse or mistreatment of a person’s child may constitute cruelty to that person; chancery courts may consider evidence of child abuse or mistreatment as conduct supporting the grant of a divorce based on habitual cruel and inhuman treatment. Pittman v. Pittman, 195 So.3d 727, 2016 Miss. LEXIS 231 (Miss. 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a wife’s divorce action, the chancery court erred in granting a husband’s motion to dismiss because it did not apply the correct legal standard when it failed to consider acts of child mistreatment by the husband in assessing whether sufficient evidence of habitual cruel and inhuman treatment existed; the chancery court failed to make factual findings to which the supreme court had to defer regarding the violence the husband perpetuated in considering whether the wife defeated the motion.

       Sufficient evidence showed a husband’s habitual cruel and inhuman treatment because his wife’s testimony about his homosexual affairs and child molestation was corroborated. Jackson v.

       Grant of divorce in favor of the wife was appropriate because the cumulative effect of the degrading sexual behavior, cursing and yelling, habitual gambling, jealousy, and stalking, and the resulting negative effect to the wife’s health amounted to habitual cruel and inhuman treatment. The wife had testified about those behaviors and the adverse effects on her health. Harmon v. Harmon, 141 So.3d 37, 2014 Miss. App. LEXIS 308 (Miss. Ct. App. 2014).

   Due to multiple incidents of violent and cruel behavior, including a plate-throwing incident, destruction of the husband’s property post separation, and corrobation of the violent events from husband’s son, the appellate court agreed with the chancellor’s findings and find that the husband met his burden of proving his ground for a divorce of cruel and inhuman treatment under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c05s93-5-1ol12008" target="_self">93-5-1 (2008)</a></cite> by a preponderance of the evidence. Price v. Price, 22 So.3d 331, 2009 Miss.

       Wife presented more than ample evidence of diverse repugnant conduct and more corroborative evidence existed than just the singular testimony of a sole spouse claiming she was subjected to degrading and offensive sexual behavior by the offending spouse; the combination of the husband’s behaviors, including his sexual behavior, financial conduct, and his verbal degradation, were so repugnant to the wife to render her unable to perform her marital duties and sufficiently supported the grant of divorce on the ground of habitual cruel and inhuman treatment.

      <p>
       Divorce granted on the ground of habitual cruel and inhuman treatment was affired because the wife testified to numerous displays of violence by the husband, including his whipping her with a wet towel in front of friends, his throwing plates of food in her face when he was unhappy with what she had cooked, his giving her a black eye, his forcing her to abort their third child because of the expense of another child, and his frequent threats to kill her.

      <p>
       Chancellor did not err in granting the wife a divorce on the ground of habitual cruel and inhuman treatment given the husband’s demanding and manipulative behavior and two incidents that had rendered the relationship unsafe for the wife; the husband continually subjected the wife to demanding and manipulative behavior and accusations of infidelity, coupled with emotional isolation.

       Where a wife alleged that the husband committed adultery and physically and verbally abused the wife by hitting, punching, trying to strangle, and using a belt to whip the wife, it was error to deny a divorce based on the grounds of habitual cruel and inhuman treatment because (1) the wife offered testimony of physical and verbal abuse, (2) the wife provided sufficient corroboration to support the claim, and (3) the wife did not condone the abuse.

       Court properly granted a divorce to a wife where the husband’s regular drinking binges, foul language, rude and condescending behavior toward the wife and the children, mysterious expenditure of marital funds, and unexplained extended absences rose to the level of habitual cruel and inhuman treatment.

      </p>
      <p>
       The chancery court’s finding that the wife was not guilty of habitual cruel and inhuman treatment of her husband was supported by substantial evidence, even though the chancellor found that the wife’s efforts, attitude, and desires to live beyond her husband’s financial means were the cause of the parties’ separation, that the husband was justified in leaving the home under all the circumstances, and that resumption of the marriage would be impossible given the psychological background of the parties.

       Chancery court properly found that husband was not entitled to a divorce on ground of cruel and inhuman treatment, notwithstanding husband’s testimony that he could not talk with wife about family or other matters, that wife’s drinking contributed to the problem, that the wife refused to permit him to retrieve items of personal property from the home and their lock box, that wife had destroyed some of his personal items, and that her financial practices were an embarrassment.

       Marriage problems stemming from wife’s desire to pursue career and on disputes over money, arguments regarding sexual relations, husband’s criticism of stepson’s behavior, husband’s lack of friendliness and attentiveness when in-laws come to visit, and husband’s single kick on wife’s backside, causing her to scream out in pain, is not sufficient basis upon which to grant wife divorce on ground of habitual cruel and inhuman treatment.

       Evidence that wife’s manner of handling money caused husband hardship and embarrassment, that wife disappeared and abandoned family duties on several occasions, that wife occasionally bought jewelry without telling husband, that wife committed acts of cruelty against children, and that husband and wife frequently argued, is insufficient to support grant of divorce on grounds of habitual cruel and inhuman treatment where there is no proof that wife’s mismanagement of family funds, disappearances, or alleged mistreatment of children rendered continuance of cohabitation impossible, except at risk of life, limb, or health on part of husband.

       Cruelty justifying divorce is not established by fact that wife drank beer to such extent that in two years her weight had increased from 165 to 210 pounds, that husband had at times to prepare his own supper and breakfast, and that if he was a few minutes late she would cry and complain that he had been with some other woman.

       Proof that defendant at times was quarrelsome, that he did not provide the necessities of life as liberally as he could have, and that on the day before filing of the action he choked plaintiff inflicting bruises which disappeared within about two weeks, was insufficient to establish cruel and inhuman treatment as ground for divorce.

       Corroboration of the offensive conduct complained of by the moving party is required when seeking a divorce based on the ground of habitual cruel and inhuman treatment, except in unusual cases such as isolation; the testimony of the defendant may also provide corroboration. Additionally, the corroborating evidence need not be sufficient in itself to establish the ground, but rather need only provide enough supporting facts for a court to conclude that the plaintiff’s testimony is true; corroboration must be sufficient enough to provide some supporting facts for a court to conclude that the plaintiff’s testimony is true.

       Chancellor did not err in refusing to consider evidence of cruel and inhuman treatment that occurred before the parties were married because, to grant a divorce on grounds of habitual cruel and inhuman treatment, there must be a causal connection between the cruel treatment and the separation from the household, and it must be related in point of time to the separation.

       Chancellor did not err in dismissing a wife’s complaint for divorce based on habitual cruel and inhuman treatment because she presented insufficient proof and the isolation exception did not apply because, although the nearest neighbor was 1/2 mile away, the wife was fully employed throughout the marriage and saw people on a daily basis at work.

       Chancellor did not err in dismissing a wife’s complaint for divorce based on habitual cruel and inhuman treatment where the wife failed to corroborate her allegations, which the husband denied except to admit to occasional name calling, and the evidence presented, consisting of her own testimony and the testimony of one of her former co-workers, as a whole was insufficient.

       Court rejected the husband’s claim that his conduct, upon which the wife relied in making her case for divorce on the grounds of habitual cruel and inhuman treatment, was too remote in time to establish a causal connection between the separation and the ground for divorce, because it was no longer required that a specific act be the proximate cause of a separation before a divorce could be granted on grounds of habitual cruel and inhuman treatment. It was, instead, habitual or continuous behavior over a period of time, close in proximity to the separation, or continuing after a separation occurs, that could satisfy the grounds for divorce.

       In a divorce trial, where court was adjourned and the husband did not appear at the next scheduled hearing, the chancellor committed reversible error in concluding a decision on property division, alimony, and child support could be rendered fairly without allowing the wife an opportunity to cross-examine the husband; cross-examination of the husband was necessary for the chancellor’s complete deliberation on the marriage and assets without a one-sided slant on the facts and circumstances.

      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court erred in granting the wife a divorce for habitual cruel and inhuman treatment because the husband’s conduct did not rise to the appropriate level of abuse and the wife acknowledged that there was no physical abuse, threatening language nor financial neglect; due to the unconventional sleeping arrangement, conflicting testimony concerning each parties’ sexual desire for the other and the undisputed fact that the couple consummated sex three months prior to separation, there was insufficient evidence to support the granting of divorce due to habitual cruel and inhuman treatment.

       A chancellor’s decision to not grant a wife a divorce on the ground of cruel and inhuman treatment was not error where the only person who testified that the husband treated the wife in a cruel and inhuman manner was the wife herself, and the husband denied every instance of physical abuse that the wife alleged.

       Two photographs of a wife’s bruised arms were not sufficient corroborating evidence of the wife’s claim of habitual cruel and inhuman treatment to warrant the granting of a divorce on that ground where there were other witnesses to the marriage who were available to testify.

       Wife failed to prove claim of habitual cruel and inhuman treatment where there was nothing in record to show any attempt to ferret out sources or gain further information about alleged murder plot against wife. Internal Revenue Service agent who informed wife that her husband planned to murder her was never offered as witness and court did not know whether his testimony would have been any more than hearsay. If wife contemplated using this as basis for sustaining charge of habitual cruel and inhuman treatment, she had responsibility of offering more evidence than conversation she had with agent.

       A chancellor has authority and right in a divorce action to require the posting by a husband of a performance bond and the furnishing of a policy of insurance on his life to assure performance of provisions of a decree requiring him to support his mentally incompetent wife for the term of her natural life.

       On taking jurisdiction of a divorce action in which one of the parties is a mentally incompetent wife confined to an institution, the chancery court is acting in a dual constitutional capacity, as trier of the action for divorce, and as superior guardian of a person of unsound mine.

       Husband was properly granted a divorce on the ground of uncondoned adultery because the wife’s defense of condonation failed since (1) there was nothing in the record to suggest that the husband, by engaging in sexual intercourse with the wife, forgave the wife for committing adultery, and (2) although the husband stated that the husband forgave the wife in a letter, the husband did not specify to which adulterous conduct the husband was referring. Ware v. Ware, 7 So.3d 271, 2008 Miss. App. LEXIS 270 (Miss. Ct. App. 2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       Appellate court affirmed the ruling that denied the husband a divorce on the grounds of adultery because even though the wife admitted that she had an extramarital affair that ended in November 2001, the parties continued to live with each other after the wife’s admission and ultimately renewed sexual relations. Thus, the trial court held that the defense of condonation applied, and the appellate court agreed. Fulton v. Fulton, 918 So. 2d 877, 2006 Miss. App. LEXIS 22 (Miss. Ct. App. 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       A wife’s condonation of her husband’s “peculiar” sexual activities was not sufficient to deny her a divorce on the grounds of habitual cruel and inhuman treatment based on evidence that the husband was impotent and occasionally dressed in women’s clothing, even though the wife continued to live with the husband and at least attempted to have sexual relations, since it was not proper for the wife to be penalized for attempting to save her marriage. Cherry v. Cherry, 593 So. 2d 13, 1991 Miss. LEXIS 964 (Miss. 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancellor was not manifestly wrong in granting divorce to husband on ground of adultery, which may be shown by either evidence or admissions, either of which is sufficient to support decree of divorce, where evidence showed wife had sexual intercourse with another man and her acts of adultery were uncondoned. Jordan v. Jordan, 510 So. 2d 131, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2628 (Miss. 1987).

       The defense of condonation is recognized, but the mere resumption of residence does not constitute a condonation of past marital sins and does not act as bar to a divorce being granted. Wood v. Wood, 495 So. 2d 503, 1986 Miss. LEXIS 2691 (Miss. 1986).

      </p>
      <p>
       Where the chancellor was warranted in believing that the husband had been guilty of habitual, cruel and inhuman treatment of the wife, and that the reconciliations between the parties amounted to a condonement of past wrongdoing on the assumption that the conduct complained of would not be repeated, decree awarding divorce to wife would be affirmed.

       Knowledge by complainant of cause for divorce at time marriage was consummated is bar to suit on that ground, but complainant does not have knowledge or good reason to believe that at time of marriage husband was habitual drunkard when husband, prior to marriage, was never drunk, but at most was only occasional and moderate social drinker and did not become habitual drunkard until after marriage.

      <p>
       Wife’s condonation of past acts of cruelty is impliedly conditioned upon the future good behaviour of the husband, and after condonation if the cruelty is repeated the right to assert the condoned offenses as a ground for divorce is revived. Smith v. Smith, 40 So. 2d 156 (Miss. 1949).

       Cohabitation after cruel and inhuman treatment cannot be considered as condonation in the same sense as after an act of adultery. Smith v. Smith, 40 So. 2d 156 (Miss. 1949).

      <p>
       Contention that acts of cruel and inhuman treatment occurring prior to last reconciliation were condoned by the wife and could not constitute grounds for divorce held untenable, since habitually cruel and inhuman treatment as grounds for divorce consists generally of a course of conduct rather than a single act. Smith v. Smith, 40 So. 2d 156 (Miss. 1949).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where husband and wife entered into an agreement after alleged acts of cruelty stating that differences were settled and agreeing to dismiss pending litigation and resume relations as husband and wife, the court held that by agreement and conduct the parties condoned all alleged acts of cruelty accruing prior to such agreement so as to preclude divorce under this section [Code 1942, § 2735].

       Wife’s failure to come and live with husband in designated town and her failure to deliver the children to him as provided in agreement condoning prior alleged acts of cruelty does not revive the alleged acts of cruelty, so as to constitute grounds for divorce under this section [Code 1942, § 2735].

      <p>
       In the division of the marital property, the chancellor awarded the ex-wife a vehicle free and clear, the leasehold interest to a residence, one-half of the value of the marital home, and personal property in her possession, which she valued at $50,000 in her financial statement, and awarded the ex-husband sole ownership of a corporation, two encumbered vehicles, one-half of the value of the marital home, and any personal property in his possession; although the ex-wife alleged otherwise, the chancellor properly classified the ownership of the corporation, which was valued at $10,000, as marital property, and thus based on the facts of the case and the value of the corporation, the assets of the marriage were equitably divided. Wilson v. Wilson, 975 So. 2d 261, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 681 (Miss. Ct. App. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the husband and wife divorced on the ground of irreconcilable differences, the chancellor did not err in: (1) valuing the marital home based on the average of the two parties’ appraisals; (2) awarding the husband his full retirement to maintain his life and to keep the marital home; (3) awarding the wife a substantial equity in the marital home; and (4) awarding alimony to the wife to address any discrepancy in the distribution of assets.

       Chancellor determined that a utility trailer was a marital asset, based on a pretrial order which classified it as a marital asset, and the chancellor relied on the evidence of the manner in which each spouse and the children would need to use the trailer; the mother would need to use the trailer for her daughter’s horse, while the father stated that he would use the trailer for various tasks unrelated to his daughter’s horse. Thus, the chancellor did not err in awarding the trailer to the mother; accordingly, there was nothing inequitable about the chancellor’s finding with regard to the utility trailer, let alone reversible. Ethridge v. Ethridge, 926 So. 2d 264, 2006 Miss. App. LEXIS 270 (Miss. Ct. App. 2006).

       Where the parties agreed to an irreconcilable differences divorce, the husband was awarded the double-wide and the wife the single-wide, and the chancellor ordered the husband to pay the wife $17,000, representing one-half of the equity; he was also required to pay the wife an additional $16,500 for the value of the single-wide mobile home which was destroyed in a fire before the entry of judgment.

       Equitable division of assets does not require that each party continue to have a possessory interest in an asset; a party being divested of her interest in an asset is compensated for her divestiture by receiving other assets or through monetary compensation. The former wife received two years free rent, valued at $ 9,600, as compensation for her interest in the marital residence; thus, the chancellor did not err in awarding the former husband sole ownership of the marital residence.

       Upon distributing property in a divorce, the chancellor committed reversible error by failing to properly classify $ 64,274 that the parties had borrowed to pay off a pre-marital debt owed by the husband.

       Where the wife had established a service oriented painting business, the value of a business included more than physical assets and goodwill, as she argued. Contrary to her position, there were many factors, other than physical assets and goodwill, that could be used in arriving at the value of a business, including income generated, accounts receivable, pending contracts, and customer lists; the chancery court erred in not assigning a specific value to the business, and on remand, the chancery court was free to consider factors other than goodwill and physical assets in valuing the wife’s business.

       Only document commemorating the transaction was a statement signed by the wife’s friend that she borrowed $ 20,000 from him to buy a car. That document was not generated until after the parties’ depositions and there was no legally binding lien on the wife’s car; the wife never signed a document agreeing to pay back her friend, and on that evidence, there was no abuse of discretion in the chancellor holding that her car was free of liens and was marital property.

       From the record it was clear that the parties specifically reserved the issue of alimony for the trial court’s resolution, and the implication of such a specific reservation was that there was no marital property remaining to be divided. Further, in representing to the chancellor that alimony, credit card debt, and attorney’s fees were the sole issues remaining, the wife waived her opportunity to argue that the individual retirement account and the share of a trucking company were marital property subject to equitable distribution; in any event, the chancellor did consider the latter assets, and all assets, in awarding the wife periodic alimony which had no fixed termination date (except for when the obligor died or the obligee remarried), as she seemed to have implied on appeal. Evans v. Evans, 912 So. 2d 184, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 706 (Miss. Ct. App. 2005).

       In their divorce case, the parties’ Miss. R. Civ. P. 8.05 declarations were “very unspecific,” and they presented conflicting testimony as to the value of their property. Since neither party offered expert testimony as to the value of said property, and because there was no ongoing business or unusual or unique asset in the marital estate that might have required expert testimony, the chancellor properly derived a value for the property based primarily upon the Rule 8.05 declarations of the parties. Studdard v. Studdard, 894 So. 2d 615, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 1063 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).

      <p>
       In an action for divorce on the ground of adultery, the chancellor erred by adopting, verbatim and by incorporation, the findings of fact and conclusions of law prepared by an attorney for one of the litigants as those of the lower court. Brooks v. Brooks, 652 So. 2d 1113, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 152 (Miss. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a wife was guilty of desertion in leaving her husband in the first place and had no intention of returning, the subsequent filing by her of a bill for separate maintenance did not toll the statute. Leggett v. Leggett, 185 So. 2d 431, 1966 Miss. LEXIS 1503 (Miss. 1966).
      </p>
      <p>
       If it could be said that the husband made an unconditional effort in good faith to bring about a reconciliation and resumption of the marital relation, and that the wife’s refusal so changed the character of the separation that it became wilful and obstinate desertion on her part, so as to set in motion the running of the one-year period required by the statute, nevertheless this period could be computed only from the date of the offer of reconciliation and would not revert back to the date when the original separation occurred. Criswell v. Criswell, 254 Miss. 746, 182 So. 2d 587, 1966 Miss. LEXIS 1573 (Miss. 1966).

       Decree in favor of wife in separate maintenance suit is res adjudicata and bar to maintenance by husband of suit for divorce against wife on grounds of cruel and inhuman treatment and desertion when such acts occurred or had their origin prior to decree in separate maintenance suit as decree in separate maintenance in favor of wife necessarily conclusively established that wife was not guilty of habitual cruel and inhuman treatment prior to actual separation and that there was no wilful desertion of husband by wife. Van Norman v. Van Norman, 205 Miss. 114, 38 So. 2d 452, 1949 Miss. LEXIS 416 (Miss. 1949).

       Decree granting wife separate maintenance in suit wherein the main issue was whether the wife had deserted the husband, barred husband’s suit for divorce filed 60 days thereafter predicated on charge of desertion.

      </p>
      <p>
       Decree granting wife separate maintenance was an adjudication that at the date of that decree she was not then a deserter, and, no appeal having been taken, the decree stands as final and conclusive, except as it may be modified upon petition presented for that purpose because of a material and substantial change of circumstances arising subsequent to the date of the decree. Wilson v. Wilson, 198 Miss. 334, 22 So. 2d 161, 1945 Miss. LEXIS 202 (Miss.), modified, 198 Miss. 334, 23 So. 2d 303, 1945 Miss. LEXIS 203 (Miss. 1945).

      <p>
       While chancellor’s determinations of events that precede divorce are findings of fact, finding that spouse’s conduct rose to level of habitual cruel and inhuman treatment, as defined as statutory ground for divorce, is a determination of law and is reversible where chancellor has employed erroneous legal standard. Potts v. Potts, 700 So. 2d 321, 1997 Miss. LEXIS 464 (Miss. 1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       Reviewing court in divorce action will not set aside chancellor’s findings of fact on issue of adultery unless they are manifestly wrong. Holden v. Frasher-Holden, 680 So. 2d 795, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 485 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the chancellor in a divorce action has failed to make his or her own findings of fact and conclusions of law on issue of adultery, Supreme Court will review the record de novo. Holden v. Frasher-Holden, 680 So. 2d 795, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 485 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       In an appeal from a judgment of divorce on the ground of adultery, deference would not be given to the findings of fact and conclusions of law of the lower court where the chancellor erred by applying an incorrect legal standard of proof for adultery, and by adopting, verbatim and by incorporation, the findings of fact and conclusions of law prepared by an attorney for one of the litigants as those of the lower court.

       Decree granting wife divorce and allowing attorney’s fee and permanent alimony for herself and child will be entered in supreme court on appeal on reversal of chancery court’s decree denying divorce, fees and alimony to wife.

      </p>
      <p>
       Supreme court has power to affirm, reverse, or modify divorce decree appealed from, or it may reverse in part and affirm in part, or remand for a new hearing, and where all the facts necessary to enable it to do justice are contained in the record, it may make such order with respect to alimony or allowances as the trial court should have made. Gresham v. Gresham, 198 Miss. 43, 21 So. 2d 414, 1945 Miss. LEXIS 167 (Miss. 1945).

       Decree granting divorce must be reversed where the complaint fails to allege a ground for divorce, even though there was neither an answer nor a demurrer to the complaint. Nichols v. Nichols, 197 Miss. 302, 20 So. 2d 72, 1944 Miss. LEXIS 301 (Miss. 1944).
      </p>
      <p>
       A chancellor’s decree denying divorce is binding upon reviewing court and precludes granting of divorce by reviewing court, unless chancellor’s finding on conflicting evidence was manifestly wrong. Sarphie v. Sarphie, 180 Miss. 313, 177 So. 358, 1937 Miss. LEXIS 118 (Miss. 1937).

    Divorce on ground of irreconcilable differences.

     </h3>
     <ol>
      <li id="t93c05s93-5-2ol11">
       Divorce from the bonds of matrimony may be granted on the ground of irreconcilable differences, but only upon the joint complaint of the husband and wife or a complaint where the defendant has been personally served with process or where the defendant has entered an appearance by written waiver of process.
      </li>
      <li id="t93c05s93-5-2ol12">
       If the parties provide by written agreement for the custody and maintenance of any children of that marriage and for the settlement of any property rights between the parties and the court finds that such provisions are adequate and sufficient, the agreement may be incorporated in the judgment, and such judgment may be modified as other judgments for divorce.
      </li>
      <li id="t93c05s93-5-2ol13">
       If the parties are unable to agree upon adequate and sufficient provisions for the custody and maintenance of any children of that marriage or any property rights between them, they may consent to a divorce on the ground of irreconcilable differences and permit the court to decide the issues upon which they cannot agree. Such consent must be in writing, signed by both parties personally, must state that the parties voluntarily consent to permit the court to decide such issues, which shall be specifically set forth in such consent, and that the parties understand that the decision of the court shall be a binding and lawful judgment. Such consent may not be withdrawn by a party without leave of the court after the court has commenced any proceeding, including the hearing of any motion or other matter pertaining thereto. The failure or refusal of either party to agree as to adequate and sufficient provisions for the custody and maintenance of any children of that marriage or any property rights between the parties, or any portion of such issues, or the failure or refusal of any party to consent to permit the court to decide such issues, shall not be used as evidence, or in any manner, against such party. No divorce shall be granted pursuant to this subsection until all matters involving custody and maintenance of any child of that marriage and property rights between the parties raised by the pleadings have been either adjudicated by the court or agreed upon by the parties and found to be adequate and sufficient by the court and included in the judgment of divorce. Appeals from any orders and judgments rendered pursuant to this subsection may be had as in other cases in chancery court only insofar as such orders and judgments relate to issues that the parties consented to have decided by the court.
      </li>
      <li id="t93c05s93-5-2ol14">
       Complaints for divorce on the ground of irreconcilable differences must have been on file for sixty (60) days before being heard. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (3) of this section, a joint complaint of husband and wife or a complaint where the defendant has been personally served with process or where the defendant has entered an appearance by written waiver of process, for divorce solely on the ground of irreconcilable differences, shall be taken as proved and a final judgment entered thereon, as in other cases and without proof or testimony in termtime or vacation, the provisions of Section 93-5-17 to the contrary notwithstanding.
      </li>
      <li id="t93c05s93-5-2ol15">
       Except as otherwise provided in subsection (3) of this section, no divorce shall be granted on the ground of irreconcilable differences where there has been a contest or denial; provided, however, that a divorce may be granted on the ground of irreconcilable differences where there has been a contest or denial, if the contest or denial has been withdrawn or cancelled by the party filing same by leave and order of the court.
      </li>
      <li id="t93c05s93-5-2ol16">
       Irreconcilable differences may be asserted as a sole ground for divorce or as an alternate ground for divorce with any other cause for divorce set out in Section 93-5-1.
      </li>
      <li id="t93c05s93-5-2ol17">
       For the purposes of orders touching the maintenance and alimony of the wife or husband, “property” and “an asset of a spouse” shall not include any interest a party may have as an heir at law of a living person or any interest under a third-party will, nor shall any such interest be considered as an economic circumstance or other factor.

   Although the chancery court never specifically stated that the property settlement was adequate and sufficient, there was no reversible error as a lack of a mere recitation of the obligatory words was not outcome determinative under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c05s93-5-2" target="_self">93-5-2</a></cite>. In re Dissolution of the Marriage of De St. Germain, 977 So. 2d 412, 2008 Miss. App. LEXIS 163 (Miss. Ct. App. 2008).
      </p>
      <p>

   Although a wife did not show prejudice as a result of a lower court’s failure to comply with Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c05s93-5-2" target="_self">93-5-2</a></cite> by requiring the parties to sign a consent to adjudicate a divorce action based on irreconcilable differences, the fact that the husband failed to file an appellate brief prevented an appellate court from concluding that equity did not warrant reversal. Engel v. Engel, 920 So. 2d 505, 2006 Miss. App. LEXIS 61 (Miss. Ct. App. 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Under an irreconcilable differences divorce, pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c05s93-5-2ol13" target="_self">93-5-2(3)</a></cite>, a written consent must state that the parties voluntarily consent to permit the court to decide the issues upon which they cannot agree, and the consent defines the issues that are to be contested and resolved by the chancellor. A chancellor erred when he failed to abide by what the parties had stipulated in the consent to divorce, namely, that all businesses of the parties were to be classified as marital property. Johnson v. Johnson, 877 So. 2d 485, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 1203 (Miss. Ct. App. 2003), cert. denied, 878 So. 2d 67, 2004 Miss. LEXIS 862 (Miss. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because there was no enforceable agreement between the divorcing parties, the chancellor was required to address issues of property distribution and support consistent with the principles of equitable distribution; however, the record was completely devoid of any analysis of the appropriateness of the distribution of property or the award of alimony, and the chancellor merely took what was an agreement for purposes of an irreconcilable differences divorce and made it the order of the court, with the result that, by failing to apply the 12 factors to be considered in awarding alimony, there was not an appropriate and equitable distribution of property or a fair and just amount of alimony awarded. Ash v. Ash, 877 So. 2d 458, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 1040 (Miss. Ct. App. 2003), cert. denied, 878 So. 2d 66, 2004 Miss. LEXIS 878 (Miss. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       A separation agreement signed by both parties was valid and binding as of the date of its execution and was not voided by the untimely death of the husband or by any supposed reconciliation of the parties and, consequently, the wife was precluded by the separation agreement from inheriting the estate of the husband. Barton v. Barton, 790 So. 2d 169, 2001 Miss. LEXIS 105 (Miss. 2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       The chancellor did not exceed his statutory authority when he entered a final judgment of divorce on the sixtieth day subsequent to the filing of the joint complaint, rather than waiting until the next day, as the last day of the 60 day period prescribed by subsection (4) of this section is properly included in computing that period. Robbins v. Robbins (In re Robbins), 744 So. 2d 394, 1999 Miss. App. LEXIS 370 (Miss. Ct. App. 1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       Giving a strict interpretation to subsection (2) of this section, the statute provides that the parties provide a written agreement and that the court finds that such provisions are adequate and sufficient; thus, where there was no written consent agreement, the chancellor exceeded his statutory authority by granting a divorce based on irreconcilable differences. Cassibry v. Cassibry, 742 So. 2d 1121, 1999 Miss. LEXIS 211 (Miss. 1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       The chancellor was manifestly in error when he granted an irreconcilable differences divorce to the parties since there was no written agreement between the parties that resolved all matters touching on child custody and support and the settlement of all property rights; attorneys’ notes signed by the parties at the end of a day’s negotiations were incomplete and were nothing more than uninformative and practically unintelligible scribblings and were devoid of any information about child custody, visitation, or the various matters touching on the support and maintenance of the children of the parties. Joiner v. Joiner, 739 So. 2d 1043, 1999 Miss. App. LEXIS 167 (Miss. Ct. App. 1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the parties had not entered into a property settlement agreement nor had the court adjudicated those issues on the date that the court declared the parties divorced, such error was harmless where the agreed judgment of divorce provided for temporary custody and support and the parties thereafter entered into a child custody, support and property settlement agreement which the chancellor found to be adequate and sufficient and which was approved by the chancellor in the final judgment. Rounsaville v. Rounsaville, 732 So. 2d 909, 1999 Miss. LEXIS 36 (Miss. 1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       An oral agreement of the parties is not sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the statute; the consent agreement must be written and signed by both parties. Cook v. Cook, 725 So. 2d 205, 1998 Miss. LEXIS 613 (Miss. 1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   The problem with §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c05s93-5-2" target="_self">93-5-2</a></cite> is that it requires all financial matters incident to the divorce to be resolved by voluntary agreement. Section<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c05s93-5-2" target="_self">93-5-2</a></cite> blithely proceeds on the premise that parties having irreconcilable differences regarding their marriage will somehow be able to reconcile their differences on financial matters. What is needed is a simple amendment to §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c05s93-5-1" target="_self">93-5-1</a></cite> providing for a thirteenth ground for divorce: irreconcilable differences. That ground for divorce should be subject to proof as any other. The defendant’s denial should have no more effect than his or her denial in the case of any of the other 12 grounds for divorce. That one spouse out of blindness, obstinance or nostalgia refuses to recognize it hardly means that a marriage may not in fact be irretrievably broken. Most important, the defending spouse’s refusal to agree on financial matters would be no bar to the granting of a divorce because of irreconcilable differences. Wilson v. Wilson, 547 So. 2d 803, 1989 Miss. LEXIS 368 (Miss. 1989).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   A prior property settlement agreement entered into by the parties is not enforceable if it is not approved by the court for purposes of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c05s93-5-2" target="_self">93-5-2</a></cite>, which requires that parties seeking a divorce on the grounds of irreconcilable differences enter into a property settlement agreement that is to be incorporated into the final decree. Traub v. Johnson, 536 So. 2d 25, 1988 Miss. LEXIS 608 (Miss. 1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       A divorce accompanied by property settlement did not revoke, by implication, a previously executed will where the parties continued to live together, the divorce decree or property settlement contained no proof of intent to revoke the prior testamentary instrument, and there was no showing that the property settlement was anything more than a formality to comply with the requirements of a divorce for irreconcilable differences. Rasco v. Estate of Rasco, 501 So. 2d 421, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2274 (Miss. 1987).
      </p>
      <p>

   Agreement between divorcing husband and wife, which was incorporated into their divorce decree pursuant to Mississippi Code §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c05s93-5-2" target="_self">93-5-2</a></cite>, which obligated husband to pay $5,000 per month to wife, and further provided that payments to the wife would not terminate upon husband’s death or wife’s remarriage, and that wife could never ask that payments to her be increased, was, notwithstanding the use of the term “alimony” therein, in fact a property settlement or lump sum alimony, payable in fixed, unalterable installments, which could not be modified on ground of husband’s subsequent deteriorated financial condition. East v. East, 493 So. 2d 927, 1986 Miss. LEXIS 2564 (Miss. 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although no fault divorce may not be granted without parties having made provisions by written agreement for custody and maintenance of children and for settlement of property rights between parties, effective date of separation agreement is not delayed until no fault divorce is granted. Crosby v. Peoples Bank of Indianola, 472 So. 2d 951, 1985 Miss. LEXIS 2032 (Miss. 1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       When parties who obtain divorce on grounds of irreconcilable differences have submitted property settlement agreement which has been incorporated by court into final decree; contradictory, private contract entered by parties is void as against public policy. Sullivan v. Pouncey, 469 So. 2d 1233, 1985 Miss. LEXIS 2083 (Miss. 1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   When §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c05s93-5-2" target="_self">93-5-2</a></cite> has been complied with, a custody, support, alimony and property settlement agreement becomes a part of the final decree for all legal intents and purposes, and this is so, whether the agreement is copied verbatim into the text of the decree, whether it is attached as an exhibit and incorporated by reference, or whether it is simply on file with the clerk of the court; if the agreement is sufficient to comply with the statute, that is enough to render it a part of the final decree of divorce. Switzer v. Switzer, 460 So. 2d 843, 1984 Miss. LEXIS 2032 (Miss. 1984).

       Chancery court did not err by not equitably dividing a husband’s military retirement when granting the parties a divorce based on irreconcilable differences because the wife signed a consent agreement wherein the wife indicated the chancery court only needed to resolve one disputed issue related to whether she had misappropriated $ 46,000 from the husband. Gordon v. Gordon, 126 So.3d 922, 2013 Miss. App. LEXIS 273 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 127 So.3d 1115, 2013 Miss. LEXIS 631 (Miss. 2013).

   Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c05s93-5-2ol13" target="_self">93-5-2(3)</a></cite>, that issue was meritless because there were no issues submitted to the chancellor. The judgment of divorce was entered pursuant to
   Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c05s93-5-2ol12" target="_self">93-5-2(2)</a></cite>, and the proposed agreed order met §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c05s93-5-2ol12" target="_self">93-5-2(2)</a></cite>’s requirement of a written agreement.

   In divorce in which the parties entered a written consent for divorce on the ground of irreconcilable differences, it was signed by both parties and by their respective counsel, and neither party was granted leave of court to withdraw his or her consent to the divorce based on irreconcilable differences, the ex-wife argued unsuccessfully that the judgment of divorce was void because neither party had ever withdrawn the fault-based grounds asserted in their respective complaint and counter-complaint, as required by
   Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c05s93-5-2ol15" target="_self">93-5-2(5)</a></cite>. Section<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c05s93-5-2ol13" target="_self">93-5-2(3)</a></cite> operated as a cancellation and withdrawal of the contests or denials referenced in §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c05s93-5-2ol15" target="_self">93-5-2(5)</a></cite>.

   Amended §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c05s93-5-2" target="_self">93-5-2</a></cite>, which became effective April 9, 1990, applied to a divorce action in which all pleadings were filed prior to the effective date of the amendment and trial took place after the effective date since the amended statute affected only the mode of procedure and no substantive right of any of the parties, and the proceedings which were in process under the statute had not reached the stage of final judgment at the time the modification by amendment became effective.

      <p>
       <p>
   In an uncontested divorce action based on irreconcilable differences, it was within the chancellor’s discretion to determine whether a personal appearance of a party or of an attorney was required since no proof is required under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c05s93-5-2" target="_self">93-5-2</a></cite>, which governs a divorce sought on the grounds of irreconcilable differences, and neither §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c05s93-5-7" target="_self">93-5-7</a></cite> nor<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c05s93-5-17" target="_self">93-5-17</a></cite>, which govern the conduct of divorce proceedings, indicates a requirement that the person seeking the divorce must personally appear before the chancellor. The chancellor abused his discretion in refusing to grant the divorce without a personal appearance where the parties were proceeding pro se, the wife was a resident of California, and the husband was incarcerated in a correctional facility.

   Chancellor’s decision to award a divorce based on irreconcilable differences amounted to manifest error because complaints for divorce on the ground of irreconcilable differences had to have been on file for 60 days before being heard pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c05s93-5-2ol14" target="_self">93-5-2(4)</a></cite> and an ex-husband’s complaint failed to satisfy such requirement. Tyrone v.

   Chancery court exceeded its authority in granting the parties a divorce on the ground of irreconcilable differences because the parties failed to establish that each of the procedural steps in Miss.

   Trial court did not err by not ruling that the judgment of divorce was void and, consequently, that the citation of contempt against the father for failing to pay child support was void, as the mandates of Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c05s93-5-2ol15" target="_self">93-5-2(5)</a></cite> were inapplicable; the father filed neither an answer to the complaint for divorce, nor a counterclaim, and he admitted in his appellate brief that the proceedings for divorce were uncontested. Further, because the record showed that the father was personally served with process, the divorce proceedings met the requisite mandates of Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c05s93-5-2ol11" target="_self">93-5-2(1)</a></cite>. Breland v. Breland, 920 So. 2d 510, 2006 Miss. App. LEXIS 57 (Miss. Ct. App. 2006).

   Chancellor’s decision dividing the marital property and awarding alimony was based upon a complete and careful factor-by-factor analysis and was supported by substantial evidence; the chancellor did not err in denying the wife’s request for attorney fees because under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c05s93-5-2ol13" target="_self">93-5-2(3)</a></cite>, the chancellor was limited to the resolution of the issues specifically identified and personally agreed to in writing by the parties, which only included the three contested issues of property distribution, alimony, and marital property. Wideman v. Wideman, 909 So. 2d 140, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 557 (Miss. Ct. App. 2005), cert. denied, 933 So. 2d 303, 2006 Miss. LEXIS 344 (Miss. 2006).

       Because the Irreconcilable Differences Divorce Act had been complied with, the parties’ settlement agreement became a part of the final divorce decree; it became a part of the final decree of divorce as if the decree had been rendered by the chancery court following a contested divorce proceeding.

   The mere fact that irreconcilable differences was asserted in the pleadings filed by both parties as an alternate ground for divorce did not, in and of itself, meet all the requirements of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c05s93-5-2ol13" target="_self">93-5-2(3)</a></cite>, which mandates a written consent to a divorce on the ground of irreconcilable differences signed by both parties, and was not alone sufficient to justify a divorce on the ground of irreconcilable differences; although both parties requested a divorce on the ground of irreconcilable differences, both parties also denied that the other party was entitled to a divorce on that ground, and, therefore, the facts negated any conclusion that there was mutual consent to a divorce on the ground of irreconcilable differences. Massingill v. Massingill, 594 So. 2d 1173, 1992 Miss. LEXIS 74 (Miss. 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       The chancery court acted beyond its statutory authority in awarding divorce on ground of irreconcilable differences where there was no written agreement of the parties regarding property rights, and husband had filed cross-complaint against wife whose complaint sought a divorce on grounds of adultery, habitual cruel and inhuman treatment, and, in the alternative, irreconcilable differences. Alexander v. Alexander, 493 So. 2d 978, 1986 Miss. LEXIS 2636 (Miss. 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       Filing of second complaint by husband, grounded on wife’s adultery, which was inconsistent with first complaint based upon irreconcilable differences, constituted an effective withdrawal from and objection to the first complaint and, since wife had adequate notice, chancellor could grant divorce and custody of minor child to husband on second complaint, notwithstanding the parties’ earlier execution of child custody, child support, and property settlement agreements.

       In a divorce proceeding, a husband argued unsuccessfully that the divorce judgment was void because he did not formally withdraw his initial denial of his wife’s assertion in her complaint that she was entitled to a divorce on the grounds of irreconcilable differences. The agreed judgment of divorce provided that all further relief herein requested by either party was denied and that was sufficient to operate as a withdrawal of the wife’s fault-based grounds for divorce and the husband’s initial denial of her assertion that she was entitled to a divorce on the grounds of irreconcilable differences.

       Escalation clauses do not have to be tied to all four factors in Tedford v. Dempsey, 437 So.2d 410 (Miss. 1983); therefore, in a child support dispute, a child support agreement was enforceable because it was clear and measurable, it adequately and sufficiently provided for the needs of the child, it allotted room for a fluctuation in income, and it set the minimum amount the parties agreed was sufficient to support the child. The clause was tied to the father’s earnings, and depending upon his yearly income, it could have been escalating or de-escalating. (overruling Bruce v. Bruce, 687 So.2d 1199 (Miss. 1996)). Short v.

       Father’s argument that a chancellor disregarded the statutory guidelines for child support was rejected because the child support was ordered pursuant to an agreement that the father freely entered into; the parties used the broad latitude prescribed to them in formulating an agreement that they presented to the chancellor as sufficient to support their child. Even though the amount of child support was high, the father consented to providing more support than recommended by the guidelines. Short v. Short, 131 So.3d 1149, 2014 Miss. LEXIS 85 (Miss. 2014).

       Although a chancery court erred in granting the parties a divorce based on irreconcilable differences without addressing custody or support of their seventeen-year-old child, who was residing with his older sister, the error was harmless and the issue was moot because the child was no longer a minor and the parties were no longer obligated to pay child support for him.

   Trial court denied wife’s motion for relief from a divorce judgment under Miss. R. Civ. P. 60(b) based upon its erroneous application of law because a showing that an agreement was overreaching did not require a showing of fraud, and the settlement agreement that the wife signed without an attorney was clearly one-sided and unfair with the wife giving up custody of the children and all her marital property. Further, the court could not say that the agreement was in the best interests of the children because it gave the children no specific visitation period with their mother, formerly the primary caregiver of the children, and thus it did not meet the requirements of Miss.

Because the parents had been sharing joint legal and physical custody since their separation, on their own initiative, the chancellor found that there was a proven willingness from both parties to cooperate; thus, the chancellor did not err in awarding joint custody of the child to the parties.

       Filing of second complaint by husband, grounded on wife’s adultery, which was inconsistent with first complaint based upon irreconcilable differences, constituted an effective withdrawal from and objection to the first complaint and, since wife had adequate notice, chancellor could grant divorce and custody of minor child to husband on second complaint, notwithstanding the parties’ earlier execution of child custody, child support, and property settlement agreements.

       Since a petition was not made to the chancellor to review and modify the property settlement agreement, it was not properly before the chancery court; in order to change the agreement to reflect the parties’ new custodial arrangement, the wife had to petition the chancery court to review and alter the agreement.

       Chancellor did not abuse his discretion in denying a former husband’s request for modification of child support. The husband had agreed in a property-settlement agreement that he would pay a minimum monthly support payment of $3,000 and while the husband had incurred a loss of income,under the relevant Powell factors, the circumstances did not warrant a downward modification.

      <p>
       In this divorce action, the chancellor was within her authority to utilize the equitable powers of the chancery court to “modify” or “reform” the property settlement agreement and to order its distribution according to the applicable percentages because the impossibility stemmed from the incorrect estimate of the account’s balance at the time of divorce, and from the fact that the husband did not have the information regarding the account to which to effect the transfer.

Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c05s93-5-2ol11" target="_self">93-5-2(1)</a></cite> had created the alleged jurisdictional defect. Ridgeway v. Hooker, 240 So.3d 1202, 2018 Miss. LEXIS 68 (Miss. 2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       After granting the parties a divorce based on irreconcilable differences, the chancellor properly found their date of separation as the date of demarcation, divided the marital assets, and refused to award the wife alimony because neither party provided any monetary support to the other post-separation, except the disability benefits paid on behalf of their child, the chancellor set out his considerations in classifying the contested items as marital property and conducted a detailed analysis of all the factors in distributing that property, and alimony was inappropriate inasmuch as the wife was not left with a deficit where she was awarded 28 acres of a 34-acre tract (valued at $35,000) and a majority of the marital assets.

       There was a genuine dispute of material fact about whether an alienation of affections case was time barred because it was unclear when a former wife’s affections were alienated; although the couple filed for divorce on May 27, 2010, they moved back in together in July 2010 as the wife recovered from surgery, during which time they allegedly cohabitated and engaged in sexual relations. The trial court failed to consider the sixty-day waiting period before an irreconcilable differences divorce became final, as well as the public policy underlying the waiting period, which sought to foster reconciliation. Anderson v. Ladner, 198 So.3d 381, 2016 Miss. App. LEXIS 15 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 202 So.3d 617, 2016 Miss. LEXIS 364 (Miss. 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a divorce proceeding, a husband argued unsuccessfully that the agreed judgment of divorce was void because it incorrectly recited that the parties were present and giving testimony. Both parties agreed that no testimony was heard by the chancellor on the day the divorce was entered, and the husband asserted that was a material variance in the judgment which renders it void, but he cited no authority for this proposition; however, chancellor correctly found that the language was mere surplusage and held any error harmless.

       Parents may resolve a custody schedule issue through an agreement that a chancellor finds adequate and sufficient before incorporating it into an amended divorce judgment, or they could allow the chancellor to resolve the issue for them. A joint-physical-custody schedule should provide each parent with significant periods of physical custody in such a way so as to assure their child of frequent and continuing contact with both parents, but that does not necessarily mean that each parent would have to get equal time with their child.

       Although the issue of periodic alimony was not included in the parties’ signed consent, as required for an irreconcilable differences divorce, a remand was necessary to determine if an initial award of lump sum alimony was intended to be part of a property settlement such that it could have been reinstated. If it was intended as alimony, it could not have been reinstated. Myrick v. Myrick, 186 So.3d 429, 2016 Miss. App. LEXIS 102 (Miss. Ct. App. 2016).

       Chancellor erred in distributing the parties’ property because several of his findings were not supported by the evidence presented at trial where, while the husband used the proceeds of the sale of certain agricultural equipment to pay off marital debt, the chancellor weighed it against the husband, finding that he had violated a temporary order and dissipated marital assets, and, while the husband possessed four college degrees, no evidence was provided to show that they would provide more gainful employment than he presently possessed as a junior college professor.

       Because the wife acknowledged that she was entering into a binding agreement to divorce the husband pursuant to the terms of the settlement and on the basis of irreconcilable differences, she withdrew her fault-based divorce grounds, and their property-settlement agreement was executed in writing and signed by both parties, she could not later renegotiate the nature or the terms of the divorce.

       The defense of recrimination was not available to deny a divorce to a wife where the defense was based on the parties’ son’s testimony that he had seen his mother sit on a man’s lap and kiss him, since this would not qualify as a ground for divorce; it did not constitute habitual cruel and inhuman treatment because there was no testimony as to the habitual nature of the act or that the husband even knew about the alleged relationship. Cherry v. Cherry, 593 So. 2d 13, 1991 Miss. LEXIS 964 (Miss. 1991).

      <p>
       Under the doctrine of recrimination, which is founded on the basis that the equal guilt of a complainant bars his or her right to a divorce, the complainant’s offense need not be the same offense charged against his or her spouse, but it must be an offense sufficient to constitute a ground for divorce.

       Chancellor made specific findings of fact when he stated that the basis for granting the divorce was the wife’s admission of uncondoned adultery; even though the husband admitted to having an affair, the chancellor was not required to deny him a divorce based on recrimination when he proved that the wife had also committed adultery.

       A wife’s condonation of her husband’s “peculiar” sexual activities was not sufficient to deny her a divorce on the grounds of habitual cruel and inhuman treatment based on evidence that the husband was impotent and occasionally dressed in women’s clothing, even though the wife continued to live with the husband and at least attempted to have sexual relations, since it was not proper for the wife to be penalized for attempting to save her marriage. Cherry v. Cherry, 593 So. 2d 13, 1991 Miss. LEXIS 964 (Miss. 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that a divorced plaintiff continued to live under the same roof with the defendant after filing the complaint is a heavy factor to be weighed in considering whether he or she has a valid cause, though it does not in and of itself compel a denial of divorce; it is conceivably possible for valid grounds for divorce to exist despite this. Lawyers representing persons seeking a divorce have the obligation to advise and warn them about the undesirability of continuing to live in the same household following the filing of the suit, and they have the obligation to seek and press for a temporary hearing before the chancellor to secure alimony pendente lite and temporary support money.

       A wife did not condone her husband’s adultery as a matter of law by continuing to live in the same house with him and sleep in the same bed while waiting for a second indiscretion as proof of adultery after the initial indiscretion, which was not conclusive.

       Chancellor’s finding of 6 months residency of wife prior to commencement of divorce proceeding was manifestly in error and therefore jurisdiction of subject matter failed; residence of married woman is that of her husband during time they lived together as husband and wife, although married woman may establish residence upon separation from husband with intent to abandon her marital residence and establish independent residence; wife had left husband in Germany on August 19, with round trip ticket to return to Germany and filed original and amended bill alleging November 16 as date of separation of parties, although she filed affidavit and testified that she had never intended to change her residence from state of Mississippi; calculation of 6 months period prior to either August or November date failed to reveal 6 month period preceding date of commencement of action on December 28.

   Iowa 1-year residency requirement for instituting divorce action held constitutional. Sosna v. Iowa, <cite class="us_code">419 U.S. 393</cite>, <cite class="s_court">95 S. Ct. 553</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">42 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 532, 1975 U.S. LEXIS 19 (U.S. 1975).

       Jurisdiction of Mississippi courts over a divorce suit brought by one who had become a resident of the state, upon personal service of process on defendant, is not affected by pendency of a divorce proceeding theretofore instituted in another state.

       There is no requirement that the bill of complaint should necessarily allege that one of the parties had been an actual bona fide resident for the period stated, and especially where the bill alleges that the parties had been living in the state for such a period of time as husband and wife, since their residence under such circumstances would have been presumed to have been bona fide in the absence of proof to the contrary. Horton v. Horton, 213 Miss. 768, 57 So. 2d 723, 1952 Miss. LEXIS 423 (Miss. 1952).

       Where the jurat of the chancery clerk discloses that the complainant personally appeared before him and made an oath that the facts as stated in the above bill for divorce are true as stated therein and the bill was not filed by collusion with the defendant for the purposes of obtaining a divorce contrary to the laws, the affidavit to the bill of complaint was sufficient to give jurisdiction to the trial court despite the fact there was a failure to add the words but that the cause or causes for divorce are true as therein stated, in the language of the statute. Horton v. Horton, 213 Miss. 768, 57 So. 2d 723, 1952 Miss. LEXIS 423 (Miss. 1952).

       Husband’s absence from state for purpose of study pursuant to scholarship held not “abandonment” of domicile, and therefore chancery court had jurisdiction of divorce suit. May v. May, 158 Miss. 68, 130 So. 52, 1930 Miss. LEXIS 17 (Miss. 1930).

       That a man and wife move to another state, purchase a home, register to vote, and reside there for an extended period of time are circumstances indicative of an intention to abandon their domicil of origin and to establish a new domicil, but such facts are not conclusive in the face of uncontradicted evidence of an intention not to abandon the domicil of origin.

      <p>
       A naval officer, married in Maryland and thereafter living at duty stations in various parts of the country to which he had been ordered, who claimed his parents’ residence in Greenville, Mississippi as his legal residence on a driver’s license and navy emergency data records, had established a domicile in Mississippi which met the jurisdictional requirements of this section [Code 1942, § 2736]. Bannan v. Bannan, 188 So. 2d 253, 1966 Miss. LEXIS 1376 (Miss. 1966).

       In order for the court to have jurisdiction in a divorce action there must be bona fide domicile which means residence with intent to remain. Lynch v. Lynch, 210 Miss. 810, 50 So. 2d 378, 1951 Miss. LEXIS 315 (Miss. 1951).

       Complainant must actually and voluntarily have established residence within the state for a year next preceeding commencement of a divorce suit, with a bona fide intention of remaining there at least indefinitely, in order to give the court jurisdiction. Lucia v. Lucia, 200 Miss. 520, 27 So. 2d 774, 1946 Miss. LEXIS 317 (Miss. 1946).
      </p>
      <p>
       Once established, a domicile continues until another is acquired by removal to another locality with a bona fide intention to remain there at least indefinitely and to abandon the old domicile without intent to return thereto.

       Where the complainant first registered and paid poll tax in this state in 1943, overlooked payment of 1944 poll tax, paid 1945 poll tax, testified that he established his domicile in January, 1944, and otherwise testified that it was established a month or two later, and further stated that he did not decide to make this state his legal residence until after discovery that insanity was a ground for divorce in this state, the decree of the chancellor dismissing the bill was remanded for further investigation of evidence apparently obtainable. Lucia v. Lucia, 200 Miss. 520, 27 So. 2d 774, 1946 Miss. LEXIS 317 (Miss. 1946).

       To constitute a complainant an actual bona fide resident of a county in this state, there must have been an actual residence voluntarily established in such county with the bona fide intention of remaining there, if not permanently, at least indefinitely.

       Intent necessary to establish a residence in this state is the intent that an established residence shall be reasonably permanent, and a mere intention to establish a residence at some future time is not sufficient.

       While a complainant’s own testimony as to his intention is relevant in determining whether he has established a residence within the purview of this section [Code 1942, § 2736], a mere assertion of intention to establish a residence within the state is not in itself sufficient to comply with this section.

       Where divorce decree of another state purporting to affect or determine marital status and right of citizens of Mississippi is contrary to public policy of Mississippi, its courts will determine for themselves jurisdiction of court rendering such decree and consequent validity thereof, notwithstanding recitals of decree of jurisdictional fact of residence or domicile.

       Mere rendition of Arkansas divorce decree raised no presumption that husband obtaining such decree was resident of Arkansas in good faith with intention of remaining and acquiring permanent domicile there, and therefore husband pleading such decree in bar of wife’s divorce suit in Mississippi must prove that he acquired domicile in Arkansas.

      The proceedings to obtain a divorce shall be by complaint in chancery, and shall be conducted as other suits in chancery, except that (1) the defendant shall not be required to answer on oath; (2) no judgment by default may be granted but a divorce may be granted on the ground of irreconcilable differences in termtime or vacation; (3) admissions made in the answer shall not be taken as evidence; (4) the clerk shall not set down on the issue docket any divorce case unless upon the request of one (1) of the parties; (5) the plaintiff may allege only the statutory language as cause for divorce in a separate paragraph in the complaint; provided, however, the defendant shall be entitled to discover any matter, not privileged, which is relevant to the issues raised by the claims or defenses of the other; (6) the court shall have full power in its discretion to grant continuances in such cases without the compliance by the parties with any of the requirements of law respecting continuances in other cases; and (7) in all cases, except complaints seeking a divorce on the ground of irreconcilable differences, the complaint must be accompanied with an affidavit of plaintiff that it is not filed by collusion with the defendant for the purpose of obtaining a divorce, but that the cause or causes for divorce stated in the complaint are true as stated.

       Where a complaint was not accompanied by an affidavit signed by the plaintiff that the action was not filed in collusion with the defendant, the court did not err in requiring the submission of an amended complaint with a properly signed affidavit and then proceeding with the trial. Keller v. Keller, 763 So. 2d 902, 2000 Miss. App. LEXIS 228 (Miss. Ct. App. 2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       An affidavit to a bill of complaint for divorce which contained all of the other essential averments but omitted “for the purpose of obtaining a divorce” is not defective. White v. Fillyaw, 272 So. 2d 924, 1973 Miss. LEXIS 1557 (Miss. 1973).
      </p>
      <p>
       Fact that the affidavit attached to the amended cross bill of complaint failed to state that it was not filed in collusion with the complainant is not a basis for reversal where the objection was raised for the first time on appeal and both the original bill of complaint and the original cross bill were accompanied by an affidavit which affirmatively stated that neither was filed by collusion. Marshall v. Marshall, 205 So. 2d 644, 1968 Miss. LEXIS 1541 (Miss. 1968).
      </p>
      <p>
       A bill for divorce is never taken as confessed whether answered or not. Ladner v. Ladner, 233 Miss. 222, 102 So. 2d 195, 1958 Miss. LEXIS 375 (Miss. 1958).
      </p>
      <p>
       The purpose of requiring affidavit of complainant is to purge the conscience of complainant touching the question of collusion. Vance v. Vance, 197 Miss. 332, 20 So. 2d 825, 1945 Miss. LEXIS 293 (Miss. 1945).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a statute specifically prescribes who shall make a certain affidavit, it can be made by none other than the person specified, although there is nothing in the language of the statute to show that its designation was intended to be exclusive. Vance v. Vance, 197 Miss. 332, 20 So. 2d 825, 1945 Miss. LEXIS 293 (Miss. 1945).
      </p>
      <p>
       Affidavit of complainant required under this section [Code 1942, § 2737] can only be made by complainant himself or herself, and not by an agent or attorney, that statute (Code 1942, § 1661), generally permitting an oath or affirmation to be made by an agent or attorney, being inapplicable.

       Where bill for divorce was sworn to by attorney of record and mother of ostensible complainant, who was in armed services overseas, and not by the complainant himself, and wife made timely objection to any hearing because of this failure, supreme court will dismiss decree for husband and remand the cause with direction that it may not be proceeded with further until the required affidavit is made by the complainant personally.

       Wife’s claims against her husband which she brought in circuit court that were more closely related to the parties’ marital relationship and financial affairs had to be decided in chancery court; her claims against him for intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress, along with her alienation of affection claims against his alleged paramour, were purely legal and were properly before the circuit court. Germany v. Germany, 123 So.3d 423, 2013 Miss. LEXIS 545 (Miss. 2013).
      </p>
      <p>
       As a wife’s conversion claim against her husband was really a request for a award of marital assets that ordinarily would be distributed in the divorce action, the circuit court erred in denying the husband’s motion to transfer that claim to the parties’ divorce action which was pending in chancery court. Germany v. Germany, 123 So.3d 423, 2013 Miss. LEXIS 545 (Miss. 2013).
      </p>
      <p>
       Circuit court erred in denying a husband’s motion to transfer his wife’s claim for unjust enrichment to the parties’ divorce action which was pending in chancery court, because 1) it was an equitable claim, and 2) to allow her to pursue that claim in circuit court could lead to a double recovery if she was awarded alimony by the chancery court. Germany v. Germany, 123 So.3d 423, 2013 Miss. LEXIS 545 (Miss. 2013).
      </p>
      <p>
       As the substance of a wife’s breach-of-contract and fraud claims against her husband was related to divorce and alimony, the circuit court erred in denying the husband’s motion to transfer those claims to the parties’ divorce action which was pending in chancery court. Germany v. Germany, 123 So.3d 423, 2013 Miss. LEXIS 545 (Miss. 2013).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a prenuptial agreement provided that a wife would receive equity in the marital home upon divorce, but did not provide remedies for a breach, the chancellor’s remedy and credibility determinations would not be reversed on appeal. Doster v. Doster, 853 So. 2d 147, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 721 (Miss. Ct. App. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       A chancellor’s finding that a wife was entitled to distribution of marital property and/or lump sum alimony was premature where the husband’s principal asset was in bankruptcy, since the value of the husband’s estate was not before the court due to the bankruptcy proceedings; the issues of property division and lump sum alimony should have remained in the trial court pending the conclusion of the bankruptcy proceedings. Heigle v. Heigle, 654 So. 2d 895, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 228 (Miss. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       A chancellor’s determination that a wife was not entitled to periodic alimony was premature where the husband’s principal asset was in bankruptcy, since the value of the husband’s estate was not before the court due to the bankruptcy proceedings; the issue of periodic alimony should have remained in the trial court pending the conclusion of the bankruptcy proceedings. Heigle v. Heigle, 654 So. 2d 895, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 228 (Miss. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       A chancery court abused its discretion in exercising jurisdiction over a divorce action brought by the wife where a divorce had been granted by a Maine court in an action filed by the husband; the wife was estopped from asserting the invalidity of the Maine decree since she remarried soon after the decree became final, thereby indicating her reliance on its validity. Scribner v. Scribner, 556 So. 2d 350, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 23 (Miss. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a wife filed a bill of complaint for divorce in one county and a hearing was held and a temporary decree was issued awarding the wife temporary custody of a child, and the issue was joined on the merits when the husband filed an answer and cross bill, a subsequent reconciliation of the parties in another county did not ipso facto dispose of the proceeding, and the chancery court of another county in which the wife subsequently filed a bill for divorce should have sustained the husband’s plea in abatement. Lee v. Lee, 232 So. 2d 370, 1970 Miss. LEXIS 1627 (Miss. 1970).
      </p>
      <p>
       A decree for separate support and maintenance is res judicata of the fact that the wife has not deserted the husband, and in a subsequent action by the husband for a divorce on the ground of desertion the issues are limited to that which has transpired subsequent to such decree. Wilson v. Wilson, 202 Miss. 540, 32 So. 2d 686, 1947 Miss. LEXIS 313 (Miss. 1947).
      </p>
      <p>

       Chancery court did not err in granting a divorce on the ground of desertion even though the proceedings were not heard in open court because the husband failed to answer the wife’s complaint or enter an appearance. Luse v. Luse, 992 So. 2d 659, 2008 Miss. App. LEXIS 391 (Miss. Ct. App. 2008).

      <p>
       <p>
   In an uncontested divorce action based on irreconcilable differences, it was within the chancellor’s discretion to determine whether a personal appearance of a party or of an attorney was required since no proof is required under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c05s93-5-2" target="_self">93-5-2</a></cite>, which governs a divorce sought on the grounds of irreconcilable differences, and neither §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c05s93-5-7" target="_self">93-5-7</a></cite> nor<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c05s93-5-17" target="_self">93-5-17</a></cite>, which govern the conduct of divorce proceedings, indicates a requirement that the person seeking the divorce must personally appear before the chancellor. The chancellor abused his discretion in refusing to grant the divorce without a personal appearance where the parties were proceeding pro se, the wife was a resident of California, and the husband was incarcerated in a correctional facility.

   Because a husband did not challenge the granting of a divorce itself or the chancery court’s decision to try the case in his absence, the husband’s attempt to defend the case for the first time on appeal was improper, and the issues he raised were procedurally barred by Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c05s93-5-7" target="_self">93-5-7</a></cite> (Rev. 2004) and Miss. R. Civ. P. 55(e). Lee v. Lee, 78 So.3d 337, 2011 Miss. App. LEXIS 131 (Miss. Ct.

       A divorce complainant must prove the allegations of the complaint even when the defendant has failed to answer; the complainant’s proof requirement does not become lighter because the defendant fails to answer. Moeller v. Roy, 609 So. 2d 426, 1992 Miss. LEXIS 651 (Miss. 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 93-5-7 does not bar a defendant in a divorce action from presenting proof rebutting the plaintiff’s proof even if the defendant did not file an answer to the complaint; since the lack of an answer does not confess the allegations and the plaintiff is still required to place the necessary proof before the court, a defendant’s failure to answer does not deprive the defendant of the right to put on evidence to rebut the allegations of the complaint, though the defendant cannot offer evidence outside the scope of the complaint and cannot offer any evidence supporting any affirmative charge. Moeller v. Roy, 609 So. 2d 426, 1992 Miss. LEXIS 651 (Miss. 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       Two photographs of a wife’s bruised arms were not sufficient corroborating evidence of the wife’s claim of habitual cruel and inhuman treatment to warrant the granting of a divorce on that ground where there were other witnesses to the marriage who were available to testify. Moeller v. Roy, 609 So. 2d 426, 1992 Miss. LEXIS 651 (Miss. 1992).
      </p>

       Divorce will not be granted on uncorroborated testimony of complainant unless the case is such that, in its nature or owing to the isolation of the parties, no corroborating proof is reasonably possible. Anderson v. Anderson, 190 Miss. 508, 200 So. 726, 1941 Miss. LEXIS 72 (Miss. 1941).
      </p>
      <p>
       A case where corroborating proof is not reasonably possible is not made out where the parties lived throughout their married lives in a large and closely settled town, and moved almost daily among many who, in the various relations of life, could hardly have escaped observation of corroborative facts and circumstances. Anderson v. Anderson, 190 Miss. 508, 200 So. 726, 1941 Miss. LEXIS 72 (Miss. 1941).
      </p>
      <p>
       Corroborating evidence will be sufficient if it proves such substantial facts and circumstances as will serve to engender in a sound and prudently cautious mind a confident conclusion that the testimony of the complainant is true in all the essential particulars.

       A trial court in a divorce action erred by failing to provide findings of fact and conclusions of law when requested to do so by one of the parties, and therefore the case would be reversed and remanded for the limited purpose of providing findings of fact and conclusions of law as required under Rule 52, Miss. R. Civ. P. Lowery v. Lowery, 657 So. 2d 817, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 332 (Miss. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       It will be presumed from the entry of a decree of divorce that the court did its duty, that the ground for divorce was duly proven, and that the divorce was not the result of collusion. In re Estate of Kennington, 204 So. 2d 444, 1967 Miss. LEXIS 1194 (Miss. 1967).

       Where the supreme court reversed that part of a decree in a divorce case which erroneously adjudged the guilty wife to have forfeited her interests in a life insurance policy on the life of her husband, it will not remand the cause for an amendment of the pleadings, so that a reformation of the policy may be sought, but will, on timely request, frame its judgment without prejudice of any right the husband may have to bring original suit for such relief.

       <p>
   Appellate court in no way suggests, intimates or holds that the date of a divorce trial must be set on the trial docket at least 20 days prior to trial. In many instances, if not most, complaints for divorce may be set for trial outside of the normal docket setting of the civil trial docket because a divorce case may not be set down on the issue docket unless at the request of one of the parties. Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c05s93-5-7" target="_self">93-5-7</a></cite>. The appellate court simply holds that once a party appears in a temporary phase of the divorce proceeding, the party is entitled to notice of the subsequent hearing on the underlying divorce proceeding unless the party is so notified during the temporary proceeding.

       In a divorce proceeding, where the husband failed to answer the wife’s requests for admissions, and they were deemed admitted, it was not error to deny the wife’s motion to alter or amend judgment in regard to the weight given to the admissions, because the admissions were taken into consideration, but they were not conclusive, in and of themselves, of the ultimate issue.

       Trial court, in a divorce proceeding, exercised jurisdiction over the parties it did not have and had to be dismissed; even though the wife brought the action in DeSoto County and the husband waived process and voluntarily attempted to submit to the jurisdiction, jurisdiction could not be agreed on. Roberts v. Roberts, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 487 (Miss. Ct. App. June 3, 2003), op. withdrawn, sub. op., 866 So. 2d 474, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 915 (Miss. Ct. App. 2003).

       This section [Code 1942, § 2738] is mandatory, and statute (Code 1942, § 1441) providing for the transfer of causes to the proper venue where the court lacks venue jurisdiction does not apply to divorce actions.

       Substantial evidence supported the chancery court’s finding that a husband resided in Harrison County, Mississippi with the intention to remain there when the divorce was filed because the husband listed his address as Harrison County, and he testified in a deposition that he lived in Harrison County; the wife testified that when the husband left the marital home he left to live at his aunt’s condominium in Harrison County.

Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c05s93-5-11" target="_self">93-5-11</a></cite> because it was filed in the county in which the wife was residing, notwithstanding that the couple’s former home, which the wife had not yet sold and on which a homestead exemption was claimed, was in another county.

   Filing of the contested divorce in Coahoma County was incorrect in light of the mandatory requirements of Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c05s93-5-11" target="_self">93-5-11</a></cite> as a contested divorce had to be filed in the county of defendant’s residence, which was Chickasaw County, and the trial court correctly determined that Coahoma County did not have jurisdiction over the contested divorce, but the trial court erred in attempting to cure the jurisdictional error by simply dismissing the contested divorce and retaining the irreconcilable differences divorce, which could have been filed in Coahoma County as the wife was a resident of that county; thus, because the trial court had no jurisdiction over the contested divorce, it had no jurisdiction over the entire action and the trial court erred by failing to grant the husband’s motion to dismiss in toto.

   The trial court did not err in granting a divorce decree in vacation without having previously taken the case under advisement for a ruling in vacation, where the wife requested additional time to present argument to the court, the court granted the request and instructed her to prepare an order so that the case could be taken under advisement, as required by §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c05s93-5-17" target="_self">93-5-17</a></cite>, she did not follow the instruction, either through oversight or inadvertence, and the order was never entered, and where, further, the parties consented to take the decree in vacation, and their understanding had the effect of retaining jurisdiction in the court until the decree nunc pro tunc was entered, the necessity for which was prompted by the wife’s oversight in failing to prepare the order. Chaffin v. Chaffin, 437 So. 2d 384, 1983 Miss. LEXIS 2819 (Miss. 1983).

   In a divorce action the court improperly held that a divorce decree was void on the basis that the decree set a date certain in vacation when the matters pertaining to alimony and child support and property rights would be heard but the decree rendered thereon was another date, where none of the proceedings in the case after the date on which the divorce was granted involved “proceedings to obtain a divorce” as envisioned by §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c05s93-5-17" target="_self">93-5-17</a></cite>.

       Chancellor had jurisdiction to hear in vacation petition, contained in wife’s suit for separate maintenance, for temporary alimony and counsel fees, where petition alleged that the granting of such relief in vacation was urgent and necessitous, notwithstanding that it developed at the vacation hearing that the wife was receiving a monthly allowance from the federal government allotted to her at the instance of a son-in-law in the military service.

       Based on the evidence presented, the chancellor did not err in awarding the ex-wife rehabilitative alimony as it served the purpose of helping the ex-wife become self-supporting and prevented her from becoming destitute while doing so. The chancellor possessed the authority to order temporary alimony and make all proper orders and judgments thereon and the ex-husband was required to comply with previous orders of the court made prior to the final decree.

       Where, in a divorce action, it appeared that the pleadings showed a valid marriage, that an application for temporary alimony was made in good faith, and that the court had jurisdiction, the court erred in denying temporary relief as a matter of law, without hearing the testimony. Neely v. Neely, 52 So. 2d 501, 1951 Miss. LEXIS 530 (Miss. 1951).
      </p>
      <p>
       In passing on petition for temporary alimony under this section [Code 1942, § 2742], chancellor is not required to investigate the merits or inquire into the truth of the facts alleged, but is only required to determine whether a case for relief is stated on the face of the petition.

       Chancellor was within the chancellor’s discretion when the chancellor found a spouse in contempt for violating a temporary support order because the spouse admitted that the spouse did not pay the credit-card debts, child support, or medical costs not covered by insurance as mandated in the temporary support order. Apparently, the chancellor considered the spouse’s unemployment as a basis to not hold the spouse in wilful contempt and to permit the arrearage to be paid in monthly installments. O'Brien v. O'Brien, 149 So.3d 508, 2014 Miss. App. LEXIS 69 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 151 So.3d 1017, 2014 Miss. LEXIS 523 (Miss. 2014).

   In an uncontested divorce action based on irreconcilable differences, it was within the chancellor’s discretion to determine whether a personal appearance of a party or of an attorney was required since no proof is required under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c05s93-5-2" target="_self">93-5-2</a></cite>, which governs a divorce sought on the grounds of irreconcilable differences, and neither §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c05s93-5-7" target="_self">93-5-7</a></cite> nor<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c05s93-5-17" target="_self">93-5-17</a></cite>, which govern the conduct of divorce proceedings, indicates a requirement that the person seeking the divorce must personally appear before the chancellor. The chancellor abused his discretion in refusing to grant the divorce without a personal appearance where the parties were proceeding pro se, the wife was a resident of California, and the husband was incarcerated in a correctional facility.

       There can be no per se prohibition against a child witness testifying in a divorce case between the child’s parents. The right of every litigant to compulsory process for witnesses and to have them testify under oath in court is so well grounded that any per se exclusion simply because he or she is a child of the divorcing parents risks offending the due process provisions of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution and Mississippi Constitution Art 3, § 14. Before excluding the testimony of a child witness of tender years in a divorce proceeding, the chancellor, at a minimum, should follow the procedure required by Crownover v. Crownover (1975) 33 Ill App 3d 327, 337 NE2d 56. Although no parent can be precluded from having a child of the marriage testify in a divorce proceeding simply because of that fact, parents in a divorce proceeding should, if at all possible, refrain from calling children of their marriage as witnesses, and counsel should advise their clients against doing so except in the most exigent cases.

       § 93-5-23.
    Custody of children; alimony; effect of military duty on custody and visitation.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      When a divorce shall be decreed from the bonds of matrimony, the court may, in its discretion, having regard to the circumstances of the parties and the nature of the case, as may seem equitable and just, make all orders touching the care, custody and maintenance of the children of the marriage, and also touching the maintenance and alimony of the wife or the husband, or any allowance to be made to her or him, and shall, if need be, require bond, sureties or other guarantee for the payment of the sum so allowed. Orders touching on the custody of the children of the marriage shall be made in accordance with the provisions of Section 93-5-24. For the purposes of orders touching the maintenance and alimony of the wife or husband, “property” and “an asset of a spouse” shall not include any interest a party may have as an heir at law of a living person or any interest under a third-party will, nor shall any such interest be considered as an economic circumstance or other factor. The court may afterwards, on petition, change the decree, and make from time to time such new decrees as the case may require. However, where proof shows that both parents have separate incomes or estates, the court may require that each parent contribute to the support and maintenance of the children of the marriage in proportion to the relative financial ability of each. In the event a legally responsible parent has health insurance available to him or her through an employer or organization that may extend benefits to the dependents of such parent, any order of support issued against such parent may require him or her to exercise the option of additional coverage in favor of such children as he or she is legally responsible to support.
     </p>
     <p>
      Whenever the court has ordered a party to make periodic payments for the maintenance or support of a child, but no bond, sureties or other guarantee has been required to secure such payments, and whenever such payments as have become due remain unpaid for a period of at least thirty (30) days, the court may, upon petition of the person to whom such payments are owing, or such person’s legal representative, enter an order requiring that bond, sureties or other security be given by the person obligated to make such payments, the amount and sufficiency of which shall be approved by the court. The obligor shall, as in other civil actions, be served with process and shall be entitled to a hearing in such case.
     </p>
     <p>
      At the discretion of the court, any person found in contempt for failure to pay child support and imprisoned therefor may be referred for placement in a state, county or municipal restitution, house arrest or restorative justice center or program, provided such person meets the qualifications prescribed in Section 99-37-19.
     </p>
     <p>
      Whenever in any proceeding in the chancery court concerning the custody of a child a party alleges that the child whose custody is at issue has been the victim of sexual or physical abuse by the other party, the court may, on its own motion, grant a continuance in the custody proceeding only until such allegation has been investigated by the Department of Human Services. At the time of ordering such continuance, the court may direct the party and his attorney making such allegation of child abuse to report in writing and provide all evidence touching on the allegation of abuse to the Department of Human Services. The Department of Human Services shall investigate such allegation and take such action as it deems appropriate and as provided in such cases under the Youth Court Law (being Chapter 21 of Title 43, Mississippi Code of 1972) or under the laws establishing family courts (being Chapter 23 of Title 43, Mississippi Code of 1972).
     </p>
     <p>
      If after investigation by the Department of Human Services or final disposition by the youth court or family court allegations of child abuse are found to be without foundation, the chancery court shall order the alleging party to pay all court costs and reasonable attorney’s fees incurred by the defending party in responding to such allegation.
     </p>
     <p>
      The court may investigate, hear and make a determination in a custody action when a charge of abuse and/or neglect arises in the course of a custody action as provided in Section 43-21-151, and in such cases the court shall appoint a guardian ad litem for the child as provided under Section 43-21-121, who shall be an attorney. Unless the chancery court’s jurisdiction has been terminated, all disposition orders in such cases for placement with the Department of Human Services shall be reviewed by the court or designated authority at least annually to determine if continued placement with the department is in the best interest of the child or public.
     </p>
     <p>
      The duty of support of a child terminates upon the emancipation of the child. The court may determine that emancipation has occurred pursuant to Section 93-11-65.
     </p>
     <p>
      Custody and visitation upon military temporary duty, deployment or mobilization shall be governed by Section 93-5-34.

       Appellate court reversed trial court’s denial of a husband’s motion to terminate his spousal support payments to his former wife, and remanded the matter to the trial court, as it was unclear from the agreement as to whether the payments were to be considered alimony and whether the husband’s obligations would continue after his death. Beezley v. Beezley, 917 So. 2d 803, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 704 (Miss. Ct. App. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the record showed that the parties had been married almost 20 years and that the wife had primarily worked at a few part-time jobs, in addition to raising two children, the appellate court held: (1) as to the husband’s part ownership in the business, the chancellor was within his discretion in finding that there was no goodwill, because said air conditioning business had numerous skilled employees, the husband was not an essential, irreplaceable part of said business, and the business would have operated normally if the husband left the business; (2) even though the husband was granted primary physical custody of the parties’ minor child, the award of child support to the wife was not improper based on the criteria for overcoming the presumption that the guidelines were appropriate; (3) the award of periodic alimony to the wife was proper given the length of the marriage, given the fact that the parties had enjoyed a high standard of living, and given that the wife had very little education or work experience; and (4) the wife’s acts of infidelity which occurred while the parties were separated was not a ground for denying alimony. Rush v. Rush, 932 So. 2d 800, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 533 (Miss. Ct. App. 2005), aff'd in part and rev'd in part, 932 So. 2d 794, 2006 Miss. LEXIS 354 (Miss. 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the father was severely in arrears as to his child support obligation and had voluntarily left his employment for early retirement, he came into court with unclean hands. Thus, the chancellor properly denied his motion for modification of child support. Leiden v. Leiden, 902 So. 2d 582, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 879 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004), cert. denied, 901 So. 2d 1273, 2005 Miss. LEXIS 331 (Miss. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancellor erred in changing the alimony from rehabilitative to permanent periodic alimony at a review hearing where a motion for modification was never filed. Further, the chancellor erred in focusing on the husband’s financial condition; the focus should have been on the wife’s financial condition, as the fact that the husband’s financial condition was about the same as it had been earlier had no bearing on whether the wife had arrived at a point that the wife no longer needed financial help. Oster v. Oster, 876 So. 2d 428, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 377 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court applied the incorrect legal standard in determining if alimony was reasonable; the Ferguson factors were used to determine whether alimony was proper in a case, except the chancellor did not use these factors, but instead used the Hemsley factors, which were used to determine if alimony is reasonable, such that since he applied the wrong legal standard, the determination of alimony was reversed and remanded. Smith v. Smith, 856 So. 2d 717, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 904 (Miss. Ct. App. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Ex-husband argued that that in addition to the seven year bar under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.15.html#t15c01s15-1-43" target="_blank">15-1-43</a></cite>, laches and/or equitable estoppel should have precluded ex-wife from enforcing any of the 1981 settlement agreement’s financial provisions, except those that he had already met, and that the parties had a verbal understanding that, while he would continue paying $ 3,900 per month in alimony, the ex-wife would not seek to enforce the escalator and retirement fund provisions of the settlement agreement. However, by the husband’s threats, the husband came into court with “unclean hands,” which prevented the husband from being able to assert equitable defenses, there was no fraud or overreaching on the ex-wife’s part with respect to the 1981 settlement agreement, and the contempt order for the ex-husband to pay alimony, and stock dividend division arrearages, of almost one-half million, was proper. Nicholas v. Nicholas, 841 So. 2d 1208, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 287 (Miss. Ct. App. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       Property settlement provided for payments consistent with nonmodifiable lump-sum alimony, rather than periodic alimony, even though they were to end upon death of the payor husband and were to be replaced by potentially lesser amount of life insurance proceeds, where agreement designated payments as lump-sum alimony, provided for payment of fixed sum, clearly stated that said payments were not modifiable, and very significantly, did not provide for termination of payments upon wife’s death. McDonald v. McDonald, 683 So. 2d 929, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 633 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Lump-sum alimony is not in the nature of continuing support, but rather, is a property transfer which is vested in recipient spouse at the time said alimony is awarded. McDonald v. McDonald, 683 So. 2d 929, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 633 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       “Rehabilitative periodic alimony,” synonymous with “periodic transitional alimony,” is a separate and equitable tool for chancellors to use in their discretion, and allows a party needing assistance to become self-supporting without becoming destitute in the interim. Hubbard v. Hubbard, 656 So. 2d 124, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 283 (Miss. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       “Periodic alimony” and “rehabilitative periodic alimony” vest as they become due and are modifiable; however, periodic alimony is for an indefinite period of time, while rehabilitative alimony is for a fixed period. Hubbard v. Hubbard, 656 So. 2d 124, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 283 (Miss. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       While both rehabilitative periodic alimony and lump sum alimony which is not paid all at once can share the same characteristic of being a certain amount of money paid over a definite period of time, they are distinguishable in their modifiability, respective purposes, and by the intent for which the chancellor grants them; rehabilitative periodic alimony is not intended as an equalizer between the parties but is for the purpose of allowing the less able party to start anew without being destitute in the interim, while lump sum alimony is intended as an equalizer between the parties to serve equity between them completely, once and for all. Hubbard v. Hubbard, 656 So. 2d 124, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 283 (Miss. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       A wife’s lump sum alimony award of $24,000 was grossly inadequate and constituted an abuse of discretion where the husband had a net worth of at least $315,000 due to an inheritance from his family, the wife’s estimated minimum monthly expenses totalled $1,600, she was awarded $500 per month in child support payments, and she earned gross monthly wages of $340, since the award did not allow the wife to maintain her accustomed standard of living and did not reflect a consideration of her lack of available resources or the husband’s ability to pay. Creekmore v. Creekmore, 651 So. 2d 513, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 110 (Miss. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       When the equitable distribution of property acquired during the marriage is accomplished, the resultant division of assets and liabilities must be factored into the determination of other financial matters such as alimony and child support. Bennett v. Bennett, 650 So. 2d 517, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 86 (Miss. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       In determining an award of alimony upon divorce, homemaker contributions are not to be measured by a mechanical formula, but on the contribution to the economic and emotional well-being of the family unit. Ferguson v. Ferguson, 639 So. 2d 921, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 352 (Miss. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       An antenuptial contract is like any other contract and as such is subject to the same rules of construction and interpretation applicable to contracts. Estate of Hensley v. Estate of Hensley, 524 So. 2d 325, 1988 Miss. LEXIS 212 (Miss. 1988).

       Prior to statutory revision, in a divorce action instituted by a husband against his wife, the trial court erred in granting alimony to the wife where she had filed an answer but had not filed a cross-bill for affirmative relief. Diamond v. Diamond, 403 So. 2d 129, 1981 Miss. LEXIS 2159 (Miss. 1981), but see Queen v. Queen, 551 So. 2d 197, 1989 Miss. LEXIS 363 (Miss. 1989).
      </p>
      <p>
       A husband’s challenge to the constitutionality of the statute was untimely where no such challenge had been raised in the original divorce proceedings or in several subsequent proceedings in which he had attempted to defeat or reduce the alimony award. Walker v. Walker, 389 So. 2d 502, 1980 Miss. LEXIS 2112 (Miss. 1980).

       Where neither party is entitled to a divorce under the evidence, no alimony can be allowed. Burnett v. Burnett, 271 So. 2d 90, 1972 Miss. LEXIS 1269 (Miss. 1972).

       A court cannot give relief from civil liability for accrued alimony. Rainwater v. Rainwater, 236 Miss. 412, 110 So. 2d 608, 1959 Miss. LEXIS 334 (Miss. 1959).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a general sense, alimony is an allowance authorized by law to be made to the wife out of her husband’s estate for her support, the amount of his property, whether exempt or not from sale under an ordinary execution, being taken into account in determining such allowance. Felder v. Felder's Estate, 195 Miss. 326, 13 So. 2d 823, 1943 Miss. LEXIS 127 (Miss. 1943).

       Alimony not awarded where prayer therefor is dependent on decree of divorce which cannot be granted. Walker v. Walker, 140 Miss. 340, 105 So. 753, 1925 Miss. LEXIS 267 (Miss. 1925), overruled,

       The allowance of alimony is justified by the natural obligation of the husband, as the bread winner of the family, to support his wife. Robinson v. Robinson, 112 Miss. 224, 72 So. 923, 1916 Miss. LEXIS 93 (Miss. 1916).

       Because the broad, inherent equity powers of a chancery court establish its authority to divide marital assets, and because a chancellor supported the chancellor’s findings by substantial credible evidence in the record, the court did not err in the calculation of marital assets on remand by finding a second mortgage to be a marital debt and a joint obligation of the parties. Gutierrez v. Gutierrez, 233 So.3d 797, 2017 Miss. LEXIS 247 (Miss. 2017).

      </p>
      <p>
       There was no abuse of discretion in a chancellor’s award of periodic alimony to a wife because the chancellor noted that the wife was in her fifties, that the wife and husband had been married for thirty-three years, there was a disparity in the incomes between the parties, the wife’s education level was low, and she had a sparse employment history, which would likely make it difficult for her to obtain gainful employment; there was no error in the chancellor’s determination of fault or misconduct by the husband during the marriage, and the chancellor’s finding of “fault or misconduct” was not the sole reason for awarding periodic alimony but was merely considered in conjunction with the other factors discussed above. George v. George, 22 So.3d 424, 2009 Miss. App. LEXIS 856 (Miss. Ct. App. 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancellor did not err in awarding the wife $500 a month in permanent alimony and properly considered all factors, finding that the wife suffered a defect in her ability to meet her reasonable living expenses after the equitable division of the martial property. Elliott v. Elliott, 11 So.3d 784, 2009 Miss. App. LEXIS 353 (Miss. Ct. App. 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       Award of periodic alimony to the wife was appropriate because the chancellor addressed the Armstrong factors in making the determination, including the length of the marriage, the fault of the parties, the lack of children, the health of the parties, the age of the parties, and the income and expenses of the parties in the alimony determination. Goellner v. Goellner, 11 So.3d 1251, 2009 Miss. App. LEXIS 346 (Miss. Ct. App. 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancellor did not abuse his discretion in awarding the wife rehabilitative alimony as it would serve the purpose of preparing her to reenter the work force when their son reached the age of eighteen. Smith v. Smith, 25 So.3d 369, 2009 Miss. App. LEXIS 283 (Miss. Ct. App. 2009), cert. denied, 24 So.3d 1038, 2010 Miss. LEXIS 17 (Miss. 2010).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a case where a divorce was granted to a wife based on a husband’s habitual drunkenness, a chancellor did not err by denying the wife periodic alimony because the parties would have made almost the exact same amount if the wife had worked 40 hours as a nurse; it was within the chancellor’s discretion to weigh each party’s fault. Also, lump sum alimony was also properly denied since the marital residence, as well as the wife’s education, was paid for by the husband’s parents. Dorsey v. Dorsey, 972 So. 2d 48, 2008 Miss. App. LEXIS 18 (Miss. Ct. App. 2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       Alimony award had to be reversed and the case remanded to the chancery court for a determination of whether periodic or rehabilitative alimony was needed because: (1) neither the bench opinion nor the final decree granting the divorce indicated whether an analysis of the factors for granting alimony was made; (2) the chancellor himself stated that he was astounded that the ex-wife testified she only earned $250 to $270 every two weeks in take home pay; (3) the wife was 41 years old at the time of the trial, and since then the couple’s only child had married and left the marital home; (4) the record indicated that the ex-husband had essentially become voluntarily unemployed in an effort to avoid showing any means to pay the wife the alimony ordered; and (5) from the record it was impossible to see why the wife would need $4,000 per month in periodic alimony, unless the award was meant as an equitable distribution. Carroll v. Carroll, 976 So. 2d 880, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 301 (Miss. Ct. App. 2007), cert. denied, 977 So. 2d 343, 2008 Miss. LEXIS 107 (Miss. 2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancery court did not err by awarding a wife alimony in the amount of $375 per month, after she received a lump sum representing her share of the marital property, based on her age, the fact that the parties were married for 29 years, and her limited earning capacity; the chancery court’s failure to make record consideration of these factors was not error based on the facts. Roberson v. Roberson, 949 So. 2d 866, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 75 (Miss. Ct. App. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       Appellate court affirmed the trial court’s decision as it was clear that the trial court factors such as the length of the marriage, the parties’ respective ages, the income received by both parties, and the fact that the husband would retain the marital home while the wife did not have a home; thus, the appellate court found that the chancellor’s findings were supported by credible evidence in the record, and that she did not abuse her discretion or commit manifest error in awarding alimony. Blalack v. Blalack, 938 So. 2d 909, 2006 Miss. App. LEXIS 721 (Miss. Ct. App. 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Trial court did not err in awarding the wife alimony in the amount of $1,000 per month pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c05s93-5-23" target="_self">93-5-23</a></cite>, as the trial court considered all the proper factors before awarding the alimony, and the award of alimony was consistent with the testimony presented. Dobbs v. Dobbs, 912 So. 2d 491, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 709 (Miss. Ct. App. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a divorce action, a wife was properly awarded $250 per month in alimony where the evidence showed that she had worked on the husband’s chicken farm for many years, had declining health, and worked part-time as a massage therapist; the chancery court properly applied the factors under Armstrong v. Armstrong, 618 So.2d 1278, 1280 (Miss. 1993), and reviewed the parties’ financial statements. Stuart v. Stuart, 956 So. 2d 295, 2006 Miss. App. LEXIS 759 (Miss. Ct. App. 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court did not err in refusing to award alimony to a wife even though the husband’s income was substantially higher as the couple’s marriage was very short, and most, if not all, of the wife’s requests were met through the trial court’s property distribution. Larney v. Record, 908 So. 2d 171, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 487 (Miss. Ct. App. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a no-fault divorce, the record showed that the line of questioning at issue (primarily cross-examination of the husband), was not intended to establish that he had abandoned the wife by his leaving the marital home before the marriage, but was for the purpose of establishing time lines and the financial contributions of the parties. The questioning was also to determine how the payments of the wife’s vehicle were being made, not to establish fault; there was no indication that the husband’s having left the marital home was the driving factor in establishing the alimony award to the wife, and in any event, the fact that both spouses agreed to a divorce did not eliminate the consideration of the fault factor. Patterson v. Patterson, 917 So. 2d 111, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 432 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 921 So. 2d 1279, 2005 Miss. LEXIS 812 (Miss. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       While the chancery court did not specifically mention the Armstrong factors, the chancery court did find: (1) that the divorce was a result of the husband’s adultery; (2) that the wife’s earnings were about half of her husband’s; (3) that her cancer and other health problems prohibited her from seeking other employment; and (4) that the parties were married for 29 years. Those factors all favored an award of periodic alimony for the wife and there was no manifest error. White v. White, 913 So. 2d 323, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 250 (Miss. Ct. App. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Alimony the husband was ordered to pay met only the reasonable needs of the wife and barely allowed her to pay her living expenses; no evidence indicated that the wife was living extravagantly or wasting the husband’s alimony checks and even though the trial court did not properly consider fault as a factor in awarding alimony, the alimony award was not rendered improper, and the wife had established her inability to pay her own attorney’s fees and rejected the husband’s argument that her inability to pay her legal bills was due to her costly vices. Lawton v. Lawton, 905 So. 2d 723, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 1067 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a trial court did not delineate its reasoning and analysis regarding the amount and type of alimony to be distributed, and its award of rehabilitative periodic alimony to the wife was arguably inappropriate because she had a stable, professional job and did not put her career on hold during the marriage, the case was remanded to the trial court for determination of the appropriate type and amount of alimony. Holley v. Holley, 892 So. 2d 183, 2004 Miss. LEXIS 1171 (Miss. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Court erred in its alimony award where the income that the chancellor did not consider in the original award to the wife did not serve to convince him to lower alimony; instead, he raised it; therefore, the same debt served to advantage the wife twice; first, to increase her award of assets, and second, to increase her award of alimony. Watson v. Watson, 882 So. 2d 95, 2004 Miss. LEXIS 709 (Miss. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the parties were married approximately 36 years, in awarding the wife more than two-thirds of the marital estate, the chancellor clearly recognized the wife’s contributions to the financial well-being of the marriage. The great majority of the assets awarded the wife were unencumbered while most of the property awarded the husband held mortgages; further, the wife had the ability to resume a nursing career, and on those facts the chancellor’s decision denying alimony was not erroneous. Marsh v. Marsh, 868 So. 2d 394, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 202 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancellor did not abuse his discretion in finding that a wife was not entitled to an award of alimony where the chancellor conducted a thorough analysis of all the relevant factors. Tynes v. Tynes, 860 So. 2d 325, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 1065 (Miss. Ct. App. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the parties were in their late 50s, and husband’s net income was over double that of the wife, an award of the parties’ home, one-half of the husband’s 401K, and periodic alimony to wife was proper, especially since the wife was going to lose health coverage through the husband’s employer; the husband’s support of a girlfriend was not grounds to reduce alimony, and a recitation of facts in the judgment showed the chancellor covered most, if not all the Ferguson and Armstrong factors, so that no reversal was required. Palmer v. Palmer, 841 So. 2d 185, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 244 (Miss. Ct. App. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       Factors to be in awarding alimony include parties’ income and expenses, parties’ health and earning, parties’ needs, parties’ obligations and assets, presence or absence of minor children in the home, parties’ ages, parties’ standard of living during marriage and at time of support determination, tax consequences of spousal support order, parties’ fault or misconduct, any wasteful dissipation of assets by either party, and any other factor deemed by the court to be just and equitable. Parsons v. Parsons, 678 So. 2d 701, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 410 (Miss. 1996).

       Alimony was denied to a former wife in a divorce matter after a consideration of the factors under Armstrong v. Armstrong, 618 So.2d 1278 (Miss. 1993); a chancery court did not just look to the wife’s adultery in making its decision, but also relied on her work history, her extreme behavior, and her unwillingness to contribute either directly or indirectly to the marriage. Brabham v. Brabham, 950 So. 2d 1098, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 128 (Miss. Ct. App. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       Court of appeals erred in holding that the trial court had improperly imposed alimony to punish the husband for his adultery, as the trial court specifically stated that it was not doing so; therefore, alimony, although incorrect as to its specific type, was awarded for its proper purpose. Holley v. Holley, 892 So. 2d 183, 2004 Miss. LEXIS 1171 (Miss. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where alimony is otherwise appropriate, it should not be denied a wife solely because she is adjudged at fault in the divorce judgment; adultery should not stand as an absolute bar to alimony, especially when denial of alimony would render the wife destitute; thus, a wife who committed adultery was entitled to minimal alimony in an amount which would not leave her in a state of financial misfortune where she contributed substantially to the total accumulation of marital assets, the marriage lasted approximately 25 years, the wife had no separate income or estate while the husband’s was substantial, and the wife lacked any financial security without alimony. Hammonds v. Hammonds, 597 So. 2d 653, 1992 Miss. LEXIS 195 (Miss. 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       A husband who was granted a divorce on the ground of the wife’s adultery would not be required to pay the wife periodic alimony where the wife was a college graduate, she was capable of full-time employment, and she owned 49.8 percent of the shares in the corporate owner of 5 commercially successful McDonald’s restaurants. Retzer v. Retzer, 578 So. 2d 580, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 858 (Miss. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       It was an abuse of discretion on the part of the trial court to refuse to grant alimony to complainant wife when the long marriage of the parties, the conduct accorded the wife by her husband, the admission of adultery in open court on his part, as well as the ages of the parties, including the likelihood of unemployment by reason thereof, were taken into consideration. Horton v. Horton, 269 So. 2d 347, 1972 Miss. LEXIS 1224 (Miss. 1972).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where, in a divorce action, the wife’s infidelity was overwhelmingly established by the evidence and at least in part was not condoned, it was error for the court to make an allowance for her support. King v. King, 191 So. 2d 409, 1966 Miss. LEXIS 1213 (Miss. 1966).
      </p>

       When a divorce has been properly granted because of the adultery of the wife, she is not entitled either to alimony or to the custody of the children. Keyes v. Keyes, 252 Miss. 138, 171 So. 2d 489, 1965 Miss. LEXIS 1084 (Miss. 1965).
      </p>
      <p>
       When divorce has been properly granted because of the adultery of the wife, she is not entitled either to alimony or to the custody of the children, save temporarily as to an infant so young as not to permit separation from its mother, and save in exceptional circumstances. Winfield v. Winfield, 203 Miss. 391, 35 So. 2d 443, 1948 Miss. LEXIS 285 (Miss. 1948).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where decree of divorce in favor of husband was sustainable on ground of wife’s adultery, award of alimony and custody of the youngest of three children, aged six years, to the wife was wholly reversed and vacated and a decree entered awarding the custody of the children to the father, leaving the privilege of visitation to the children open for the chancellor to determine on remand.

       Trial court did not err in awarding a wife $1,000 per month as permanent alimony because the parties were married 26 years, the majority of marital assets received by the wife consisted of retirement accounts that she could not use for living expenses without incurring substantial tax penalties, the husband earned considerably more income than the wife and had the potential for his income to increase further through promotions, and the husband was primarily at fault for the collapse of the marriage.

Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c05s93-5-23" target="_self">93-5-23</a></cite>, albeit deemed periodic alimony, was based on an errant division of marital property, if the chancellor found on remand that the wife’s wasteful dissipation of assets through gambling exceeded one-half of the value of the marital estate, no more need be done as to equitable distribution of marital assets. Lowrey v. Lowrey, 25 So.3d 274, 2009 Miss. LEXIS 549 (Miss. 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancellor did not err in awarding lump-sum alimony of $60,000 to the wife to counterbalance the award of real property, the marital estate’s only asset, to the husband because the wife had no separate estate since she contributed her entire inheritance from her mother–approximately $80,000–to the family and those funds had been used to purchase the home. Further, the wife lacked financial security because she had repeatedly sacrificed her career to help her husband advance his, had supported her husband while he went to school, and was in remission after surviving breast cancer.

       Where the husband’s adulterous conduct was the sole cause of the breakup of the nineteen-year marriage, the evidence supported the chancellor’s order requiring the husband to pay $ 750 per month in periodic alimony and $ 500 per month in alimony arrearages; the chancellor correctly applied the Armstrong factors. The husband’s net income was greater than the wife’s; her expenses were higher; the children lived with the wife; without alimony, she could not maintain her previous standard of living. Holley v.

       Ex-husband had, shortly before trial, over $500,000 in his personal possession, a working farm, a helicopter, and a mistress with whom he continued to live and financially support after the divorce; thus, the chancellor did not err in finding that the husband had the ability to pay the spousal support ordered in the final judgment. Carroll v. Carroll, 976 So. 2d 880, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 301 (Miss. Ct. App. 2007), cert. denied, 977 So. 2d 343, 2008 Miss. LEXIS 107 (Miss. 2008).

       Where evidence indicated that a former wife and her boyfriend were mutually supportive of one another, the trial court did not err in ruling that the wife was not entitled to rehabilitative alimony. Alexis v. Tarver, 879 So. 2d 1078, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 750 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).

       Where a former wife’s net income slightly exceeded her former husband’s, and she was awarded over $300,000, or 51.7 percent, of the marital property, which adequately provided for her needs, the chancellor did not err in denying her alimony. McLaurin v. McLaurin, 853 So. 2d 1279, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 787 (Miss. Ct. App. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence supported determination that wife was entitled to alimony, notwithstanding husband’s testimony concerning amount of his expenses; husband’s testimony that he had $500 monthly “expenses” consisting of money put aside for “emergency” showed that such “expenses” actually were “savings” and husband’s failure to document other claimed expenses, $400 per month of which were unnecessary, rendered those claims highly suspect. Parsons v. Parsons, 678 So. 2d 701, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 410 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Wife’s financial declaration, reverse side of which revealed itemized list of wife’s monthly expenses, was sufficient evidence of wife’s needs to justify award of alimony. Parsons v. Parsons, 678 So. 2d 701, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 410 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       A chancellor was correct in awarding lump sum alimony to a wife, even though she did not contribute to the husband’s accumulation of wealth, where the husband’s wealth was inherited from his family, the wife’s wages during the first 5 years of the marriage helped to conserve the husband’s estate, she worked during most of the marriage while he did not, she quit her job after both parties agreed that she should stay home with their daughter, her separate income and estate were meager in comparison to his, and she would enjoy no financial security without lump sum alimony. Creekmore v. Creekmore, 651 So. 2d 513, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 110 (Miss. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       An award of alimony to a wife would be reversed and remanded for reconsideration in light of the division of marital property accomplished by the parties’ stipulation where the chancellor failed to take into consideration the extent of the assets awarded to the wife and the income therefrom when determining the award of alimony.

      <p>
       A trial court did not err in refusing to award alimony to a 62-year-old wife where the parties were married for only 6 years, the wife left the marriage economically stronger than she entered, she worked part time and received monthly social security income, the 67-year-old husband did not intend to resume his carpentry work full time and had recently undergone surgery for a hernia repair, and there was no jointly acquired property.

       A wife was entitled to lump sum alimony where the parties were married for 22 years, the wife worked to help support the family seemingly at the expense of her own education, she stayed home to care for the children when the couple decided that was best, she worked on and off throughout the marriage for the husband’s medical practice, and there was a large disparity between the parties’ estates.

      </p>
      <p>
       In determining an award of lump sum alimony, the following factors should be considered: (1) substantial contribution to accumulation of total wealth of the payor, either by quitting a job to become a homemaker or by assisting in the spouse’s business; (2) a long marriage; (3) the recipient spouse has no separate income or the separate income is meager by comparison; and (4) without the lump sum award, the receiving spouse would lack financial security.

      <p>
       A chancellor abused his discretion in denying periodic alimony to a wife where the chancellor awarded a divorce to the wife on the ground of the husband’s habitual cruel and inhuman treatment, the duration of the marriage was 22 years, the husband had a “healthy income” and was able to afford alimony in a reasonable amount, and some form of alimony was required in order to prevent the wife from being in desperate need.

       A husband who was granted a divorce on the ground of the wife’s adultery would not be required to pay the wife periodic alimony where the wife was a college graduate, she was capable of full-time employment, and she owned 49.8 percent of the shares in the corporate owner of 5 commercially successful McDonald’s restaurants. Retzer v. Retzer, 578 So. 2d 580, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 858 (Miss. 1990).

       A wife was not entitled to alimony and child support where she received 1/2 of the proceeds from the operation of the parties’ chicken farm, which was their most valuable asset, she was provided with substantial income for her and the children, and the property was divided equally between the parties with the exception of a 101-acre tract of land in which the wife had a lesser interest. Martin v. Martin, 566 So. 2d 704, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 466 (Miss. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       An award of lump sum alimony to a wife was not an abuse of discretion, even though the wife would not have lacked financial security without the lump sum award, where the wife resigned from her employment at the request of her husband to assist him in the operation of his real estate business 6 months after the parties’ marriage, she was able to contribute more to the business after she received her license to sell real estate, she resigned from her employment with another realtor at the request of her husband because the realtor was a competitor, she promoted her husband’s business through her home and social life, she assumed all of the duties associated with running the family’s household, the parties were married for 19 years, and the wife’s estate was substantially less than the husband’s net worth. White v. White, 557 So. 2d 480, 1989 Miss. LEXIS 516 (Miss. 1989).
      </p>
      <p>
       A divorcing spouse, who has assisted his wife or her husband in the accumulation of wealth during the marriage as reflected by an increase in net worth, may be awarded lump sum alimony reflecting an equitable portion of the increase. Moreover, a substantial lump sum award of alimony is similarly appropriate where one spouse has accumulated considerable property and the other spouse has contributed by doing his or her part as a homemaker. White v. White, 557 So. 2d 480, 1989 Miss. LEXIS 516 (Miss. 1989).

       Incident to judgment for divorce, Chancery Court has authority to award alimony after considering, weighing, and balancing among other factors, (1) health and earning capacity of husband, (2) health and earning capacity of wife, (3) entire sources of income of both parties, and (4) such other facts and circumstances bearing on subject that might be shown by evidence.

       Even in cases where the wife has been guilty of fault justifying granting the husband a divorce, alimony, if allowed at all, should be reasonable in amount, commensurate with wife’s accustomed standard of living, minus her own resources, and considering the husband’s ability to pay. Wood v. Wood, 495 So. 2d 503, 1986 Miss. LEXIS 2691 (Miss. 1986).

      <p>
       Where a couple had been married for approximately 24 years, at the beginning of the marriage they had no assets and the husband made a salary of $85 per week, and at the time of the divorce the husband admitted assets of $800,000, and the wife’s worth was meager by comparison, since the wife had contributed to the accumulation of the property of her husband, doing her part as a housewife, it would not be improper that she be allowed a reasonable amount as lump-sum alimony in conjunction with an award of monthly alimony. Jenkins v. Jenkins, 278 So. 2d 446, 1973 Miss. LEXIS 1445 (Miss. 1973).
      </p>
      <p>
       It was an abuse of discretion on the part of the trial court to refuse to grant alimony to complainant wife when the long marriage of the parties, the conduct accorded the wife by her husband, the admission of adultery in open court on his part, as well as the ages of the parties, including the likelihood of unemployment by reason thereof, were taken into consideration.

       Where a divorce was granted to the husband because of the wife’s fault, although the record revealed that the wife was not entirely to blame for the dissolution of the marriage, and where the wife received income from a prior husband for the support of her children and the prior husband also had arranged a home for the children, and it appeared that the wife was able to earn her own living, a decree awarding alimony to the wife would be reversed. Russell v. Russell, 241 So. 2d 366, 1970 Miss. LEXIS 1339 (Miss. 1970).
      </p>
      <p>
       It was not abuse of discretion to deny alimony to a divorced wife, where following their separation, the wife removed the furniture and appliances from the home of the parties and sold most of the cattle of the husband, retaining the proceeds for her own use, and also kept the automobile, the payments for which the husband was directed by the court to pay.

      </p>
      <p>
       Where the record shows that the husband was at least partially at fault and that the wife was sick and unable to earn a living and had no means of support other than living with her parents, this evidence was adequate to warrant the finding of the chancellor that the wife was entitled to alimony.

       Where the parties agreed to an irreconcilable differences divorce, the wife was awarded $2,615,815 upon the distribution of the parties’ $ 5.1 million marital estate. In light of the wife’s property settlement, the chancellor’s alimony award of $7,000 per month was against the overwhelming weight of the evidence and not supported by the record. Cosentino v.

      </p>
      <p>
       Award of periodic alimony in the amount of $375 per month was appropriate based on the disparity in the earning capacity of the parties, the fact that a wife had fewer work prospects, the parties had been married for 29 years, and the wife had nowhere to live as a result of the judgment; moreover, it was of no consequence that the husband was unemployed at the time of the award because he was a skilled carpenter who could have easily found work.

       A provision in a divorce decree which directed the husband to pay the wife a sum certain and specified regular installment payments was a final settlement of all of the husband’s financial obligations to the wife, and therefore the wife’s subsequent action for a share of the husband’s military retirement pension was precluded; it should have been known at the time of the divorce that the husband would ultimately become eligible for military retirement pay and, since there was nothing to indicate otherwise, it had to be assumed that in fixing the financial terms of the original divorce judgment the chancery court considered all relevant facts, including the husband’s ultimate eligibility for military retirement.

       The duration of a periodic alimony award, which directed the husband to pay monthly alimony of $700 until July, 2001, at which time the sum would be reduced to $550, was not excessive where the husband made no showing that the chancellor should have deviated from the general rule which dictates that periodic alimony terminates upon death or remarriage.

       Chancellor was neither manifestly wrong nor did he abuse his discretion when he awarded a wife only $300 a month in periodic alimony because the award was not oppressive, unjust, or grossly inadequate.

When the two estates were reviewed in combination with the two year rehabilitative alimony of $ 200 per month, the wife’s estate was valued at $ 15,900 and the husband’s estate was valued at $ 10,175, which did not even include the amount of temporary support the wife had received since the parties’ separation, the value of living in the marital residence over the period of the parties’ separation, or the value of all the personal property in the marital residence awarded to the wife; thus, the chancery court did not abuse its discretion in its award of rehabilitative alimony of $ 200 per month. Fogarty v. Fogarty, 922 So. 2d 836, 2006 Miss. App. LEXIS 139 (Miss. Ct. App. 2006).

      <p>
       In a divorce case, while the trial court concluded that it could be said that alimony should have decreased in recent years because of decreases in the ex-husband’s income, it could also be said that alimony should have increased for two other years because of his increased income for those two years; thus, the trial court’s decision not to modify the periodic alimony award was not manifestly wrong. Brennan v. Ebel, 880 So. 2d 1058, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 233 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 882 So. 2d 234, 2004 Miss. LEXIS 1084 (Miss. 2004).

       Where the wife’s assets could not produce income sufficient to meet her recurring monthly living expenses, requiring the husband to continue to contribute an amount of $ 850 per month in alimony to permit his former wife to continue to meet her recurring expenses could not be considered excessive and did not demonstrate an abuse of discretion by the chancellor. Seale v. Seale, 863 So. 2d 996, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 3 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the husband failed to make all the mandated alimony payments to the wife, the wife admitted to receiving various benefits from the husband after he stopped submitting checks marked “alimony;” the chancery court had to classify each of the payments made and determine whether or not they were court-ordered expenses, such as medical or dental expenses, for which the husband would not be entitled to a credit, and others not specifically ordered but that were of benefit to the wife, such as payment of her household utilities. Franklin v. Franklin, 864 So. 2d 970, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 1113 (Miss. Ct. App. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       The totality of a chancellor’s awards of alimony and property to a wife was excessive where the wife was awarded periodic alimony which exceeded the husband’s net income as well as his gross income, she was granted greater than 50 percent of the marital property, and she was awarded substantial lump sum alimony. Brooks v. Brooks, 652 So. 2d 1113, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 152 (Miss. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       Alimony should be reasonable in amount, “first deducting the resources of the wife and then finding an amount commensurate with the wife’s accustomed standard of living, and considering the ability of the husband to pay.” As long as the chancellor follows this general standard, the amount of the award is largely within his or her discretion. The chancellor should consider the reasonable needs of the wife and the right of the husband to lead as normal a life as possible with a decent standard of living. Brendel v. Brendel, 566 So. 2d 1269, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 539 (Miss. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       In awarding the original sum of alimony and child support, the factors which must be considered are the health of the husband and his earning capacity, the health of the wife and her earning capacity, the entire sources of income of both parties, the reasonable needs of the wife, the reasonable needs of the child, the necessary living expenses of the husband, the estimated amount of income taxes the respective parties must pay on their income, the fact that the wife has the free use of the home, furnishings, and automobile, and such other facts and circumstances bearing on the subject as might be shown by the evidence.

       Award of alimony and child support must be made to wife who for some 13 years has used her income to pay household bills so that husband could invest his income; husband cannot be permitted to reap all benefits of increase in income and net worth simply by divesting himself of assets to avoid appearance of income.

       In a dissolution matter, a chancery court did not abuse its discretion in awarding a wife $ 1,500 per month in periodic alimony because the parties were married eleven years, the wife suffered from a genetic illness and was unable to work, and the husband earned $ 84,000 per year while the wife’s annual $ 9,324 Social Security disability benefit was her only source of income; the husband was fully aware of the wife’s illness prior to their marriage.

       Award of $1,000 in temporary spousal support was upheld on review where the evidence showed that a former husband had the ability to pay this due to his employment as a doctor; the trial court reviewed the financial situations of the parties, including the fact that the wife had returned to work as a nurse, and moreover the husband was properly found in contempt for failing to make this payment for seven months.

      <p>
       Chancellor did not abuse his discretion in awarding the wife alimony where the record was clear that the wife’s income along with her share of marital property and child support would not cover the basic monthly expenses for herself and her children; the addition of $1,000 per month in alimony left the wife with only a moderate surplus after paying the basic monthly expenses for her and her children.

       Chancellor did not err by awarding a former wife $2,500 per month in periodic alimony where the evidence showed that a former husband was capable of earning more than $12,000 per month; moreover, it was not error to order that twenty-five percent of the earnings over $150,000 be awarded to the wife to account for the husband’s fluctuating income.

      <p>
       Chancellor did not err in a divorce case by refusing to award a wife periodic payments of rehabilitative alimony; the wife’s situation was not the type that warranted such an award because she did not need retraining to reenter the workforce after being a stay at home mother for three years, and she failed to substantiate money borrowed to pay debts.

       A chancellor did not err in awarding a wife periodic alimony in the amount of $300 per month where the parties were married for 10 years, the husband was retired, the wife was permanently disabled, the wife’s monthly income was $525 and her monthly expenses were approximately $1100, the husband’s monthly income was $1413 and his monthly expenses were approximately $1120, and both parties were awarded exclusive use of an unencumbered home and at least one automobile.

       A chancellor committed a severe abuse of discretion when he awarded a wife only $12,000 in lump sum alimony and refused to grant her any periodic payment alimony where there was a large disparity between the parties’ income and earning capacity, the husband would have no difficulty contributing monthly support payments to the wife given his significant income, the wife supported the couple for the first 11 years of their 17-year marriage which enabled the husband to obtain a medical degree, and the wife had experienced a deterioration in her mental state as evidenced by her psychological and emotional treatment at a hospital on 2 different occasions; the chancellor had a duty to attempt to see that the wife, who had a history of emotional problems, be provided for in her present and future mentally disturbed state.

       An award of $500 per month in alimony and $950 per month in child support was not an abuse of discretion where the wife, who had custody of the parties’ child, was a school teacher with a net income of $832.18 per month, a check spread indicated that the monthly living expenses for the wife and the child was $2,625.93, the husband was a certified public accountant who had a total personal net taxable income of $58,688 in 1987, the wife was not awarded any part of the husband’s oil share investment, resident real estate investment, commercial building, or an equitable interest in 8 acres and a house which the husband inherited, and the award was not so high that it would provide the wife and child with a higher standard of living than the husband.

      </p>
      <p>
       An award of periodic alimony to a wife in the amount of $700 per month was not excessive where both parties were in good health and of approximately the same age, the husband earned an annual salary of $41,000, the wife earned an annual salary of $13,624, the husband attended high school through the 10th grade, the wife graduated high school, the wife received use of the parties’ home and automobile but was responsible for paying the notes on both, and the husband had no responsibility for payment of the note on the home or the automobile; the terms of the decree placed both parties in nearly identical financial positions. Even if the award provided the wife with slightly more disposable income than the husband, such a disparity would not be sufficient to prove an abuse of discretion. Boykin v.

       A divorce action would be remanded to the trial court for further consideration of the alimony award to the wife upon additional evidence being taken of the husband’s ability to pay, since the award of $300 per month alimony and the use of the jointly owned home was grossly inadequate for a wife of 34 years, provided the former husband had earning ability or assets indicative of greater ability to pay.

       An award of $1,000 per month for the support of the wife was not equitable and just since it was insufficient to maintain her in accord with her station and condition in life and in harmony with the estate of her husband, particularly since the monthly payments were subject to be terminated by the death of the husband, leaving the wife with no security in that event, an insurance policy upon the husband’s life with the wife being one of the beneficiaries, was subject to termination by the company which the husband controlled, and the monthly award was insufficient to support the wife with basic necessities and to maintain the home as existed prior to the divorce.

       Under a showing that the divorced wife, in addition to owning her own home and 367 acres of land, also owned personal property of the value of several thousand dollars, and prior to the separation she had been employed at a salary of more than $200 per month, while the husband earned slightly more than $422 a month and owned no property except an automobile which was used in his employment, an award to the wife of $200 per month as alimony and support of the parties’ minor child was unjust and oppressive and the supreme court could reduce the amount to $150 a month, without remanding the case for rehearing, since all of the facts necessary to enable the court to make a determination were in the record.

      </p>
      <p>
       Where alimony decree relieving husband of all future obligations to support wife by paying $1250 and allowing her the use of the home for one year, was unjust under the circumstances, supreme court decreed that husband pay her $60 per month and permit her to occupy the home, or, at her option, to pay her $100 per month without the use of the home, to continue until a change in circumstances justified a modification of the order.

       Chancellor had not erroneously classified the payment of one half of the husband’s military retirement as lump sum alimony because the payment of one-half of the husband’s military retirement had no fixed duration, nor, as of the time of the proceedings sub judice, a fixed amount. However, the instant property settlement agreement granted the wife one-half of the military retirement, and the chancellor correctly stated in his final judgment that the husband’s payment of such benefits was a “substitute for a property division” and thus characterized as lump sum alimony.

       Chancellor did not abuse his discretion in awarding the ex-wife lump sum alimony rather than permanent alimony because (1) the wife was assuming a greater debt than the husband; (2) the wife needed assistance in caring for the children; (3) the wife had been out of the work force for a few years; and (4) the husband’s financial means were greater.

       Where a chancellor awarded a wife lump sum alimony, based, inter alia, on the 32-year marriage, the husband’s fault in causing the divorce by committing a crime that caused him to be imprisoned, and his assets, which included a life estate property interest, the alimony award of $ 12,600 was not so exorbitant as to constitute an abuse of discretion.

       In a divorce case, a chancery court erred in failing to analyze the four factors considered in lump sum alimony awards; the appellate court noted that such an award did not seem appropriate because the parties each had separate assets and households, and the chancery court seemed to base its award on the fact that the wife had extensive medical problems.

       An award to a wife of $12,000 in lump sum alimony was grossly inadequate and constituted an abuse of discretion where the wife’s separate income and estate were meager in comparison to the husband’s, the wife had permanent custody of the party’s minor child, the husband’s monthly child support payments would terminate at his death and his life expectancy was not long, and the amount of the award constituted only 2.6 percent of the husband’s estate.

      <p>
       A wife’s lump sum alimony award of $24,000 was grossly inadequate and constituted an abuse of discretion where the husband had a net worth of at least $315,000 due to an inheritance from his family, the wife’s estimated minimum monthly expenses totalled $1,600, she was awarded $500 per month in child support payments, and she earned gross monthly wages of $340, since the award did not allow the wife to maintain her accustomed standard of living and did not reflect a consideration of her lack of available resources or the husband’s ability to pay.

       A chancellor did not err in awarding lump sum alimony to a wife in the amount of $4500, in addition to periodic alimony in the amount of $300 per month, where the parties were married for 10 years, the wife had assisted in the husband’s business, the husband’s monthly income was $1413 while the wife’s was $525, the husband had obtained $10,000 from the couple’s joint checking account while the wife had removed $5,000, and the husband was awarded sole ownership of 2 vehicles used during the marriage while the wife received only one.

       A chancellor did not abuse her discretion in awarding a wife lump sum alimony in the amount of $25,020 where the parties were married for approximately 18 years, the wife worked for many years in the husband’s businesses without receiving a salary, there was no indication that she was not a dutiful and faithful wife, the husband’s income was more than twice that of the wife’s, the chancellor was skeptical as to the husband’s true earnings and the evidence suggested that the husband had some alternative source of support that he had not disclosed, and the wife would lack financial security without the award.

       A chancellor’s award of lump sum alimony to a wife would be affirmed, even though the post-divorce disparity of the parties’ separate estates demonstrated that the award was skewed slightly in favor of the husband, where it was apparent that the chancellor had been mindful of each party’s circumstances when he made the award.

      <p>
       An award to a wife of $600.00 per month in the form of “periodic transitional alimony” for 30 months, which was actually a lump sum award payable in fixed periodic installments, was not excessive where the wife’s net income was $896.00 per month, her monthly expenses totalled $2,843.00, the husband’s net income was approximately $5,075.00 per month, and his monthly expenses amounted to approximately $2,539.00.

      <p>
       A chancellor committed a severe abuse of discretion when he awarded a wife only $12,000 in lump sum alimony and refused to grant her any periodic payment alimony where there was a large disparity between the parties’ income and earning capacity, the husband would have no difficulty contributing monthly support payments to the wife given his significant income, the wife supported the couple for the first 11 years of their 17-year marriage which enabled the husband to obtain a medical degree, and the wife had experienced a deterioration in her mental state as evidenced by her psychological and emotional treatment at a hospital on 2 different occasions; the chancellor had a duty to attempt to see that the wife, who had a history of emotional problems, be provided for in her present and future mentally disturbed state.

      </p>
      <p>
       A lump sum alimony award to a wife in the amount of $60,000 was so low as to be an abuse of discretion where the parties had been married for approximately 14 years, the husband had had assets worth $817,000 before the marriage, the wife had had assets worth $30,000 before the marriage, the husband’s worth had increased $446,000 during the course of the marriage, the wife’s assets had increased by $110,754.11, and though the wife’s contributions to her husband’s construction business had not been significant, her efforts had been concentrated more as a homemaker.

      </p>
      <p>
       A trial court abused its discretion in limiting a wife’s lump sum alimony award to $50,000 where the evidence showed a substantial increase in wealth obtained during the course of the parties’ marriage, the wife’s contributions to the marriage and promotion of the husband’s business were worth substantially more, the wife quit 2 jobs to assist in her husband’s business, and she was instrumental in the public relations aspect of the business.

      </p>
      <p>
       An award to a wife of $5,400 as lump-sum alimony was inadequate and amounted to an abuse of discretion where the wife had contributed $28,000 to the husband while he was in law school, she had contributed $11,000 to a joint savings account upon his completion of law school, $6,900 was put into IRA accounts by the wife in the husband’s name, and the wife contributed $1,200 to office furniture for the husband’s law office.

      </p>
      <p>
       Lump-sum award of $75,000 was not so low as to constitute abuse of discretion, where ex-husband’s assets totaled between $700,000 and $900,000, all accumulated during the marriage, and ex-wife’s total assets at end of marriage were approximately $40,000, reflecting her one-half interest in marital home, although lump-sum award would be payable immediately, instead of upon ex-wife reaching age 65.

       Where husband, who was 57 years old in excellent health for his age, was a board certified neurosurgeon with an annual income of close to $300,000 and net worth well in excess of $900,000, while the wife, who was 59 years old without significant health problems had completed 2 years of college and had no special skills, her work experience being that of a sales clerk with limited clerical training, and whose earning, exclusive of alimony, was about $11,000 per year, an award to wife of periodic monthly alimony of $2,500 was not an abuse of discretion, but a $50,000 lump sum alimony award was so inadequate as to constitute an abuse of discretion and husband would be required to pay her $150,000 as lump sum alimony. Tutor v. Tutor, 494 So. 2d 362, 1986 Miss. LEXIS 2639 (Miss. 1986).

      <p>
       There was no merit to a former husband’s contention that an award of lump-sum alimony in the amount of $240,000 was oppressive or would present the likelihood of the necessity that he liquidate assets, where his net worth had been determined to be not less than $750,000. Schilling v. Schilling, 452 So. 2d 834, 1984 Miss. LEXIS 1654 (Miss. 1984).

      <p>
       A lump sum award of alimony, if reasonable in amount as determined from the circumstances of the parties, does not violate the terms of the statute even though made in conjunction with other alimony, and an order was proper requiring a husband, whose average earnings were in excess of $630 per month and who together with his wife was able to accumulate in excess of $25,000 in savings during the period of the marriage, to pay to the wife the lump sum of $5,325 together with monthly payments of $150.

       Because the appellate court affirmed the chancellor’s grant of divorce based on the husband’s habitual cruel and inhuman treatment of the wife, which materially contributed to their separation, the husband’s claim for separate maintenance was a moot issue. G.B.W. v. E.R.W., 9 So.3d 1200, 2009 Miss. App. LEXIS 285 (Miss. Ct. App. 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       Wife was not entitled to periodic, lump sum, or rehabilitative alimony because the chancellor essentially split the marital estate equally, the disparity between the parties’ estate was less than five hundred dollars, the equitable division of the marital property resulted in no appreciable deficit for either party, and at the time of both of the hearings, the wife was employed full-time as a school teacher. McIntosh v. McIntosh, 977 So. 2d 1257, 2008 Miss. App. LEXIS 184 (Miss. Ct. App. 2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       Wife was not entitled to separate maintenance because she testified that during their separation the husband continued to pay the majority of the household bills. Likewise, the husband testified that he was “willing to pay anything.” McIntosh v. McIntosh, 977 So. 2d 1257, 2008 Miss. App. LEXIS 184 (Miss. Ct. App. 2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a married couple separated, the chancellor properly granted the wife’s request for separate maintenance. The the husband had almost $ 4,000 a month in “spendable” income; therefore, a separate maintenance award of $1800 to his wife would not deplete his estate. Honea v. Honea, 888 So. 2d 1192, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 958 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a married couple decided mutually that the wife would quit her job because the husband’s income was sufficient to support them, upon their separation the wife was entitled to a separate maintenance award. The wife had access to $ 3,600 a month before the separation; she met the qualifications for separate maintenance in that no fault was alleged on her part for the separation. Honea v. Honea, 888 So. 2d 1192, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 958 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Wife need not be totally blameless for an award of separate maintenance to be allowed, but her misconduct must not have materially contributed to the separation. A wife was entitled to a separate maintenance award where the couple’s separation was due to the husband’s desire to spend more time with his children from a previous marriage. Honea v. Honea, 888 So. 2d 1192, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 958 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       In order to award separate maintenance, a court must find a separation without fault on the wife’s part, and willful abandonment of her by the husband with refusal to support her. Honea v. Honea, 888 So. 2d 1192, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 958 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Separate maintenance does not have only one purpose. The purpose of separate maintenance should be to provide, as nearly as may be possible, the same sort of normal support and maintenance for the wife, all things considered, as she would have received in the home if the parties had continued normal cohabitation and the wife had helped in a reasonable way, in view of her health and physical condition, to earn her own support and that of the family. Honea v. Honea, 888 So. 2d 1192, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 958 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Six criteria must be considered in setting awards of separate maintenance: (1) the health of the husband and the wife; (2) their combined earning capacity; (3) the reasonable needs of the wife and children; (4) the necessary living expenses of the husband; (5) the fact that the wife has free use of the home and furnishings; and (6) other such facts and circumstances. Honea v. Honea, 888 So. 2d 1192, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 958 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       While the amount of separate maintenance should provide for the wife as if the couple were still cohabiting, the allowance should not unduly deplete the husband’s estate. Honea v. Honea, 888 So. 2d 1192, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 958 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancellor’s award of separate maintenance to the wife was not excessive where the chancellor took into consideration all the relevant factors when determining the appropriate amount of the payments; the award was equitable due to the wife’s poor health and the great disparity between their respective incomes. Myers v. Myers, 881 So. 2d 220, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 1165 (Miss. Ct. App. 2003), aff'd in part and rev'd in part, 881 So. 2d 180, 2004 Miss. LEXIS 711 (Miss. 2004).

       <p>
   A chancellor properly set aside a separate maintenance agreement where the parties’ marriage was void under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c01s93-1-1" target="_self">93-1-1</a></cite> because they were uncle and niece; equitable estoppel was not available, since the parties had equal access to all the facts and ample opportunity to investigate the legality of the marriage, and public policy prevented validation of the void marriage by the doctrine of estoppel.

      </p>
      <p>
       A chancellor did not err in ordering a wife to “maintain medical insurance” for the parties’ 2 children as a form of separate maintenance where the wife’s income exceeded the husband’s throughout the marriage, the wife’s income was $2932 per month, the husband’s income was $2166 per month, there was no indication that the wife could not secure medical insurance through her employment, and it was the chancellor’s intention to encourage the parties to resume cohabitation. Steen v. Steen, 641 So. 2d 1167, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 371 (Miss. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       A wife was not entitled to separate maintenance where her efforts, attitude and desires to live beyond her husband’s financial means contributed to the parties’ separation because of the psychological makeup of her husband and the husband’s leaving the marriage was justified, even though the wife made efforts to salvage the marriage after the separation by seeking marital counseling. Ramsey v. State, 554 So. 2d 300, 1989 Miss. LEXIS 601 (Miss. 1989).
      </p>
      <p>
       An award of separate maintenance and child support to the wife and the parties’ 3 children of approximately 41 percent of the husband’s $88,700 annual salary was reasonable where both parties were in good health, the husband’s earning power was approximately 4 times as great as the wife’s, and the needs of the wife and the children were reasonable in light of the style of living to which they had become accustomed. Ramsey v. State, 554 So. 2d 300, 1989 Miss. LEXIS 601 (Miss. 1989).
      </p>
      <p>
       A separate maintenance award in the form of a “lump sum” is inappropriate as it runs contrary to the basic purpose of separate maintenance, which is to order the husband to re-enter the marital relationship or pay support to the wife. Presumably, if “lump sum” separate maintenance were allowed, the husband would continue to owe his wife this vested amount even if he resumed the marital relationship, which runs contrary to the policies concerning separate maintenance. Williams v. Williams, 528 So. 2d 296, 1988 Miss. LEXIS 330 (Miss. 1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       Separate maintenance is a monetary amount for support and does not extend to division of marital assets. As a Chancery Court has no authority to divest title to property from the husband on an order of separate maintenance, it likewise lacks authority to vest title to property in the husband in a separate maintenance award. Thompson v. Thompson, 527 So. 2d 617, 1988 Miss. LEXIS 202 (Miss. 1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       An earlier decree of separate maintenance did not bar the relitigation of the issue of maintenance in a divorce decree but, rather, the earlier decree for separate maintenance could be modified upon a showing of a material or substantial change of circumstances arising subsequent to the date of that decree.

       Where the complainant-husband’s charges of his wife’s infidelity were overwhelmingly established by the evidence and her conduct, at least in part, was not condoned, and the wife filed a cross-action for divorce on the ground of her husband’s alleged cruelty, it was error on the part of the trial court to refuse to grant either party a divorce but, instead, to enter a decree of separate maintenance requiring the husband to support his wife; and on appeal the decree of separate maintenance was set aside and the husband was awarded a divorce on his original bill of complaint.

       While a chancellor was within the authority granted the chancellor by the parties when the chancellor ordered the husband to maintain a life-insurance policy with the wife named as the beneficiary, the amount that the husband was required to maintain was unreasonable and excessive. On remand the chancellor was to take a new look at the amount of life insurance that was required to protect the wife’s alimony interest. Griner v. Griner, 235 So.3d 177, 2017 Miss.

      <p>
       Substantial credible evidence supported the chancellor’s decision to award the wife $ 300 per month in periodic alimony and an additional award to pay the note on her mobile home, including any delinquent payments; the wife had several physical conditions that limited her ability to work, and the husband’s behavior was also a factor in the parties’ decision to divorce.

       Chancellor did not err in denying the husband an award of alimony where the trial court properly applied the correct factors to the evidence and determined that an award of alimony was not appropriate. Ericson v. Tullos, 876 So. 2d 1038, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 595 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       A chancellor errs in making an alimony determination where he fails to follow the proper procedure to determine the appropriate division of marital property and award of alimony: (1) the chancellor is to classify the parties’ assets as marital or nonmarital; (2) the chancellor is to evaluate and equitably divide the marital property employing the Ferguson factors as guidelines in light of each party’s nonmarital property, but property division should be based upon a determination of fair market value of the assets, these valuations should be the initial step before determining division, and the chancellor must assume that the contributions and efforts of the marital partners, whether economic, domestic, or otherwise, are of equal value in determining a division of assets; (3) if the marital assets, after equitable division and in light of the parties’ nonmarital assets, will adequately provide for both parties, then no more need be done; and (4) if an equitable division of marital property, considered with each party’s nonmarital assets, leaves a deficit for one party, then alimony should be considered. A chancellor erred where he failed to consider a wife’s domestic contributions equally with her husband’s economic contributions, where he improperly applied an alimony standard of “semblance of living” rather than “standard of living to which the wife was accustomed”, where he failed to properly apply the Hemsley factors to division of marital property, and where he failed to properly apply the Ferguson factors as guidelines to dividing that property. Johnson v. Johnson, 877 So. 2d 485, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 1203 (Miss. Ct. App. 2003), cert. denied, 878 So. 2d 67, 2004 Miss. LEXIS 862 (Miss. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       In the context of property division or alimony in a divorce proceeding, when a chancellor provides a recitation of facts in his judgment that covers most, if not all the Ferguson and Armstrong factors, no reversal is required; a chancellor is in the best position to hear the testimony and view the evidence.

       Broad authority is vested in the chancery courts to provide for the material needs of spouses incident to divorce; there are several forms of aid including, but not limited to: (a) periodic alimony, sometimes called permanent or continuing alimony; (b) lump sum alimony or alimony in gross; (c) division of jointly accumulated property; and (d) award of equitable interest in property. There are no clear lines of demarcation between these, nor should there be, and courts are authorized in their sound discretion to use one or several or all in combination. What is commonly referred to as periodic alimony terminates automatically upon the death of the obligor or the remarriage of the obligee. Periodic alimony is subject to modification or termination in the event of a material change of circumstances subsequent to the decree awarding alimony; such a modification may be made only upon order of the chancery court. Periodic alimony becomes vested only on the date each periodic payment becomes due. In contrast, what is commonly referred to as lump sum alimony is that ordered by the court in such form and manner that from the outset it becomes fixed and irrevocable. Lump sum alimony may be payable in a single lump sum or in fixed periodic installments. It may be payable in cash or in kind or in combination thereof. It is a final settlement between the husband and wife and may not be changed or modified by either party, absent fraud. Lump sum alimony is vested in the obligee when the judgment awarding it becomes final, retroactive to the date the judgment is entered. It becomes an obligation of the estate of the obligor if he or she dies before payment. Because of these important differences between the 2 forms of alimony, chancery courts are urged to be as clear as possible in providing the terms and effects of an alimony award. Bowe v. Bowe, 557 So. 2d 793, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 53 (Miss. 1990).

       Failure to award any alimony is not necessarily an abuse of discretion. Dickerson v. Dickerson, 245 Miss. 370, 148 So. 2d 510, 1963 Miss. LEXIS 524 (Miss. 1963).

       The fact that a divorced plaintiff continued to live under the same roof with the defendant after filing the complaint is a heavy factor to be weighed in considering whether he or she has a valid cause, though it does not in and of itself compel a denial of divorce; it is conceivably possible for valid grounds for divorce to exist despite this. Lawyers representing persons seeking a divorce have the obligation to advise and warn them about the undesirability of continuing to live in the same household following the filing of the suit, and they have the obligation to seek and press for a temporary hearing before the chancellor to secure alimony pendente lite and temporary support money.

       In a divorce case, a former husband’s Sixth Amendment right to counsel was not triggered because he would not have lost his physical liberty if he had not prevailed in a temporary support hearing; the right was implicated in contempt proceedings, but the husband was represented by counsel during those hearings. Bougard v. Bougard, 991 So. 2d 646, 2008 Miss. App. LEXIS 578 (Miss. Ct. App. 2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       Record made it clear that the parties reached their property settlement agreement by and through the negotiations of their attorneys and the court was not persuaded that the language proposed by the former husband reflected the original intent of the parties; a thorough comparison of the documents provided in the record did not lend the court to agree with the husband’s contention that the final agreement should have been reformed due to a mutual mistake to reflect the understanding and intent of the parties. Pratt v. Pratt, 977 So. 2d 386, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 606 (Miss. Ct. App. 2007), cert. denied, 977 So. 2d 343, 2008 Miss. LEXIS 94 (Miss. 2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       When the chancellor, in the judgment of divorce, ordered the husband to pay rehabilitative alimony for six months and neither the husband nor the wife appealed, that judgment became final. The review provision was contained in the judgment of divorce, not in a separate temporary order, and the consequences flowing from the finality of that judgment were binding on both parties; thus, the chancellor erred in converting the rehabilitative alimony into permanent periodic alimony. Oster v. Oster, 876 So. 2d 428, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 377 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       In wife’s action for delinquent child support and delinquent spousal support, there were two judgments, an interim judgment, which did not mention the husband’s motion for modification, and the final judgment which stated that the motion for modification was denied; applying Brennan v. Brennan, the appellate court held the entry of the latter judgment, effective retroactively to the former judgment, cleansed the husband’s hands, since it was the first judgment that was entered after the trial court specifically refused to hear the husband’s motion for modification due to the fact that the husband came into court with unclean hands. Cook v. Whiddon, 866 So. 2d 494, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 130 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>

       In a case involving a dispute over a lump sum alimony award, a chancery court should have considered the changed financial circumstances of the parties when the case was remanded for further proceedings. Haney v. Haney, 881 So. 2d 862, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 1114 (Miss. Ct. App. 2003), aff'd in part and rev'd in part, 907 So. 2d 948, 2005 Miss. LEXIS 441 (Miss. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a case involving a dispute over an alimony award, a chancery court erred in awarding attorney’s fees to a former wife because the wife had the ability to pay the fees based on separate assets and an award of lump sum alimony. Haney v. Haney, 881 So. 2d 862, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 1114 (Miss. Ct. App. 2003), aff'd in part and rev'd in part, 907 So. 2d 948, 2005 Miss. LEXIS 441 (Miss. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a case was remanded because the chancellor failed to make sufficient findings in support of his division and classification of marital property, the chancellor also had to revisit his award of permanent periodic alimony to the former wife, as equitable division and alimony were linked and when one expanded, the other had to recede. Lauro v. Lauro, 847 So. 2d 843, 2003 Miss. LEXIS 272 (Miss. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancellor abused her discretion by allowing a wife to put forward evidence of her need for temporary rehabilitative alimony, in order “to be fair to both parties and to do equity,” where there had been no mention of alimony in the pre-trial statement. Singley v. Singley, 2003 Miss. LEXIS 283 (Miss. June 12, 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       A chancellor’s determination that a wife was not entitled to periodic alimony was premature where the husband’s principal asset was in bankruptcy, since the value of the husband’s estate was not before the court due to the bankruptcy proceedings; the issue of periodic alimony should have remained in the trial court pending the conclusion of the bankruptcy proceedings. Heigle v. Heigle, 654 So. 2d 895, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 228 (Miss. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a divorce case, there was no need for a chancellor to apply the factors under Ferguson v. Ferguson, 639 So. 2d 921 (Miss. 1994), or Armstrong v. Armstrong, 618 So. 2d 1278 (Miss. 1993), because the parties entered into settlement agreement regarding property division and alimony. Bougard v. Bougard, 991 So. 2d 646, 2008 Miss. App. LEXIS 578 (Miss. Ct. App. 2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       An award of lump sum alimony was not beyond the scope of the pleadings, even though the complaint did not specifically request lump sum or periodic alimony, but instead requested permanent support and maintenance and other general relief, since the husband could not reasonably be said to have been surprised by the award of alimony in a divorce action. Crowe v. Crowe, 641 So. 2d 1100, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 378 (Miss. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       A judgment of alimony was properly awarded, even though the original complaint was for separate maintenance and was not formally amended, where there was nothing inherent in the substance of the claim to prevent the separate maintenance action from being converted to one for alimony, and the issue of alimony was tried by consent. Weiss v. Weiss, 579 So. 2d 539, 1991 Miss. LEXIS 238 (Miss. 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       A court’s exercise of jurisdiction to determine alimony was not improper where the parties were previously granted a foreign divorce with reservation of the right to litigate alimony, and the statutory residency jurisdictional requirement was satisfied.

      </p>
      <p>
       Where parties incomes were not sufficient to meet expenses at time of trial, Chancery Court should have retained jurisdiction over question of alimony and if at later date husband’s dental practice became successful financially, court would have authority to award such alimony as may at that time be fair and equitable; in cases where facts do not justify present award of alimony, Chancery Court generally ought to retain jurisdiction over question of alimony, and need not award nominal alimony in order to allow for modification in event that earning power of one spouse increases. McNally v. McNally, 516 So. 2d 499, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2956 (Miss. 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       Award to wife of alimony and child support where such is not sought in pleadings is error, because it deprives husband of due process, although such judgments are not void; therefore, where husband paid alimony and child support for 3 years before complaining about due process violation, decree is final and due process right has been waived. Miller v. Miller, 512 So. 2d 1286, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2815 (Miss. 1987).

      <p>
       In a divorce action instituted by a husband against his wife, provisions of the decree requiring the husband to furnish an automobile and to make mortgage payments would be upheld where these allowances were elements of child support, and the husband had injected the question of custody and support of the minor child in his original bill of complaint.

       Father did not make explicit charges of abuse or neglect against the mother, and the record did not support the mother’s claim that the appointment of a guardian ad litem was mandatory; while the mother’s residence was not an ideal living condition for the child, a report did not show that she was abused or neglected, nor did a doctor who treated the child find that she was abused or neglected, and the chancellor did not abuse his discretion in failing to appoint a guardian. The Court of Appeals’ decision was overruled to the extent it announced a new standard requiring mandatory appointment of a guardian ad litem in child-custody proceedings.

      <p>
       Father who was awarded custody of the parties’ son argued that the chancellor’s award of the daughter’s custody to the mother was clearly contrary to her best interest, primarily because of the mother’s adulterous relationship. However, the record demonstrated that the chancellor had found that neither parent was unfit to have custody, that he considered the children’s preferences, and that he had determined that given the age and sex of the children it would be beneficial for them to have respective male and female role models; thus, there was no manifest error. Sandlin v. Sandlin, 906 So. 2d 39, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 1115 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court did not abuse its discretion in awarding primary physical custody of minor children to the mother because there was evidence in the record to support the findings that the continuity of care prior to the separation favored the mother because she had been the primary caretaker, and the mother’s parenting skills favored her as well, and evidence raised by the father of the mother’s gambling activities and relationships with other men did not demonstrate the mother’s unfitness as a custodial parent; while there was evidence that tended to weigh in favor of the father’s ability to be the preferred caregiver of the children, it was the trial court’s duty to weigh the evidence, make witness credibility assessments, and reach a determination that best served the interests of the children, and because it appeared that this was done, the judgment was affirmed. Ivy v. Ivy, 863 So. 2d 1010, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 11 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).

       <p>
   No indication existed that the chancellor considered the appointment of a guardian ad litem to be mandatory based on allegations of neglect or abuse of the child; Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c05s93-5-23" target="_self">93-5-23</a></cite> afforded the chancellor some discretion in whether there was a legitimate issue of neglect or abuse, and the father’s representations to the chancellor, even if exaggerated, were not so egregious as to render him unfit to serve as a custodial parent. Johnson v. Johnson, 872 So. 2d 92, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 370 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because of the apparently limited assistance a guardian ad litem could have rendered, the chancellor’s decision against making such an appointment did not constitute such an abuse of discretion as to constitute reversible error; the guardian ad litem would have considered the same information that was presented to the chancellor in open court and that would have offered an opinion as to what arrangement would best serve the child’s interest. Loomis v. Bugg, 872 So. 2d 694, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 376 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       The chancellor erred in determining that he did not have the power to make a custody award to a stepparent and thus make no custody decision whatsoever even after expressly finding the natural parent unfit; where it is in the best interests of the child, temporary custody/guardianship should be given to a stepparent, until such time as the biological parent can be located and given proper notice.

      </p>
      <p>
       A court order requiring a custodial mother to obtain court approval before she could move her residence was erroneous and unenforceable. It is an incident of custody that the parent having physical custody provide a residence for the child where he or she thinks is appropriate; the location of this residence is a matter committed to the discretion of the custodial parent in the first instance. A court may only intervene where there has been a material change in circumstances which adversely affect the child and it is shown that the best interests of the child require a modification of custody; a change of residence is not per se a change of circumstance. Bell v. Bell, 572 So. 2d 841, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 582 (Miss. 1990), modified, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 869 (Miss. Dec. 12, 1990).

       In arriving at the proper solution of a custodial problem the chancellor is in a particularly advantageous position, and under evidence in a proceeding to modify a final divorce decree as to custody of four minor children, the chancellor did not abuse his discretion in determining that both parents were personally unfit and unsuitable for custody, and in granting temporary care, custody, and control to the maternal grandparents, leaving the door open for the parents to come back into court if there should be a material change in their circumstances and if they should rehabilitate and prove themselves.

       Substantial evidence supported the chancery court’s decision to award the mother custody of the children because the chancery court provided a thorough analysis of the Albright factors and found that they favored awarding custody to the mother, and the mother had custody of the children’s siblings. Miller v. Smith, 229 So.3d 148, 2016 Miss. App. LEXIS 749 (Miss. Ct. App. 2016), aff'd, 229 So.3d 100, 2017 Miss. LEXIS 427 (Miss. 2017).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because the chancery court met the statutory requirements, it acted within its discretion in ruling contrary to the recommendation of the guardian ad litem (GAL); the chancery court based her decision on the testimony she heard during the trial and the reports detailing the child’s interviews with police and the Mississippi Department of Human Services, and it specifically discussed the GAL’s recommendation and its analysis under each of the Albright factors. Miller v. Smith, 229 So.3d 148, 2016 Miss. App. LEXIS 749 (Miss. Ct. App. 2016), aff'd, 229 So.3d 100, 2017 Miss. LEXIS 427 (Miss. 2017).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a child custody dispute where a guardian ad litem was appointed after a mother raised allegations of child abuse, a chancellor was not required to accept the recommendations of the guardian ad litem that the mother receive primary physical custody of the children; the chancellor stated that he considered the recommendations, but determined that it was in the best interest of the children for the father to receive primary custody after considering the appropriate factors. Borden v. Borden, 130 So.3d 1168, 2014 Miss. App. LEXIS 36 (Miss. Ct. App.), rev'd, 167 So.3d 238, 2014 Miss. LEXIS 498 (Miss. 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancellor erred by awarding a maternal grandmother custody of a child because the chancellor failed to apply the legal presumption that it was in the child’s best interest for her father to have custody; the chancellor treated the particular custody battle as a modification, failing to recognize that the grandmother had no right to custody as against the father. Wilson v. Davis, 111 So.3d 1280, 2013 Miss. App. LEXIS 222 (Miss. Ct. App. 2013), aff'd in part and rev'd in part, 181 So.3d 991, 2016 Miss. LEXIS 4 (Miss. 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancellor’s judgment awarding the father primary physical custody of the three minor children was affirmed because: (1) the record reflected that the chancellor specifically considered the potential effect that the separation of the mother’s child from a prior relationship from the other children might have had on the children, but she determined it did not outweigh the other factors favoring the father; (2) the chancellor did not err when she failed to provide the mother with the tender-years advantage with respect to the five-year old boy because she did specifically acknowledge the tender-years doctrine and cited case law addressing its diminished application; and (3) the chancellor’s finding that the stability of home environment factor favored the father was supported by credible evidence that the father had maintained a stable routine and ensured the children were cared for by his mother while he was at work. Montgomery v. Montgomery, 20 So.3d 39, 2009 Miss. App. LEXIS 663 (Miss. Ct. App. 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a custody proceeding, the chancellor properly considered the Albright factors because, inter alia, the mother testified concerning her home’s close proximity to the child’s school and the presence of family members who cared for the child while the mother was at work, and the chancellor concluded from the testimony that there was a strong relationship between the child and his half-sister and that any great reduction in his time with her would adversely impact the child. Collins v. Collins, 20 So.3d 683, 2008 Miss. App. LEXIS 739 (Miss. Ct. App. 2008), cert. denied, 2009 Miss. LEXIS 542 (Miss. Nov. 5, 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a father was granted a divorce on the ground of adultery, substantial evidence supported the decision to grant the father custody of the parties’ child because, inter alia, despite a temporary agreed order, the mother maintained a sexual relationship with a boyfriend throughout the trial and testified that the boyfriend regularly slept at the mother’s house while the child was in the mother’s custody. Thurman v. Johnson, 998 So. 2d 1026, 2008 Miss. App. LEXIS 523 (Miss. Ct. App. 2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancellor did not err in failing to find a change in material circumstances sufficient to support a modification of a child custody agreement because even though there was evidence that the mother interfered with the father’s visitation rights, there was also evidence that he had, to some degree, interfered with her rights as well. Bittick v. Bittick, 987 So. 2d 1058, 2008 Miss. App. LEXIS 402 (Miss. Ct. App. 2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancellor, in awarding custody of a 20-month-old child to the child’s father, did not give insufficient weight to the fact that the child was of tender years because: (1) the once strong presumption that a mother was generally best suited to raise a young child had been significantly weakened; and (2) the chancellor properly weighed the age of the child as he would any other factor. Klink v. Brewster, 986 So. 2d 1060, 2008 Miss. App. LEXIS 382 (Miss. Ct. App. 2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court did not err in awarding father custody of parties’ child as the mother failed to prove her allegations that the father had viewed pornography on family computers and had engaged in adultery; further, the mother had an unstable employment history, had admitted to committing adultery, and had a history of alcohol use and traffic violations. DeVito v. DeVito, 967 So. 2d 74, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 700 (Miss. Ct. App. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       Father alleged that the mother was morally unfit as a parent due to her relationship with a boyfriend and due to alleged drug abuse, but there was no substantial evidence that the mother used illegal drugs, but only that a boyfriend – who apparently was awaiting sentencing for a conviction – did so; also, in an effort to reduce the children’s exposure to the mother’s boyfriend, the mother was ordered not to have custody of her children in the presence of any male to whom she was not married or related between 10:30 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. on the following day. The chancellor made a reasonable analysis of the evidence, found the evidence raised concerns about the moral fitness of the mother, took steps to reduce the effect of those concerns, and on the balance found that the totality of the evidence supported giving custody to the children’s mother. Ethridge v. Ethridge, 926 So. 2d 264, 2006 Miss. App. LEXIS 270 (Miss. Ct. App. 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       Court properly awarded child custody to a mother because the child had lived in the mother’s home his entire life, he did well in school there, the father was physically limited as to what he could do with the child, and there was nothing to indicate that separation from his sister would be in the child’s best interest. Owens v. Owens, 950 So. 2d 202, 2006 Miss. App. LEXIS 750 (Miss. Ct. App. 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       In determining the best interest of two minor girls, a chancellor did not err by awarding legal and physical custody thereof to a father where the applicable factors demonstrated that the mother had used drugs and committed adultery; although the father’s conduct was questionable as well, it was for the chancellor to weigh the evidence and judge credibility, and the other factors favored neither party. Bellais v. Bellais, 931 So. 2d 665, 2006 Miss. App. LEXIS 436 (Miss. Ct. App. 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancellor did not err in finding that a material change in circumstances had occurred when parties’ daughter moved to Mississippi as both the mother and father stipulated to the fact that there was a material and substantial change in circumstances. Review of the Albright factors meant that the father was properly granted primary physical custody of children. Harper v. Harper, 926 So. 2d 253, 2006 Miss. App. LEXIS 263 (Miss. Ct. App. 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancellor’s opinion devoted 29 pages to the Albright factors and gave the husband the benefit of all of the admissions arising from the wife’s failure to respond under Miss. R. Civ. P. 36, absent the admission pertaining to the ultimate issue of the child’s custody; therefore, the chancellor properly determined the best interests of the child. Gilcrease v. Gilcrease, 918 So. 2d 854, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 781 (Miss. Ct. App. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       When considering the Albright factors upon the father’s petition to change child custody, the chancellor properly found that the tender years doctrine weighed equally between the parties because the girls had recently lived with their father for two years. Glissen v. Glissen, 910 So. 2d 603, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 160 (Miss. Ct. App. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the custody decision was a close call, the appellate court upheld the chancellor’s decision to award child custody to the husband based on the following Albright factors: continuity of care; employment; moral fitness; stability of the home environment; and the home, school and community record of the child. Funderburk v. Funderburk, 909 So. 2d 1241, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 110 (Miss. Ct. App. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancellor carefully considered the Albright factors and the best interest of the children in finding that the father was entitled to primary physical custody of the children, aged 3 and 14. While both parents had excellent parenting skills, the mother’s occasional use of marijuana was troubling, as to her judgment, and the stability of the home environment and employment of each parent favored the father; moreover, even though one child was a child of “tender years,” a factor slightly favoring the mother, the children had a strong emotional bond, and it was not in their best interest to be separated. Taylor v. Taylor, 909 So. 2d 1280, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 126 (Miss. Ct. App. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Physical custody of an 18-month-old child was properly awarded to the husband in a divorce case because the trial court examined all of the applicable factors before determining that the father had the best parenting skills, his employment was more flexible, he provided more continuous care, and the sex of the child favored custody by the father; although the tender years doctrine slightly favored the mother, this was not a ground for reversal, and there was no rule that the best interest of the child was served by keeping siblings together. Copeland v. Copeland, 904 So. 2d 1066, 2004 Miss. LEXIS 1490 (Miss. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancellor did not plainly err in her evaluation of the evidence and application of the Albright factors to determine that the best interest of the child would be served by the mother having primary custody; the evidence demonstrated that the mother was a good mother, and the stability of the home environment favored the mother. Bass v. Bass, 879 So. 2d 1122, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 775 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancery court did not make specific findings of fact concerning child custody; therefore, the appellate court had to remand for consideration of all the necessary factors and on-the-record factual findings. Franklin v. Franklin, 864 So. 2d 970, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 1113 (Miss. Ct. App. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       Father was properly awarded custody of parties’ two minor boys because the Albright factors were properly considered, as both children were boys, and the compelling interest in keeping siblings together outweighed the “tender years” presumption; the father was involved in extracurricular activities and sports with the boys; and one of the children had a stronger bond with his father than his mother. Steverson v. Steverson, 846 So. 2d 304, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 457 (Miss. Ct. App. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancellor did not err by awarding primary care of a minor child to a husband because the evidence showed that the husband had extended family to care for the child, and the child needed the guidance of his father; the parties’ religious differences were irrelevant to the custody determination. Messer v. Messer, 850 So. 2d 161, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 542 (Miss. Ct. App. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancellor improperly granted custody in favor of a mother where the evidence showed that the mother was unable to provide a stable environment for the child because of her medical condition; the chancellor also erroneous determined that the father was unable to provide daycare or housing and that the mother had provided continuous care for the child before the parties’ divorce. Divers v. Divers, 856 So. 2d 370, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 194 (Miss. Ct. App. 2003), cert. denied, 2003 Miss. LEXIS 614 (Miss. Nov. 6, 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       Custody decision reversed and remanded where chancellor failed to consider each of the factors set out in Albright v. Albright, 437 So. 2d 1003, 1005 (Miss. 1983) in both his oral statement and written order. Hamilton v. Hamilton, 755 So. 2d 528, 1999 Miss. App. LEXIS 696 (Miss. Ct. App. 1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no hard and fast rule that the best interest of siblings will be served by keeping them together. Bredemeier v. Jackson, 689 So. 2d 770, 1997 Miss. LEXIS 77 (Miss. 1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       A chancellor did not err in awarding permanent primary child custody to the mother, even though she had committed adultery and temporary custody had been awarded to the father, where the chancellor found that the mother had greater willingness and capacity to learn proper parenting skills, the father’s psychological profile was potentially detrimental to the children, and “coaching” of the children had occurred while they were in the father’s custody. Williams v. Williams, 656 So. 2d 325, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 280 (Miss. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       The doctrine of unclean hands cannot override a chancellor’s duty to award custody in the best interests of the child. Shelton v. Shelton, 653 So. 2d 283, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 150 (Miss. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       A chancellor did not abuse his discretion in awarding custody of a 14-year-old boy to his mother on the ground that the father was unfit to be a parent, even though the child testified that he preferred to live with his father, where the child’s testimony indicated that his relationship with his mother would seriously deteriorate if he were allowed to live with his father, and the father had encouraged the child to ignore and disobey his mother, allowed him to chew tobacco and dip snuff, allowed him to ride a 4-wheeler without adult supervision, allowed him to carry and shoot a .357 magnum pistol without adult supervision, kept his supply of pornographic movies in the child’s bedroom, told him he would buy the child a truck if he stayed with him after the divorce, and belittled his wife in the child’s presence and encouraged the child to do the same. Ferguson v. Ferguson, 639 So. 2d 921, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 352 (Miss. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       The presumption in favor of awarding custody of a child to a natural parent should prevail over any imperative regarding the separating of siblings. Sellers v. Sellers, 638 So. 2d 481, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 311 (Miss. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       A chancellor erred in awarding custody of a child to her maternal aunt rather than her father where there was no finding that the father was unfit to have custody of the child, and the main foundation for the ruling was the chancellor’s concern about separating the child from her half-brother; while the separation of siblings may be an important consideration, it may not be used as a basis to deprive a parent of his or her child in favor of a third party unless the parent has been found to be unfit. Sellers v. Sellers, 638 So. 2d 481, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 311 (Miss. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       A chancellor did not err in awarding custody of a child to his father, even though the mother “may have presented enough evidence at trial to let one conclude that custody should have been awarded to her,” where the weight of the evidence in favor of the mother was not so great as to make an award of custody to the father erroneous, the wife stated that the father was a good parent and that he and the child were close, and the only evidence of the father’s alleged physical abuse of the child was the mother’s uncorroborated testimony. Chamblee v. Chamblee, 637 So. 2d 850, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 285 (Miss. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       A chancellor did not err in awarding physical custody of 2 minor children to their mother where the chancellor awarded the parents joint legal custody, both parents were found to be fit and proper parents, the mother was the primary caregiver though both parents played active parenting roles, the father had a work schedule based on 12-hour shifts and the only option he had considered for child care while he was at work was his elderly mother who had suffered a stroke, the father did not dispute the mother’s ability to care for the children, and the father was given liberal visitation rights. Moak v. Moak, 631 So. 2d 196, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 44 (Miss. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       An award of custody to the father based on the finding that the father was more morally fit than the mother to care for the child was erroneous to the extent that it was based on a finding of adultery by the wife where the evidence of adultery was neither clear nor convincing and did not rise above mere conjecture. McAdory v. McAdory, 608 So. 2d 695, 1992 Miss. LEXIS 600 (Miss. 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       A trial court did not abuse its discretion in awarding custody of 2 minor children to their father, though both parents were suitable choices for custody, where the mother had previously “secreted the children” for approximately three weeks, and the father had possession of the parties’ house which would give the children stability of the home environment and place them in familiar surroundings. Faries v. Faries, 607 So. 2d 1204, 1992 Miss. LEXIS 599 (Miss. 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       There was no abuse of discretion in visitation provisions which granted a father visitation with his 15-year-old son 7 days at Christmas and 2 weeks during the summer, “and such other visitation as could be worked out” between the father and son, where the father had voluntarily moved to another state which made regular visitation more difficult, the father chose to live in a home which was several levels below what he could actually afford and provided little or no testimony of features of the home which might be conducive to visitation, and the son testified that he disliked the father. Caldwell v. Caldwell, 579 So. 2d 543, 1991 Miss. LEXIS 236 (Miss. 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   A child custody agreement which provides that the child or children must until majority reside in a particular community, is contrary to the best interests of the children and should not be approved by the court. Such agreements that have been approved are unenforceable. It is presumptuous for anyone, court or otherwise, to declare as an absolute that it is in the best interest of a young child that he or she spend his or her entire minority in a single community. Thus, courts may not require that children be reared in a single community come what may, and divorcing parents may not make such agreements which courts are obligated to enforce. Chancery courts must refuse to approve any child custody agreement presented under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c05s93-5-2" target="_self">93-5-2</a></cite> or otherwise which mandates, without exception, that children be raised in a given community. Such agreements do not make “adequate and sufficient” provisions for the care and maintenance of children. Bell v. Bell, 572 So. 2d 841, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 582 (Miss. 1990), modified, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 869 (Miss. Dec. 12, 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       A mother was unfit to have custody of her children where she had used marijuana in the children’s presence, she sometimes slept until 11:00 a.m. and the children would already be outside, unsupervised, by that time, and there was testimony that the children had not been adequately fed or clothed and that there had been a resulting deleterious effect on their health. White v. Thompson, 569 So. 2d 1181, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 631 (Miss. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       In order to overcome the presumption that best interest of child will be served by child being in custody of his or her natural parent as against third party, there must be a clear showing that the natural parent has (1) abandoned the child; (2) the conduct of the parent is so immoral as to be detrimental to child; or (3) that the parent is unfit mentally or otherwise to have custody. Keely v. Keely, 495 So. 2d 452, 1986 Miss. LEXIS 2652 (Miss. 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       Award of custody of children to husband is not impermissibly based solely on wife’s adultery where chancellor looks to work schedules, life styles, and other criteria and, while finding that no special circumstances exist to justify granting custody to adulterous mother, considers adultery as but one factor in overall consideration. Carr v. Carr, 480 So. 2d 1120, 1985 Miss. LEXIS 2379 (Miss. 1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       In determining relative fitness of parents to be awarded custody of child, adultery may be unwholesome influence and impairment to child’s best interest or may have no effect; this factor should be considered by trial court along with all others when making original custody determinations; marital fault should not be used as sanction in custody award. Carr v. Carr, 480 So. 2d 1120, 1985 Miss. LEXIS 2379 (Miss. 1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       Offshore oil workers, truck drivers, and other persons whose professions require them to be away from home for extended periods of time are not to be deprived of custody of children on that basis. Smith v. Todd, 464 So. 2d 1155, 1985 Miss. LEXIS 1924 (Miss. 1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       That which will promote the best interest of the children is the criterion by which an award of custody should be made, and the problem of what is to the best interest of a child must be solved by a consideration of the relative fitness and ability of each parent to discharge the duties of nurture, maintenance, education, and training. Hodge v. Hodge, 186 So. 2d 748, 1966 Miss. LEXIS 1326 (Miss. 1966).

       Upon the parties’ divorce, the chancellor properly applied the Albright factors in awarding the wife custody over their daughter; the wife was the better choice with regard to the children’s continuity of care, her willingness and capacity to provide primary child care, the employment and employment responsibilities of the parents, and the home, school, and community record of the children. As a part-time truck driver, the husband’s schedule was unpredictable and stressful; the wife’s adultery did not affect her parental responsibilities. Brock v. Brock, 906 So. 2d 879, 2005 Miss.

       Chancellor did not err by not applying the “tender years” doctrine, because chancellors were required to weigh a number of factors, of which age was only one, and manifest error did not arise simply from failing to give custody of children of tender years to their mother.

      <p>
       In a habeas corpus proceeding by a mother against the paternal aunt and paternal grandparents seeking custody of two children awarded to the mother by a prior divorce decree, trial court committed reversible error in suppressing affidavits of nonresident witnesses whose attendance could not be procured, and awarding mother custody of the children, without hearing evidence as to changed conditions and circumstances since the divorce decree, pertaining to abandonment, neglect, and alleged moral unfitness of the mother. Neal v. Neal, 238 Miss. 572, 119 So. 2d 273, 1960 Miss. LEXIS 440 (Miss. 1960).

       The chancery court has a broad discretion in awarding custody of children, which, however, is to be exercised in the light of the rule that custody of children of tender years should be awarded to the mother. Brown v. Brown, 237 Miss. 53, 112 So. 2d 556, 1959 Miss. LEXIS 448 (Miss. 1959).

       Where the wife was entitled to a divorce from the husband on grounds of cruel and inhuman treatment, and there was no proof of any immoral conduct on her part, the wife, as natural mother, was entitled to the custody of two minor children of the marriage as against their natural father, and their paternal grandparents, or either of them.

       Where decree of divorce in favor of husband was sustainable on ground of wife’s adultery, award of alimony and custody of the youngest of three children, aged six years, to the wife was wholly reversed and vacated and a decree entered awarding the custody of the children to the father, leaving the privilege of visitation to the children open for the chancellor to determine on remand.

       When divorce has been properly granted because of the adultery of the wife, she is not entitled either to alimony or to the custody of the children, save temporarily as to an infant so young as not to permit separation from its mother, and save in exceptional circumstances.

   Although the chancellor initially granted the mother’s motion to terminate the father’s parental rights, the Hinds County Chancery Court did not have proper subject matter jurisdiction to do so because the Scott County Chancery Court entered the initial order of child custody; when presented with information regarding the jurisdictional problem, the chancellor immediately corrected the defect by setting aside his previous orders and instructing that any further proceedings regarding the case be brought before the Scott County Chancery Court, pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c05s93-5-23" target="_self">93-5-23</a></cite>. C.M. v. R.D.H., 947 So. 2d 1023, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 29 (Miss. Ct. App. 2007).

       In a child custody case where the mother chose to move the child to a new area that “coincidentally” happened to be in another state and under the same roof of a man who had been found by a chancellor to have abused her child, the court-ordered restriction upon removing the child from the trial court’s jurisdiction was both valid and enforceable.

       The youth court had exclusive jurisdiction to determine custody and visitation rights with respect to an abused child even though the youth court order was in direct conflict with a chancery court order in the parents’ divorce proceedings which were being conducted concurrently with the youth court proceedings. D. L. D. v. Wilkinson County, 606 So. 2d 1125, 1992 Miss. LEXIS 543 (Miss. 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       Continuing and exclusive nature of chancery court jurisdiction over issues involving child custody precludes Youth Court from having exclusive original jurisdiction over proceedings involving abused child, where allegations of abuse are raised in context of custody proceeding over which chancery court already exercises jurisdiction. Rights of minor child suspected of having been sexually abused by parent, to access to court, were not impaired by chancery court’s considering allegations of sexual abuse without referring matter to Youth Court; and even though Youth Court statute provided for exercise of exclusive jurisdiction over child abuse cases, such provision was not applicable to charges raised in case over which chancery court had already assumed and was exercising jurisdiction. Chrissy F. v. Mississippi Dep't of Public Welfare, 780 F. Supp. 1104, 1991 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17998 (S.D.

       Chancery court has exclusive and continuing jurisdiction over custody proceedings, and may issue subsequent modifications to one of its decrees as material change in circumstances may warrant.

      </p>
      <p>
       Although custody of a child may be awarded in a habeas corpus proceeding, support for the child and visitation rights of the parties may not be determined in the habeas corpus court. Thus, Chancery Court did not have continuing jurisdiction over child by virtue of decree previously rendered by it in habeas corpus proceeding. Roach v. Lang, 396 So. 2d 11, 1981 Miss. LEXIS 1976 (Miss. 1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the chancery court had granted a divorce and had granted custody of the children to the mother, it had continuing jurisdiction to act on a subsequent petition to modify the divorce decree as to custody, even though in the interim the youth court had stepped in to deal with a temporary emergency situation. Morris v. Morris, 245 So. 2d 22, 1971 Miss. LEXIS 1350 (Miss. 1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       Exclusive jurisdiction of the custody of children as between their parents is vested in the chancery court in which the original divorce decree was entered, and as between the parties the youth court of another county had no authority to change or modify the chancery court’s decree awarding custody. Ladner v. Ladner, 206 So. 2d 620, 1968 Miss. LEXIS 1577 (Miss. 1968).
      </p>
      <p>
       The proper venue for a habeas corpus proceeding by a mother to obtain custody of her children from the father was in the county where the children resided in the custody of the father, rather than in the county where the decree, largely giving custody to the mother, was entered. Logan v. Rankin, 230 Miss. 749, 94 So. 2d 330, 1957 Miss. LEXIS 419 (Miss. 1957).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the father invoked the jurisdiction of a Texas court to obtain custody of his children, after the mother, to whom custody had been largely awarded by the Mississippi court, had taken the children to that state, the judgment of the Texas court, awarding exclusive custody of the children to the mother, superseded the earlier decree of the Mississippi court, and was entitled to full faith and credit, and was res adjudicata of the facts and circumstances existing at the time of the rendition of the judgment. Logan v. Rankin, 230 Miss. 749, 94 So. 2d 330, 1957 Miss. LEXIS 419 (Miss. 1957).
      </p>
      <p>
       The chancery court in granting a divorce is authorized to make such orders touching the care, custody and maintenance of the children of the marriage as may seem equitable and just and where the chancery court makes no order of custody, the county court has jurisdiction to issue writ of habeas corpus and to determine the rightful custody of the minor. Payne v. Payne, 58 So. 2d 377 (Miss. 1952).

      <p>
       No adjudication will be made in divorce action as to custody of minor child of parties when child is beyond jurisdiction of court. Kincaid v. Kincaid, 207 Miss. 692, 43 So. 2d 108, 1949 Miss. LEXIS 380 (Miss. 1949).
      </p>
      <p>
       Jurisdiction of divorced husband’s petition for permanent care and custody of minor child then in custody of such husband, in which proceedings divorced wife was summoned but did not appear, was properly declined by chancery court, since proceeding was merely advisory and not adversary. Bobo v. Christian, 199 Miss. 433, 25 So. 2d 325, 1946 Miss. LEXIS 214 (Miss. 1946).
      </p>
      <p>
       While the general rule is that in order for a decree or judgment awarding the custody of children to be valid, the child or children must be within the territorial jurisdiction of the court, their removal from the jurisdiction prior to decree after the court has once acquired jurisdiction of such children does not deprive the court of jurisdiction to fix their custody.

       Chancery court did not abuse its discretion by not appointing a guardian ad litem (GAL) sua sponte in a contempt proceeding because a mother never asked the chancery court to appoint a GAL; the appointment of a GAL was not mandatory because the mother failed to cite to any concrete allegation of abuse. Brown v. Hewlett, — So.3d —, 2019 Miss. App. LEXIS 94 (Miss. Ct. App. Mar. 12, 2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       Appointment of the guardian ad litem (GAL) was discretionary, and the GAL was properly allowed to withdraw without submitting a final custody recommendation because allegations of abuse mandating the appointment of a GAL were not present in the custody case; and the scope of the GAL’s appointment did not include making a final recommendation regarding custody of the minor children. Kaiser v. Kaiser, — So.3d —, 2019 Miss. App. LEXIS 262 (Miss. Ct. App. June 11, 2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancery court did not err in failing to appoint a guardian ad litem, sua sponte, to investigate a father’s allegations of neglect because the allegations were either not severe enough to require investigation or were adequately investigated by an agent of the court who acted as a guardian ad litem in all but name, the agent, the parties, and the court all seemed to have understood the agent to have been assigned to act as a neutral, investigative agent for the court, and, while the mother’s home environment could have had some harmful effects on the child and the father was more attendant to her care, a pediatric endocrinologist found no evidence that the child was abused or neglected. Carter v. Carter, 204 So.3d 803, 2015 Miss. App. LEXIS 687 (Miss. Ct. App. 2015), aff'd on other grounds, 204 So.3d 747, 2016 Miss. LEXIS 489 (Miss. 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancellor erred in not providing a summary of the guardian ad litem’s recommendation and a summary of why the chancellor rejected that recommendation where the chancellor only acknowledged the guardian ad litem’s recommendation in awarding custody. Borden v. Borden, 167 So.3d 238, 2014 Miss. LEXIS 498 (Miss. 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancellor made a determination that it was in the best interest of the child that her primary custody be placed with her grandmother, but with the mother continuing to have a role in the child’s life. The chancellor specifically noted and gave proper consideration to a guardian ad litem’s recommendation, and he stated why he felt the best interest of the child required that that the child’s grandmother have primary custody. McCraw v. Buchanan, 10 So.3d 979, 2009 Miss. App. LEXIS 242 (Miss. Ct. App. 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a custody proceeding, the chancellor properly considered all of the evidence before it in rendering the custody decision, including findings of the guardian ad litem, because the guardian ad litem made no custody recommendation; the only recommendation that the guardian ad litem made to the court was that there were no grounds for finding any abuse of the child. That was reflected in the chancellor’s divorce decree, which stated that there was insufficient proof of child abuse. Collins v. Collins, 20 So.3d 683, 2008 Miss. App. LEXIS 739 (Miss. Ct. App. 2008), cert. denied, 2009 Miss. LEXIS 542 (Miss. Nov. 5, 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Chancellor did not commit reversible error by not following the recommendation of the child’s guardian ad litem because she found that the guardian ad litem considered only the isolated incident in which the father physically harmed the child and not all of the times the child witnessed the abuse of her mother and because the guardian failed to recognize Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c05s93-5-24ol19" target="_self">93-5-24(9)</a></cite>. J.P. v. S.V.B., 987 So. 2d 975, 2008 Miss. LEXIS 394 (Miss. 2008).

      <p>
       <p>
   Although the trial court retained jurisdiction over the case in order to review custody before the child was to begin attending school, the trial court’s custody determination was a final order that was appealable under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c05s93-5-23" target="_self">93-5-23</a></cite>; like many kinds of domestic relations orders, custody orders were permitted to be modified at any time, but such orders were considered final and appealable.

       A mother’s contention on appeal that the appointment of a guardian ad litem in a custody proceeding was improper was erroneous where both parties agreed to the appointment of the guardian ad litem. Foster v. Foster, 788 So. 2d 779, 2000 Miss. App. LEXIS 472 (Miss. Ct. App. 2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       A child custody order awarding the father custody of the parties’ 2 children would be vacated where the mother did not have sufficient time to prepare for 2 adverse witnesses and the custody question was extremely close, so that the mother’s lack of an opportunity to prepare for the witnesses could have affected the evidence presented and, necessarily, the chancellor’s decision. Schepens v. Schepens, 592 So. 2d 108, 1991 Miss. LEXIS 983 (Miss. 1991).

      </p>
      <p>
       In all cases except where a divorce is granted, or separate maintenance is decreed, the right to the custody of children must be determined on habeas corpus and where the court dismissed the husband’s divorce action on the ground that wife’s prior divorce was valid, it was not error for the court not to retain the bill to determine the question of custody. Payne v. Payne, 213 Miss. 815, 58 So. 2d 9, 1952 Miss. LEXIS 430 (Miss. 1952).
      </p>

       Custody of children may be awarded notwithstanding prayer for divorce is denied, custody not being dependent on decree of divorce. Davis v. Davis, 194 Miss. 343, 12 So. 2d 435, 1943 Miss. LEXIS 75 (Miss. 1943).

       Remarriage of a divorced wife entitled the divorced husband to a reassignment of a policy of insurance on his life, assigned by him to her under the alimony provisions of a divorce decree, requiring such assignment for the evident purpose of protecting her against failure of alimony payments by the death of the husband, since under the divorce decree the divorced wife did not receive absolute ownership of the policy.

      </p>
      <p>
       The conveyance of a former wife’s interest in her residence to her former husband for a cash payment and mortgage assumption was a “sale” within the meaning of a property settlement agreement which was incorporated into the parties’ final divorce decree, which provided that the former husband would continue to pay $350 per month toward the housing expenses of the parties’ 2 minor children in the event the parties sold the residence. Thus, the former husband’s obligation to provide financially for the housing expenses of his 2 children continued, in spite of his argument that his housing support obligation terminated because the transaction was not a “sale” within the meaning of the agreement in that it was not a sale to a third party. Webster v. Webster, 566 So. 2d 214, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 530 (Miss. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       Social Security benefits received by a mother for the benefit of a minor child under the Social Security Act are considered an alternative source of payment that satisfies child support and should be credited toward that obligation. Moreover, child support obligations are to be off-set, not only to the extent of payments actually received under the Social Security Act, but also for payments that the child was entitled to receive, based on the parent’s retirement. Thus, a father’s child support obligations would be credited for social security benefits that the minor child was entitled to receive based on the father’s retirement, even though social security benefits were elected based on the child’s step-father’s retirement.

Regular child support refers to the sums of money which the particular parent is ordered to pay for the child’s basic, necessary living expenses, namely food, clothing and shelter. Other sums which a parent may be ordered to pay for the care and maintenance of the child are the expenses of a college or other advanced education. Other items which may properly be awarded pursuant to a valid child care and maintenance order are health related expenses such as reasonable and necessary medical, dental, optical, and psychiatric/psychological expenses. A parent can also be required to absorb insurance expenses such as maintaining medical and hospitalization insurance on the child, and maintaining a life insurance policy on his or her own life with the child named as beneficiary.

       It was not error for a trial court to consider a father’s overtime pay in measuring his earning capacity to determine an appropriate child support award where the trial court considered overtime in determining both parents’ earning capacity, the father had worked overtime consistently for two years and had practically doubled his base salary, and the award was not of such an amount as to create the belief that the trial court gave undue weight to the father’s overtime income.

      <p>
       A provision in a child support decree ordering an automatic $50 per month increase in child support when the child started kindergarten was improper where there was no evidence that kindergarten would cost more than what was previously being spent; if the automatic increase was a modification, it was improper since a modification can result only from substantial and material changes that follow the decree to be modified, and the automatic increase lacked the specificity required for an escalation clause since the specific basis for the calculation of the increase was not provided.

       Section 43-19-101, which sets forth child support award guidelines, is only a guideline and may not determine the specific need or the specific support required; the determination of the amount of support needed must be made by a chancellor who hears all the facts, views the witnesses, and is informed at trial of the circumstances of the parties and particularly the circumstances of the child.

      </p>
      <p>
       A child support award of $325 per month was not so high as to constitute reversible error where the mother’s adjusted monthly gross income was between $2100 and $2265, the father, who had custody of the child, performed many in-kind services for the child, and the mother had paid no direct support for the child for a minimum of 5 years.

      </p>
      <p>
       A child support award of $400 per month for one 6-year-old child was excessive where the father, who had custody of the child, only asked for $100 per month in child support, the chancellor recognized that $400 per month was not required at the time for child support, and both parents had approximately the same earnings. The chancellor should have considered the amount of money which reasonably should have been required in child support from each parent, but apparently considered only the guidelines developed by the Governor’s Commission on Child Support.

However, the father’s 18-year-old daughter was not emancipated where she did not work full time and her earnings were insufficient to support the necessities for her continued education, she was enrolled as a student at Mississippi State University, and her record as a student was acceptable; the father was therefore required to continue to support the daughter at the rate of $300 per month.

       A chancellor erred in ordering a father to pay future additional child support in the amount of 10 percent of his adjusted gross income exceeding $50,000 where the chancellor relied solely upon the father’s possible future income and did not include other factors such as the mother’s separate income, the inflation rate, and the needs and expenses of the children.

       When employing escalation clauses for child support, the bench and bar are urged to: (a) specify with certainty the specific cost of living or consumer price index which is to be utilized; (b) show the applicable ratio (present CPI is to ascertainable CPI as present award is to future award); (c) calculate the base figure as of the date of judgment; (d) establish frequency of adjustment (nothing less than yearly is suggested); and (e) establish an effective date for each adjustment (e.g. anniversary of date of judgment.)

       Because the chancellor found that the children were emancipated, as they were 24 and 22 years old at the time of the 2012 order, the chancellor erred in requiring the father to pay child support, college expenses, and life and health insurance for the benefit of the children.

       Chancery court did not abuse its discretion by declining to require a parent to provide post-majority financial support for the parent’s child because Mississippi law did not vest the court with the authority to mandate that parents financially support their offspring post-majority. The duty imposed for a parent to support its child does not extend beyond the child’s minority, which terminates when the child reaches twenty-one years of age. Hays v.

   Chancellor did not err in modifying an original order of a county court that had improperly terminated child support when the child reached 16 years of age, because, Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c05s93-5-23ol12004" target="_self">93-5-23 (2004)</a></cite> clearly mandated that child support continued until the child attained the age of 21 years of age or was otherwise emancipated and the record showed that the child had not reached the age of 21. And, even if the appellate court held that the mother was estopped from bringing the action due to laches, child support could still be viably pursued by the child under Mississippi law. Owen v.

       Evidence supported the determination that the parties’ oldest child became emancipated in April, 1997, rather than in August, 1997, where (1) the child had discontinued full-time enrollment in school and had obtained full-time employment by April, 1997, and (2) although she was living in the custodial home, she had established independent living arrangements because her mother had moved to another state.

       Evidence supported the conclusion that the parties’ 18 year old son was not emancipated where (1) although he had a full time job, he still lived with his mother as his income was insufficient to allow him to establish an independent residence, and (2) he expressed a desire to go to college and testified that he did not do so only because he could not afford it.

       A trial court did not err in declining to order a father to pay child support where the mother and the father each had custody of one child, the court’s decision was based on the fact that each party would have the responsibility for the child in his or her custody, and the parties’ respective incomes were almost the same.

       The fact that one child became emancipated and the other child moved into the father’s home did not automatically grant the father the right to receive a credit for child support payments made after that point in time. However, the father was allowed the opportunity to prove before a trial judge that he should receive such a credit. Nichols v. Tedder, 547 So. 2d 766, 1989 Miss. LEXIS 328 (Miss. 1989).

Thus, the courts have no authority under these statutes to require parents to provide for the care and maintenance of their child after the child becomes emancipated, by reaching the age of 21, or otherwise, whichever occurs first. This does not foreclose the enforceability of agreements by the parties providing for the post-emancipation care and maintenance of their children, whether those agreements are separate contracts, or have been incorporated into the divorce decree.

       Mother was not provided notice that she might be required to defend a claim of child support nor was there a suggestion in the record that support payments from the mother were even being contemplated by the court on its own or asked for by the father.

The guidelines may be received and considered in all support matters as relevant, but the guidelines may not determine the specific need or the specific support required; this is to be done by a chancellor at a time real, on a scene certain, and with a knowledge special to the actual circumstances and to the individual child or children.

      <p>
       Trial courts have the authority to allocate income tax dependency exemptions by ordering the custodial parent to sign the required release where the equities of the case favor such action. A trial court’s authority to allocate the exemption to the non-custodial parent reduces the amount of income tax to be paid to the federal government, and produces a tax saving to the non-custodial parent which exceeds the moderate increase in the tax liability of the custodial parent. This result will almost always prevail where, as is often the case, the custodial parent’s adjusted gross income is less than the adjusted gross income of the non-custodial parent. In such a situation, the after-tax spendable income of the non-custodial parent is increased. This savings in tax liability could easily be channeled into increased child support or other payments thereby rendering the custodial parent’s after-tax spendable income, including child support or other payments, the same or better than if he or she had claimed the dependency exemption.

       Award to wife of alimony and child support where such is not sought in pleadings is error, because it deprives husband of due process, although such judgments are not void; therefore, where husband paid alimony and child support for 3 years before complaining about due process violation, decree is final and due process right has been waived.

       To extent that there is legal duty for parent to support adult incapacitated child, duty runs from parent to child, not from one divorced spouse to other; any action for support of child should therefore be maintained by or on behalf of adult child against parent from whom support is sought, not by suit brought by one parent against other for modification of divorce decree.

      <p>
       Existing law regarding periodic alimony and child support is not altered by the law pertaining to the equitable division of marital assets; upon the dissolution of a marriage, the chancery court has the discretion to award periodic and/or lump sum alimony, divide real and personal property, including the divesting of title, and may consider awarding future interests to be received by each spouse.

       A chancellor erred in determining that a father was not entitled to regular overnight visitation with his minor son, where there was no substantial evidence in the record tending to show that such visitation would be detrimental to the son in any way, since non-custodial parents are presumptively entitled to regular overnight visitation with their children.

       A husband had sufficient minimum contacts with Mississippi so that requiring him to submit to an adjudication of his rights in a divorce proceeding did not offend “traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice,” where the husband was physically present in Mississippi at the time he was personally served, and he was domiciled in Mississippi for years and left the state incident to separation from his spouse and family. Chenier v. Chenier, 573 So. 2d 699, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 840 (Miss. 1990).

      <p>
       When a non-custodial parent has unsupervised visitation rights, the custodial parent has no right to interfere with the non-custodial parent’s visitation with his or her children. Thus, a mother’s wishes that her children not fly in a private plane was not sufficient to deny the father the right to provide flying lessons or to fly his children in his private airplane during his visitation hours, where there was no evidence that flying would endanger the children’s lives or that the children were opposed to flying or taking flying lessons.

      </p>
      <p>
       A chancellor did not err in severely restricting a mother’s visitation with her children to not more than once per week, for no more than one and 1/2 hours, in the father’s home, where the mother had secreted the children and refused to deliver them in defiance of a court order changing custody from the mother to the father; the safety and welfare of the minor children compelled the chancellor to act in their best interest, protecting them from abduction by the mother.

       Decree denying husband divorce and awarding wife custody of children, attorney’s fees, and monthly support and granting lien on husband’s lands to secure payment thereof, rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction having jurisdiction of the subject matter and of the parties, was not void but only erroneous because of an error apparent on the face of the decree.

       Chancery decree awarding wife custody of children, monthly support for herself and the children, granting a lien on husband’s lands to secure payment thereof, and directing that, upon default, special execution should issue to the sheriff to advertise and sell such land, exceeded the power of the court in directing that the proceeds of the sale in excess of what would be required to satisfy costs and the instalments then due be impounded and retained by the sheriff as a trust fund out of which to provide payment of future instalments, and was subject to correction by injunction or bill of review.

       In the case of property jointly owned by the parties but undisturbed in the judgment of divorce, the title remains as before. Thus, where the divorce proceedings failed to reflect that the husband’s anticipated military retirement pension was mentioned or affected, the wife’s pre-divorce interest, if any, in the husband’s pension remained undisturbed.

       The principles of res judicata, which command that a final judgment precludes all claims that were or reasonably may have been brought in the original action, apply in divorce actions; the rule that a judgment for alimony, custody or support may be modified only upon a showing of a post-judgment material change of circumstances is a recognition of the force of res judicata in divorce actions.

       A decree for alimony is not a debt in the strict sense of that term, but rather a judgment calling for the performance of a duty made specific by the decree of a court of competent jurisdiction, as regards homestead exemption.

       In view of wife’s right to alimony constituting an interest in her husband’s real estate, alimony decree fixing payment thereof a specific lien upon the land of the husband as security for the payment of the alimony constitutes such lien an encumbrance running with the land so as to render subject thereto the subsequently acquired homestead right of husband’s second wife.

       In view of this section [Code 1942, § 2743] authorizing the court to require sureties for the payment of alimony allowed, and of the fact that a wife’s right to alimony constitutes such an interest in her husband’s real estate that she is entitled to have a lien fixed on it to enforce her vested right to maintenance out of his property regardless of whether the property was the homestead of the parties, the authority of the court could not be defeated by any subsequent act of the husband in contravention of her rights under a specific lien fixed on his property, and especially when such lien is declared at a time when no homestead rights could be effectually claimed by him therein.

       Chancery court properly denied a husband’s motion to reduce or terminate his alimony obligation because the wife’s receipt of disability benefits did not constitute a material change in circumstances; the plain language of the parties’ divorce agreement reflected that it was anticipated that the wife would receive disability benefits at some point in the future.

       Ex-husband’s obligation to pay alimony was terminated because the ex-wife admitted that the ex-wife and a boyfriend cohabited, and the ex-wife failed to rebut the presumption of mutual support since, inter alia, the boyfriend gave the ex-wife money for groceries and clothes and helped the ex-wife with utilities and projects around the ex-wife’s home.

      <p>
       Chancellor found cohabitation between the ex-wife and another man based on financial aspects of the relationship and not the moral aspects of the relationship; also, the wife did not present proof suggesting that there was no mutual support within the relationship, and thus there was evidence to support the chancellor’s conclusion that the wife and the other man had arranged their physical living arrangements and financial affairs as a couple evidencing a de facto marriage.

       In a proceeding for modification of a divorce decree, the chancellor abused his discretion in simply reducing the amount of alimony to the same extent that the child support had been reduced, without applying any standard in determining the modification of alimony; furthermore, the chancellor abused his discretion in awarding alimony to the wife in the amount of $150 per month where the alimony award exceeded the husband’s monthly net spendable income after paying child support.

       The trial court erred in reducing the amount of a husband’s alimony and child support payments where the modification was not founded on a material or substantial change in the after-arising circumstances of the parties. Although the trial court felt that it had allowed too much alimony and child support in the first instance and although such payments where in fact high, they were not so high as to be unconscionable and oppressive, thereby justifying the court in affording extraordinary relief under its equitable powers.

       Miss. R. Civ. P. 60 did not preclude a chancellor from ordering the retroactive modification of alimony since a chancellor had authority to modify based on a father’s second petition for such; moreover, the chancellor had the authority to order the modification retroactive to a date within the filing of the petition and the entry of the order. Austin v. Austin, 981 So. 2d 1000, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 710 (Miss. Ct. App. 2007), cert. denied, 981 So. 2d 298, 2008 Miss. LEXIS 223 (Miss. 2008).

       Appellate court did not have to consider whether a father’s motion to reopen under Miss. R. Civ. P. 60 after the denial of his first petition for modification of child support and alimony was timely because the issue was properly before the court after a father filed a second petition for modification based on a loss of income; all the father was required to show was a material change in circumstances, and there was no time limit on modifications.

       A spouse should not be required to deplete his or her separate estate when his or her income has dropped below the level of his or her separate maintenance obligations; thus, a chancellor erred in refusing to reduce a husband’s separate maintenance obligation which he could not meet without liquidating his separate estate. Kennedy v. Kennedy, 662 So. 2d 179, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 484 (Miss. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       Fact that a former wife had a high paying job and a husband had voluntarily left his employment was insufficient to show a material change in circumstances justifying a modification of alimony; however, a chancery court did not err by fashioning the wife a remedy from an escalation clause in a property agreement, and the three-year statute of limitations applied since it was a contract matter. D'Avignon v. D'Avignon, 945 So. 2d 401, 2006 Miss. App. LEXIS 549 (Miss. Ct. App. 2006), overruled,

       There was not a material change in circumstances warranting modification of a periodic alimony award to a wife, in spite of the husband’s argument that the wife went from having no income before the divorce to having an income of almost $80,000, where the majority of her income came from alimony and the husband remained in a much better financial position than the wife.

       A trial court was manifestly in error when it modified/terminated a wife’s alimony, even though she began to work as a nurse full-time rather than part-time, she no longer had children at home, and she was not required to contribute to the cost of the children’s education and maintenance, where the husband was an affluent professional person, he maintained a high standard of living, he lavishly supported his children including the children of his second wife, and his claimed monthly living expenses of $7,203 exceeded by $1,203 the yearly alimony he paid to the wife who had provided him with 4 children.

      </p>
      <p>
       In an action to decrease alimony payments, financial reversals of a close corporation of which the husband was the major shareholder did not constitute a sufficient material change in circumstances so as to justify a reduction in alimony where the corporation was recovering and the monthly alimony payments were modest in view of the husband’s financial circumstances.

       Award of $250 per month additional alimony was not against overwhelming weight of evidence despite wife’s contention that house payments had risen, home had required substantial repairs, her health had deteriorated, and there had been inflation; court found that wife’s income had steadily increased, while husband’s income had decreased since 1980.

       Where wife obtaining divorce was allowed the occupancy and use of the home, together with an award of $60 per month alimony, the fact that she augmented her income in a moderate degree by taking in roomers, was not such a change in circumstances as would justify a modification of the previous award.

       The court which granted divorce decree to wife improperly directed that payment of $200 by husband should be in full settlement of alimony for wife and support for nine-month-old child, and three years later, on showing that wife could earn nothing and that child needed medical attention, court properly directed husband, who was remarried, had another child, and was earning about $80 per month, to pay $12 per month for child’s support, since a father’s duty to support his child is absolute when necessity arises.

       Chancery court did not abuse its discretion by denying the father’s motion for modification and termination of child support under this section because the parties’ disabled son’s 21st birthday was not a material change in circumstances unanticipated by the parties at the time of divorce that would warrant modification of the initial child support order.

   Substantial evidence supported an upward adjustment of child support under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c05s93-5-23" target="_self">93-5-23</a></cite> based on a material change in circumstances because of the child’s increased needs and expenses, inflation, and the father’s improved financial condition and earning capacity, and the child was attending college and also had transportation costs; further, departure from the 14 percent guideline set forth in Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.43.html#t43c19s43-19-101" target="_blank">43-19-101</a></cite> was proper because the father consistently earned more than $50,000 per year and the chancellor’s findings concerning the child’s needs and circumstances supported the departure.

       When an action for contempt was started by a former wife, the child of the parties was well into adulthood, so that the obligation to pay child support had ended, and the husband no longer owed alimony because of the wife’s remarriage. And, although the former husband should have sought to have had the divorce decree modified prior to changing his former wife as a beneficiary on his life insurance policy, a finding of contempt was a seemingly harsh result because their child was an adult and to have required him to have complied with the decree would have resulted in the former wife being unjustly enriched.

       Chancery court properly denied a former husband’s motion to reconsider a judgment that granted him a permanent modification of alimony because, while the decrease in his income from his loss of employment was not anticipated at the time of the divorce and was a material change in circumstances, it did not justify a termination of alimony, his post-divorce personal bills and remarriage could not be used as factors to reduce his support payments, he had not missed any payments on his monthly financial obligations since the divorce, the wife had been substantially dependent upon both her disability payments and the alimony payments from the husband since the divorce to meet her monthly living expenses, and her financial situation had not changed.

       A chancellor was manifestly in error in not reducing or terminating a separate maintenance award to a wife, even though the husband took “voluntary retirement” at the age of 59, where physical infirmities curtailed the husband’s ability to earn a living, and his monthly income was drastically reduced.

      </p>

       It was manifest error and an abuse of discretion for a chancellor to find that there had been no material or substantial change in circumstances warranting a modification of a father’s child support payments where the father suffered a heart attack approximately one year after the original decree was entered which resulted in a precipitous decline in his income, the father would be required to pay over 1/2 of his income in child support payments if the original decree were not modified, and the statutory child support guidelines’ suggestion and the actual child support ordered constituted a difference of nearly $500.00 a month.

       <p>
   An increase in a father’s child support obligation from $300 to $750 per month was excessive and unsupported by the evidence in the record, even though the father’s income and resources had increased over time, where the mother’s income had also steadily increased, the child had not required any extraordinary or unexpected care or treatment, there was no evidence that any of the child’s needs had gone unmet, the child’s actual expenses averaged approximately $260 per month, and utilization of the child support guidelines set forth in §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.43.html#t43c19s43-19-101" target="_blank">43-19-101</a></cite> produced a monthly figure of approximately $583.

      <p>
       A former husband failed to show that he was financially unable to comply with the divorce decree so as to avoid paying child support arrearage, where he failed to offer substantial evidence which was “particular and not general” to support his contention, and he had failed to pay medical expenses and school expenses at a time when he held a well paying job, which indicated that financial hardship was not the sole factor in his failure to make payments. Additionally, the husband’s argument that he had to pay other bills before making support payments was meritless, since such payments are paramount. Gregg v. Montgomery, 587 So. 2d 928, 1991 Miss. LEXIS 712 (Miss. 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   There was no error in a chancellor’s decision to leave a father’s child support obligation at $250 per month where the father argued that his salary had declined drastically from that earned in previous years but there was an indication that this was a voluntary choice of the father’s, the father argued that his monthly support burden should be at least $80 less in accordance with the guidelines of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.43.html#t43c19s43-19-101" target="_blank">43-19-101</a></cite>, and the wife argued that her monthly expenses outstripped her income by approximately $600 each month but she had received an increase in monthly income since the final decree.

      </p>
      <p>
       A father did not sustain a material change in circumstances warranting a reduction in child support when he voluntarily left his employment and enrolled in college, where he sought to modify his child support obligation within 6 months of the original divorce decree awarding child support, and his testimony indicated that he anticipated that he would be furthering his education long before the original divorce decree was entered. Tingle v. Tingle, 573 So. 2d 1389, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 838 (Miss. 1990).

      <p>
       A chancery court had the authority to modify an original divorce judgment requiring the husband to pay 1/2 of his net salary to his former wife in child support payments for one child where, subsequent to the divorce decree making this requirement, the husband’s monthly salary almost doubled. In the absence of some extraordinary circumstances, a chancery court could not validly render a decree that, regardless of a parent’s future salary, he or she would have to pay 1/2 of it for child support for one child; requiring a parent to pay 1/2 of his or her net salary for support of one child, without examining the child’s needs, is not the escalation clause recommended to take care of inflation in the cost of living. Brown v. Brown, 566 So. 2d 718, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 450 (Miss. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       There was a material change in circumstances which warranted modification of a child support order requiring the father to pay $400 per month per child for the parties’ 2 children who were in the mother’s custody, where the oldest child went to live with his father while the matter was pending, and the father had experienced a substantial reduction in his income while the mother had experienced an increase in hers, so that “both parties receive approximately the same amount of money,” and therefore the court was within its authority in terminating all child support.

       A denial by the Internal Revenue Service of a non-custodial parent’s claim of an income tax dependency exemption which that parent acquired pursuant to court order, constitutes a change in circumstances justifying the parent in seeking relief by way of modification of support obligations.

      <p>
       A decrease in a father’s income from $1,740 per month to $972 per month did not qualify as a material or substantial change in the father’s financial situation which would warrant modification of a child support agreement incorporated by a final divorce decree where the father was aware in November of 1986, when he signed the child support agreement, that the severance pay he was receiving would run out in January of 1987 and that after the severance pay ran out he had no confirmed employment.

       That a divorce decree requires the deposit in the registry of the court of cash or securities as security for the performance of its provisions for alimony and support of children does not preclude a modification of such provisions.

      </p>
      <p>
       The court which granted divorce decree to wife improperly directed that payment of $200 by husband should be in full settlement of alimony for wife and support for nine-month-old child, and three years later, on showing that wife could earn nothing and that child needed medical attention, court properly directed husband, who was remarried, had another child, and was earning about $80 per month, to pay $12 per month for child’s support, since a father’s duty to support his child is absolute when necessity arises.

      </p>
      <p>
       Even though there was a material change in circumstances, a modification of custody was not warranted where a child suffered no adverse effects; a father contributed to the child’s dental problems, a mother’s relationships did not constitute a material change in circumstances, and there was no detriment due to the child’s taking of one half of a prescription pill. Sudduth v. Mowdy, 991 So. 2d 1241, 2008 Miss. App. LEXIS 594 (Miss. Ct. App. 2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       Mother was not entitled to a modification of the chancery court’s award of custody to the children’s father based upon a material change in circumstances because the instances alleged primarily centered on the contention that the father engaged in a pattern of parental alienation and that the ongoing conflict between the couple was detrimental to the children’s best interests; any adverse effects felt by the children were not due to a material change in circumstances but to the ongoing volatile relationship between their parents. Gilliland v. Gilliland, 984 So. 2d 364, 2008 Miss. App. LEXIS 353 (Miss. Ct. App. 2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a child custody modification proceeding, the ex-husband was properly awarded custody because (1) the requisite adverse effect was correctly and specifically found prior to the determination that a change in custody would be in the child’s best interest, based mainly on the ex-wife’s coaching of the child’s testimony, (2) a private investigator’s DVD was properly admitted, and (3) the effect of separating the child from a half-sister was considered.

      </p>
      <p>
       Although the mother experienced material change in circumstances that adversely affected the children, the best interest of children did not require a change in custody and the trial court did not err in denying the father’s motion for modification and in refusing to modify the custody arrangement.

      </p>
      <p>
       After the parties’ divorce in which the former wife was awarded primary custody of the son, she moved four times, dated several men, and cohabited with a man. The chancellor found that the child’s best interests required a change in custody and awarded the former husband primary physical custody. Hill v. Hill, 942 So. 2d 207, 2006 Miss. App. LEXIS 250 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 942 So. 2d 164, 2006 Miss. LEXIS 758 (Miss. 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court properly granted the father’s petition for modification of child custody, because the chancellor found a material change in the child’s custodial care. The mother denied or prevented the father’s visitation on numerous occasions; the child’s education was deliberately interrupted by the mother several times to limit his participation in any necessary decisions; the mother involved the child in arguments between her and the father; and the guardian ad litem opined that the child had been substantially impacted by the mother’s attitude and approach to care such that the effects would worsen throughout his life. Thornhill v. Van Dan, 918 So. 2d 725, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 171 (Miss. Ct. App. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancery court erred in failing to identify the specific material change in circumstance in the custodial home. Without a finding of such a material change or a finding that the actual custodial arrangement was detrimental to the well-being of the children, the appellate court could not affirm the chancery court’s modification of custody; the record showed the parties’ children, in the father’s primary custody, had experienced behavioral problems, but there was no showing that same was due to detrimental conditions in his home or to a poor environment therein. Beasley v. Beasley, 913 So. 2d 358, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 271 (Miss. Ct. App. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancellor properly determined that there had been a material change in circumstances that adversely affected the child’s well-being based on the following findings: (1) the child had moved at least 10 times in the four years since the child’s parents had separated; (2) the child had failed first grade and was doing poorly academically; (3) the child was exposed to pornographic tapes while in the custody of the mother; (4) the mother’s new job schedule caused problems as to the child’s care; and (5) the mother’s frequent relationships with different men was not healthy for the child. Thus, where the record showed that the father’s employment was more conducive to parenting responsibilities and that the father would provide the child with a more stable home environment, modification of physical custody was proper. Brown v. White, 875 So. 2d 1116, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 597 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the mother had improved her lifestyle by quitting the use of illegal drugs, obtaining steady gainful employment, and living comfortably and in stable circumstances with her 10-year-old daughter, the custodial paternal grandparents had provided the child with a stable, secure, and nurturing environment in which the child appeared to be thriving; thus, although there was a material change in the mother’s circumstances, the trial court did not err in finding that it was in the best interest of the child to remain with the child’s grandparents, and it properly denied the mother’s petition seeking to modify the custody arrangement awarding paramount physical custody of the child to the child’s grandparents. Callahan v. Davis, 869 So. 2d 434, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 256 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).

The key to those statutes is that Miss. Code Ann. § 93-5-23 provides for the child’s care and custody in a divorce situation and Miss. Code Ann. § 93-11-65 states that it is an alternative, in addition to Miss. Code Ann. § 93-5-23. Slaughter v. Slaughter, 869 So. 2d 386, 2004 Miss. LEXIS 317 (Miss. 2004).

      </p>
      <p>
       When considering a modification of child custody, the proper approach was to first identify the specific change in circumstances, and then analyze and apply the Albright factors in light of that change; the trial court’s opinion did not reflect what the prior conditions were or identify any changed circumstances with which to make a comparison; the analysis was incomplete.

   Because the child’s best interest was the court’s “polestar” consideration in determining child custody, the importance of guardian ad litem appointments in child custody proceedings could not be overemphasized; in a case where a mother sought modification of child custody, and there was an allegation of abuse, it was mandatory that a guardian ad litem be appointed, under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c05s93-5-23" target="_self">93-5-23</a></cite>. Robison v. Lanford, 841 So. 2d 1119, 2003 Miss. LEXIS 151 (Miss. 2003).

       Party seeking custody modification must prove that substantial change in circumstances has transpired since issuance of the custody decree, that this change adversely affects child’s welfare, and that child’s best interests mandate a change of custody.

      </p>
      <p>
       Totality of circumstances should be considered in determining whether change in circumstances warrants custody modification. Bredemeier v. Jackson, 689 So. 2d 770, 1997 Miss. LEXIS 77 (Miss. 1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       Custody may be modified where environment provided by the custodial parent is found to be adverse to the child’s best interest and circumstances of the noncustodial parent have changed such that he or she is able to provide an environment more suitable than that of the custodial parent. Touchstone v. Touchstone, 682 So. 2d 374, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 534 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Neither nasty exchanges between former spouses when picking up or dropping off child for visitation, nor former wife’s implication that former husband had sexually abused child warranted change in custody; although child was subjected to some gross unpleasantries between his parents, record did not remotely suggest that these episodes were characteristic of the overall circumstances in which he lived. Touchstone v. Touchstone, 682 So. 2d 374, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 534 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Isolated incident, e.g., an unwarranted striking of a child, does not in and of itself justify a change of custody; rather, it must be the overall circumstances in which a child lives, likely to remain unchanged in the foreseeable future and adversely impacting a child, to warrant change of custody. Touchstone v. Touchstone, 682 So. 2d 374, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 534 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Change in circumstances warranting modification of custody is one in overall living conditions in which child is found. Riley v. Doerner, 677 So. 2d 740, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 287 (Miss. 1996).

       Change of circumstances in noncustodial parent is not in and of itself sufficient to warrant a modification of custody. Riley v. Doerner, 677 So. 2d 740, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 287 (Miss. 1996).

      <p>
       When environment provided by custodial parent is found to be adverse to child’s best interest, and circumstances of noncustodial parent have changed such that he or she is able to provide an environment more suitable than that of custodial parent, Chancellor may modify custody accordingly.

      </p>
      <p>
       Where a child living in a custodial environment clearly adverse to child’s best interest somehow appears to remain unscarred by his or her surroundings, Chancellor is not precluded from removing child for placement in a healthier environment.

      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence that home of custodial parent is site of dangerous and illegal behavior, such as drug use, may be sufficient to justify a modification of custody, even without a specific finding that environment has adversely affected child’s welfare. Riley v. Doerner, 677 So. 2d 740, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 287 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Once Chancellor determined that mother’s home was site of illegal drug use, as well as other behavior adverse to child’s welfare, and determined that father’s circumstances had improved such that he was able to provide a good home for child, it was within his discretion to transfer custody from mother to father, despite fact that Chancellor could not discern any negative effect on child caused by mother’s home environment. Riley v. Doerner, 677 So. 2d 740, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 287 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancellor is never obliged to ignore a child’s best interest in weighing a custody change; in fact, a Chancellor is bound to consider child’s best interest above all else. Riley v. Doerner, 677 So. 2d 740, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 287 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Test for custody modification need not be applied so rigidly, nor in such a formalistic manner, so as to preclude Chancellor from rendering a decision appropriate to facts of individual case. Riley v. Doerner, 677 So. 2d 740, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 287 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       A chancellor erred in failing to grant a father’s request for modification of custody of his 18-year old daughter where both parents and the daughter agreed that she should be in the father’s custody, she had been living with the father, and the chancellor had reduced the father’s child support obligation to reflect this living arrangement. Shelton v. Shelton, 653 So. 2d 283, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 150 (Miss. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       A chancellor was not “manifestly in error” in refusing to modify the custody of 2 children from their father to their mother, even though the father’s activities in attempting to exclude the mother from the children’s lives were very iniquitous and hurtful to the children, where the mother failed to show a material change in circumstances that adversely affected the children. Stevison v. Woods, 560 So. 2d 176, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 205 (Miss. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       A chancellor did not err in his determination that a material change in circumstances adverse to the welfare and best interests of the children warranted a change in custody from the mother to the father where the mother had moved and changed employment several times during the year after the parties’ divorce, daycare arrangements were similarly changed, the mother had subjected the children to numerous unwarranted physical and psychological examinations, not for treatment, but for investigation and interrogation as to alleged sexual abuse, and the daughter had exhibited distress and disturbance when being returned to the mother at the end of a visitation period with the father, while the father held a stable position and maintained a stable home, with his parents providing alternative care. Newsom v. Newsom, 557 So. 2d 511, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 43 (Miss. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancellor’s modification of custody decree granting father custody of minor children was proper where, although maternal grandmother, in seeking custody of minor children, had met burden of proving that mother was unfit to have custody of children, she had not met this burden with respect to father. Milam v. Milam, 509 So. 2d 864, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2509 (Miss. 1987).
      </p>

       A change of circumstances in the out of custody parent is not sufficient to authorize modification of custody award. Duran v. Weaver, 495 So. 2d 1355, 1986 Miss. LEXIS 2713 (Miss. 1986).
      </p>

       Even if the original divorce decree in awarding custody of children between their parents could be said to be a joint custody arrangement, the chancellor could modify such decree only upon a finding that there had been a material change of circumstances affecting the children. Rutledge v. Rutledge, 487 So. 2d 218, 1986 Miss. LEXIS 2436 (Miss. 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       Fact that custodial parent is receiving aid for dependent children, and social services from federal and state programs, including housing, does not disqualify parent from having custody of children and does not constitute material change adversely affecting children which may be basis for modification of custody decree, either by emergency order or by final decree. Robinson v. Robinson, 481 So. 2d 855, 1986 Miss. LEXIS 2339 (Miss. 1986).

       Modification of custody decree may not be granted where, to extent that there has been showing of change of circumstance, record shows that custodial parent has provided more stable home environment then since originally being granted custody and greatest change seems to be in noncustodial parent’s desire for custody.

       The provision authorizing the court from time to time to make new decrees applies to a custody as well as to an alimony decree; but this power may be exercised only where there has been a material change of circumstances, even though the award of custody was until a further order of the court.

       In proceedings for the modification of a decree awarding the care and custody of a minor child, the guiding star in such cases is the best interest of the child, and the chancellor has broad discretion in such matters.

       In a hearing upon the father’s petition testimony as to the suitability of the mother’s second husband as co-custodian of the infant daughter was proper, and although incompetent testimony in regard to the mother relative to an event which transpired prior to the decree giving her custody of the child was admitted, it was not reversible error, where, disregarding this testimony, the chancellor was warranted in awarding custody of the child to the father for ten months of the year.

       In an action by the mother for a modification of a divorce decree in reference to the custody of the child, where the mother clearly made out a strong prima facie case of a material change in her circumstances and conditions since the divorce decree with reference to the welfare of the child, the trial court should have reexamined the issue of custody. Boswell v. Pope, 213 Miss. 31, 56 So. 2d 1, 1952 Miss. LEXIS 328 (Miss. 1952).

       Chancery court’s transfer of child custody from a mother to a father was upheld because no error could be found in the court’s determination that the transfer was favored by: (1) the health, sex, and age of the children; (2) the existing emotional ties; (3) the home, school, and community record of the children; (4) the preference of the child at the age sufficient to express a preference by law; and (5) the stability of the home environment.

       <p>
   In determining whether there was a substantial and material change in circumstances to warrant a modification of child custody, the lower court would be required to consider the fact that the child had chosen to live with his mother, as well as the fact that the child had passed 12 years of age and could qualify under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c11s93-11-65" target="_self">93-11-65</a></cite> to choose his custodial parent, as factors to be considered on remand along with any other evidence the parties wished to produce.

   Reversal of a trial court’s denial of a mother’s request for modification of a child custody order based on changed circumstances was required because, although a guardian ad litem was properly appointed under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c05s93-5-23" target="_self">93-5-23</a></cite> based on allegations of abuse, the chancellor rejected the guardian’s recommendations but did not state the reasons for doing so in the order, nor did he summarize those recommendations as required; in addition, the chancellor did not explain his reasons for declining to follow the child’s preference to live with his mother as required by Miss.

       There was no material change in circumstances due to a mother’s remarriage; therefore, a chancery court did not err in refusing to modify a custody order, despite the testimony from one child regarding his preference to live with the father; furthermore, the evidence was not unequivocal that placement with the father would have been in his children’s best interests since the mother was best able to provide for their daily needs.

       Although the rules regulating provisions for custody of minor children do not reflect a policy of encouraging separation of siblings, a chancery court did not commit error when it provided that the parties’ older child would reside with his father while the younger child would continue to reside with the mother, where the judge conferred with the older child in chambers and found that he wished to live with his father, the child was over 15 years of age, and the court made elaborate provision for assuring that the children were together as much as was reasonably practicable given their residence in separate communities and their attendance at different schools.

       Where a mother and father agreed to joint physical and legal custody of their daughter but the father moved for a modification of the custody arrangement based upon a change in circumstances after the mother moved 80 miles away, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in granting the father’s motion because shuttling the child between the parents’ respective homes each week caused instability and because the girl was about to begin attending school, which meant that she could not split every week between her parents’ homes.

Albright, 437 So. 2d 1003, 1005 (Miss. 1983), to re-evaluate the factors after the filing of the Miss. R. Civ. P. 60(b) motion was a harmless error.

       Modification of a child custody proceeding was not warranted where a child with developmental delays, autism, and possible severe mental retardation was moved to Alaska because the child was not adversely affected by such; moreover, the child needed stability due to the fact that she had always resided with the father, and the mother’s experts were unable to say that the services offered to child in Alaska were inadequate since they were not familiar with the extent of those services.

       Chancery court properly weighed the Albright factors and modified custody of the parties’ children to the mother because the father and the stepmother smoked in the presence of the children, who had allergy problems, and the mother was the primary parent to take the children to the doctor and wand visit their school, while the father only remembered going to the school once; the mother was granted sole legal and physical custody.

       Trial court erred in modifying custody based on a material change in circumstances–the mother’s inability to set and enforce boundaries for the children–as its finding that the mother imposed little or no discipline on the children was not supported by substantial, credible evidence.

       Where a mother and father agreed to joint physical and legal custody of their daughter but the father moved for a modification of the custody arrangement based upon a change in circumstances after the mother moved 80 miles away, the trial court did not err in finding that the Albright mental health factor weighed in favor of the father because testimony from the mother’s mother and sister established that the mother went through a stage where she could not take care of herself and the mother testified that she was seeing a psychiatrist and was taking medication for depression, bi-polar disorder, and anxiety.

      <p>
       Chancery court properly denied a mother’s petition for modification of child custody because the chancellor was in the best position to assess the witnesses, did not believe a mother’s assertions of sexual abuse, and did believe a father’s explanations with regard to the allegations. The father explained that their daughter had a diaper rash requiring him to put Desitin on the affected area and that the daughter was bit while playing as school with other children. Lorenz v.

      <p>
       Issue of custody was fully and vigorously tried on the merits and both parties presented extensive evidence regarding custody, and the chancellor determined it to be in the best interest of the child to make his custodial situation more conducive to continuous learning; there was no error in the chancellor’s grant of full custody to the father.

       There was sufficient evidence of changed circumstances to support the chancellor’s decision to modify the child custody award and grant the ex-husband primary custody of the children because, inter alia: (1) the ex-wife was cohabitating with the husband’s brother, who had four felony convictions for indecency with a 14-year-old minor; (2) the wife had been unable to consistently have the youngest child at school at the appropriate time; (3) the wife would sleep for days at a time, awaking only to eat and returning to bed; (4) the middle child received virtually no discipline from the wife; and (5) the wife’s behavior since the divorce was adversely affecting her children.

       Chancellor abused his discretion in modifying a child custody arrangement without finding the requirement of a substantial and material change in circumstances that adversely affected the child’s welfare. Although the trial court referred to the change as an adjustment of the visitation schedule and awarded the wife “primary physical visitation” as opposed to “primary physical custody,” the conclusion was inescapable that the court changed the custody of the minor child.

       A chancellor erred in changing custody of a 6-year-old girl from her mother to her father based solely on the child’s unusual knowledge of sexual conduct allegedly gained from her accidental exposure to sexual relations between her mother and stepfather where the totality of the facts and circumstances failed to support a finding that the child’s best interest would be served by a change in custody.

       The evidence was sufficient to support a finding that a father had discharged his obligation to support his daughter where the parents modified the custody and child support provisions of their divorce decree by an agreement under which the father took custody of the daughter and the child support payment made by the father to the mother for their three children was proportionately reduced, and the father subsequently made substantial direct payments to the daughter for her support. Although court-ordered child support payments vest in the child as they accrue and may not thereafter be modified or forgiven, this does not mean that equity may not at times suggest ex post facto approval of extra-judicial adjustments in the manner and form in which support payments have been made.

       In a father’s action seeking a change in child custody from the mother to the father, evidence of the father’s treatment of the mother and the child prior to the parties’ divorce was manifestly material to the issue of the fitness of the father to have custody of the child, where the divorce decree indicated that the court had found merit to the mother’s charges of habitual cruel and inhuman treatment.

      </p>
      <p>
       The evidence did not reflect a material change in the circumstances of a child and his parents, which adversely affected the child, to the extent that a change of custody from the mother to the father was warranted, where the mother called upon the father for help when she fell upon hard times, the father had custody of the child for 16 months while the mother had liberal visitation, and the mother asked the father to restore custody to her when her situation stabilized, but the father declined; the parties’ act, in temporarily modifying the custody decree, was not binding upon the court.

       A chancellor was not “manifestly wrong” in changing custody of a daughter from the mother to the father where the mother’s move to Alaska had an “adverse effect” on the daughter, the parties’ original divorce decree provided custody of the parties’ son in the father and custody of their daughter in the mother, the daughter visited with her brother every day prior to the move to Alaska, and the mother had a poor relationship with her son.

First, the moving party must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that, after the entry of the judgment sought to be modified, there has been a material change in circumstances which adversely affects the welfare of the child. Second, if such an adverse change has been shown, the moving party must show by like evidence that the best interest of the child requires the change of custody. Phillips v. Phillips, 555 So. 2d 698, 1989 Miss. LEXIS 510 (Miss. 1989).

       Case seeking modification of child custody decree which gave joint legal custody of minor children to both parents and physical custody to mother was affirmed, although remanded to Chancery Court for updating custody hearing where record was 2 years old and Chancery Court judgment appealed from was almost entirely lacking in statement of findings of fact or conclusions of law upon which judgment was based.

       Upon making an explicit finding that mother’s proposed move from Union County was not a material change of circumstances which would adversely affect the child whose custody had been awarded to her, chancellor committed reversible error in transferring custody of child from mother to father.

       Trial court did not modify custody based on a father’s relocation due to a job transfer, but rather it considered evidence of the mother’s conduct and the adverse effect that had on the child, and it did not err by proceeding to analyze the factors under Albright v. Albright, 437 So.2d 1003 (Miss. 1983), after it determined that there was a change in circumstance due to the mother’s conduct; moreover, seven of the factors favored the father, and neither party was favored by the child’s age since the tender years presumption had been weakened in Mississippi.

       On a petition to modify a divorce decree awarding custody of a child to the wife, where the record did not reflect a change in conditions materially and adversely affecting the child’s welfare, but on the contrary tended to show that conditions surrounding the child have been bettered, the decree would not be modified, since the final divorce decree was res judicata, and only subsequent substantial change in conditions materially and adversely affecting the child’s welfare would warrant its modification.

   Agreed provisions of a divorce decree as to visitation rights are not res judicata so as to preclude modifications of a minor nature where original provisions prove impractical and are unsuited to the best interests of the children, and there has been a substantial change of circumstances.

       Where the ex-wife chose to cohabit with a convicted felon in Texas, the effects of this new relationship constituted a material change in circumstances that adversely affected the children.

       An extramarital relationship is not, per se, an adverse circumstance warranting modification of a custody decree. Thus, a chancellor’s modification of a joint child custody decree by forbidding the mother to continue conducting her “illicit” relationship with her male friend while her daughter resided with her was sufficient where there was no substantial credible evidence showing an adverse change affecting the child of such proportions that the child’s best interest would be served by further modifying the custody decree.

       Judgment awarding the father primary physical custody of minor child was affirmed because there was substantial evidence for the chancellor’s finding that the child had been sexually abused while in the mother’s care, which, together with the mother having moved to Alabama without informing the father, constituted a change in circumstances was adverse to the child’s best interests.

       Child custody was properly modified based on a change in circumstances arising from allegations that a mother refused to comply with visitation between a father and his 14-year-old daughter because, even though the age and sex of the child favored the mother under the best interest factors in Albright v. Albright, 437 So. 2d 1003, (Miss. 1983), most of the rest of the factors favored the father; he provided the most stable environment, he was the only one employed, he had the better parenting skills, and he was in better health than the mother. An appellate court took note of a threatening letter that the mother had attached to the locker of one of the child’s classmates. Davis v. Davis, 17 So.3d 114, 2009 Miss. App. LEXIS 105 (Miss. Ct.

       A chancellor did not err in refusing to modify an antenuptial agreement requiring the husband to “bestow his retirement benefits with a reasonable and comfortable monthly income to his wife so long as she may live,” even though the wife had remarried, where the agreement had been specifically enforced in the parties’ judgment of divorce, and the parties testified that their respective incomes and economic statuses had not significantly changed since the divorce proceedings.

       In a husband’s action for reduction of child support and for judgment for any alimony paid to the wife since her remarriage, the court did not err in treating a $225 monthly house payment made by the husband as alimony and a $700 monthly payment as child support where the husband was relieved of the house payment when the wife purchased the house from the husband, the husband continued to make the $700 payment after the wife had remarried, and the husband had not designated any part of the $700 monthly payment as alimony on his federal tax return.

       The fact that the father of a six-year-old girl had remarried and was in a position to provide better living conditions for the child than could the mother, who had to work for a living since she received no award of alimony, was not a sufficient change of circumstances to warrant taking custody away from the mother to whom it had been granted in the divorce decree, in the absence of evidence that the mother was unfeeling toward the child, or had neglected or mistreated her.

       A finding that a son was emancipated and that his father had no further duty to support him would be reversed, and the father would be required to abide by the terms of a court order requiring him to pay for his son’s college expenses, even though the son worked full-time, where the father had ignored the court order to pay his son’s college expenses, in effect forcing his son to abandon his schooling and become a full-time worker.

       In determining whether there had been a substantial change in circumstances necessary to modify child support, the trial court should have considered an increase in expenses as a result of the children’s attendance at college; this was not something that should have been anticipated at the time of the entry of the original decree since few parents can anticipate with certainty, 5 years ahead of time, that their children will attend college.

       Chancery court did not abuse its discretion in granting visitation to a father because the father was awarded two weekends per month, six weeks in the summer, and holidays every other year, and “liberal visitation,” at a minimum, meant two weekends a month and five weeks during the summer.

      </p>
      <p>
       Chancellor’s decision to grant the mother’s motion requesting modification of the visitation provision to require the father to pay the entire cost of his optional visitation was supported by substantial evidence, because the mother was unemployed and could not afford the cost of transporting her son.

       Chancery court did not err by refusing to order the husband to undergo a mental evaluation under Miss. R. Civ.

       Where evidence that the very young child had been sexually abused by his father during times of visitation included testimony from the mother, relatives, teachers, and a child therapist, the child had never named another person as his abuser, and during four years of hearings and examinations, no one else had been implicated as sexually abusing the child, the appellate court could not find that the chancellor’s decision to terminate visitation, at least for an interim period, was based on insufficient credible evidence.

      <p>
       Incarcerated father admitted to barely knowing the child, and the only testimony heard by the chancellor was from the child’s parents, the maternal grandfather and the paternal grandmother, and none of that testimony concerned the child’s best interest. There was no testimony by anyone else, professional or otherwise, regarding what, if any, impact the exposure to the prison environment might have on an impressionable young child, and therefore, the father failed to meet the burden of showing that visitation was in the best interest of the child.

      </p>
      <p>
       Mother argued that the chancellor abused his discretion in setting up the revised visitation schedule since it did not provide for more frequent weekend visitation periods, a longer period during the summer, and extended weekend visitation during Mardi Gras; however, the visitation arrangements for the mother ordered by the chancellor appeared to fall within the range of discretion afforded the chancellor in fashioning a schedule that was in the best interest of the child, and the chancellor did not abuse his discretion in failing to expand the visitation further in the areas complained of by the mother in her appellate brief.

      </p>
      <p>
       Decision of a chancellor, who found that a father’s alleged sexual abuse of his four-year-old son had not been proven and refused to restrict the father’s visitation, was supported by substantial evidence and was based on the credibility of the witnesses; it was therefore not overturned on appeal.

       A chancellor erred in amending a visitation order to restrict a father’s visitation with his 2 daughters to daytime hours on the basis that he taught his children Christian principles while living with a woman to whom he was not married where there was not substantial evidence in the record supporting the chancellor’s finding that the children were confused by the father’s alleged hypocrisy; moreover, even if the children were confused or did not like their father’s living arrangements, that is not the type of harm that rises to the level necessary to overcome the presumption that a non-custodial parent is entitled to overnight visitation. Harrington v. Harrington, 648 So. 2d 543, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 632 (Miss. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       A chancellor erred in suspending all visitation rights of a father, even though there was ample evidence that the child had been sexually abused, where there was not substantial credible evidence that the father was the abuser; however, the evidence warranted restriction of visitation, since there was conflicting evidence as to the identity of the abuser. Doe v. Doe, 644 So. 2d 1199, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 528 (Miss. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       In cases where the terms of visitation are at issue, the change in circumstances rule has no application because the court is not being asked to change the permanent custody of the child. All that need be shown is that there is a prior decree providing for visitation rights that is or is not working and that is or is not in the best interest of the child. On visitation issues, as with other issues concerning children, the chancery court enjoys a large amount of discretion in making its determination of what is in the best interest of the child.

       Petition by noncustodial parent who has been granted reasonable visitation rights to be granted specific visitation rights after parties have been unable to agree upon reasonable visitation is properly viewed as petition to clarify, not modify, divorce decree and should be granted.

   The chancellor did not abuse his discretion in refusing to modify a child custody decree, pursuant to §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c05s93-5-23" target="_self">93-5-23</a></cite>, to require that professional psychological care and treatment be required, even though the child was experiencing emotional problems, perhaps resulting from the divorce and subsequent custody fight, in view of the finding that the child’s emotional problems could best be dealt with by keeping him in the custody of his mother and that his mother was a fit and suitable person to have the care and custody of the child; nor was there abuse of discretion in the chancellor’s modification of the original decree awarding the father two day visitation privileges, even though a substantial distance separated the parties.

       A mother’s petition which sought modification of her visitation rights and claimed that the father continuously refused to permit the mother to visit the child at any and all reasonable times, and that the father arbitrarily defined reasonable rights of visitation as he saw fit, sufficiently charged that there had been material and substantial changes in circumstances, and a decree modifying the mother’s visitation rights by designating specific and exact times and intervals between changes in custody and visitation of the mother and father was justified and did not have the effect of splitting custody.

   Agreed provisions of a divorce decree as to visitation rights are not res judicata so as to preclude modifications of a minor nature where original provisions prove impractical and are unsuited to the best interests of the children, and there has been a substantial change of circumstances. Tighe v. Moore, 246 Miss. 649, 151 So. 2d 910, 1963 Miss. LEXIS 491 (Miss.), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">375 U.S. 921</cite>, <cite class="s_court">84 S.

       The modification of a former decree awarding the care and custody of a minor daughter to the mother, to provide that the father should have care and custody of the child during the summer months with the mother exercising such rights during the school months, and granting certain visitation rights to each of the parents, was not an abuse of the chancellor’s discretion.

       Former husband’s decision to pursue medical residency was not such “substantial change in circumstances” as might justify modification of payment schedule for lump-sum alimony, if such modifications are permissible, where former husband considered pursuing residency for years before he entered property settlement agreement.

       A chancellor erred in determining that the matter of a child support arrearage was previously settled by a court-approved modification of child support, which effectively amounted to a forgiveness of vested but unpaid child support obligations, since this is contrary to the well-established rule that “a court cannot relieve the civil liability for support payments that have already accrued.” Tanner v. Roland, 598 So. 2d 783, 1992 Miss. LEXIS 222 (Miss. 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       A former husband failed to show that he was financially unable to comply with the divorce decree so as to avoid paying child support arrearage, where he failed to offer substantial evidence which was “particular and not general” to support his contention, and he had failed to pay medical expenses and school expenses at a time when he held a well paying job, which indicated that financial hardship was not the sole factor in his failure to make payments. Additionally, the husband’s argument that he had to pay other bills before making support payments was meritless, since such payments are paramount. Gregg v. Montgomery, 587 So. 2d 928, 1991 Miss. LEXIS 712 (Miss. 1991).

       A custody agreement which called for a change in custody of the children from the mother to the father on relocation by the mother was void and contrary to public policy. The court cannot surrender or subordinate its jurisdiction and authority as to the circumstances and conditions which will cause a change in custody. McManus v. Howard, 569 So. 2d 1213, 1990 Miss.

       Where parties incomes were not sufficient to meet expenses at time of trial, Chancery Court should have retained jurisdiction over question of alimony and if at later date husband’s dental practice became successful financially, court would have authority to award such alimony as may at that time be fair and equitable; in cases where facts do not justify present award of alimony, Chancery Court generally ought to retain jurisdiction over question of alimony, and need not award nominal alimony in order to allow for modification in event that earning power of one spouse increases.

      </p>
      <p>
       Modification of divorce decree changing custody of child from mother to paternal grandparents was erroneous where there was no evidence that mother was an unfit person to have custody; moreover, custody would not be changed since mother had moved to Florida and planned to carry the child out of the jurisdiction of the court, although under such circumstances the court would retain jurisdiction by requiring mother to post a bond to insure the child’s return when ordered to the jurisdiction of the court. Rodgers v. Rodgers, 274 So. 2d 671, 1973 Miss. LEXIS 1607 (Miss. 1973).

      <p>
       The rule being well established that a chancery court which grants the custody of children in a divorce proceeding has, as between the same parties, continuing exclusive jurisdiction to modify the decree upon subsequent changed circumstances, the chancery court in the county in which the children and divorced parents resided was without jurisdiction to modify the decree of custody entered by the chancery court of another county, notwithstanding the statute providing that an action to determine the legal custody of a child may be brought in the county where the child is actually residing, in the county of residence of a party who has actual custody, or in the county of the residence of the defendant.

      <p>
       Even if the court granting divorce to the mother and awarding to her the custody of the parties’ minor child had continuing jurisdiction over the matter, the chancellor properly dismissed the father’s proceeding for modification of the custody decree, and for custody of the child, where the mother was decoyed into the state for service of process by trick, device and fraud on the part of the husband.

       A decree expressly awarding a given sum as present alimony, payable in monthly installments, and reserving the matter of future alimony for further consideration was not the allowance of a commuted and lump sum intended to be permanent, so that court had full jurisdiction to award further alimony if changed conditions so required.

       Where under the alimony provisions of a divorce decree, the divorced husband was required to assign to the divorced wife a policy of insurance on his life not as a division of property, but for the evident purpose of protecting her against failure on his part to make alimony payments, the chancery court, under this section [Code 1942, § 2743], as well as under the decree expressly retaining jurisdiction of the terms of the alimony, retained jurisdiction to adjudicate the future title to and rights under the policy as affected by changed conditions.

       The amount of periodic alimony awarded in a divorce decree based on irreconcilable differences was subject to modification, even though an agreement incorporated into the decree provided that the alimony provisions “shall not be modified without consent and agreement of the parties,” since periodic alimony agreements incorporated into a divorce decree based on irreconcilable differences are subject to modification where a material change in circumstances arises.

       A letter written by a former wife evidencing an attempt to waive alimony, which was provided to her former husband to enable him to obtain a loan, would not bar the wife’s claim of recovery for unpaid alimony, even though the letter was written subsequent to the entry of the parties’ divorce decree, since the letter could not deprive the court of its exclusive power to modify the decree to meet a change in the circumstances and conditions of the parties as described by statute; in order for the wife to relieve the husband of alimony payments, it would be necessary for her to file a motion to modify with the court.

       An obligation owed by one spouse to the other becomes fixed and vested when due and unpaid. This obligation will not be discharged or amended in an agreement between the parties unless it is explicitly pled before an informed court. To amend a prior decree, even a temporary one, the parties should recite the change and present it to the court. Thus, a final decree of divorce did not relieve a husband from paying an arrearage of temporary alimony which accrued before the entry of that final decree. Lewis v. Lewis, 586 So. 2d 740, 1991 Miss. LEXIS 500 (Miss. 1991).

       A chancery court’s order reducing a father’s child support obligation, predicated on its finding that there was a material change in circumstances, could not relate back to the date that the father first filed and sought a reduction in child support; such a rule provides sharp incentives for one who would have his or her support obligation reduced to bring the matter to trial as expeditiously as possible. Accordingly, the father’s reduction in child support obligations became effective on the date of the court judgment. McPhail v. McPhail, 564 So. 2d 839, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 163 (Miss. 1990).

       To extent that there is legal duty for parent to support adult incapacitated child, duty runs from parent to child, not from one divorced spouse to other; any action for support of child should therefore be maintained by or on behalf of adult child against parent from whom support is sought, not by suit brought by one parent against other for modification of divorce decree.

       In wife’s action for delinquent spousal support and child support, since the wife was successful on her motion for contempt, it followed that she was eligible for an award of attorney fees; however, since there were two contempt hearings following the hearing in which the husband’s hands were cleansed, and since the amount of attorney fees was not allocated on a per hearing basis, the appellate court reversed and remanded for further consideration the amount of the award of attorney fees.

       There was no error in the chancellor finding the ex-husband in contempt because (1) the husband did not make alimony payments and a judgment was entered against him to pay the wife past due alimony, but he only paid half of the amount; (2) the husband only paid three months of the wife’s insurance premiums; and (3) the evidence indicated that the husband simply chose not to pay the court-ordered alimony and insurance premiums; thus, in a petition for contempt and enforcement, the chancellor did not err in awarding the wife unpaid alimony, unpaid insurance premiums, and attorney fees.

       The fact that a child has been emancipated does not pretermit recovery of vested but unpaid child support. Either the child or the former custodial parent may bring an action against the defaulting parent, though the latter receives any recovery in his or her continuing fiduciary capacity subject to all of the duties and strictures thereof. If by reason of the supporting parent’s default, the custodial parent is forced to dip into his or her own resources beyond what would otherwise be expected of him or her, he or she may recover and retain amounts so proved, subject to equitable adjustment should the child’s prior needs so suggest.

      <p>
       A trial court properly dismissed a former wife’s fraudulent conveyance claim against her former husband, based upon the former husband’s conveyance of 15.2 acres of farm property to his father for inadequate consideration, where the husband had tendered the amount of the child support judgment owed to the former wife. However, since the matter was to be remanded for a determination of an additional amount of child support owed by the former husband, the judgments would be vacated to the extent necessary to provide the lower court with the opportunity to consider the need for security with regard to the child support arrearage or any of the father’s further obligations to and for the benefit of his children.

      </p>
      <p>
       A trial court in a divorce action erred by failing to provide findings of fact and conclusions of law when requested to do so by one of the parties, and therefore the case would be reversed and remanded for the limited purpose of providing findings of fact and conclusions of law as required under Rule 52, Miss.

      </p>

       The Supreme Court’s remand of a child support case to the chancery court “for such further proceedings and judgments as may be required and as may be consistent with this opinion” did not restrict the chancery court to consideration of the issues litigated in the original proceeding.

      </p>
      <p>
       The standards for review of periodic alimony are much the same as those used in reviewing lump sum alimony; the chancellor should consider the reasonable needs of the wife and the right of the husband to lead as normal a life as possible with a decent standard of living.

      </p>
      <p>
       Since there is no statute setting up any special procedure for appeal from a divorce action or relief from a divorce judgment, Rule 60, Miss. R. Civ. P. was controlling where the husband had filed a Motion for Relief from Final Judgment under Rule 60(b)(3), alleging that the wife had found new employment which more than doubled her salary. The chancellor had the authority to alter the final judgment if Rule 60(b)(3) was otherwise applicable, even though the husband had already filed bond for supersedeas, where the record had not yet been transmitted to the Supreme Court when the Rule 60(b)(3) Motion for Relief was filed. Gray v. Gray, 562 So. 2d 79, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 237 (Miss. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancery Court’s decision on alimony will not be disturbed on appeal unless it is against overwhelming weight of evidence or manifestly in error; in case claiming inadequacy or outright denial of alimony, appellate court will interfere where decision is seem oppressive, unjust, or grossly inadequate, such that it evidences abuse of discretion. McNally v. McNally, 516 So. 2d 499, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2956 (Miss. 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       Award to wife of alimony and child support where such is not sought in pleadings is error, because it deprives husband of due process, although such judgments are not void; therefore, where husband paid alimony and child support for 3 years before complaining about due process violation, decree is final and due process right has been waived. Miller v. Miller, 512 So. 2d 1286, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2815 (Miss. 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       That part of a decree granting a divorce is severable from other parts of the decree involving alimony, attorney’s fees, and insurance protection, and although a party is estopped from appealing from a final decree of divorce, he has not thereby lost the right to appeal from the other provisions of the decree.

       Chancellor acted within her discretion in choosing the date of the divorce, rather than the date of a temporary support order, to mark the point of demarcation between marital and separate property. To the extent that Pittman v. Pittman, 791 So. 2d 857 (Miss. Ct. App. 2001), could be read to create a rule that a temporary support order always and necessarily indicated the point of demarcation, the Mississippi Supreme Court overruled it. Collins v.

      </p>
      <p>
       Chancellor’s division of the marital assets were supported by substantial credible evidence; there was not sufficient testimony, other than the husband’s assertions, that the wife did not contribute to the marital assets. Beddingfield v. Beddingfield, 11 So.3d 780, 2009 Miss. App. LEXIS 348 (Miss. Ct. App. 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       Husband acquiesced to the appraised value of $ 599,000-$ 600,000 of the marital home, and there was no expert testimony that the initial appraisal was faulty; the delay between the completion of the appraisal and the division of marital assets was not unreasonable, and the chancellor did not err in finding that the husband bound himself to that figure. Smith v. Smith, 25 So.3d 369, 2009 Miss. App. LEXIS 283 (Miss. Ct. App. 2009), cert. denied, 24 So.3d 1038, 2010 Miss. LEXIS 17 (Miss. 2010).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancellor did not err in its classification and equitable division of the parties’ assets as the chancellor properly made findings based on the Ferguson factors, and as the wife had minimal financial ability other than her lump-sum distribution of marital assets, he properly awarded her attorney’s fees. Stewart v. Stewart, 2 So.3d 770, 2009 Miss. App. LEXIS 69 (Miss. Ct. App. 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a divorce case, a chancellor properly determined that a business given to a former husband by his father was separate property; the evidence presented by the former wife was insufficient to show that the business and personal expenses were so interwoven as to have caused the stock of the company to have transmuted into marital property, even though some personal funds were used to pay business debts. Moreover, property given to the husband by his brothers was also found to be an inter vivos gift not subject to division as a marital asset. Dorsey v. Dorsey, 972 So. 2d 48, 2008 Miss. App. LEXIS 18 (Miss. Ct. App. 2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancellor did not err in determining that the property settlement agreement was ambiguous with respect to the husband’s duty to pay the wife upon sale of less than the complete property; the wife was to be paid upon each partial sale and the chancellor did not err in finding that the agreement was unambiguous with regard to the division of proceeds. Crisler v. Crisler, 963 So. 2d 1248, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 549 (Miss. Ct. App. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a divorce action was filed ten years earlier and temporary support was ordered, it was properly not considered the line of demarcation for the equitable division of marital assets because the case was subsequently dismissed as being stale under Miss. R. Civ. P. 41; the dismissal relieved the husband of his support obligations. Marshall v. Marshall, 979 So. 2d 699, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 411 (Miss. Ct. App. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the parties stipulated regarding the value of a residence, a chancellor did not err by taking into consideration the cost of repairs because that was not part of the stipulation; moreover, the distribution as a whole was not inequitable.

      </p>
      <p>
       In a divorce case, a chancery court did not err by finding that mineral interests given to a former wife by her former husband were separate property of the wife since they were the separate property of the husband at the time of the gift; moreover, the husband intended them to be the wife’s separate property since he titled them in her name alone. LaRue v. LaRue, 969 So. 2d 99, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 338 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 968 So. 2d 948, 2007 Miss. LEXIS 660 (Miss. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a divorce case, a chancery court did not err by finding that a wife’s interest in her husband’s property was marital due to commingling where the husband had his children re-deed the property to him after a mistake in a gift to them; however, the chancery court properly relied on the factors in Ferguson v. Ferguson, 639 So. 2d 921 (Miss. 1994), when awarding the wife the entire interest thereof because it was a way to provide for the maintenance of the two elderly parties. LaRue v. LaRue, 969 So. 2d 99, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 338 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 968 So. 2d 948, 2007 Miss. LEXIS 660 (Miss. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a divorce case, a chancery court did not err by ordering a former husband to pay all of the marital debts where a chancellor considered each party’s economic and domestic contributions, the disposal of marital assets, the market value of each party’s separate and marital assets, and each party’s mineral interest and Social Security income; the award was fair and equitable. LaRue v. LaRue, 969 So. 2d 99, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 338 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 968 So. 2d 948, 2007 Miss. LEXIS 660 (Miss. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a divorce case, a chancery court did not err by dividing a marital residence between the parties and allowing the wife to reside there for life due to the wife’s age, limited income, and inability to work for health reasons. LaRue v. LaRue, 969 So. 2d 99, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 338 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 968 So. 2d 948, 2007 Miss. LEXIS 660 (Miss. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a divorce case, a chancery court did not err by refusing to find that a former wife dissipated the marital assets by gambling where it was disputed as to who spent the $100,000 at issue; the wife testified that she wrote checks for her husband to use gambling on a regular basis. LaRue v. LaRue, 969 So. 2d 99, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 338 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 968 So. 2d 948, 2007 Miss. LEXIS 660 (Miss. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancellor did not abuse his discretion in distributing the marital property where the chancellor properly considered the Ferguson factors; the father was the sole wage earning with an annual salary of $200,000, the wife did not work, and the chancellor found substantial marital debt. Lauro v. Lauro, 924 So. 2d 584, 2006 Miss. App. LEXIS 161 (Miss. Ct. App. 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a divorce case, a former wife was properly awarded ten percent of a former husband’s retirement account and 50 percent of the equity in the marital home where the evidence showed that the husband made almost all of the financial contributions to the marriage, and where the wife only worked part-time sporadically, the husband did most of the household duties, and the wife diverted funds from the husband’s account to rent an apartment while she was seeing another man; it was fair to give the wife fewer assets since she was not given any of the marital debt. Brabham v. Brabham, 950 So. 2d 1098, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 128 (Miss. Ct. App. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancellor’s division of marital assets was supported by credible evidence and he properly awarded the store to the wife, given that she had less marketability for her skills and the husband had more equity in property than the wife; the husband was not entitled to additional alimony other than the wife’s support for three months. Graham v. Graham, 948 So. 2d 451, 2006 Miss. App. LEXIS 915 (Miss. Ct. App. 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court did not err in dividing the marital assets of the parties where there would be four people in the wife’s household as opposed to only one in the husband’s, where the husband earned more than $50,000 per year, while the wife earned only $18,000; the trial court also found that the husband’s adultery had to be considered since it was the admitted cause of the break down of the marriage. Seymour v. Seymour, 960 So. 2d 513, 2006 Miss. App. LEXIS 805 (Miss. Ct. App. 2006), cert. denied, 959 So. 2d 1051, 2007 Miss. LEXIS 382 (Miss. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       Body shop was properly characterized as marital property; however, the body shop held no assets as all was leased from the prior operator. Thus, the chancellor did not err in finding that the body shop would be addressed as alimony, but not in the division of property. Fogarty v. Fogarty, 922 So. 2d 836, 2006 Miss. App. LEXIS 139 (Miss. Ct. App. 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       Property distribution was equitable where the chancellor conducted an appropriate analysis of the factors and delineated the two factors that she found relevant; the wife was entitled to one-half the equity in the home, and the husband was entitled to one-half of the wife’s retirement accounts, and the chancellor chose to have the respective obligations completely offset each other; there was no evidence that the credit card debt was not marital debt. Shoffner v. Shoffner, 909 So. 2d 1245, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 109 (Miss. Ct. App. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Court properly divided marital properly where the wife made a substantial income, her house was free of any mortgages, the husband was disabled and had little income, and he had child support payments for his other children. Jones v. Jones, 904 So. 2d 1143, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 993 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a divorce case, a court properly characterized the wife’s real property as her separate property where the land had always been titled in the wife’s maiden name, it was debt free at the time of the marriage, the wife purchased the land from her great-grandmother’s estate, and she had a great emotional attachment to the property. Jones v. Jones, 904 So. 2d 1143, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 993 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancellor, in his findings of fact and conclusions of law, equitably disposed of all of the parties’ property in accordance with the Ferguson factors and applicable case law; therefore, the appellate court was not at liberty to disturb that decision. Ericson v. Tullos, 876 So. 2d 1038, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 595 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a divorce trial, where court was adjourned and the husband did not appear at the next scheduled hearing, the chancellor committed reversible error in concluding a decision on property division, alimony, and child support could be rendered fairly without allowing the wife an opportunity to cross-examine the husband; cross-examination of the husband was necessary for the chancellor’s complete deliberation on the marriage and assets without a one-sided slant on the facts and circumstances. Barnes v. Barnes, 874 So. 2d 477, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 490 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancellor did not abuse his discretion in ordering that the wife could occupy the marital home for six months, during which time the husband would pay all utilities, and that thereafter the wife would be assessed rent against her interest until the home was sold and the proceeds of sale divided between the parties. Ferro v. Ferro, 871 So. 2d 753, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 90 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the chancellor rejected both parties’ opinions as to the value of the husband’s gun shop, valued it a $50,000, and awarded the wife one-third of this amount, the chancellor’s recitation of facts after the discussion of the Ferguson factors was sufficient, and he did not abuse his discretion. Ferro v. Ferro, 871 So. 2d 753, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 90 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancellor properly ordered a husband to reimburse his wife for his criminal defense and counseling fees paid during the marriage as part of the distribution of assets since the fees for the husband’s misconduct were paid from marital funds. Avery v. Avery, 864 So. 2d 1054, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 91 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancellor made distribution of the marital property in accordance with case law where the wife would become eligible for some of the husband’s retirement benefits, and the husband’s personal injury settlement proceeds were outside of the marital estate and could not be subject to equitable distribution. Tynes v. Tynes, 860 So. 2d 325, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 1065 (Miss. Ct. App. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancellor erred in ordering the sale of the marital home where the husband had dropped his complaint for divorce; once the couple had reunited, the separation agreement including settlement of property rights became null and void, and the husband’s withdrawn petition did not constitute a request to order partition of the martial property. Myers v. Myers, 881 So. 2d 220, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 1165 (Miss. Ct. App. 2003), aff'd in part and rev'd in part, 881 So. 2d 180, 2004 Miss. LEXIS 711 (Miss. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a former wife’s net income slightly exceeded her former husband’s, and the chancellor awarded her over $300,000, or 51.7 percent, of the marital property, the division of property, though not equal, was equitable, and the chancellor did not err in failing to award her alimony. McLaurin v. McLaurin, 853 So. 2d 1279, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 787 (Miss. Ct. App. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the chancellor erred by failing to make sufficient findings in support of the division of the marital property to meet the Ferguson standard and failed to make specific findings as to how the marital property was classified, the case was remanded for such findings. Lauro v. Lauro, 847 So. 2d 843, 2003 Miss. LEXIS 272 (Miss. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancellor erred by failing to include a husband’s inherited property as a martial asset during the distribution of property because it had been co-mingled with the parties’ marital property; however, a reversal was not necessary because an equitable result had been reached. Messer v. Messer, 850 So. 2d 161, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 542 (Miss. Ct. App. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancellor did not err by equally dividing an unfinished marital home because the wife’s monetary contribution was offset by the fact that the property had been inherited by the husband. Messer v. Messer, 850 So. 2d 161, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 542 (Miss. Ct. App. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancellor did not err in classifying a condominium as a marital asset because the evidence showed that numerous payments were made from the parties’ joint account, and significant improvements were made by the husband; moreover, the wife was given all of the equity in the property when an award of complete ownership and possession was entered. Messer v. Messer, 850 So. 2d 161, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 542 (Miss. Ct. App. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancellor did not err in valuing a condominium because the evidence established that neither party introduced any evidence to support valuation; moreover, the decision to accept an appraiser’s valuation of a mobile home did not amount to manifest error. Messer v. Messer, 850 So. 2d 161, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 542 (Miss. Ct. App. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancellor did not err by failing to divide ownership in 110 acres of land because the evidence showed that the parties purchased the land as an investment for their child’s education; moreover, the parties could have instituted a partition proceeding to divide the land if an agreement could not have been reached concerning the disposition of the land. Messer v. Messer, 850 So. 2d 161, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 542 (Miss. Ct. App. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a former wife admitted to having numerous affairs during her marriage, and the former husband was granted a divorce on grounds of adultery, the chancellor erred in awarding the wife half of the marital assets, as the strain and conflict created in the marriage by the wife’s affairs could not be ignored without violating principles of equity. Singley v. Singley, 2003 Miss. LEXIS 283 (Miss. June 12, 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       Goodwill should not be used in determining the fair market value of a business subject to equitable division in divorce cases. Singley v. Singley, 2003 Miss. LEXIS 283 (Miss. June 12, 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the chancellor correctly determined that a husband’s inheritance was commingled and became a part of the marital estate, she apparently failed to realize that she could adjust the Ferguson distribution because of the factors surrounding the source and application of the inheritance; while the wife might have been entitled to some interest in the commingled funds, she was not necessarily entitled to half. Singley v. Singley, 2003 Miss. LEXIS 283 (Miss. June 12, 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       Funds inherited by a wife were converted to marital property when she placed them in an account which the couple used to purchase cattle and to pay other family expenses; however, the amount paid by the husband to the wife after he sold the cattle to his father regained its nonmarital status and would not be subject to equitable distribution. Heigle v. Heigle, 654 So. 2d 895, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 228 (Miss. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a husband and wife had been divorced in a community property state, a resulting or constructive trust was available to protect the community property interest of the wife in real property acquired in Mississippi solely in the husband’s name; thus, the wife was entitled to an undivided 1/2 interest in Mississippi oil and gas properties, which were acquired with community funds and held in the husband’s name, based on the theory of resulting or constructive trust. Palmer v. Palmer, 654 So. 2d 1, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 81 (Miss. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       The totality of a chancellor’s awards of alimony and property to a wife was excessive where the wife was awarded periodic alimony which exceeded the husband’s net income as well as his gross income, she was granted greater than 50 percent of the marital property, and she was awarded substantial lump sum alimony. Brooks v. Brooks, 652 So. 2d 1113, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 152 (Miss. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       A chancellor erred in not giving a husband any credit for his investment in the parties’ Mercedes automobile. Pittman v. Pittman, 652 So. 2d 1105, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 142 (Miss. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       The equitable division of marital assets between divorcing parties does not require an automatic 50-50 split or a vested right in the other spouse’s pension plan, but rather requires “fundamental fairness” in the division of marital assets; thus, equitable distribution was effected, even though the chancellor did not give the wife an interest in the husband’s pension plan, where she was instead awarded monies which reflected her contribution to the marital assets. Savelle v. Savelle, 650 So. 2d 476, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 64 (Miss. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   A wife’s waiver of her right to alimony did not compromise her claim for division of her husband’s military pension, since a military pension constitutes personal property, and a claim for equitable division of property is separate and distinct from a claim for alimony. Pierce v. Pierce, 648 So. 2d 523, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 499 (Miss. 1994), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">515 U.S. 1160</cite>, <cite class="s_court">115 S. Ct. 2613</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">132 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 856, 1995 U.S. LEXIS 4319 (U.S. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   When property is found to be jointly accumulated, the chancellor should make specific findings in support of the proportionate share awarded to the parties because a spouse is not automatically entitled to an equal division of jointly-accumulated property. Pierce v. Pierce, 648 So. 2d 523, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 499 (Miss. 1994), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">515 U.S. 1160</cite>, <cite class="s_court">115 S. Ct. 2613</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">132 L.

      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   A chancellor’s findings were sufficient to support an award to a wife of a 50 percent interest in her husband’s military pension where the chancellor found that the parties were married for more than 20 years while the husband was on active duty as a member of the United States Navy, and the husband earned and became eligible for retirement pay from the military service while the wife “followed him faithfully throughout the years of their marriage up to the time of their last separation.” Pierce v. Pierce, 648 So. 2d 523, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 499 (Miss. 1994), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">515 U.S. 1160</cite>, <cite class="s_court">115 S. Ct. 2613</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">132 L.

      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   A chancellor did not err in dismissing a complaint in which a woman sought “equitable division of partnership assets” accumulated during 13 years of cohabitation with her companion where the parties never entered into a ceremonial marriage, the woman was not an innocent partner to a void marriage, and she was not destitute but was well-compensated during and after the relationship; the legislature has not extended the rights enjoyed by married people to those who choose merely to cohabit, and cohabitation remains a “crime against public morals and decency” under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.97.html#t97c29s97-29-1" target="_blank">97-29-1</a></cite>.

      </p>
      <p>
       A chancellor erred in holding that a wife’s adulterous conduct precluded her from being entitled to any form of equitable distribution of property upon divorce where her affairs occurred during periods in which the parties were separated, and the chancellor did not make a finding as to the effect, if any, the affairs had on the deterioration of the marriage. Carrow v. Carrow, 642 So. 2d 901, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 438 (Miss. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       A chancellor erred in failing to grant a wife an equitable distribution of marital assets where the wife paid most of the family’s household expenses and did a great deal of domestic work in the home during the course of the marriage, thereby allowing the husband to utilize more of his money for the purchase of investments. Carrow v. Carrow, 642 So. 2d 901, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 438 (Miss. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       Profit sharing plans acquired during the course of the marriage are marital assets subject to adjudication by the chancery court granting a divorce, depending upon the facts and circumstances of each particular case. Parker v. Parker, 641 So. 2d 1133, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 375 (Miss. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       When an interest in a profit sharing plan has been awarded in a divorce proceeding pursuant to Mississippi law, the parties may seek qualification of the interest in the pension plan under federal law if the state court order is properly drawn under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), as amended by the Retirement Equity Act (REA); if the order is properly drawn and approved by the pension plan administrator, it becomes “qualified” under federal law and vests an interest in the alternate payee. Parker v. Parker, 641 So. 2d 1133, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 375 (Miss. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       The alternate payee’s interest in a pension plan vests only after (1) a chancellor has determined that an equitable division of the marital assets requires awarding some portion of one spouse’s pension or profit sharing plan to the other spouse, and (2) a Qualified Domestic Relations Order (QDRO) is entered and accepted as qualified; in other words, if apportionment of one spouse’s pension or profit sharing plan is not equitable based on the facts and circumstances presented, no right in such a plan in favor of the other spouse can ever vest. Parker v. Parker, 641 So. 2d 1133, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 375 (Miss. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       A wife was entitled to a percentage of her husband’s profit sharing plan where the wife made material contributions as a homemaker and a wage earner, and her earned income was enjoyed by both parties rather than invested only in her name. Parker v. Parker, 641 So. 2d 1133, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 375 (Miss. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       A chancellor erred in awarding a wife an interest in her husband’s pension benefits in the absence of findings that the wife contributed to the accumulation of the funds in the pension plan. Crowe v. Crowe, 641 So. 2d 1100, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 378 (Miss. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       The chancery court has the authority to equitably divide marital assets upon divorce. Ferguson v. Ferguson, 639 So. 2d 921, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 352 (Miss. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       No right to property vests by virtue of the marriage relationship alone prior to entry of a judgment or decree granting equitable or other distribution pursuant to dissolution of the marriage; thus, the rights of alienation and the laws of descent and distribution are not affected by the recognition of marital assets. Ferguson v. Ferguson, 639 So. 2d 921, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 352 (Miss. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       The following guidelines should be considered when making an equitable division of marital property: (1) substantial contribution to the accumulation of the property; (2) the degree to which each spouse has expended, withdrawn or otherwise disposed of marital assets and any prior distribution of such assets by agreement, decree or otherwise; (3) the market value and the emotional value of the assets subject to distribution; (4) the value of assets not ordinarily, absent equitable factors to the contrary, subject to such distribution, such as property brought to the marriage by the parties and property acquired by inheritance or inter vivos gift by or to an individual spouse; (5) tax and other economic consequences, and contractual or legal consequences to third parties, of the proposed distribution; (6) the extent to which property division may, with equity to both parties, be utilized to eliminate periodic payments and other potential sources of future friction between the parties; (7) the needs of the parties for financial security with due regard to the combination of assets, income and earning capacity; and (8) any other factor which in equity should be considered. Ferguson v. Ferguson, 639 So. 2d 921, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 352 (Miss. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       When evaluating the division of marital assets upon divorce, chancery courts should support their decisions with findings of fact and conclusions of law for purposes of appellate review. Ferguson v. Ferguson, 639 So. 2d 921, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 352 (Miss. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       A division of marital property should be based upon a determination of the fair market value of the assets, and these valuations should be the initial step before determining division; thus, expert testimony may be essential to establish valuation sufficient to equitably divide the property, particularly when the assets are diverse. Ferguson v. Ferguson, 639 So. 2d 921, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 352 (Miss. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although contributions of domestic services are not made directly to a retirement fund, they are nonetheless valid material contributions which indirectly contribute to any number of marital assets, thereby making such assets jointly acquired; when one spouse has contributed directly to a retirement fund by virtue of his or her labor, while the other spouse has contributed indirectly by virtue of domestic services and/or earned income which both parties have enjoyed rather than invested, it is equitable to allow both parties to reap the benefits of the one existing retirement plan. Ferguson v. Ferguson, 639 So. 2d 921, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 352 (Miss. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       In dividing marital assets upon divorce, homemaker contributions are not to be measured by a mechanical formula, but on the contribution to the economic and emotional well-being of the family unit. Ferguson v. Ferguson, 639 So. 2d 921, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 352 (Miss. 1994).

       Marital partners can be equal contributors whether or not they both are at work in the marketplace; thus, for the purpose of divorce, marital property would be defined as any and all property acquired or accumulated during the course of the marriage. Hemsley v. Hemsley, 639 So. 2d 909, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 351 (Miss. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       Assets acquired or accumulated during the course of the marriage are marital assets subject to an equitable distribution by the chancellor. Hemsley v. Hemsley, 639 So. 2d 909, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 351 (Miss. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       In determining an equitable distribution of marital property upon divorce, it is assumed that the contributions and efforts of the marital partners, whether economic, domestic or otherwise, are of equal value; in arriving at an equitable distribution, the chancellor should follow the guidelines set out. Hemsley v. Hemsley, 639 So. 2d 909, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 351 (Miss. 1994).

       A chancellor did not err in awarding a wife 50 percent of the husband’s military retirement benefits and civil service retirement benefits where the wife contributed her share to the marriage by caring for the children and the house.

       A chancellor failed to equitably divide a $400,000 marital estate where he awarded all but $20,500 to the husband, the parties were married for 11 years, the entire marital estate was accumulated during the course of the marriage, the wife did the majority of the housework and cared for the parties’ son during the first 8 or 9 years of the marriage, she contributed her own salary to the marital assets, and she participated in activities she thought would build the husband’s dental practice.

       A chancellor did not err in awarding a husband permanent possession, custody and control of the former marital residence and 10 acres of other land where the husband was awarded custody of the parties’ child, and the wife retained the ownership interest in the property that she had prior to the divorce. Chamblee v. Chamblee, 637 So. 2d 850, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 285 (Miss. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       A primary consideration in providing for a proper division of property at divorce is the economic contributions made to the marriage by each party, whether it be in terms of actual money earned or in terms of service without compensation. Chamblee v. Chamblee, 637 So. 2d 850, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 285 (Miss. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       A chancellor abused his discretion in awarding to a husband every item of marital property that the parties contested where both parties had donated large amounts of money and non-compensated time to the marriage. Chamblee v. Chamblee, 637 So. 2d 850, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 285 (Miss. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       A chancellor did not abuse his discretion in awarding a wife an equitable lien in the husband’s 1/2 interest in the parties’ marital home arising out of all the improvements, work and money she had spent on the house where the wife had purchased with her own money the land on which the home was located, the wife worked hard remodeling and renovating the home, and she made the majority of the improvements and contributions to the homestead.

      </p>
      <p>
       A wife was entitled to her 1/2 share of all three of the parties’ real properties that were part of the marital estate, including the marital residence, even though the wife voluntarily left the residence and failed to assert any semblance of a claim during the 6-year period when she was living with another man, since the mere passage of time should not have deprived the wife of her 1/2 interest in the properties that she had helped purchase and maintain and which the parties had used as a marital home, and there was no compelling reason not to partition all three marital properties aside from sheer punishment of the wife. Lenoir v. Lenoir, 611 So. 2d 200, 1992 Miss. LEXIS 791 (Miss. 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a divorce proceeding, an equitable lien was necessary to protect the wife’s mother’s interest in the parties’ residence, where the mother had loaned the husband and wife $51,500 to enable them to retire the mortgage against their home, since unjust enrichment would result if the husband and wife were permitted to divorce and partition the debt-free family residence. Dudley v. Light, 586 So. 2d 155, 1991 Miss. LEXIS 586 (Miss. 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       A chancellor did not err in ordering a husband to pay his wife an income of $7,333.33 per month from the corporate owner of 5 commercially successful restaurants, of which the wife owned 49.8 percent of the shares while the husband owned the remaining shares, where the amount was based on current financial information and would be subject to change depending upon the economic welfare of the corporation. Just as the chancery court has the authority to require a husband to pay his wife periodic and lump sum alimony from his property and estate, it clearly has the authority to require a divorced husband to pay his wife whatever is due her in his management of her property. Retzer v. Retzer, 578 So. 2d 580, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 858 (Miss. 1990).

      <p>
       The former wife of a retired Naval officer could not belatedly seek an equitable division of her former husband’s military retirement pension, even though their 1982 divorce decree expressly reserved the wife’s “rights as may now or hereafter be vested by law” in the husband’s military retirement. The Federal Uniformed Services Former Spouses Protection Act did not vest any rights in anyone, but merely removed a federal bar and allowed the states to treat the military retirement pensions of their domiciliaries as personal property subject to state property laws, and state law did not vest or revest in the wife any rights in the husband’s military pension. Brown v. Brown, 574 So. 2d 688, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 809 (Miss. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       In an action to determine a former wife’s entitlement to a share of her former husband’s military retirement pension, a finding that the former husband at all times remained a Mississippi domiciliary during his active duty tenure with the Army was absolutely requisite to the judgment entered by the lower court denying the former wife’s claim to a share of the pension on the basis of Mississippi law, since the matter of whether the spouse of a service person has a vested right in the military retirement pension is governed by the law of the state (or states, pro rata) of domicile during the term of active duty service, the term during which the pension is earned. Since the lower court made no finding on the matter of the former husband’s domicile, the matter would be remanded for findings regarding the former husband’s state of domicile for the legally operative period of time. Southern v. Glenn, 568 So. 2d 281, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 584 (Miss. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       A court did not err in rejecting a husband’s claim that he owned a 100 percent equitable interest in a 112-acre tract of land, less the 5 acres on which the parties’ home was located, even though the husband acquired the land by gift from his aunt and the husband conveyed an interest in the property to the wife only because it was necessary in order to obtain a loan to build their house; deeds between husband and wife are common, even without consideration, and are necessary vehicles in family business and relationships. Powers v. Powers, 568 So. 2d 255, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 278 (Miss. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       A wife was entitled to receive an undivided 1/2 interest in a marital home where the property was jointly accumulated and the wife was jointly and severally liable on the note and deed of trust pertaining to that property, in spite of the husband’s argument that the chancellor erred in awarding the 1/2 interest because the wife’s financial contributions in obtaining the property did not amount to a 1/2 interest. Brendel v. Brendel, 566 So. 2d 1269, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 539 (Miss. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       A chancellor was not manifestly wrong in awarding to a husband the right to operate the parties’ chicken farm, which was their most valuable asset and was an asset that could quickly depreciate and deteriorate in value, until its disposition under the terms of the divorce decree, where the parties’ experience in operating the farm was approximately equal. Additionally, the chancellor was not manifestly wrong in awarding the husband use of the parties’ home until its disposition under the terms of the decree since the house was a necessary part of the operation of the chicken farm which was properly awarded to the husband. Martin v. Martin, 566 So. 2d 704, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 466 (Miss. 1990).

      <p>
       An award to a wife of “a lien on 1/3 of Defendant’s gross Federal Civil Service Retirement. Benefits as provided by Federal Law with a lien hereby being imposed thereon” was unclear and would be remanded for clarification, since it was not possible to discern, for example, whether the chancellor meant to impose a lien on 1/3 of the husband’s retirement benefits as security in the event he failed to meet his financial responsibilities as delineated in the divorce decree, or whether the chancellor meant to award the wife 1/3 of the husband’s retirement benefits. The chancellor should delineate in the divorce decree the specific terms, e.g., method of payment, which concern a former spouse’s civil service retirement benefits. Boykin v. Boykin, 565 So. 2d 1109, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 290 (Miss. 1990).

      <p>
       It was within the trial court’s discretion to deny the wife’s request to remain in the marital home, and to order that the house be sold and the proceeds divided, in spite of the wife’s argument that the denial of her use of the marital home was not in the best interest of the child in her custody, where the husband had custody of the parties’ other child who also had an interest in the family home.

      </p>
      <p>
       The Chancery Court seeks equity in a property division by reference to the economic contribution made by each spouse to the acquisition and maintenance of the property, and in doing so has no authority to disregard a spouse’s economic contributions just because they were not monetary in form.

      <p>
       In an action by an ex-wife to recover the fair rental value of land owned jointly by the parties but farmed exclusively by the ex-husband after the divorce, the trial court properly directed a verdict for the ex-husband where the separation agreement provided that he was to use the real property rent free for agricultural purposes and where the property settlement had not been subject to the approval of the chancery court, thereby remaining purely contractual in nature and not subject to judicial modification.

       No evidence of sexual abuse by the third party was presented at trial, but evidence was presented that the mother coached the child regarding the sexual abuse allegations, and all allegations of sexual abuse were found to be unsubstantiated; thus, the record supported the chancellor’s award of attorney fees. Garner v. Garner, — So.3d —, 2019 Miss. LEXIS 357 (Miss. Oct. 3, 2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       After finding a father’s claims of abuse and neglect by the mother were unsubstantiated, a chancellor never made a finding that the mother lacked the ability to pay attorney’s fees incurred litigating other matters in the child support dispute. Remand was therefore necessary because the chancellor abused the chancellor’s discretion by failing to separate the attorney’s fees the mother incurred defending against the father’s allegations of abuse and neglect from those fees incurred litigating other matters. Campbell v. Campbell, 269 So.3d 426, 2018 Miss. App. LEXIS 306 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 258 So.3d 285, 2018 Miss. LEXIS 523 (Miss. 2018).

   Although a chancery court properly awarded attorney’s fees to a father for defending against the mother’s baseless abuse allegations, Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c05s93-5-23" target="_self">93-5-23</a></cite>, and for the mother’s contemptuous conduct, the court erred in awarding the full amount of the attorney’s bill because at least part of the fees awarded were for custody modification proceedings, for which attorney’s fees were not normally awarded.

       <p>
   Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c05s93-5-23" target="_self">93-5-23</a></cite> provided that attorney’s fees are only appropriate where the child abuse allegations were without foundation, but in finding an award of attorney’s fees not warranted, the chancellor explained that the wife’s concerns were well-founded, because on the witness stand, the husband admitted to the underlying behavior investigated by the guardian ad litem. In short, the chancellor found ample foundation in the following: the husband’s admissions on the stand; his continuing practice of bathing his daughter even after the guardian ad litem’s first report; and his continuing to help the daughter bathe even after the court instructed both parents that the children were of sufficient age to bathe themselves. Jones v. Jones, 43 So.3d 465, 2009 Miss. App. LEXIS 946 (Miss. Ct. App. 2009), cert. denied, 49 So.3d 106, 2010 Miss. LEXIS 463 (Miss. 2010).

       Award of attorney’s fees for he wife was made in the chancellor’s ruling in the same paragraph and right after his discussion of the wife’s poor health and the disproportionate incomes of the parties. It was clear that those two factors were the deciding points in favor of the attorney’s fees award, and there was no error as to the chancellor’s ruling. White v. White, 913 So. 2d 323, 2005 Miss.

       Award of attorney fees to the husband in a divorce action was improper where the chancellor never made a finding that the wife had fabricated the sexual abuse charges involving their older son and had in some manner convinced the child to make the statements that he did; an award of some amount of fees incurred by the husband allocable to enforcing the visitation order might be supportable but a finding of contempt must first have been made. Gregory v. Gregory, 881 So. 2d 840, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 1082 (Miss. Ct. App. 2003), cert. denied, 883 So. 2d 1180, 2004 Miss. LEXIS 1333 (Miss. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Award of attorney’s fees to the wife was in error where the chancellor made no finding that the wife was unable to pay her own attorney; the wife was allocated over $300,000 in the divorce, and the fact that she did not have the money actually in the bank did not alter the value of her assets and thus her ability to pay. Franklin v. Franklin, 864 So. 2d 970, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 1113 (Miss. Ct. App. 2003).

      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
       When considering award of attorney fees in divorce proceeding, lower court must take into account sum sufficient to secure competent attorney; relative financial ability of parties; skill and standing of attorney employed; nature of case and novelty and difficulty of questions at issue; degree of responsibility involved in management of cause; time and labor required; usual and customary charge in community; and preclusion of other employment by attorney due to acceptance of case.

       If improper conduct of a party’s attorney unnecessarily increased the amount of attorney’s fees, the amount awarded should be decreased by the amount of any unnecessary fees, but any other consideration of the attorney’s improper behavior in the determination of attorney’s fees e.g., to sanction the client by awarding nominal attorney’s fees would be improper.

       It was error for a chancellor to award attorney’s fees to a wife based only on the wife’s statement as to the amount she owed her attorney, without supporting evidence such as a timesheet showing the number of attorney hours spent.

       Testimony of wife that she lacks money to pay legal fee of approximately $6,500 owed to her attorney and that husband has told her that he probably makes $100,000 or more a year, combined with evidence that wife has annual income of approximately $15,000 and has $6,000 cash in safety deposit box and that husband has submitted state income tax returns to effect that he has made less than $20,000 per year does not meet standards for accurate assessment of attorney fees.

      <p>
       Under agreed decree between husband and wife in divorce proceeding providing for sale of land and that “after paying all court cost and attorney’s fee, the proceeds to be equally divided between the complainant and defendant, giving to each a one-half interest,” trial court is without authority to change agreement and to refuse to allow one-half of fee for appellant’s attorney to be paid out of appellee’s part, and court’s refusal to allow attorney’s fee to be paid out of whole proceeds of sale is reversible error. Sutton v. Sutton, 208 Miss. 886, 45 So. 2d 736, 1950 Miss. LEXIS 311 (Miss. 1950).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where decree of divorce granted to a husband was reversed and the cause remanded for no other purpose than to permit chancellor to fix an allowance to the wife to cover attorney’s fees earned in the defense of the case, the chancellor could not deny any allowance on the theory that since the final decree of the divorce issue in the main case the wife had become able to pay the fees herself, since the question involved is whether the wife was able to pay while the proceedings for the divorce were in progress. Wilson v. Wilson, 202 Miss. 545, 32 So. 2d 688, 1947 Miss. LEXIS 314 (Miss. 1947).

      <p>
       Where, pursuant to an agreement, divorce case was remanded for determination whether wife should be allowed counsel fees, supreme court, acting upon analogy of Code 1942, § 1972, authorized chancery court to include in its decree an additional amount of 50 per cent for counsel services rendered in supreme court provided that that court finds that the wife is entitled to an allowance for counsel fees. Wilson v. Wilson, 198 Miss. 334, 22 So. 2d 161, 1945 Miss. LEXIS 202 (Miss.), modified, 198 Miss. 334, 23 So. 2d 303, 1945 Miss. LEXIS 203 (Miss. 1945).

      <p>
       The court is without authority, in the absence of statutory justification, to allow divorced wife counsel fees with which to contest former husband’s petition to modify divorce decree in reference to custody of the children of the parties, where by the divorce decree awarding wife alimony in gross sum husband was freed of his primary moral and legal obligation to contribute to wife’s support, and an allowance under such circumstances constitutes reversible error.

      </p>
      <p>
       On appeal by a husband from a decree in a suit for divorce, directing him to pay alimony pendente lite and counsel fees to the wife, the supreme court will, on proper application, award the wife a reasonable solicitor’s fee for resisting the appeal.

       An allowance pendente lite should not be on the basis of compensation for the services of counsel in conducting the suit to an end. Allowance should be made for her litigation from time to time, as the cause progresses, and the allowances of counsel fees for the wife should be made to her, and not to her counsel direct. Parker v.

       Chancellor did not abuse his discretion in awarding the wife half of her attorney’s fees where the husband had a substantial income and the wife had no income; the chancellor found that the wife had the ability to contribute toward the costs of her representation and held that the husband should only be obligated to pay one-half of the wife’s legal expenses.

       In a divorce case, a chancery court did not err by awarding a former wife $7,000 in attorney fees due to an inability to pay, it was not error to refuse to force the elderly wife to sell her mineral interests to pay her fees since this was her source of monthly income, and moreover she would have been unable to pay for a home equity loan; however, the wife cited no authority for her entitlement to attorney fees for defending an appeal of the case.

       Although trial court allowed wife $500 for her defense of husband’s original bill seeking divorce, she should have also been allowed her reasonable counsel fees in connection with prosecuting her cross bill against her husband, where it appeared that the husband was earning a net annual income which was many times in excess of what the wife was earning, and the wife was not able to work full time during the last year of their living together.

       Although cross actions for divorce resulted in a decree for the husband on grounds of his wife’s adultery and drunkenness, she should not be denied a remedy merely because of lack of funds when her attempt was in good faith, and where the husband was financially able to pay the same a reasonable attorney’s fee was allowed the wife for services performed in her behalf both at the trial and on appeal.

       The chancellor was within his discretion to award reasonable attorney fees to the husband for defending against sexual abuse allegations by the wife, notwithstanding the wife’s argument that custody was not at issue because the parties had stipulated to the custody of their child as custody had been at issue for almost three years prior to the stipulation, and the wife had alleged that the husband was guilty of abuse and neglect of the child.

       A chancellor did not err in awarding attorney’s fees to a wife, even though she did not establish her inability to pay the fees, where the fees were awarded for an ancillary suit to have the husband’s conveyance of the marital home to his sister and niece set aside; the chancellor did not “reward” the wife by his decision, but reimbursed her the extra legal costs incurred as a result of the husband’s actions.

      </p>
      <p>
       An award to a wife of only $2,500 in attorney’s fees was an abuse of discretion where her attorney’s fees and expenses totalled $8,393.75, she testified that she was unable to pay the fees and that the services listed on her attorney’s itemization were actually rendered, her attorney testified that the work was reasonably required and necessary, the husband had the ability to pay the fees, and the award was based on the chancellor’s finding that the case could have been concluded in much less time so that the total amount of attorney’s fees was “grossly excessive” but he found that both parties’ attorneys were equally at fault in causing a portion of the excessive time; the issue would be reversed and remanded to allow the wife’s attorney to present evidence of the only McKee factor not satisfied the preclusion of other employment as a result of the divorce case.

       A chancellor abused his discretion by making an award of attorneys fees to a wife where he made no finding of the wife’s inability to pay, determining only that the fees were reasonable in light of the fact “that the litigation has been protracted and difficult.” Bennett v.

       A chancellor abused his discretion in not awarding a wife attorney’s fees where the husband had been found in willful contempt for failing to pay child support and other obligations, and the husband had inflicted substantial injury on his wife and children by evading and ignoring many prior judgments ordering him to provide support. Morreale v. Morreale, 646 So. 2d 1264, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 198 (Miss.), modified, in part, 646 So. 2d 1264, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 634 (Miss. 1994).

       A chancellor did not abuse her discretion in ordering a husband to pay his wife $15,000 as a partial attorney’s fee, where the wife’s attorney’s fees totalled $18,957, the husband’s attorney stipulated that the amount was reasonable, the wife testified that she was unable to pay the fees, and much of the fees resulted from the husband’s actions in failing to obey the court’s orders and refusing to provide requested discovery.

      <p>
       In a proceeding for modification of a father’s child support obligation, the chancellor erred in refusing to award attorney’s fees to the mother, since the father had no basis on which to bring a claim that he was entitled to a reduction of his monthly child support obligation where all of the changes asserted by the father either occurred prior to his signing of the initial child support agreement or were changes which should have been reasonably anticipated by him at the time he signed the agreement.

       An award of attorney’s fees to a wife in the amount of $4,000 was not excessive where the wife’s attorney requested a fee of $5,400 for 54 hours of work at a rate of $100 per hour, the attorney explained that he reviewed the case file for purposes of trial preparation and other related matters, and the attorney meticulously detailed the events which transpired between the date the case was accepted to the date of the hearing. However, the wife’s request for additional attorney’s fees as a result of the husband’s appeal was denied since the $4,000 awarded by the chancellor appeared to be sufficient to cover the costs of the appeal.

       In a case where a divorce was granted to a wife based on a husband’s habitual drunkenness, a wife’s request for attorney’s fees and costs was properly denied because the parties made almost the same amount; moreover, the wife was unable to prove that she had to take out a loan to pay for such.

       A chancellor erred in awarding a husband more than $25,000 in attorney’s fees after awarding him over $93,000 worth of contested property, since the husband was more than able to pay both his attorney’s fees and court costs out of the proceeds from the property award. Chamblee v. Chamblee, 637 So. 2d 850, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 285 (Miss. 1994).

       Although awarding attorney’s fees in a divorce action is entrusted to the discretion of the chancellor, an award of attorney’s fees to a former wife in an action for modification of child custody brought by her former husband, was error where there was no evidence offered to show that the wife was unable to pay, and the judge did not make a finding that the husband pursued his litigation merely to harass the wife. Jones v. Starr, 586 So. 2d 788, 1991 Miss. LEXIS 755 (Miss. 1991).
      </p>

       A wife was not entitled to an award of attorney’s fees and court costs where the husband and the wife were equally vested with the property, except for a 101-acre tract of land in which the wife had a lesser interest, the parties’ respective incomes and ability to gain income were practically the same, and the wife did not attempt to demonstrate her inability to pay for attorney’s fees.

      </p>
      <p>
       A mother was not automatically entitled to reasonable attorney’s fees merely because she successfully defeated the father’s efforts to reduce his child support obligation. The general rule that a father who seeks alteration of his child support liability to the mother without justification should pay for the mother’s attorney’s fees does not hold where the equities are otherwise. Thus, a court was within its authority when it held that the mother was not entitled to an award of attorney’s fees where there had been a large volume of claims and counterclaims and intervening discovery disputes, so that the equities differed and were relatively balanced. Additionally, the mother possessed the ability to earn sufficient income to pay reasonable attorney’s fees, and much of the expense that the mother’s attorneys incurred in litigating the case was unreasonable.

       Chancellor assessed all guardian ad litem (GAL) costs against the mother, but remand was necessary; while the third party was entitled to those GAL costs incurred as a result of the unsubstantiated abuse allegations, the record was unclear what portion of the total amount of costs awarded was actually incurred by the GAL in investigating those allegations. Garner v. Garner, — So.3d —, 2019 Miss. LEXIS 357 (Miss. Oct. 3, 2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a proceeding for modification of visitation in which the Department of Human Services joined the action and supported the father, the department was properly required to pay guardian ad litem fees, including those incurred after the date that the department was made a passive litigant in the case; notwithstanding the department’s passive role, it previously became a litigant when it adopted the position of the father and alleged child abuse, and taking a passive role in the litigation did not change its status as a party to the case. Mississippi Dep't of Human Servs. v. Murr, 797 So. 2d 818, 2000 Miss. LEXIS 184 (Miss. 2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a proceeding for modification of visitation in which the Department of Human Services joined the action and supported the father and the department was then required to pay guardian ad litem fees, the court had the authority to require the parents to reimburse the department for such fees by making periodic payments, notwithstanding the department’s argument that such an “installment plan” was impermissible and amounted to an interest-free loan to the parents. Mississippi Dep't of Human Servs. v. Murr, 797 So. 2d 818, 2000 Miss. LEXIS 184 (Miss. 2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where each parent had been accused of some form of abuse by the other, the chancellor properly ordered the parents to split the fees of the guardian ad litem. Foster v. Foster, 788 So. 2d 779, 2000 Miss. App. LEXIS 472 (Miss. Ct. App. 2000).

   Award of custody to a father was proper because the trial court found that the Albright factors of the age, health, and sex of the child, parenting skills, physical and mental health and age of the parents, moral fitness of the parents, and stability of the home environment and employment favored the father and only the continuity of care factor favored the mother; nothing showed that the trial court was manifestly wrong in applying the Albright factors or in determining the child’s best interest. Under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c05s93-5-24ol17" target="_self">93-5-24(7)</a></cite>, awarding custody to the mother was no longer presumed to be in the child’s best interest. Crabb v. Bowden, 110 So.3d 346, 2013 Miss. App. LEXIS 96 (Miss. Ct. App. 2013).
      </p>
      <p>
       Order awarding custody to a mother, in a paternity case brought by the father, was proper because the chancellor issued a written opinion containing a discussion of each Albright factor, as well as an overall analysis regarding the child’s best interest, and there was no basis to overturn the decision; among other things, there was simply no competent evidence that the child’s health would have been better served in the father’s custody, even the father acknowledged that the child spent more time with the mother, and both parties demonstrated that they were willing and able to care for the child. Even if the appellate court disagreed with the chancellor on some of the individual factors, it would not substitute its judgment for his as to the child’s best interest, absent a showing of a manifest abuse of discretion, and that burden was nearly insurmountable in close cases. Solangi v. Croney, 118 So.3d 173, 2013 Miss. App. LEXIS 100 (Miss. Ct. App. 2013).
      </p>
      <p>
       In evaluating custody, the trial court focused on the father’s desire to have custody of the child, but the undisputed record revealed that for two and a half years, the father had no contact with the child; further, the father provided no financial support, nor did he send any birthday or Christmas cards or gifts to the child. As a matter of law the father’s actions (or lack thereof) during the two and a half years before the mother’s death constituted desertion; because the evidence of desertion was clear, the trial court erred in awarding custody to the natural father without an on-the-record analysis of the child’s best interests utilizing the Albright factors. Pendleton v. Leverock (In re Marriage of Leverock), 23 So.3d 424, 2009 Miss. LEXIS 599 (Miss. 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancery court abused its discretion in reducing a mother’s visitation because the primary concern in determining visitation was to be the best interests of the children and the chancery court’s decision appeared to be punishment for the disruptive behavior of the mother and her family in court and for continuing to discuss the legal proceedings with the children after the chancellor had repeatedly admonished the mother to refrain from doing so. Wilburn v. Wilburn, 991 So. 2d 1185, 2008 Miss. LEXIS 487 (Miss. 2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       In reviewing the denial of a mother’s motion for modification of a custody award, the appellate court rejected the mother’s argument that, although the couple’s property settlement agreement provided that the father would have primary physical custody, the couple had actually agreed to shared custody and that the father’s breach of that agreement warranted a change in custody because it would constitute a fraud upon the court for parties to present a property settlement agreement that was incorporated into the final decree while actually intended to abide by a contradictory private contract; because such a circumstance would clearly be against public policy, the court declined to enforce the secret contract and held that the chancery court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to modify custody. Wilburn v. Wilburn, 991 So. 2d 1185, 2008 Miss. LEXIS 487 (Miss. 2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancery court properly denied a mother’s petition for modification of child custody because the chancellor was in the best position to assess the witnesses, did not believe a mother’s assertions of sexual abuse, and did believe a father’s explanations with regard to the allegations. The father explained that their daughter had a diaper rash requiring him to put Desitin on the affected area and that the daughter was bitten while playing at school with other children. Lorenz v. Strait, 987 So. 2d 427, 2008 Miss. LEXIS 359 (Miss. 2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court did not err by awarding the wife sole legal and physical custody where the trial court determined that it was not in the best interests of the children to be shuttled back and forth between the two households. Henderson v. Henderson, 952 So. 2d 273, 2006 Miss. App. LEXIS 869 (Miss. Ct. App. 2006), cert. denied, 951 So. 2d 563, 2007 Miss. LEXIS 165 (Miss. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a temporary child custody order remained uncontested for three years, it acquired incidents of permanency, necessitating that it be treated as permanent for the purpose of assigning the burden of proof; the father was granted permanent physical custody where the mother failed to prove a material change in circumstances since the date of the temporary order. Swartzfager v. Derrick, 942 So. 2d 255, 2006 Miss. App. LEXIS 823 (Miss. Ct. App. 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   None of the purported incidents between the child’s parents amounted to family violence, and even if they had, Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c05s93-5-24ol19" target="_self">93-5-24(9)</a></cite> gave the chancellor the discretion to grant the father custody of the child because the father would not continue to perpetrate family violence. Cockrell v. Watkins, 936 So. 2d 970, 2006 Miss. App. LEXIS 611 (Miss. Ct. App. 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although chancellor found that the following factors were neutral and did not weigh in favor of either parent: (1) the age of the child; (2) the health and sex of the child; (3) the age, physical, and mental health of the parents, and the moral fitness of the parents; and (4) the emotional ties of parent and child, the chancellor concluded that factors such as the best parenting skills, willingness and capacity to provide primary child care, employment responsibilities, and the child’s home, school, and community records all favored the father; additionally, factors such as the stability of the home environment and employment of each parent also tilted in the father’s favor. Thus, after thoroughly weighing the evidence and each Albright factor, the chancellor did not err in awarding physical custody of the child to the father. C.W.L. v. R.A., 919 So. 2d 267, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 438 (Miss. Ct. App. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancery court erred in failing to identify a specific material change in circumstance in the custodial home. Without a finding of such a material change or a finding that an actual custodial arrangement was detrimental to the well-being of a child, child custody could not be modified; the appellate court declined to apply a totality of the circumstances standard, as the case at bar did not represent one of the rare situations that said standard was intended to address (the latter standard was used where a custodial parent continued her drug use, a fact known when the parent was awarded custody, but conditions failed to improve). Beasley v. Beasley, 913 So. 2d 358, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 271 (Miss. Ct. App. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Physical custody of an 18-month-old child was properly awarded to the husband in a divorce case because the trial court examined all of the applicable factors before determining that the father had the best parenting skills, his employment was more flexible, he provided more continuous care, and the sex of the child favored custody by the father; although the tender years doctrine slightly favored the mother, this was not a ground for reversal, and there was no rule that the best interest of the child was served by keeping siblings together. Copeland v. Copeland, 904 So. 2d 1066, 2004 Miss. LEXIS 1490 (Miss. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Denial of custody to a natural parent in favor of a third party should be granted only when there is a clear showing that the natural parent has relinquished his parental rights, that he has no meaningful relationship with his children, or that the parent’s conduct is clearly detrimental to his children. Brown v. Wiley (In re Brown), 902 So. 2d 604, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 1082 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004), cert. denied, 901 So. 2d 1273, 2005 Miss. LEXIS 337 (Miss. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a child custody case, the failure to stay current on child support goes to whether a natural parent has abandoned his child and cannot be a factor in determining whether a natural parent is otherwise unfit. Brown v. Wiley (In re Brown), 902 So. 2d 604, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 1082 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004), cert. denied, 901 So. 2d 1273, 2005 Miss. LEXIS 337 (Miss. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Miss. Code Ann. [former] §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c15s93-15-103ol13" target="_self">93-15-103(3)</a></cite>, which lists the grounds for termination of parental rights, is helpful in selecting the factors a court should consider in deciding whether a natural parent is otherwise unfit for taking care of his children. Brown v. Wiley (In re Brown), 902 So. 2d 604, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 1082 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004), cert. denied, 901 So. 2d 1273, 2005 Miss. LEXIS 337 (Miss. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancellor properly determined that there had been a material change in circumstances that adversely affected the child’s well-being based on the following findings: (1) the child had moved at least 10 times in the four years since the child’s parents had separated; (2) the child had failed first grade and was doing poorly academically; (3) the child was exposed to pornographic tapes while in the custody of the mother; (4) the mother’s new job schedule caused problems as to the child’s care; and (5) the mother’s frequent relationships with different men was not healthy for the child. Thus, where the record showed that the father’s employment was more conducive to parenting responsibilities and that the father would provide the child with a more stable home environment, modification of physical custody was proper. Brown v. White, 875 So. 2d 1116, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 597 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Award of custody to the father was improper where he had a hectic work schedule, his mother took care of the children more than he did, and the child old enough to express a preference stated that she wanted to live with her mother. Watts v. Watts, 854 So. 2d 11, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 143 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 859 So. 2d 392, 2003 Miss. LEXIS 378 (Miss. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       In matters concerning child custody, reviewing court will not reverse Chancery Court’s factual findings, be they of ultimate fact or of evidentiary fact, where there is substantial evidence in the record supporting these findings of fact. Touchstone v. Touchstone, 682 So. 2d 374, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 534 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancellor’s findings regarding child custody will not be disturbed when supported by substantial evidence unless the chancellor abused his discretion, was manifestly wrong or clearly erroneous or applied an erroneous legal standard. Touchstone v. Touchstone, 682 So. 2d 374, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 534 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       In all child custody cases, polestar consideration is the best interest of the child. Touchstone v. Touchstone, 682 So. 2d 374, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 534 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Custody may be modified where environment provided by the custodial parent is found to be adverse to the child’s best interest and circumstances of the noncustodial parent have changed such that he or she is able to provide an environment more suitable than that of the custodial parent. Touchstone v. Touchstone, 682 So. 2d 374, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 534 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Isolated incident, e.g., an unwarranted striking of a child, does not in and of itself justify a change of custody; rather, it must be the overall circumstances in which a child lives, likely to remain unchanged in the foreseeable future and adversely impacting a child, to warrant change of custody. Touchstone v. Touchstone, 682 So. 2d 374, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 534 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Change in circumstances warranting modification of custody is one in overall living conditions in which child is found. Riley v. Doerner, 677 So. 2d 740, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 287 (Miss. 1996).

       When environment provided by custodial parent is found to be adverse to child’s best interest, and circumstances of noncustodial parent have changed such that he or she is able to provide an environment more suitable than that of custodial parent, Chancellor may modify custody accordingly.

       Chancellor did not abuse the chancellor’s discretion in finding that a wife was a perpetrator of domestic violence because, according to a paternal grandparent, the husband said that the wife threw an aerosol can at the husband’s head, which drew blood, and stated that it was the wife’s “missile of choice,” indicating that it had happened often. Furthermore, the chancellor did not err in awarding only supervised discretionary visitation to the parents, even though the husband denied the statements at trial. Randallson v.

       Chancellor did not erroneously overlook the issue of family violence in awarding primary physical custody of a minor child to a parent, because, despite an altercation between the parent and another, older child, neither parent had a history of perpetuating family violence on any household member and neither parent was responsible for an incident of family violence that resulted in serious bodily injury.

       Chancery court erred in denying a father visitation because it did did not consider whether adequate provisions could be made that would allow the father to have visitation with the daughter; the chancery court did not consider whether any of the restrictions would be adequate for the safety of the daughter and the mother if visitation was allowed.

       Decision to award the mother custody was supported by the evidence because the father offered no proof of counseling or participation in a parenting program or proof that he had complied with any of the factors in the statute that would entitle him to a finding that he rebutted the presumption that it was detrimental to the daughter and not in her best interest to be placed in sole custody, joint legal, or joint physical custody of a parent who had a history of perpetrating family violence.

       <p>
   Chancellor concluded that the testimony of the parties at most documented general yelling and screaming which, on a few occasions, resulted in slapping and perhaps one incident of choking, but there was no serious or even moderate injuries resulting from the same; thus, the chancellor failed to find the existence of a pattern of family violence pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c05s93-5-24ol19ai" target="_self">93-5-24(9)(a)(i)</a></cite>, which provided for custody restrictions on parents with a history of perpetrating family violence.

       In a father’s action seeking a change in child custody from the mother to the father, evidence of the father’s treatment of the mother and the child prior to the parties’ divorce was manifestly material to the issue of the fitness of the father to have custody of the child, where the divorce decree indicated that the court had found merit to the mother’s charges of habitual cruel and inhuman treatment.

       Based on the evidence before the chancellor at the time of the divorce, the chancellor did not abuse her discretion in ordering the husband to bear the transportation costs for visitation because, as to the interference with his visitation rights, the husband merely asserted that bearing the transportation costs would pose a financial strain; and, although the husband might eventually be able to establish an undue financial burden or interference with his visitation rights, he could do so in a modification proceeding at a later date.

      </p>
      <p>
       Although the chancellor did not alter visitation to account for the distance between the wife’s place of residence and the husband’s place of residence, the chancellor enjoyed wide discretion in setting visitation and was not required to do so; thus, the husband failed to show the visitation arrangement compromised his relationship with his children or undermined the best interests of the children. Branch v. Branch, 174 So.3d 932, 2015 Miss. App. LEXIS 470 (Miss. Ct. App. 2015).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the mother had a record of hostility toward the father and interfered with his court ordered visitation, the chancellor did not err by determining that a change in custody from the mother to the father was in the best interest of the child even though the guardian ad litem recommended that the child continue to live with the mother. The mother’s allegations of sexual abuse by the father were unsubstantiated. Potter v. Greene, 973 So. 2d 291, 2008 Miss. App. LEXIS 30 (Miss. Ct. App. 2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       When a non-custodial parent has unsupervised visitation rights, the custodial parent has no right to interfere with the non-custodial parent’s visitation with his or her children. Thus, a mother’s wishes that her children not fly in a private plane was not sufficient to deny the father the right to provide flying lessons or to fly his children in his private airplane during his visitation hours, where there was no evidence that flying would endanger the children’s lives or that the children were opposed to flying or taking flying lessons.

       Where a mother and father agreed to joint physical and legal custody of their daughter but the father moved for a modification of the custody arrangement based upon a change in circumstances after the mother moved 80 miles away, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in granting the father’s motion because shuttling the child between the parents’ respective homes each week caused instability and because the girl was about to begin attending school, which meant that she could not split every week between her parents’ homes.

      <p>
       Chancellor erred in finding a material change in circumstances based on the move by the non-custodial parent, as relocation of either parent was insufficient grounds for modification of child custody and the material change in circumstances had to be unforeseeable at the time of the original decree and the husband’s reassignment by the U.S. Navy was eminently foreseeable; in addition, the erroneous admission of a social worker’s opinion (because if failed to meet the requirements of Miss. R. Evid. 702) prejudiced the wife and constituted an abuse of discretion. Giannaris v. Giannaris, 960 So. 2d 462, 2007 Miss. LEXIS 399 (Miss. 2007).

       Order awarding legal and physical custody of two children to their father was upheld where the chancellor properly made findings regarding the Albright factors; while the chancellor might have emphasized, to some degree, the mother’s moving to Iowa, allegedly to follow a convict boyfriend, that was not the sole reason he granted custody to the father.

       Modification of a child custody order to the father was affirmed because as the mother had moved to another state and as the trial court found it was in the child’s best interest for primary custody to be granted to her father, the appellate court could not state that the finding was clearly erroneous.

       A court order requiring a custodial mother to obtain court approval before she could move her residence was erroneous and unenforceable. It is an incident of custody that the parent having physical custody provide a residence for the child where he or she thinks is appropriate; the location of this residence is a matter committed to the discretion of the custodial parent in the first instance. A court may only intervene where there has been a material change in circumstances which adversely affect the child and it is shown that the best interests of the child require a modification of custody; a change of residence is not per se a change of circumstance.

   A child custody agreement which provides that the child or children must until majority reside in a particular community, is contrary to the best interests of the children and should not be approved by the court. Such agreements that have been approved are unenforceable. It is presumptuous for anyone, court or otherwise, to declare as an absolute that it is in the best interest of a young child that he or she spend his or her entire minority in a single community. Thus, courts may not require that children be reared in a single community come what may, and divorcing parents may not make such agreements which courts are obligated to enforce. Chancery courts must refuse to approve any child custody agreement presented under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c05s93-5-2" target="_self">93-5-2</a></cite> or otherwise which mandates, without exception, that children be raised in a given community.

       Chancellor did not err in awarding primary physical custody of the two minor children to the ex-wife as the ex-husband showed a lack of consideration for the children’s best interests because the wife’s former boyfriend was no longer in the picture; the husband denied the wife access to the children for nearly three months, with no court order; and the husband failed to take the younger child to the doctor for four days despite a high fever.

       Chancellor apparently assigned slightly greater weight to a child’s sex than to the child’s age. Furthermore, the chancellor did not abuse its discretion by finding that this factor, as a whole, slightly favored the father. Barbaro v. Smith, — So.3d —, 2019 Miss. App. LEXIS 322 (Miss. Ct. App. July 16, 2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancellor properly awarded physical custody of the parties’ child to the mother because the chancellor applied and weighed the appropriate factors in the case law and made appropriate findings of fact with support in the evidence. Although the chancellor made statements prior to trial, which seemed to reflect an outdated view of the tender years doctrine, the father’s attorney provided the court with case law on the issue, the chancellor corrected himself, and the chancellor’s bench ruling and the final judgment correctly applied the law. Harden v. Scarborough, 240 So.3d 1246, 2018 Miss. App. LEXIS 145 (Miss. Ct. App. 2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancery court properly awarded custody of the parties’ children to the mother because, among other things, the chancellor recited the relevant facts and rendered a rational decision on the continuity of care factor, even if the custody situation prior to trial was the result of an unfair ruling from another court, the Mississippi chancery court entered an order giving the mother temporary custody more than a year prior to trial, and the chancellor assigned great weight to the facts that the mother had the better parenting skills and that the respective employment situations favored the mother, as a school teacher, over the father, a truck driver.

      </p>
      <p>
       Chancery court did not err in awarding the wife sole legal custody of the children based on the factors of the children’s age, health, and sex; continuity of care; parenting skills; employment; moral fitness; the children’s home, school, and community record; and the stability of the home environment. Branch v. Branch, 174 So.3d 932, 2015 Miss. App. LEXIS 470 (Miss. Ct. App. 2015).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancellor erred by awarding a maternal grandmother custody of a child because the chancellor failed to apply the legal presumption that it was in the child’s best interest for her father to have custody; the chancellor treated the particular custody battle as a modification, failing to recognize that the grandmother had no right to custody as against the father. Wilson v. Davis, 111 So.3d 1280, 2013 Miss. App. LEXIS 222 (Miss. Ct. App. 2013), aff'd in part and rev'd in part, 181 So.3d 991, 2016 Miss. LEXIS 4 (Miss. 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because the chancery court should have considered the natural-parent presumption and whether a father had lost the benefit of the presumption, either through desertion or some other conduct that made him unfit as a parent, before determining who should have custody of the child, it erred in awarding custody to the child’s maternal grandmother. Brown v. Hargrave (In re Brown), 66 So.3d 726, 2011 Miss. App. LEXIS 393 (Miss. Ct. App. 2011).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Given the evidence presented, the court could not conclude that the chancellor abused his discretion, was manifestly wrong, clearly erroneous or applied an erroneous legal standard when he modified the custodial agreement pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c05s93-5-24" target="_self">93-5-24</a></cite> and ruled that the children’s best interests were served by granting the father sole physical custody with the mother having liberal rights of visitation.

      </p>
      <p>
       Chancellor’s judgment awarding the father primary physical custody of the three minor children was affirmed because: (1) the record reflected that the chancellor specifically considered the potential effect that the separation of the mother’s child from a prior relationship from the other children might have had on the children, but she determined it did not outweigh the other factors favoring the father; (2) the chancellor did not err when she failed to provide the mother with the tender-years advantage with respect to the five-year old boy because she did specifically acknowledge the tender-years doctrine and cited case law addressing its diminished application; and (3) the chancellor’s finding that the stability of home environment factor favored the father was supported by credible evidence that the father had maintained a stable routine and ensured the children were cared for by his mother while he was at work. Montgomery v. Montgomery, 20 So.3d 39, 2009 Miss. App. LEXIS 663 (Miss. Ct. App. 2009).

      <p>
       Where a mother and father agreed to joint physical and legal custody of their daughter but the father moved for a modification of the custody arrangement based upon a change in circumstances after the mother moved 80 miles away, the trial court did not err in finding that the Albright mental health factor weighed in favor of the father because testimony from the mother’s mother and sister established that the mother went through a stage where she could not take care of herself and the mother testified that she was seeing a psychiatrist and was taking medication for depression, bi-polar disorder, and anxiety. Pearson v. Pearson, 11 So.3d 178, 2009 Miss. App. LEXIS 308 (Miss. Ct. App. 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a child custody case, a father was properly awarded custody because several of the best interest of the child factors under Albright v. Albright, 437 So. 2d 1003 (Miss. 1983), favored him; even if a mother exhibited good parenting skills, her use of the Internet to meet people was a cause for concern. Moreover, the father had the more stable environment, the moral fitness factor favored him, and the child would have been uprooted if the mother had custody. Jones v. Jones, 19 So.3d 775, 2009 Miss. App. LEXIS 172 (Miss. Ct. App. 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Chancellor did not commit reversible error by not following the recommendation of the child’s guardian ad litem because she found that the guardian ad litem considered only the isolated incident in which the father physically harmed the child and not all of the times the child witnessed the abuse of her mother and because the guardian failed to recognize Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c05s93-5-24ol19" target="_self">93-5-24(9)</a></cite>. J.P. v. S.V.B., 987 So. 2d 975, 2008 Miss. LEXIS 394 (Miss. 2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       Husband was properly awarded child custody under the Albright factors because the chancery court considered the husband’s unemployment, the husband’s alleged attack on the wife, the daycare facility owned by the husband’s family, and the wife’s violent live-in boyfriend; the wife was not impermissibly sanctioned for adultery. Weeks v. Weeks (In re Dissolution of Marriage of Weeks), 989 So. 2d 408, 2008 Miss. App. LEXIS 271 (Miss. Ct. App. 2008).

Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c05s93-5-24ol19" target="_self">93-5-24(9)</a></cite> in failing to restrict a father to supervised visitation with his child where the chancellor determined appropriate precautions; the chancellor ordered that visitation exchanges take place at the county sheriff’s department to prevent future outbursts between the parents. Holliday v. Stockman, 969 So. 2d 136, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 758 (Miss. Ct. App. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancellor stated that the mother’s mental health was the overriding consideration for the chancery court’s decision to award primary custody of the parents’ two children to the father; there was substantial evidence supporting the chancellor’s finding that the father had a better capacity to care for the children than did the mother due to the mother’s mental and emotional condition because, inter alia: (1) she suffered from stress and anxiety that prompted her to pull out her own hair; (2) the father and his parents testified that when the mother became upset she frequently lost control and that the loss of control was sometimes directed against the children; (3) the paternal grandmother testified that the mother used excessive force when spanking the children; (4) the mother once became so frustrated about having to redo a room in a new house they were building that she picked up pieces of drywall and started hitting herself over the head with them; (5) the guardian ad litem interviewed the police officers who had arrested the mother for domestic violence/simple assault against the father and the eldest son and they described the mother as being completely out of control; and (5) the officers who had been to the parents’ home on prior occasions reported the same bizarre behavior and expressed concern for the mother’s own safety and the children’s safety. Gilliland v. Gilliland, 969 So. 2d 56, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 195 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 968 So. 2d 948, 2007 Miss. LEXIS 656 (Miss. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancellor harbored serious concerns about the mother’s treatment of the children when in her custody where the chancellor found that the mother’s past treatment of the children neared physical and mental child abuse and that her overzealousness had adversely affected the children; also, the mother’s mental health was the overriding consideration for the court’s decision to award primary custody of both children to the father, and thus the chancellor acted within his discretion in finding that a more limited visitation schedule suited the best interests of the children. Gilliland v. Gilliland, 969 So. 2d 56, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 195 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 968 So. 2d 948, 2007 Miss. LEXIS 656 (Miss. 2007).

   Chancery court properly found material change in circumstances adversely impacting a child for custody modification under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c05s93-5-24" target="_self">93-5-24</a></cite> because mother’s drug addiction transpired after original custody arrangement and possibility of future relapse, along with current depression, could be considered in determining child’s best interest. McSwain v. McSwain, 943 So. 2d 1288, 2006 Miss. LEXIS 691 (Miss. 2006).

       <p>
   Former wife was properly awarded physical and legal custody of two minor children because the trial court analyzed the appropriate factors in determining the best interest of the children under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c05s93-5-24" target="_self">93-5-24</a></cite>; the age, sex, health, and continuity of care were the only factors that favored the wife. Henderson v. Henderson, 952 So. 2d 273, 2006 Miss. App. LEXIS 869 (Miss. Ct. App. 2006), cert. denied, 951 So. 2d 563, 2007 Miss. LEXIS 165 (Miss. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Mother’s argument that as a result of her daughter’s sex and the fact that the mother had custody of her daughter in the past the trial court should have found in her favor under the age, health, and sex of child factor when considering the father’s motion for a modification of custody was rejected because under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c05s93-5-24" target="_self">93-5-24</a></cite>, there was no presumption that the best interests of a child were furthered by awarding custody to a mother.

      </p>
      <p>
       Father’s infrequent physical visits with his children could not be used as a factor in deciding that he was otherwise unfit to care for his children because (1) he made frequent telephone calls to his children; and (2) he was a bus driver who had difficulty earning a decent income and who was physically far away from his children, and he simply did not have the time or money to make frequent visits from Pennsylvania to Mississippi. Brown v. Wiley (In re Brown), 902 So. 2d 604, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 1082 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004), cert. denied, 901 So. 2d 1273, 2005 Miss. LEXIS 337 (Miss. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       In divorce proceedings, a chancellor did not err in finding that the health of the parties’ children favored neither parent where the evidence showed that the former husband was present for all of one child’s surgeries and had administered medication to the child since the child was placed primarily with the husband, even though the former wife had administered the medication before the change in placement. Pulliam v. Smith, 872 So. 2d 790, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 428 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       In divorce proceedings, a chancellor did not err in finding that the parenting skills factor favored neither party because even though the former wife was not employed full time and the former husband was employed as a teacher, the children would have been with the wife in the summer and the husband had evidenced adequate after-school care and had a job that did not require overnight travel. Pulliam v. Smith, 872 So. 2d 790, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 428 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       In divorce proceedings, a chancellor did not err in finding that the mental health of the parents favored a former husband based on a psychological assessment indicating that the former wife was more unstable than the husband, where the wife had committed fraud toward the trial court and the husband by negotiating a settlement as to visitation and custody while not disclosing her plans to immediately remarry and relocate Pulliam v. Smith, 872 So. 2d 790, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 428 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       In divorce proceedings, a chancellor did not err in finding that the emotional tie of the parent and the children factor favored neither party, even though the former husband had not visited the children while they visited the former wife after her relocation to another state. Pulliam v. Smith, 872 So. 2d 790, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 428 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       In divorce proceedings, a chancellor did not err in finding that the moral fitness of the parents favored the former husband where the chancellor based the finding on the fact that the mother had negotiated a settlement regarding custody and weekly visitation without disclosing her plans to immediately remarry and relocate out of state. Pulliam v. Smith, 872 So. 2d 790, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 428 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       In divorce proceedings, a chancellor did not err in finding that the home and school community slightly favored a former husband, even though the husband did not have a lease on the house he was renting, where the house in question had been the former marital residence. Pulliam v. Smith, 872 So. 2d 790, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 428 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancellor incorrectly applied the law in finding that the father was an unfit parent because the chancellor denied custody to the father due to his inability to pay his child support in full and his inability to visit his children on a regular basis, but, in doing so, the chancellor was, in effect, denying the father custody on the grounds of abandonment while simultaneously holding that the father had not abandoned his children. Additionally, the chancellor’s holding that the father was not emotionally available for his children when their mother died was unsupported by the record; therefore, the trial court’s judgment denying the father custody and awarding custody of the children to their maternal grandmother was erroneous. Brown v. Wiley (In re Brown), 902 So. 2d 604, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 1082 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004), cert. denied, 901 So. 2d 1273, 2005 Miss. LEXIS 337 (Miss. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       In divorce proceedings, a chancellor did not err in finding that the stability of home and employment slightly favored a former husband where the former wife had remarried upon little consideration immediately upon receiving a divorce and the husband had stable employment in the community. Pulliam v. Smith, 872 So. 2d 790, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 428 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Neither nasty exchanges between former spouses when picking up or dropping off child for visitation, nor former wife’s implication that former husband had sexually abused child warranted change in custody; although child was subjected to some gross unpleasantries between his parents, record did not remotely suggest that these episodes were characteristic of the overall circumstances in which he lived. Touchstone v. Touchstone, 682 So. 2d 374, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 534 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court did not abuse its discretion by excluding, in custody modification proceeding, arguably repetitive testimony concerning incident in which mother bit another woman on the arm. Touchstone v. Touchstone, 682 So. 2d 374, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 534 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence that home of custodial parent is site of dangerous and illegal behavior, such as drug use, may be sufficient to justify a modification of custody, even without a specific finding that environment has adversely affected child’s welfare. Riley v. Doerner, 677 So. 2d 740, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 287 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Once Chancellor determined that mother’s home was site of illegal drug use, as well as other behavior adverse to child’s welfare, and determined that father’s circumstances had improved such that he was able to provide a good home for child, it was within his discretion to transfer custody from mother to father, despite fact that Chancellor could not discern any negative effect on child caused by mother’s home environment. Riley v. Doerner, 677 So. 2d 740, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 287 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       A chancellor did not err in awarding permanent primary child custody to the mother, even though she had committed adultery and temporary custody had been awarded to the father, where the chancellor found that the mother had greater willingness and capacity to learn proper parenting skills, the father’s psychological profile was potentially detrimental to the children, and “coaching” of the children had occurred while they were in the father’s custody. Williams v. Williams, 656 So. 2d 325, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 280 (Miss. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       A chancellor erred in changing custody of a 6-year-old girl from her mother to her father based solely on the child’s unusual knowledge of sexual conduct allegedly gained from her accidental exposure to sexual relations between her mother and stepfather where the totality of the facts and circumstances failed to support a finding that the child’s best interest would be served by a change in custody. Smith v. Jones, 654 So. 2d 480, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 151 (Miss. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       A chancellor erred in failing to grant a father’s request for modification of custody of his 18-year old daughter where both parents and the daughter agreed that she should be in the father’s custody, she had been living with the father, and the chancellor had reduced the father’s child support obligation to reflect this living arrangement.

      </p>
      <p>
       A chancellor did not abuse his discretion in awarding custody of a 14-year-old boy to his mother on the ground that the father was unfit to be a parent, even though the child testified that he preferred to live with his father, where the child’s testimony indicated that his relationship with his mother would seriously deteriorate if he were allowed to live with his father, and the father had encouraged the child to ignore and disobey his mother, allowed him to chew tobacco and dip snuff, allowed him to ride a 4-wheeler without adult supervision, allowed him to carry and shoot a .357 magnum pistol without adult supervision, kept his supply of pornographic movies in the child’s bedroom, told him he would buy the child a truck if he stayed with him after the divorce, and belittled his wife in the child’s presence and encouraged the child to do the same. Ferguson v. Ferguson, 639 So. 2d 921, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 352 (Miss. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       A chancellor erred in awarding custody of a child to her maternal aunt rather than her father where there was no finding that the father was unfit to have custody of the child, and the main foundation for the ruling was the chancellor’s concern about separating the child from her half-brother; while the separation of siblings may be an important consideration, it may not be used as a basis to deprive a parent of his or her child in favor of a third party unless the parent has been found to be unfit. Sellers v. Sellers, 638 So. 2d 481, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 311 (Miss. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       A chancellor did not err in awarding custody of a child to his father, even though the mother “may have presented enough evidence at trial to let one conclude that custody should have been awarded to her,” where the weight of the evidence in favor of the mother was not so great as to make an award of custody to the father erroneous, the wife stated that the father was a good parent and that he and the child were close, and the only evidence of the father’s alleged physical abuse of the child was the mother’s uncorroborated testimony. Chamblee v. Chamblee, 637 So. 2d 850, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 285 (Miss. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a proceeding to determine custody of a minor child, the chancellor erred in rendering his opinion based on the summarized testimony of what the attorneys believed vital witnesses would have said; in utilizing the summarized testimony, the chancellor was not in a position to view the demeanor and judge the credibility of the witnesses, and therefore failed to fully assess and consider the fitness of the parties to care for the child. Murphy v. Murphy, 631 So. 2d 812, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 76 (Miss. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a hearing on a motion for a new trial in a proceeding to determine custody of a minor child, the chancellor erred in rendering the issue of the parties’ fitness res judicata and refusing to hear additional testimony and consider expert reports submitted by social workers; chancellors in child custody cases should consider any and all evidence which aids them in reaching the ultimate custody decision, and the ability to hear and consider additional evidence is at all times within a chancellor’s authority in matters concerning child custody. Murphy v. Murphy, 631 So. 2d 812, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 76 (Miss. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       A chancellor did not err in awarding physical custody of 2 minor children to their mother where the chancellor awarded the parents joint legal custody, both parents were found to be fit and proper parents, the mother was the primary caregiver though both parents played active parenting roles, the father had a work schedule based on 12-hour shifts and the only option he had considered for child care while he was at work was his elderly mother who had suffered a stroke, the father did not dispute the mother’s ability to care for the children, and the father was given liberal visitation rights. Moak v. Moak, 631 So. 2d 196, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 44 (Miss. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       A child custody order awarding the father custody of the parties’ 2 children would be vacated where the mother did not have sufficient time to prepare for 2 adverse witnesses and the custody question was extremely close, so that the mother’s lack of an opportunity to prepare for the witnesses could have affected the evidence presented and, necessarily, the chancellor’s decision.

      <p>
       Chancellor did not err in finding that it was in a child’s best interest and welfare to award joint custody of the child to the child’s maternal great-grandparents and paternal grandmother, because of the unfit parents—given the severity of the father’s drug problems, mental-health issues, and violent tendencies and the mother’s extensive drug and alcohol abuse—to protect the child from potential violence.

      <p>
       Chancellor did not abuse its discretion in awarding joint physical custody of a child to the paternal grandparent and to the maternal great-grandparents of the child, after finding both natural parents unfit, because the chancellor considered the statutory and the caselaw factors, and acted within its authority, in determining the best interests of the child. Moreover, the chancellor’s award of joint custody was supported by substantial evidence. Darby v. Combs, 229 So.3d 136, 2016 Miss. App. LEXIS 681 (Miss. Ct.

       Grandparents have no right to custody of a grandchild as against a natural parent; thus, a chancellor erred in awarding custody of a child to his grandmother based on the finding that the child’s father was “unprepared” where the chancellor did not make a specific finding as to whether the father was an unfit parent.

       Chancery court properly denied a father’s request for sole physical custody and increased his custody time instead because the chancellor’s minor changes to the custody schedule were supported by the record, the chancellor’s decision to award the father half of the child’s spring break served the purpose of joint custody—to award each custodial parent equal and significant periods of physical custody—and the appealed judgment was indeed a final judgment inasmuch as the chancellor adjudicated the merits of the father’s petition and settled all issues between the father and the mother.

       Chancellor considered the best interest factors in making the joint physical custody decision, and his findings were sup-ported by substantial evidence; both parents were employed and capable of providing for the child, both had a stable home, and the chancellor’s failure to specifically address each best interest factor was not reversible error.

       Chancellor did not err in awarding a mother and a father joint physical and legal custody of their child because it properly analyzed and applied the Albright factors; because the chancellor considered the mother’s stability when favoring the father in the stability of the home environment factor, he did not err in finding that that factor was neutral, and he found that there was evidence that both parties were a part of the child’s life.

       Parents may resolve a custody schedule issue through an agreement that a chancellor finds adequate and sufficient before incorporating it into an amended divorce judgment, or they could allow the chancellor to resolve the issue for them. A joint-physical-custody schedule should provide each parent with significant periods of physical custody in such a way so as to assure their child of frequent and continuing contact with both parents, but that does not necessarily mean that each parent would have to get equal time with their child.

       In a child custody case in which the mother argued that the chancellor’s final custody order was erroneous due to its ambiguity of the term custody, the record failed to support a grant of legal custody to the mother, and in light of the guidance provided by the Lowery decision, a plain reading of the chancellor’s judgment reflected that the chancellor granted full legal custody to the father. The case lacked any agreement regarding arrangement of shared custody, and the record failed to support an award of legal custody to the mother. Wheat v. Koustovalas, 42 So.3d 606, 2010 Miss.

Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c05s93-5-24ol12" target="_self">93-5-24(2)</a></cite> because the husband and the wife’s consent to allow the chancery court to determine custody gave the chancellor the option to award joint-custody to the parties, and although the chancellor rejected the guardian ad litem’s recommendation of joint custody, without explanation, and granted legal and physical custody of the children to the husband, chancellors were not required to defer to the findings of a guardian ad litem. Furthermore, in cases where the appointment of a guardian ad litem is discretionary, or not required by statute, the chancellor was not bound to explain his decision to reject the guardian ad litem’s recommendations.

      <p>
       Court’s award of child custody constituted joint physical custody because the amount of custodial time awarded to the father, while not generous, still afforded the father significant periods of physical custody and assured the child frequent and continuing contact with both the father and the mother. The chancellor’s decision that the child should remain with the mother during the school week was reasonable because there was testimony that the child’s grades suffered during the separation period when the father and the mother shuffled him back and forth. Collins v. Collins, 20 So.3d 683, 2008 Miss. App. LEXIS 739 (Miss. Ct. App. 2008), cert. denied, 2009 Miss. LEXIS 542 (Miss. Nov. 5, 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       Even though the parties had not agreed on joint custody, it was not subject to modification based on this fact where it had been determined that such an award was in the best interest of the children; the strained relationship between the parties existed at the time of the divorce.

   Trial court granted the parties’ joint legal and physical custody of the minor child, but the trial court also specified visitation for the mother which did not comply with Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c05s93-5-24" target="_self">93-5-24</a></cite>’s requirement of significant periods of physical custody; thus, the trial court, on remand, had to clarify the contradictory language used in its judgment.

       <p>
   Trial court erred in finding the father in contempt for violations of a custody agreement and for aiding and supporting his daughter’s decision not to return to her mother’s custody after visiting with the father because the evidence showed the father enlisted the aid of law enforcement, an attorney, and a psychologist in an attempt to get his daughter to comply with a court order to return to her mother. Although the mother had sole physical custody of the children, the father was a joint legal custodian and under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c05s93-5-24ol15e" target="_self">93-5-24(5)(e)</a></cite> he had a right to share in the decision-making process and discuss the benefits and consequences of the mother’s out-of-state move with the children.

   Appellate court interpreted
   Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c05s93-5-24ol12" target="_self">93-5-24(2)</a></cite> to prohibit a chancellor from awarding joint custody in irreconcilable differences divorce cases unless both parents specifically requested joint custody, but the Mississippi Supreme Court rejected that interpretation; the Supreme Court held that when parties consented in writing to the chancery court’s determination of custody, they were consenting to that determination and this met the statutory directive of “joint application” in §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c05s93-5-24ol12" target="_self">93-5-24(2)</a></cite>. The Supreme Court found that this was the only statutory interpretation that conformed to the primary directive of
   Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c05s93-5-24ol11" target="_self">93-5-24(1)</a></cite> that custody should be awarded according to the best interests of the child; it was the chancellor who had to determine what was in the best interests of the child, and it was the chancellor who determined the level of commitment parents had to sharing joint custody.

       <p>
   In an irreconcilable differences divorce case, the parties asked the chancellor to decide the issues of primary custody, property settlement, and support, pursuant to
   Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c05s93-5-2ol13" target="_self">93-5-2(3)</a></cite>; because the parties consented to the chancellor determination of custody, that met the statutory directive of “joint application” in §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c05s93-5-24ol12" target="_self">93-5-24(2)</a></cite>. Because the parents had been sharing joint legal and physical custody since their separation, on their own initiative, the chancellor found that there was a proven willingness from both parties to cooperate; thus, the chancellor did not err in awarding joint custody of the child to the parties.
   Crider v. Crider, 904 So. 2d 142, 2005 Miss. LEXIS 222 (Miss. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Where divorce was granted on the ground of irreconcilable differences, the trial court improperly awarded joint custody when neither of the parties requested it; the appellate court had consistently interpreted Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c05s93-5-24ol12" target="_self">93-5-24(2)</a></cite> to require the consent of both parents before joint custody could be awarded in an irreconcilable differences divorce.

   Pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c05s93-5-24" target="_self">93-5-24</a></cite>, a chancellor could award sole legal custody of children to one parent and joint physical custody to both parents; the chancellor was correct in denying the wife’s request to modify the original child custody order where she had not met her required burden of proving a material change in circumstances. Mabus v. Mabus, 847 So. 2d 815, 2003 Miss. LEXIS 274 (Miss. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       Two fleeting references to the possibility of joint custody – during a trial in which both parents fought hard for sole custody – were an insufficient to amend a parent’s pleadings under a theory of implied consent, to include a petition for joint custody. Mabus v. Mabus, 890 So. 2d 806, 2003 Miss. LEXIS 62 (Miss. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the Legislature has had numerous opportunities to change the requirement that joint custody be requested by both parents in an irreconcilable differences divorce, they have not done so and, therefore, in such a case, joint custody should be awarded only where both parties request such an award. Dearman v. Dearman, 811 So. 2d 308, 2001 Miss. App. LEXIS 27 (Miss. Ct. App. 2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although an award of joint custody was not proper where the parties, who were divorced on the ground of irreconcilable differences, did not ask for joint custody, the court nevertheless upheld the custody order as it was mislabeled as “joint custody” since it amounted to de facto physical custody to the father with liberal visitation rights to the mother. Dearman v. Dearman, 811 So. 2d 308, 2001 Miss. App. LEXIS 27 (Miss. Ct. App. 2001).

       Where neither party agreed to nor requested joint custody, the chancellor erred in awarding joint custody. Morris v. Morris, 758 So. 2d 1020, 1999 Miss. App. LEXIS 307 (Miss. Ct. App. 1999).

       Chancellor’s dismissal of a father’s petition to modify custody was appropriate because the chancellor did not err in finding that the father failed to prove a material change in circumstances that adversely affected the parties’ child as there was no evidence that an incident in which the child consumed beer, the wife’s temper and profanity, and incidents at baseball games had any adverse effect on the child. Furthermore, the child performed well in school, was in good physical and mental health, and had good relationships with both parents. Shows v. Cross, 238 So.3d 1224, 2018 Miss. App. LEXIS 99 (Miss.

       Modification of child custody was appropriate—after the mother alleged that the parties’ child had ingested opioids when with the father—because there was substantial evidence to support the chancellor’s factual findings that the mother’s participation in a scheme to plant illegal drugs in the father’s pickup truck to be found by the police and that the mother’s tampering with a drug test of the parties’ child had resulted in a material change of circumstances. The chancellor also found that the mother’s conduct threatened harm to the child. Barbaro v. Smith, — So.3d —, 2019 Miss. App. LEXIS 322 (Miss. Ct. App. July 16, 2019).

      <p>
       Chancellor did not err by modifying a child-custody arrangement because of a material change in circumstances. The chancellor found that the custodial parent was pregnant and in an extramarital relationship with the parent’s fiance, the custodial parent unilaterally reduced and virtually eliminated the non-custodial parent’s extended visitation periods and attempted to interfere with the relationship between the non-custodial parent and the child, and the child had been adversely affected by the custodial parent’s actions.

       Chancery court did not err in awarding a father custody of his child because it applied the correct legal standard in modifying custody, and its decision to modify custody from the mother to the father was based upon substantial evidence; the mother removed the child in the middle of the night in violation of a court order and then refused to accept phone calls from either the father or the guardian ad litem, the guardian ad litem’s report stated that the mother missed appointments and did not regularly make the child available to speak on the phone, and the chancery court discounted the child’s stated preference to live with the mother because it found that his desire was motivated by the mother not properly disciplining him.

       Reversal of a chancellor’s judgment and remand of a case for further consideration was appropriate because, following a father’s successful request for custody modification and physical custody of the parties’ child, the chancellor mistakenly held that the father did not have to prove a material change in circumstances adverse to the child’s best interests.

       In a child custody modification case, a finding that there was a material change of circumstances that had adversely affected a child was improper since there was no evidence as to how a mother’s living situation since the original divorce decree adversely affected the child, much less any evidence of harm or danger. There was no evidence to support an allegation that the mother had been using drugs, and a chancellor did not explain how any material change was adverse to the child’s best interest. Mize v.

   court properly found that a father was entitled to the natural-parent presumption due to the progress that he made in rehabilitating himself as a parent; the presumption was not rebutted by clear and convincing evidence. Inter alia, the father had taken legal action when denied
   visitation with his child, had visited the child, and had demonstrated that he was drug free for more than a year prior to his being awarded temporary custody.

      <p>
       Trial court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the proof did not constitute a history of family violence because the domestic abuse protective orders which the mother entered did not relate to anything but an incident after a basketball game, the facts of which the trial court found to be in dispute, that resulted in no serious injury.

      </p>
      <p>
       Chancery court’s child custody award erred because, in finding a mother unfit and invoking the family-violence presumption, the court (1) relied on inadmissible hearsay in a guardian ad litem’s report and testimony and (2) conducted no Albright analysis.

    Effect of judgment of divorce.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The judgment of divorce shall not render illegitimate the children begotten between the parties during lawful marriage; but if the judgment be rendered because one (1) of the parties was married to another at the time of the marriage or pretended marriage between the parties, it shall adjudge the marriage between the parties to have been invalid and void from the beginning and the issue thereof shall be illegitimate and subject to the disabilities of illegitimate children. And the judgment may provide, in the discretion of the court, that a party against whom a divorce is granted, because of adultery, shall not be at liberty to marry again; in which case such party shall remain in law as a married person. Provided, however, that after one (1) year, the court may remove the disability and permit the person to marry again, on petition and satisfactory evidence of reformation, or for good cause shown, on the part of the party so barred from remarriage; but the actions of the court under the foregoing proviso shall not be construed as affecting any judgment of divorce granted in any case where the discretion of the chancellor has been exercised in barring one (1) party from remarriage on account of adultery.

       Husband’s testimony, excluding that pertaining to alleged adultery, would not support a divorce on grounds of habitual cruel and inhuman treatment, where he testified that wife had cursed him on several occasions, that their sex life had decreased in frequency, that wife had been cold toward him since their reconciliation, and that he was suspicious of wife’s relation with another man. Moreover, with respect to the alleged adultery, since the alleged act occurred in the interim between an earlier divorce decree and the revocation of that decree, the wife was then a single woman and could not have committed adultery against her marital status with husband. Devereaux v. Devereaux, 493 So. 2d 1310, 1986 Miss. LEXIS 2627 (Miss. 1986).

   Mississippi Code §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.97.html#t97c05s97-5-27" target="_blank">97-5-27</a></cite> means what it says-namely, that the divorce is absolute. Devereaux v. Devereaux, 493 So. 2d 1310, 1986 Miss. LEXIS 2627 (Miss. 1986).
      </p>

       With the entry of a divorce decree, the marital rights of the parties, as related to one another, cease and the status of the parties is that of unmarried persons who may contract another marriage unless prohibited by the decree. Devereaux v. Devereaux, 493 So. 2d 1310, 1986 Miss. LEXIS 2627 (Miss. 1986).
      </p>
      <p>

   Since a wife granted a decree on March 25, 1982 was a single person until the divorce decree was revoked pursuant to Mississippi Code §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c05s93-5-31" target="_self">93-5-31</a></cite> on July 7, 1982, she could not commit adultery as an offense against her marital status with her husband during the interim.

   The revocation of a divorce decree pursuant to Mississippi Code §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c05s93-5-31" target="_self">93-5-31</a></cite> does not nullify the divorce decree, at least not to such extent as though the parties were never divorced so that any act by either of the parties in the interim between the divorce decree and the revocation of that decree could be construed by the law to be an offense against their marital status.

       There was no authority for the special chancellor’s decision to set aside divorce decree because neither party asked the special chancellor to set aside the divorce decree but were before the court on a contempt petition; the former husband made a motion for a directed verdict, and the only relief allowed was for the chancellor to either grant the motion and dismiss the former wife’s contempt petition or deny the motion and allow the contempt claim to proceed.

   The revocation of a divorce decree pursuant to Mississippi Code §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c05s93-5-31" target="_self">93-5-31</a></cite> does not nullify the divorce decree, at least not to such extent as though the parties were never divorced so that any act by either of the parties in the interim between the divorce decree and the revocation of that decree could be construed by the law to be an offense against their marital status. Devereaux v. Devereaux, 493 So. 2d 1310, 1986 Miss. LEXIS 2627 (Miss. 1986).

   Since a wife granted a decree on March 25, 1982 was a single person until the divorce decree was revoked pursuant to Mississippi Code §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c05s93-5-31" target="_self">93-5-31</a></cite> on July 7, 1982, she could not commit adultery as an offense against her marital status with her husband during the interim.

      <p>
       Husband’s testimony, excluding that pertaining to alleged adultery, would not support a divorce on grounds of habitual cruel and inhuman treatment, where he testified that wife had cursed him on several occasions, that their sex life had decreased in frequency, that wife had been cold toward him since their reconciliation, and that he was suspicious of wife’s relation with another man. Moreover, with respect to the alleged adultery, since the alleged act occurred in the interim between an earlier divorce decree and the revocation of that decree, the wife was then a single woman and could not have committed adultery against her marital status with husband.

   Because the wife met every requirement in Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c05s93-5-31" target="_self">93-5-31</a></cite> to have a divorce revoked, the appellate court erred in reversing the chancery court’s revocation of the parties’ divorce; in part, there was sufficient evidence of reconciliation and no statutory reference was made to the death of one of the parties. Because the action was not abated upon husband’s death, Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.15.html#t15c01s15-1-69" target="_blank">15-1-69</a></cite> was inapplicable. Carlisle v. Allen, 40 So.3d 1252, 2010 Miss. LEXIS 391 (Miss. 2010).
      </p>
      <p>
       Revocation of the couple’s divorce was inappropriate because the chancery court should not have conducted a hearing on the matter of revoking the divorce following the decedent husband’s death. The purpose of the joint application to revoke the divorce was to revoke the divorce; when one of the parties died, there could be no successful resolution of the application. Carlisle v. Allen, 40 So.3d 1265, 2009 Miss. App. LEXIS 349 (Miss. Ct. App. 2009), rev'd, 40 So.3d 1252, 2010 Miss. LEXIS 391 (Miss. 2010).

   While the effect of military deployment cannot be a factor in determining whether a change of circumstances has occurred, Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c05s93-5-34" target="_self">93-5-34</a></cite> does not prohibit courts from considering the effect of military service in determining the best interest of a child.

      </p>
      <p>
       Awarding child custody to a former wife was in the best interest of the parties’ children because the former husband’s military service limited his capacity to provide primary care to the children where the husband was on call twenty-four hours a day and it remained possible that the husband could be deployed overseas. Because the best interest of the children was the paramount consideration, the chancery court was not barred from considering the husband’s military service. Morris v. Morris, 5 So.3d 476, 2008 Miss.

       § 93-7-3.
    Causes for annulment of marriages.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      A marriage may be annulled for any one (1) of the following causes existing at the time of the marriage ceremony:
     </p>
     <p>
      Incurable impotency.
     </p>
     <p>
      Adjudicated mental illness or incompetence of either or both parties. Action of a spouse who has been adjudicated mentally ill or incompetent may be brought by guardian, or in the absence of a guardian, by next friend, provided that the suit is brought within six (6) months after marriage.
     </p>
     <p>
      Failure to comply with the provisions of Sections 93-1-5 through 93-1-9 when any marriage affected by that failure has not been followed by cohabitation.
     </p>
     <p>
      Or, in the absence of ratification:
     </p>
     <p>
      When either of the parties to a marriage is incapable, from want of age or understanding, of consenting to any marriage, or is incapable from physical causes of entering into the marriage state, or where the consent of either party has been obtained by force or fraud, the marriage shall be void from the time its nullity is declared by a court of competent jurisdiction.
     </p>
     <p>
      Pregnancy of the wife by another person, if the husband did not know of the pregnancy.
     </p>
     <p>
      Suits for annulment under paragraphs (d) and (e) shall be brought within six (6) months after the ground for annulment is or should be discovered, and not thereafter.
     </p>
     <p>
      The causes for annulment of marriage set forth in this section are intended to be new remedies and shall in no way affect the causes for divorce declared elsewhere to be the law of the State of Mississippi as they presently exist or as they may from time to time be amended.

       The 2008 amendment rewrote (b), substituting “Adjudicated mental illness or incompetence” for “Insanity or idiocy” and “a spouse who has been adjudicated mentally ill or incompetent” for “an insane spouse”; substituted “paragraphs (d) and (e)” for “subsections (d) and (e)” in the next-to-last paragraph; and made minor stylistic changes throughout.

       This section [Code 1942, § 2748-03] reflects a legislative intent to require a judicial declaration of legitimacy. Stutts v. Estate of Stutts, 194 So. 2d 229, 1967 Miss. LEXIS 1405 (Miss. 1967), rev'd, 529 So. 2d 177, 1988 Miss. LEXIS 352 (Miss. 1988).

      <p>
       This section [Code 1942, § 2748-03] contemplates more than a mere adulterous or illicit relationship, and is not effective to legitimate the issue resulting from a meretricious cohabitation, where there was never any kind of a marriage, either ceremonial or common law. Stutts v. Estate of Stutts, 194 So. 2d 229, 1967 Miss. LEXIS 1405 (Miss. 1967), rev'd, 529 So. 2d 177, 1988 Miss. LEXIS 352 (Miss. 1988).

      <p>
       A “valid marriage” under this section [Code 1942, § 2748-03] must have been entered into innocently and in good faith by at least one of the parties, and unless this factor exists it is not a “valid marriage” as contemplated here.

     <p>
      The father of a child which is or may be born out of lawful matrimony is liable to the same extent as the father of a child born of lawful matrimony, whether or not the child is born alive, for the reasonable expense of the mother’s pregnancy and confinement, and for the education, necessary support and maintenance, and medical and funeral expenses of the child. A child born out of lawful matrimony also includes a child born to a married woman by a man other than her lawful husband.

       Chancery court properly awarded a mother back child support and attorney’s fees and denied compensation for pregnancy and childbirth expenses or allergy-proofing her home due to her child’s medical needs because, while the biological father was responsible for the child, the mother failed to offer proper proof of those expenses to the court.

       Paternity may be determined upon the petition of the mother, or father, the child or any public authority chargeable by law with the support of the child; provided that such an adjudication after the death of the defendant must be made only upon clear and convincing evidence. If paternity has been lawfully determined, or has been acknowledged in writing according to the laws of this state, the liabilities of the noncustodial parent may be enforced in the same or other proceedings by the custodial parent, the child, or any public authority which has furnished or may furnish the reasonable expenses of pregnancy, confinement, education, necessary support and maintenance, and medical or funeral expenses for the custodial parent or the child. The trier of fact shall receive without the need for third-party foundation testimony certified, attested or sworn documentation as evidence of (a) childbirth records; (b) cost of filing fees; (c) court costs; (d) services of process fees; (e) mailing cost; (f) genetic tests and testing fees; (g) the department’s attorney’s fees; (h) in cases where the state or any of its entities or divisions have provided medical services to the child or the child’s mother, all costs of prenatal care, birthing, postnatal care and any other medical expenses incurred by the child or by the mother as a consequence of the mother’s pregnancy or delivery; and (i) funeral expenses. All costs and fees shall be ordered paid to the Department of Human Services in all cases successfully prosecuted with a minimum of Two Hundred Fifty Dollars ($250.00) in attorney’s fees or an amount determined by the court without submitting an affidavit. Proceedings may be instituted at any time until such child attains the age of twenty-one (21) years unless the child has been emancipated as provided in Section 93-5-23 and Section 93-11-65. In the event of court-determined paternity, the surname of the child shall be that of the father, unless the judgment specifies otherwise.
      </li>
      <li id="t93c09s93-9-9ol12">
       If the alleged father in an action to determine paternity to which the Department of Human Services is a party fails to appear for a scheduled hearing after having been served with process or subsequent notice consistent with the Rules of Civil Procedure, his paternity of the child(ren) shall be established by the court if an affidavit sworn to by the mother averring the alleged father’s paternity of the child has accompanied the complaint to determine paternity. Said affidavit shall constitute sufficient grounds for the court’s finding of the alleged father’s paternity without the necessity of the presence or testimony of the mother at the said hearing. The court shall, upon motion by the Department of Human Services, enter a judgment of paternity. Any person who shall willfully and knowingly file a false affidavit shall be subject to a fine of not more than One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00).
      </li>
      <li id="t93c09s93-9-9ol13">
       Upon application of both parents to the State Board of Health and receipt by the State Board of Health of a sworn acknowledgement of paternity executed by both parents subsequent to the birth of a child born out of wedlock, the birth certificate of the child shall be amended to show such paternity if paternity is not shown on the birth certificate. Upon request of the parents for the legitimization of a child under this section, the surname of the child shall be changed on the certificate to that of the father.

         The one-year time limit, specified in subsection (4)(a)(i) of this section, for the right of the alleged father to rescind the signed voluntary acknowledgement of paternity shall be tolled from the date the alleged father files his formal application for genetic testing with the Department of Human Services until the date the test results are revealed to the alleged father by the department. After the one-year time period has expired, not including any period of time tolled for the purpose of acquiring genetic testing through the department, the provisions of subsection (4)(b) of this section shall apply.

   In a paternity action, the mother argued that she had a fundamental right, as a mother, to retain the birth name given to her child, and that the paternal presumption in
   Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c09s93-9-9ol11" target="_self">93-9-9(1)</a></cite> constituted both a due process and equal protection violation, but she had waited three years (until the final hearing on custody, support, and visitation), to act on her prior motion to amend the earlier judgment of the chancellor, which had given the child the father’s surname. The Mississippi Supreme Court held: (1) although other jurisdictions had established that a parent had a fundamental constitutional right in his/her child’s name, the supreme court had yet to recognize that same was fundamental; (2) the mother had made no challenge to the constitutionality of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c09s93-9-9ol11" target="_self">93-9-9(1)</a></cite> in her motion to alter or amend, and the father and the trial court were first apprised of her constitutional challenge when she appealed to the instant court; (3) the Mississippi Attorney General had received no notice of her constitutional challenge until he received her appellate brief; and (4) consequently, the issue was procedurally barred pursuant to Miss. R. Civ. P. 24(d), and because she had failed to raise the constitutional issue in the trial court.

   In a paternity action filed by the alleged father, the Mississippi chancery court had personal jurisdiction over the mother, a Lousiana native who was in Mississippi for the sole purpose of attending a Mississippi university, since the child was conceived in Mississippi and the father was a Mississippi resident; Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.37.html#t37c103s37-103-5" target="_blank">37-103-5</a></cite> deals with tuition cost and did not deprive the Mississippi chancery court of personal jurisdiction over the mother. Venegas v. Gurganus, 911 So. 2d 562, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 868 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 920 So. 2d 1008, 2005 Miss. LEXIS 639 (Miss. 2005).

   The general purpose of this statute [Code 1972, §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c09s93-9-9" target="_self">93-9-9</a></cite>] is to provide a uniform system of enforcement of the obligation of the father of a child which is born out of lawful matrimony to bear the reasonable expenses of the mother’s pregnancy and confinement and the education, support, maintenance, medical and funeral expenses for the child, and nothing in this section deprives the chancery court of the power to entertain a suit under Code 1972, §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c11s93-11-65" target="_self">93-11-65</a></cite>, where the suit is based on the averment that the child was born in wedlock or that the child was one of the marriage within the meaning of Code 1972, §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.91.html#t91c01s91-1-15" target="_blank">91-1-15</a></cite>.

       Mississippi’s wrongful death statute which does not permit an illegitimate child to sue for or recover damages for the wrongful death of the father, where the father has not acknowledged the child, does not deny an illegitimate child who had not been acknowledged by the deceased equal protection of the laws, in view of the fact that it is a simple matter to prove the maternity of an illegitimate child, but it is infinitely more complex and difficult to prove paternity, and in Mississippi the requirements are simple and easy for a father to legitimize his child under the law.

       The only issue to be tried by the jury in a bastardy case is whether the defendant was the father of the child born to the plaintiff, and the introduction of evidence for the purpose of contradicting the defendant on his testimony that he had not made another woman pregnant constituted reversible error; for the effect of the introduction of such evidence was to contradict the defendant on a matter immaterial to the issue before the court.

       The basis of liability under the Uniform Law on Paternity is not the fathering of the illegitimate child, but the purpose of such law is to make provision for the support of the illegitimate child if and when it becomes a dependent child under the law.

   State statutory presumption that husband of child’s mother is child’s father did not violate unwed putative father’s procedural and substantive due process rights under Fourteenth Amendment; child had no due process right to maintain filial relationships with both putative father and mother’s husband, and statute did not violate child’s equal protection rights. In determining whether due process liberty interest exists regarding an asserted right, inquiry focuses on whether most specific relevant societal tradition that can be identified protects such a right.

   Though a 29-year-old alleged son filed a paternity action not to enforce his alleged father’s child support obligations, but for the sole purpose of knowing his ancestry, the trial court properly dismissed the case as time-barred; whether

       In a proceeding to establish the paternity of an infant, an instruction to the jury regarding blood tests submitted into evidence constituted reversible error where the blood tests established a 99.99 percent probability that the defendant was the father, and the instruction stated that the blood tests were “not conclusive of the issue of paternity and merely establish that out of the black male population it is biologically possible for the defendant to be the father”; although the test results did not constitute conclusive evidence of paternity, it was error to instruct the jury that the tests meant that paternity was a biological “possibility” since this language tended to discredit the evidence in that it reduced the 99.99 percent probability to a mere possibility.

       In a proceeding to establish the paternity of an infant, an instruction to the jury regarding the issue of whether the mother and the defendant had sexual intercourse during the period of probable conception constituted reversible error where the instruction stated that the jury would have to find that the couple had sexual intercourse without regard to the blood test results, which established a 99.99 percent probability that the defendant was the infant’s father, or that the tests could not be a factor in the jury’s conclusion on this question of fact; although such test results, standing alone, are insufficient to prove this element of a paternity claim, test results of this nature are relevant to whether sexual intercourse took place during the period of possible conception since they tend to make the existence of the fact that sexual intercourse took place during that time period more probable.

       In a proceeding to establish the paternity of an infant, statements made by the defendant’s attorney during closing argument that the mother was unmarried and had illegitimate children other than the infant in question were improper; the statements were irrelevant to the issue of whether the defendant was the infant’s father as they had no tendency to make the proposition that the defendant was the father any more or less probable.

       Chancery court erred by changing the surname of a nine-year-old boy at the request of his father and over the objection of his mother because, while “the surname of the child shall be that of the father,” given the child’s age and history of behavioral issues at school, it was reasonable for the mother and the maternal grandmother to be concerned that a sudden name change could have a negative impact on him, and the father’s desire to pass on his family name was not the equivalent of the child’s best interest.

       Because the maternal grandparents, who were awarded physical custody of a father’s child, did not contest the change-of-name request by the father and failed to show by a preponderance of the evidence that it was not in the best interest of the child to bear the father’s surname, the appellate court found that it was appropriate to reverse the decision of the chancery court and to render the change of the child’s surname from the mother’s surname to the father’s surname.

       This section establishes circumstances under which a legal father may disestablish paternity and terminate a child support obligation when the legal father is not the biological father of the child. To disestablish paternity and terminate a child support obligation, the legal father must file a petition in the court having jurisdiction over the child support obligation. The petition must be served on the mother or other legal guardian or custodian of the child. If the Department of Human Services is or has been a party to the establishment of paternity or collection of child support, the Attorney General of the State of Mississippi must be served with a copy of the petition. The petition must include:
       <ol type="a">
        <li id="t93c09s93-9-10ol11a">
         An affidavit executed by the petitioner that newly discovered evidence relating to the paternity of the child has come to the petitioner’s knowledge since the initial paternity determination.

A petitioner who files such an affidavit can request in the petition that the court order the child and mother, if available, be tested.

       Contract between the mother and an alleged father of an illegitimate child could not, without judicial scrutiny and approval, preclude future paternity proceedings for purposes of child support; the prior agreement between the mother and the father regarding child support was not binding and modifiable, and had not been approved by the chancellor, who was within his authority to formulate a child support order, despite the parties’ prior mutual agreement, providing for its effectiveness one year prior to the mother’s instituting suit against the father for the adjudication of paternity and child support. Kelley v. Day, 965 So. 2d 749, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 625 (Miss. Ct. App. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       Issue of back child support was dismissed where, if the father wanted the chancellor to factor in specific considerations with regard to the back child support, he should have entered them into evidence at trial; the father made no mention as to any specific considerations he may have had regarding child support from 1997 to 2001.

      <p>
       <p>
   Chancellor did not err in finding that the father was liable for one year of past-due child support where the plain meaning of Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c09s93-9-11" target="_self">93-9-11</a></cite> was such that the non-custodial parent could only be liable for up to one year. Hill v.

      </p>

       One-year limitation on a father’s liability for past, necessary support and maintenance was just that, a limit; limitation was not a statutory requirement on the amount of support a father was ordered to pay.

       In simultaneous divorce and paternity actions, the biological father sought to have parental rights terminated, and the husband, who believed for years that the husband was the child’s father, sought to be declared the child’s legal father, but joinder of claims was not allowed, and with regard to the separate paternity action, the biological father was ordered to pay child support until some further order in the divorce proceedings supplanted that obligation. Griffith v. Pell, 881 So. 2d 227, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 786 (Miss. Ct. App. 2003), aff'd, 881 So. 2d 184, 2004 Miss. LEXIS 975 (Miss. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Absent some statutory pronouncement, as long as a defendant in a paternity action has a right to a jury trial, paternity test results, even though showing a high probability of paternity, cannot be conclusive as a matter of law; the weight to be given such evidence, along with the credibility of the parties involved, remains a question for the chancery court or the jury. Thus, a chancery court did not abuse its discretion in denying a plaintiff’s motion for a new trial after the jury found that the defendant was not the father, even though human leukocyte antigen test results showed that there was a probability of 99.59649 percent that the defendant was the child’s father, where there was a delay of nearly 12 years between the birth of the child and the filing of the paternity suit, the defendant testified that he had no knowledge of his alleged paternity until the filing of the suit, the plaintiff did not fare well under cross-examination, cross-examination of the defendant was practically non-existent, and the jury was able to view the mother, daughter, and putative father.

   Right of trial by jury afforded by §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c09s93-9-15" target="_self">93-9-15</a></cite> applies only to issue of paternity, but where each party waives any right to have attorney’s fee issue resolved by court such waiver will be given effect, and where question of an award of attorneys fees is submitted to jury as trier of fact, party seeking fee must prove, inter alia, reasonable necessity of rendering of services and spending amount of time for which fee is charged, as well as reasonableness of hourly rate.

   In a proceeding to determine paternity, reference to an alleged finding of paternity by the county youth court was highly prejudicial to defendant’s case and required reversal, in that the youth court had no authority to determine paternity; moreover, it was error for the trial court to admit into evidence any references to blood tests performed on the parties pursuant to §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c09s93-9-21" target="_self">93-9-21</a></cite>, where the trial court refused to allow the reports themselves to be introduced as an exhibit, and where the trial court did not call the expert who had conducted the tests to testify as to his findings.

       Chancery courts have general jurisdiction over bastardy proceedings, for the main purposes of such proceedings are to provide support and education for bastard children, to prevent such children from becoming public charges, and to provide the mother assistance in discharging her duty to support and educate such children.

       This section [Code 1942, § 383-05] can have no reference to a final order establishing paternity, and such an order, when it becomes final, occupies the same status as any other final judgment and is only subject to being set aside, vacated, or annulled under the same circumstances and for the same reasons as apply to judgments generally.

   Where the mother of a three-year-old child filed suit against a doctor for declaration of paternity, the County Court of Jackson County, Mississippi, had jurisdiction over the action under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c09s93-9-15" target="_self">93-9-15</a></cite>. Daniels v. Bains, 967 So. 2d 77, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 714 (Miss. Ct. App. 2007).

   In a paternity action filed by the alleged father, the Mississippi court had personal jurisdiction over the mother, a Lousiana native who was in Mississippi for the sole purpose of attending a Mississippi university, since the child was conceived in Mississippi and the father was a Mississippi resident; Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.37.html#t37c103s37-103-5" target="_blank">37-103-5</a></cite> deals with tuition cost and did not deprive the Mississippi chancery court of personal jurisdiction over the mother.

   Paternity actions can never be brought in youth court. Under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c09s93-9-15" target="_self">93-9-15</a></cite>, the county court, the circuit court, or the chancery court has jurisdiction of actions relating to paternity and the support of illegitimate children; the youth court does not have jurisdiction over those matters, and is unable to act to establish the paternity of a child within its jurisdiction.

      </h4>
      <p>
       Adjudicating a decedent to be a minor’s natural father was not error where the dismissal of a first paternity case without prejudice due to insufficient process was not a jurisdictional bar to a second action, and although the father had not submitted to genetic testing because he could not afford it, he had subsequently voluntarily acknowledged his paternity. Mitchell v. Moore, 237 So.3d 681, 2017 Miss. LEXIS 446 (Miss. 2017).
      </p>
      <p>
       Husband was not entitled to a paternity test in divorce proceedings because the parties acknowledged that a child born to the wife was not the husband’s child. Pace v. Pace, 16 So.3d 734, 2009 Miss. App. LEXIS 148 (Miss. Ct. App. 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   The appellate court affirmed the order of genetic testing on an individual and a mother in the individual’s petition for a determination of paternity because the word “shall” used in Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c09s93-9-21ol12" target="_self">93-9-21(2)</a></cite> required the trial court to grant the motion for paternity. Thoms v. Thoms, 928 So. 2d 852, 2006 Miss. LEXIS 250 (Miss. 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c09s93-9-21ol11" target="_self">93-9-21(1)</a></cite> (Rev. 2000) requires neither DNA nor blood testing to establish paternity in cases of descent of an estate among illegitimate children. Jordan v. Baggett, 791 So. 2d 308, 2001 Miss. App. LEXIS 295 (Miss. Ct. App. 2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a proceeding to establish paternity, upon motion by either the plaintiff or defendant for an order requiring blood tests, the trial judge must grant the motion; no discretion is afforded the trial judge. Ivy v. Harrington, 644 So. 2d 1218, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 527 (Miss. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       Statute, prior to amendment, was mandatory and if defendant in paternity action requested blood tests, trial court was required to order them. One effect of amendment to statute, however, was that ordering of blood tests was discretionary, rather than mandatory. Deer v. State Dep't of Public Welfare, 518 So. 2d 649, 1988 Miss. LEXIS 13 (Miss. 1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where there was substantial doubt as to who was father of child, blood test was timely requested by defendant, and only method to prove natural fatherhood, trial court should have ordered blood test. Deer v. State Dep't of Public Welfare, 518 So. 2d 649, 1988 Miss. LEXIS 13 (Miss. 1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       Lower court erred in ordering blood test at request of plaintiff because statute allows blood test only on motion of defendant who was brought into court against his will. Johnson v. Ladner, 514 So. 2d 327, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2778 (Miss. 1987), dismissed, 563 So. 2d 1368, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 226 (Miss. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   In a proceeding to determine paternity, reference to an alleged finding of paternity by the county youth court was highly prejudicial to defendant’s case and required reversal, in that the youth court had no authority to determine paternity; moreover, it was error for the trial court to admit into evidence any references to blood tests performed on the parties pursuant to §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c09s93-9-21" target="_self">93-9-21</a></cite>, where the trial court refused to allow the reports themselves to be introduced as an exhibit, and where the trial court did not call the expert who had conducted the tests to testify as to his findings. Davis v. Washington, 453 So. 2d 712, 1984 Miss. LEXIS 1833 (Miss. 1984).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section [Code 1942, § 383-08] does not require the defendant in a paternity suit to request blood tests; however, if a blood test is requested the results must be introduced in evidence. Price v. Simpson, 205 So. 2d 642, 1968 Miss. LEXIS 1539 (Miss. 1968).
      </p>
      <p>
       It was error in a bastardy case to grant an instruction for the plaintiff that the defendant could, on his own motion, have requested the court to order the mother, the child, and himself to submit to blood tests; for the defendant is not required to request such tests. Price v. Simpson, 205 So. 2d 642, 1968 Miss. LEXIS 1539 (Miss. 1968).
      </p>

       <b>
        2. Non-party witnesses.
       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       The statute does not instill the court with the power to compel a non-party witness to take a blood test, though it may be requested by the court; if the court requests that a non-party witness take a blood test and the witness refuses, the court’s only option under the statute is be to exclude the testimony of that witness. Brown v. Jackson (In re Estate of Chambers), 711 So. 2d 878, 1998 Miss. LEXIS 251 (Miss. 1998).
      </p>

        3. Refusal to submit to blood test.
       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       A trial court does not have the discretion to decline to enforce a previously issued order for blood testing to establish paternity; the “may” language in the second sentence of subsection (2) of this section indicates that the trial court has two available options from which to choose; specifically, to either issue a default judgment against the refusing party or, alternatively, to enforce the order for blood tests. W. H. W. v. J. J. by & Through Povall, 735 So. 2d 990, 1999 Miss. LEXIS 109 (Miss. 1999).

       Father did not supply the trial court with expert testimony to show good cause why additional paternity testing was warranted, and without such evidence the trial court found that it could not allow additional testing; the father’s request for additional paternity testing was roughly nine years from the issuance of the original paternity evaluation, and any challenge or motion for additional paternity testing grossly exceeded the statutorily provided 30 days.

       If the court finds that the conclusions of all the experts, as disclosed by the evidence based upon the tests, are that the alleged father is not the father of the child, the question of paternity shall be resolved accordingly. If an expert concludes that the blood or other tests show the probability of paternity, that evidence shall be admitted.

       There shall be a rebuttable presumption of paternity, affecting the burden of proof, if the court finds that the probability of paternity, as calculated by the experts qualified as examiners of genetic tests, is ninety-eight percent (98%) or greater.

   Expert was admitted as an expert in the field of molecular biology, forensic DNA analysis and DNA hair analysis, and she was allowed to testify as to the results of her DNA analysis without a specific objection from the defense, and the specific arguments made by defendant on appeal were not presented to the trial court; further, Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c09s93-9-27" target="_self">93-9-27</a></cite>, regarding the presumption of paternity genetic tests, did not provide the standard for admission of DNA evidence here, and the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing in the statistical results of the DNA tests. Rankin v. State, 963 So. 2d 1255, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 553 (Miss. Ct. App. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where an expert testified that the probability of paternity was 98.63 percent, the chancellor erred in not considering the statutory presumption. Brown v. Jackson (In re Estate of Chambers), 711 So. 2d 878, 1998 Miss. LEXIS 251 (Miss. 1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a proceeding to establish the paternity of an infant, an instruction to the jury regarding blood tests submitted into evidence constituted reversible error where the blood tests established a 99.99 percent probability that the defendant was the father, and the instruction stated that the blood tests were “not conclusive of the issue of paternity and merely establish that out of the black male population it is biologically possible for the defendant to be the father”; although the test results did not constitute conclusive evidence of paternity, it was error to instruct the jury that the tests meant that paternity was a biological “possibility” since this language tended to discredit the evidence in that it reduced the 99.99 percent probability to a mere possibility. Department of Human Servs. v. Moore, 632 So. 2d 929, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 110 (Miss. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a proceeding to establish the paternity of an infant, an instruction to the jury regarding the issue of whether the mother and the defendant had sexual intercourse during the period of probable conception constituted reversible error where the instruction stated that the jury would have to find that the couple had sexual intercourse without regard to the blood test results, which established a 99.99 percent probability that the defendant was the infant’s father, or that the tests could not be a factor in the jury’s conclusion on this question of fact; although such test results, standing alone, are insufficient to prove this element of a paternity claim, test results of this nature are relevant to whether sexual intercourse took place during the period of possible conception since they tend to make the existence of the fact that sexual intercourse took place during that time period more probable. Department of Human Servs. v. Moore, 632 So. 2d 929, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 110 (Miss. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       Absent some statutory pronouncement, as long as a defendant in a paternity action has a right to a jury trial, paternity test results, even though showing a high probability of paternity, cannot be conclusive as a matter of law; the weight to be given such evidence, along with the credibility of the parties involved, remains a question for the chancery court or the jury. Thus, a chancery court did not abuse its discretion in denying a plaintiff’s motion for a new trial after the jury found that the defendant was not the father, even though human leukocyte antigen test results showed that there was a probability of 99.59649 percent that the defendant was the child’s father, where there was a delay of nearly 12 years between the birth of the child and the filing of the paternity suit, the defendant testified that he had no knowledge of his alleged paternity until the filing of the suit, the plaintiff did not fare well under cross-examination, cross-examination of the defendant was practically non-existent, and the jury was able to view the mother, daughter, and putative father. Chisolm v. Eakes, 573 So. 2d 764, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 793 (Miss. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Where no error in jury’s verdict and order of filiation was found, and where sufficient evidence of father’s ability to pay and child’s reasonable needs was offered so that matter should have been resolved by court below in favor of order for support, remand for determination of support obligations of father pursuant to §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c09s93-9-7" target="_self">93-9-7</a></cite> and for entry of final order of filiation providing for support, education, and expenses of child as provided in §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c09s93-9-29" target="_self">93-9-29</a></cite> was appropriate.

       The Mississippi State Department of Health in cooperation with the Mississippi Department of Human Services shall develop a form and procedure which may be used to secure a voluntary acknowledgement of paternity from the mother and father of any child born out of wedlock in Mississippi. The form shall clearly state on its face that the execution of the acknowledgement of paternity shall result in the same legal effect as if the father and mother had been married at the time of the birth of the child. The form shall also clearly indicate the right of the alleged father to request genetic testing through the Department of Human Services within the one-year time period specified in subsection (2)(a)(i) of this section and shall state the adverse effects and ramifications of not availing himself of this one-time opportunity to definitively establish the paternity of the child. When such form has been completed according to the established procedure and the signatures of both the mother and father have been notarized, then such voluntary acknowledgement shall constitute a full determination of the legal parentage of the child. The completed voluntary acknowledgement of paternity shall be filed with the Bureau of Vital Statistics of the Mississippi State Department of Health. The name of the father shall be entered on the certificate of birth upon receipt of the completed voluntary acknowledgement.

       The Mississippi State Department of Health and the Mississippi Department of Human Services shall cooperate to establish procedures to facilitate the voluntary acknowledgement of paternity by both father and mother at the time of the birth of any child born out of wedlock. Such procedures shall establish responsibilities for each of the departments and for hospitals, birthing centers, midwives, and/or other birth attendants to seek and report voluntary acknowledgements of paternity.

The hospital, birthing center, midwife or other birth attendant shall be responsible for providing printed information, and audio visual material if available, related to the acknowledgement of paternity, and shall be required to provide notary services needed for the completion of acknowledgements of paternity. The information described above shall be provided to the mother and natural father, if present and identifiable, within twenty-four (24) hours of birth or before the mother is released.

       Issue of back child support was dismissed where, if the father wanted the chancellor to factor in specific considerations with regard to the back child support, he should have entered them into evidence at trial; the father made no mention as to any specific considerations he may have had regarding child support from 1997 to 2001.

   In an action by an illegitimate child demanding that she be declared the heir of her natural father, capable of inheriting from him under the Mississippi laws of descent and distribution, the order entered in favor of the illegitimate daughter would be reversed and the suit dismissed where the time for bringing the action was six years from the date of the daughter’s majority (§<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.15.html#t15c01s15-1-49" target="_blank">15-1-49</a></cite>) but the action was not commenced until 18 years after that date.

       Where the chancery court is contemplating issuing an order directing the Department of Health to change a birth certificate in fact situations covered by Section 41-57-23, the chancery court should require that the Department of Health be made a party to the lawsuit; nevertheless, in cases where a chancery court has ordered the Department of Health to make a correction to a birth certificate without having first made the department a party, the department should proceed based on that court order.

       The court shall, if need be, require the father to give security by bond or other security, with sufficient sureties approved by the court, for the payment of the order of filiation. Such security, when required, shall not exceed three (3) times the total periodic sum the father shall be required to pay under the terms of the order of filiation in any one (1) calendar year. If bond or security be required, and in case the action has been instituted by a public welfare official, the defendant shall also be required to give security that he will indemnify the state and the county where the child was or may be born and every other county against any expense for the support and education of the child, which said undertaking shall also require that all arrears shall be paid by the principal and sureties. In default of such security, when required, the court may commit him to jail, or put him on probation. At any time within one (1) year he may be discharged from jail, but his liability to pay the judgment shall not be thereby affected.

The judgment is a lien on real estate and in other respects enforceable the same as other judgments.

      No appeal however shall operate as a stay of execution unless the defendant shall give the security provided for in Sections 93-9-1 through 93-9-49, and further security to pay the costs of such appeal. If any such appeal shall be taken by a guardian ad litem, appointed for the child by the court, the court may in its discretion allow payment, for the actual disbursements made by the said guardian ad litem for taking appeal. When allowed by the judge and duly audited, said disbursement shall become a county charge and shall be paid by the county.

   Where the mother prevailed in a paternity suit against the father, the county court did not err by awarding her $ 7,517.18 in attorney’s fees based on an invoice submitted by her counsel. Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c09s93-9-45" target="_self">93-9-45</a></cite> makes the award of attorney’s fees automatic in a paternity suit where it is found that the man is the biological father of the child; the only qualifier incident to that award is that the attorney’s fees must be reasonable.

      The death of the mother shall not abate the paternity prosecution, if the child be living; but a suggestion of the fact shall be made, and the name of the child substituted in the proceedings for that of the mother, and a guardian ad litem shall be appointed by the court to prosecute the cause, who shall not be liable for costs; and in such case the testimony of the mother, taken in writing before the justice, may be read in evidence, and shall have the same force and effect as if she were living and had testified to the same in court.

      In all proceedings to determine the parentage of a child when the mother is dead, her declarations in her travail, proved to be her dying declarations, may, on the trial of the case, be received in evidence.

       Midwife’s testimony of statements of mother that defendant was father of child held incompetent in bastardy proceedings. Beeks v. Walker, 146 Miss. 400, 111 So. 567, 1927 Miss. LEXIS 195 (Miss. 1927).

      <p>
       The sole and only object of this section [Code 1942, § 391] was to extend the doctrine of dying declarations to such declarations of the mother in bastardy proceedings, and to place beyond controversy their admissibility, not merely as corroborative, but as original and substantive evidence. Johnson v. Walker, 86 Miss. 757, 39 So. 49, 1905 Miss. LEXIS 94 (Miss. 1905).

         In addition to the right to proceed under Section 93-5-23, Mississippi Code of 1972, and in addition to the remedy of habeas corpus in proper cases, and other existing remedies, the chancery court of the proper county shall have jurisdiction to entertain suits for the custody, care, support and maintenance of minor children and to hear and determine all such matters, and shall, if need be, require bond, sureties or other guarantee to secure any order for periodic payments for the maintenance or support of a child. In the event a legally responsible parent has health insurance available to him or her through an employer or organization that may extend benefits to the dependents of such parent, any order of support issued against such parent may require him or her to exercise the option of additional coverage in favor of such children as he or she is legally responsible to support. Proceedings may be brought by or against a resident or nonresident of the State of Mississippi, whether or not having the actual custody of minor children, for the purpose of judicially determining the legal custody of a child. All actions herein authorized may be brought in the county where the child is actually residing, or in the county of the residence of the party who has actual custody, or of the residence of the defendant. Process shall be had upon the parties as provided by law for process in person or by publication, if they be nonresidents of the state or residents of another jurisdiction or are not found therein after diligent search and inquiry or are unknown after diligent search and inquiry; provided that the court or chancellor in vacation may fix a date in termtime or in vacation to which process may be returnable and shall have power to proceed in termtime or vacation. Provided, however, that if the court shall find that both parties are fit and proper persons to have custody of the children, and that either party is able to adequately provide for the care and maintenance of the children, the chancellor may consider the preference of a child of twelve (12) years of age or older as to the parent with whom the child would prefer to live in determining what would be in the best interest and welfare of the child. The chancellor shall place on the record the reason or reasons for which the award of custody was made and explain in detail why the wishes of any child were or were not honored.
        </li>
        <li id="t93c11s93-11-65ol11b">
         An order of child support shall specify the sum to be paid weekly or otherwise. In addition to providing for support and education, the order shall also provide for the support of the child prior to the making of the order for child support, and such other expenses as the court may deem proper.
        </li>
        <li id="t93c11s93-11-65ol11c">
         The court may require the payment to be made to the custodial parent, or to some person or corporation to be designated by the court as trustee, but if the child or custodial parent is receiving public assistance, the Department of Human Services shall be made the trustee.

         The noncustodial parent’s liabilities for past education and necessary support and maintenance and other expenses are limited to a period of one (1) year next preceding the commencement of an action.

       Provided further, that where the proof shows that both parents have separate incomes or estates, the court may require that each parent contribute to the support and maintenance of the children in proportion to the relative financial ability of each.

       Whenever the court has ordered a party to make periodic payments for the maintenance or support of a child, but no bond, sureties or other guarantee has been required to secure such payments, and whenever such payments as have become due remain unpaid for a period of at least thirty (30) days, the court may, upon petition of the person to whom such payments are owing, or such person’s legal representative, enter an order requiring that bond, sureties or other security be given by the person obligated to make such payments, the amount and sufficiency of which shall be approved by the court. The obligor shall, as in other civil actions, be served with process and shall be entitled to a hearing in such case.

       When a charge of abuse or neglect of a child first arises in the course of a custody or maintenance action pending in the chancery court pursuant to this section, the chancery court may proceed with the investigation, hearing and determination of such abuse or neglect charge as a part of its hearing and determination of the custody or maintenance issue as between the parents, as provided in Section 43-21-151, notwithstanding the other provisions of the Youth Court Law. The proceedings in chancery court on the abuse or neglect charge shall be confidential in the same manner as provided in youth court proceedings, and the chancery court shall appoint a guardian ad litem in such cases, as provided under Section 43-21-121 for youth court proceedings, who shall be an attorney. In determining whether any portion of a guardian ad litem’s fee shall be assessed against any party or parties as a cost of court for reimbursement to the county, the court shall consider each party’s individual ability to pay. Unless the chancery court’s jurisdiction has been terminated, all disposition orders in such cases for placement with the Department of Human Services shall be reviewed by the court or designated authority at least annually to determine if continued placement with the department is in the best interest of the child or the public.

       Each party to a paternity or child support proceeding shall notify the other within five (5) days after any change of address. In addition, the noncustodial and custodial parent shall file and update, with the court and with the state case registry, information on that party’s location and identity, including social security number, residential and mailing addresses, telephone numbers, photograph, driver’s license number, and name, address and telephone number of the party’s employer. This information shall be required upon entry of an order or within five (5) days of a change of address.

      <li id="t93c11s93-11-65ol11d6">
       In any case subsequently enforced by the Department of Human Services pursuant to Title IV-D of the Social Security Act, the court shall have continuing jurisdiction.

       In any subsequent child support enforcement action between the parties, upon sufficient showing that diligent effort has been made to ascertain the location of a party, due process requirements for notice and service of process shall be deemed to be met with respect to the party upon delivery of written notice to the most recent residential or employer address filed with the state case registry.

       In wife’s action for delinquent child support and delinquent spousal support, there were two judgments, an interim judgment, which did not mention the husband’s motion for modification, and the final judgment which stated that the motion for modification was denied; applying Brennan v. Brennan, the appellate court held the entry of the latter judgment, effective retroactively to the former judgment, cleansed the husband’s hands, since it was the first judgment that was entered after the trial court specifically refused to hear the husband’s motion for modification due to the fact that the husband came into court with unclean hands. Cook v. Whiddon, 866 So. 2d 494, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 130 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       In simultaneous divorce and paternity actions, the biological father sought to have parental rights terminated, and the husband, who believed for years that the husband was the child’s father, sought to be declared the child’s legal father, but joinder of claims was not allowed, and with regard to the separate paternity action, the biological father was ordered to pay child support until some further order in the divorce proceedings supplanted that obligation. Griffith v. Pell, 881 So. 2d 227, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 786 (Miss. Ct. App. 2003), aff'd, 881 So. 2d 184, 2004 Miss. LEXIS 975 (Miss. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where there was no indication that the chancellor considered the Albright factors or the requirements set forth in the statute before rendering her decision that the child should be placed in her father’s custody, the court reversed and remanded the issue of the child’s custody and instructed the chancellor to support her findings that the father was better suited to be the custodial parent. Formigoni v. Formigoni, 733 So. 2d 868, 1999 Miss. App. LEXIS 17 (Miss. Ct. App. 1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       In matters concerning child custody, reviewing court will not reverse Chancery Court’s factual findings, be they of ultimate fact or of evidentiary fact, where there is substantial evidence in the record supporting these findings of fact. Touchstone v. Touchstone, 682 So. 2d 374, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 534 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancellor’s findings regarding child custody will not be disturbed when supported by substantial evidence unless the chancellor abused his discretion, was manifestly wrong or clearly erroneous or applied an erroneous legal standard.

       In all child custody cases, polestar consideration is the best interest of the child. Touchstone v. Touchstone, 682 So. 2d 374, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 534 (Miss. 1996).

       In all child custody cases, polestar consideration is best interest of child. Riley v. Doerner, 677 So. 2d 740, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 287 (Miss. 1996).

       The presumption in favor of awarding custody of a child to a natural parent should prevail over any imperative regarding the separating of siblings. Sellers v. Sellers, 638 So. 2d 481, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 311 (Miss. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a proceeding to determine custody of a minor child, the chancellor erred in rendering his opinion based on the summarized testimony of what the attorneys believed vital witnesses would have said; in utilizing the summarized testimony, the chancellor was not in a position to view the demeanor and judge the credibility of the witnesses, and therefore failed to fully assess and consider the fitness of the parties to care for the child. Murphy v. Murphy, 631 So. 2d 812, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 76 (Miss. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a hearing on a motion for a new trial in a proceeding to determine custody of a minor child, the chancellor erred in rendering the issue of the parties’ fitness res judicata and refusing to hear additional testimony and consider expert reports submitted by social workers; chancellors in child custody cases should consider any and all evidence which aids them in reaching the ultimate custody decision, and the ability to hear and consider additional evidence is at all times within a chancellor’s authority in matters concerning child custody. Murphy v. Murphy, 631 So. 2d 812, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 76 (Miss. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       A child custody order awarding the father custody of the parties’ 2 children would be vacated where the mother did not have sufficient time to prepare for 2 adverse witnesses and the custody question was extremely close, so that the mother’s lack of an opportunity to prepare for the witnesses could have affected the evidence presented and, necessarily, the chancellor’s decision. Schepens v. Schepens, 592 So. 2d 108, 1991 Miss. LEXIS 983 (Miss. 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       The evidence was sufficient to support a finding that a father had discharged his obligation to support his daughter where the parents modified the custody and child support provisions of their divorce decree by an agreement under which the father took custody of the daughter and the child support payment made by the father to the mother for their three children was proportionately reduced, and the father subsequently made substantial direct payments to the daughter for her support. Although court-ordered child support payments vest in the child as they accrue and may not thereafter be modified or forgiven, this does not mean that equity may not at times suggest ex post facto approval of extra-judicial adjustments in the manner and form in which support payments have been made. Varner v. Varner, 588 So. 2d 428, 1991 Miss. LEXIS 719 (Miss. 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   A child custody agreement which provides that the child or children must until majority reside in a particular community, is contrary to the best interests of the children and should not be approved by the court. Such agreements that have been approved are unenforceable. It is presumptuous for anyone, court or otherwise, to declare as an absolute that it is in the best interest of a young child that he or she spend his or her entire minority in a single community. Thus, courts may not require that children be reared in a single community come what may, and divorcing parents may not make such agreements which courts are obligated to enforce. Chancery courts must refuse to approve any child custody agreement presented under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c05s93-5-2" target="_self">93-5-2</a></cite> or otherwise which mandates, without exception, that children be raised in a given community. Such agreements do not make “adequate and sufficient” provisions for the care and maintenance of children. Bell v. Bell, 572 So. 2d 841, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 582 (Miss. 1990), modified, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 869 (Miss. Dec. 12, 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       A custody agreement which called for a change in custody of the children from the mother to the father on relocation by the mother was void and contrary to public policy. The court cannot surrender or subordinate its jurisdiction and authority as to the circumstances and conditions which will cause a change in custody. McManus v. Howard, 569 So. 2d 1213, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 669 (Miss. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       When employing escalation clauses for child support, the bench and bar are urged to: (a) specify with certainty the specific cost of living or consumer price index which is to be utilized; (b) show the applicable ratio (present CPI is to ascertainable CPI as present award is to future award); (c) calculate the base figure as of the date of judgment; (d) establish frequency of adjustment (nothing less than yearly is suggested); and (e) establish an effective date for each adjustment (e.g. anniversary of date of judgment.) Caution should be exercised in applying a consumer price index that comports with Mississippi’s economic picture, as well as the parent’s job status. Wing v. Wing, 549 So. 2d 944, 1989 Miss. LEXIS 443 (Miss. 1989).
      </p>
      <p>
       Escalation clauses should be included in child support decrees since strong public policy calls for provision for increased financial needs of children without additional litigation, incurring attorney’s fees, court congestion and delay, and emotional trauma. Wing v. Wing, 549 So. 2d 944, 1989 Miss. LEXIS 443 (Miss. 1989).
      </p>
      <p>
       A father was not in contempt for failure to pay child support under an automatic adjustment clause of a property settlement agreement where the agreement was uncertain in that a genuine dispute existed over the amount owed, over the commencement year of the escalation clause, and over which consumer price index was to be utilized. Wing v. Wing, 549 So. 2d 944, 1989 Miss. LEXIS 443 (Miss. 1989).
      </p>
      <p>
       A chancellor erred in declining to award attorney’s fees to a child’s maternal grandparents for defending a custody action brought by the child’s father, who had killed the child’s mother. Veselits v. Cruthirds, 548 So. 2d 1312, 1989 Miss. LEXIS 430 (Miss. 1989).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial courts have the authority to allocate income tax dependency exemptions by ordering the custodial parent to sign the required release where the equities of the case favor such action. A trial court’s authority to allocate the exemption to the non-custodial parent reduces the amount of income tax to be paid to the federal government, and produces a tax saving to the non-custodial parent which exceeds the moderate increase in the tax liability of the custodial parent. This result will almost always prevail where, as is often the case, the custodial parent’s adjusted gross income is less than the adjusted gross income of the non-custodial parent. In such a situation, the after-tax spendable income of the non-custodial parent is increased. This savings in tax liability could easily be channeled into increased child support or other payments thereby rendering the custodial parent’s after-tax spendable income, including child support or other payments, the same or better than if he or she had claimed the dependency exemption. Nichols v. Tedder, 547 So. 2d 766, 1989 Miss. LEXIS 328 (Miss. 1989).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a divorce suit to which the maternal grandmother of children, whose custody was awarded to their mother, was not a party, the decree was not res judicata in the grandmother’s subsequent custody suit, which she filed after the mother was killed in an automobile accident, on the question whether the father of the children was an unfit parent, and in such custody suit testimony relating to the father’s character and conduct prior to the divorce decree was admissible. Lundy v. Lundy, 259 So. 2d 710, 1972 Miss. LEXIS 1547 (Miss. 1972).
      </p>
      <p>
       A decree in a custody proceeding, adjudicating that a father had abandoned his child and awarding custody to the maternal grandmother, was not res judicata with respect to the father’s petition in which he sought a modification of the decree on the ground of a change in circumstances, since such rule would be too rigid and inflexible for such a sensitive area of the law as the custody of a child, the most important consideration in such case being what is for the best interest of the child. Thompson v. Foster, 244 So. 2d 395, 1971 Miss. LEXIS 1328 (Miss. 1971).

        2. Factors in determining custody—extramarital conduct.
       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       Court properly granted custody to a husband because he had a more stable employment history, the wife disregarded court orders, she cohabited with her fiance who had issues with domestic abuse toward his previous wives and children, and the fiance was accused of molestation of one of his children and corporal punishment of the wife’s children. Mayfield v. Mayfield, 956 So. 2d 337, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 300 (Miss. Ct. App. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       An award of custody to the father based on the finding that the father was more morally fit than the mother to care for the child was erroneous to the extent that it was based on a finding of adultery by the wife where the evidence of adultery was neither clear nor convincing and did not rise above mere conjecture. McAdory v. McAdory, 608 So. 2d 695, 1992 Miss. LEXIS 600 (Miss. 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       An extramarital relationship is not, per se, an adverse circumstance warranting modification of a custody decree. Thus, a chancellor’s modification of a joint child custody decree by forbidding the mother to continue conducting her “illicit” relationship with her male friend while her daughter resided with her was sufficient where there was no substantial credible evidence showing an adverse change affecting the child of such proportions that the child’s best interest would be served by further modifying the custody decree.

       A custody agreement which called for a change in custody of the children from the mother to the father on relocation by the mother was void and contrary to public policy.

       A trial court did not abuse its discretion in awarding custody of 2 minor children to their father, though both parents were suitable choices for custody, where the mother had previously “secreted the children” for approximately three weeks, and the father had possession of the parties’ house which would give the children stability of the home environment and place them in familiar surroundings.

      <p>
       In a father’s action seeking a change in child custody from the mother to the father, evidence of the father’s treatment of the mother and the child prior to the parties’ divorce was manifestly material to the issue of the fitness of the father to have custody of the child, where the divorce decree indicated that the court had found merit to the mother’s charges of habitual cruel and inhuman treatment.

       A mother was unfit to have custody of her children where she had used marijuana in the children’s presence, she sometimes slept until 11:00 a.m. and the children would already be outside, unsupervised, by that time, and there was testimony that the children had not been adequately fed or clothed and that there had been a resulting deleterious effect on their health.

       A chancellor did not err in his determination that a material change in circumstances adverse to the welfare and best interests of the children warranted a change in custody from the mother to the father where the mother had moved and changed employment several times during the year after the parties’ divorce, daycare arrangements were similarly changed, the mother had subjected the children to numerous unwarranted physical and psychological examinations, not for treatment, but for investigation and interrogation as to alleged sexual abuse, and the daughter had exhibited distress and disturbance when being returned to the mother at the end of a visitation period with the father, while the father held a stable position and maintained a stable home, with his parents providing alternative care.

       Chancery court did not err in declining to honor an eldest child’s stated preference to live with the child’s mother, when the mother sought to relocate to another state, because it was within the chancellor’s discretion to adopt the family master’s recommendation to award custody to the father. The family master found that stability of the home environment, with which the parties’ children were familiar, favored the father primarily because the father had been with the children and with the mother until recently.

       Two children’s preference to live with the children’s father did not make awarding the children’s custody to the children’s mother erroneous because (1) the children’s preference was non-binding, and (2) the children’s preference was accounted for by awarding the father extra visitation.

   where the chancellor had concerns that the mother had coached the

   based upon a proffer), and the preference of the child did not have
   much bearing considering that the majority of the Albright factors
   favored the father.

       While the chancellor found that a child’s preference was to live with her grandmother, the appellate court did not consider this factor because the child was not of the legal age for her preference to be considered.

       Chancellor, who referenced the mother’s immature and criminal actions after she separated from the children’s father, and her sleeping with her boyfriend and allowing his 17-year-old daughter to sleep with her oldest daughter, appropriately explained his reasons for awarding custody to the father, even though the oldest children expressed a preference to reside with their mother.

       Even if the judgment was interpreted as not honoring the child’s preference because the husband was not awarded primary custody, the chancellor explained his reasoning when he stated this appeared to be a classic case in which the court should consider – and did consider – an award of joint physical custody of these children.

      </p>
      <p>
       Although the daughters of a mother and father expressed desire to live with the father, the chancellor was correct not to consider the children’s preference because there was no evidence to support a material or substantial change in circumstances; the children’s preference alone could not constitute a material or substantial change in circumstances.

Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c11s93-11-65" target="_self">93-11-65</a></cite>, a chancery court erred by dismissing a mother’s custody modification request prior to hearing from the children; this would have been a main source of evidence regarding whether or not there was a substantial change of circumstances.

       <p>
   Reversal of a trial court’s denial of a mother’s request for modification of a child custody order based on changed circumstances was required because, although a guardian ad litem was properly appointed under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c05s93-5-23" target="_self">93-5-23</a></cite> based on allegations of abuse, the chancellor rejected the guardian’s recommendations but did not state the reasons for doing so in the order, nor did he summarize those recommendations as required; in addition, the chancellor did not explain his reasons for declining to follow the child’s preference to live with his mother as required by Miss.

       Mother’s argument that her 14-year-old daughter’s preference for living with her mother should have been given significant weight, if not directly followed, was rejected because an expert testified that because of the symbiotic relationship between mother and daughter, and the effect that relationship had on her, the daughter may not have had another option other than to claim that she preferred to live with her mother; the expert also testified that the daughter was excessively dependent on her mother, which could lead to psychological problems in the daughter’s future.

   Court rejected the father’s claim that the trial court erred in failing to consider his daughter’s preference to live with him because although Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c11s93-11-65" target="_self">93-11-65</a></cite> allows a child who has attained the age of 12 to state her preference to the court as to whether she would rather live with her mother or father, the trial court is not bound to follow the child’s preference. Furthermore, there is no authority to support a conclusion that a child’s statement, in and of itself, of his or her preference to live with the non-custodial parent would rise to the level of a material or substantial change of circumstances to justify modification of custody. D.A.P. v. C.A.P.R. (In re E. C. P.), 918 So. 2d 809, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 439 (Miss. Ct. App. 2005).

       Section 93-11-65, which allows a child over the age of 12 the privilege of choosing the parent with whom the child shall live, does not provide any authority which would allow a child to choose a third party, such as a grandparent, over a natural parent.

   In determining whether there was a substantial and material change in circumstances to warrant a modification of child custody, the lower court would be required to consider the fact that the child had chosen to live with his mother, as well as the fact that the child had passed 12 years of age and could qualify under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c11s93-11-65" target="_self">93-11-65</a></cite> to choose his custodial parent, as factors to be considered on remand along with any other evidence the parties wished to produce.

It is an incident of custody that the parent having physical custody provide a residence for the child where he or she thinks is appropriate; the location of this residence is a matter committed to the discretion of the custodial parent in the first instance. A court may only intervene where there has been a material change in circumstances which adversely affect the child and it is shown that the best interests of the child require a modification of custody; a change of residence is not per se a change of circumstance.

       Substantial basis for Chancellor’s finding of viable relationship between minor child and his paternal grandparents, supporting grandparents’ petition for visitation rights following parents’ divorce, was provided by evidence that grandparents gave financial support to parents before parents’ separation through use of grandparents’ gas credit card and monetary support, and that grandparents regularly visited child both before and after parents’ separation. Settle v. Galloway, 682 So. 2d 1032, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 573 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Substantial basis for Chancellor’s finding that granting visitation rights to minor child’s paternal grandparents was in child’s best interest, supporting grandparents’ petition for visitation rights following parents’ divorce, was provided by evidence that child would have little exposure to his father, who was stationed away from home as member of United States Navy, but for child’s contact with grandparents, who exchanged videotapes with father. Settle v. Galloway, 682 So. 2d 1032, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 573 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Granting paternal grandparents right to every-other-weekend visitation with their grandchild was not excessive, where primary basis was father’s inability to exercise his parental visitation rights due to his being stationed away from home as member of United States Navy, and where the right was to be concurrent with any visitation exercised by father. Settle v. Galloway, 682 So. 2d 1032, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 573 (Miss. 1996).

       Natural grandparents have no common-law right of visitation with their grandchildren; such right must come from legislative enactment. Settle v. Galloway, 682 So. 2d 1032, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 573 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Natural grandparents’ statutory right to visit their grandchildren is not as comprehensive as parents’ visitation rights. Settle v. Galloway, 682 So. 2d 1032, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 573 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       A chancellor erred in amending a visitation order to restrict a father’s visitation with his two daughters to daytime hours on the basis that he taught his children Christian principles while living with a woman to whom he was not married where there was not substantial evidence in the record supporting the chancellor’s finding that the children were confused by the father’s alleged hypocrisy; moreover, even if the children were confused or did not like their father’s living arrangements, that is not the type of harm that rises to the level necessary to overcome the presumption that a non-custodial parent is entitled to overnight visitation. Harrington v. Harrington, 648 So. 2d 543, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 632 (Miss. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       A chancellor erred in suspending all visitation rights of a father, even though there was ample evidence that the child had been sexually abused, where there was not substantial credible evidence that the father was the abuser; however, the evidence warranted restriction of visitation, since there was conflicting evidence as to the identity of the abuser. Doe v. Doe, 644 So. 2d 1199, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 528 (Miss. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       A chancellor abused his discretion in requiring that during a mother’s visitation with her minor child the child could not be in the presence of “any male companion not related to her by blood or marriage,” since such a sweeping restriction was clearly overbroad; the fact that a parent is having an affair is not enough to create the danger requisite to limit visitation with a child. Chamblee v. Chamblee, 637 So. 2d 850, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 285 (Miss. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       A chancellor erred in determining that a father was not entitled to regular overnight visitation with his minor son, where there was no substantial evidence in the record tending to show that such visitation would be detrimental to the son in any way, since non-custodial parents are presumptively entitled to regular overnight visitation with their children. Wood v. Wood, 579 So. 2d 1271, 1991 Miss. LEXIS 308 (Miss. 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       There was no abuse of discretion in visitation provisions which granted a father visitation with his 15-year-old son 7 days at Christmas and 2 weeks during the summer, “and such other visitation as could be worked out” between the father and son, where the father had voluntarily moved to another state which made regular visitation more difficult, the father chose to live in a home which was several levels below what he could actually afford and provided little or no testimony of features of the home which might be conducive to visitation, and the son testified that he disliked the father. Caldwell v. Caldwell, 579 So. 2d 543, 1991 Miss. LEXIS 236 (Miss. 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       When a non-custodial parent has unsupervised visitation rights, the custodial parent has no right to interfere with the non-custodial parent’s visitation with his or her children. Thus, a mother’s wishes that her children not fly in a private plane was not sufficient to deny the father the right to provide flying lessons or to fly his children in his private airplane during his visitation hours, where there was no evidence that flying would endanger the children’s lives or that the children were opposed to flying or taking flying lessons. Mord v. Peters, 571 So. 2d 981, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 716 (Miss. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       A chancellor did not abuse his discretion in ordering that a mother’s visitation with her children was to be exercised outside the presence of the mother’s lesbian partner. White v. Thompson, 569 So. 2d 1181, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 631 (Miss. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       Visitation privileges should be reasonable and appropriate, fostering a positive and harmonious relationship between the children and parent. Stevison v. Woods, 560 So. 2d 176, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 205 (Miss. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       A chancellor did not err in severely restricting a mother’s visitation with her children to not more than once per week, for no more than one and 1/2 hours, in the father’s home, where the mother had secreted the children and refused to deliver them in defiance of a court order changing custody from the mother to the father; the safety and welfare of the minor children compelled the chancellor to act in their best interest, protecting them from abduction by the mother. Newsom v. Newsom, 557 So. 2d 511, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 43 (Miss. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the chancellor found that a father who had killed his child’s mother was mentally and morally unfit to have the child’s custody, and granted complete custody to the maternal grandparents, it was not error for the chancellor to grant liberal visitation rights to the father. Veselits v. Cruthirds, 548 So. 2d 1312, 1989 Miss. LEXIS 430 (Miss. 1989).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Mississippi court had continuing jurisdiction to enforce its prior order awarding custody of a child to his father, visitation to his mother, and requiring the father to post a ne exeat bond, even though the father and child had moved to Illinois and had filed a petition for modification of visitation rights in Illinois, where the father was still subject to the ne exeat bond to comply with the prior order and the Mississippi court exercised continuous and ongoing jurisdiction of the matter with full notice and appearance by all parties. Roberts v. Fuhr, 523 So. 2d 20, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2891 (Miss. 1987).

       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       Chancellor erred in finding a material change in circumstances warranting modification, as the mother failed to present any proof that the father’s living situation had changed at all since the modified divorce decree was entered, that it had adversely affected the child, or that the child was in danger. Campbell v. Watts, 192 So.3d 317, 2015 Miss. App. LEXIS 538 (Miss. Ct. App. 2015), cert. denied, 202 So.3d 208, 2016 Miss. LEXIS 209 (Miss. 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       Child’s election alone was not sufficient to support a finding of a change in circumstances. Campbell v. Watts, 192 So.3d 317, 2015 Miss. App. LEXIS 538 (Miss. Ct. App. 2015), cert. denied, 202 So.3d 208, 2016 Miss. LEXIS 209 (Miss. 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancery court properly denied a mother’s petition for modification of child custody because the chancellor was in the best position to assess the witnesses, did not believe a mother’s assertions of sexual abuse, and did believe a father’s explanations with regard to the allegations. The father explained that their daughter had a diaper rash requiring him to put Desitin on the affected area and that the daughter was bitten while playing at school with other children. Lorenz v. Strait, 987 So. 2d 427, 2008 Miss. LEXIS 359 (Miss. 2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       Mother was not entitled to an increase in child support because, based on the evidence, including the parties’ Miss. Unif. Ch. Ct. R. 8.05 financial statements, she failed to show a material change in circumstances; the fact that the parties’ children had aged was not determinative absent a showing that a corresponding increase in expenses was not foreseeable when the parties’ first stipulated to child support, and there was no showing of a material change based on one child’s medical issues as it was not shown that those issues would persist. McNair v. Clark, 961 So. 2d 73, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 473 (Miss. Ct. App. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Transfer of paramount physical custody from the mother to the father was proper where the mother’s relocation out of state with the children created a material change in circumstances adversely affecting the welfare of the children. In addition, one of the children, the 13-year-old, expressed a legally relevant desire to live with her father pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c11s93-11-65" target="_self">93-11-65</a></cite>. Marter v. Marter, 914 So. 2d 743, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 477 (Miss. Ct. App. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Termination of the father’s future duty to provide child support was awarded by the trial court where it found that there was a breakdown in the parent-child relationship; however, it was to be expected that there would be some unpleasantness coming from a child who had had no relationship with his father and when the father had been behind in his child support payments, and that such conduct was not sufficiently clear and extreme to forfeit his right to support from his father. Dep't of Human Servs. v. Marshall, 859 So. 2d 387, 2003 Miss. LEXIS 658 (Miss. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the 12-year-old son expressed a preference to live with his father, there was not any change of circumstances warranting modification of custody from the mother to the father, as there was no declaration by the child of sound, reasonable, and compelling reasons why he thought the change of custody was in his best interests, and the father had presented no convincing evidence that the custodial situation with the mother had deteriorated to adversely affect the child’s welfare. Best v. Hinton, 838 So. 2d 306, 2002 Miss. App. LEXIS 494 (Miss. Ct. App. 2002), cert. denied, 837 So. 2d 771, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 176 (Miss. Ct. App. 2003).

       It was harmless error to extend psychotherapist-patient privilege to exclude licensed clinical social worker’s testimony, in action to modify custody provisions of divorce decree, regarding mother’s interference with and “coaching” of child while he was being examined, where mother freely acknowledged her participation in the examination session. Touchstone v. Touchstone, 682 So. 2d 374, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 534 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Custody may be modified where environment provided by the custodial parent is found to be adverse to the child’s best interest and circumstances of the noncustodial parent have changed such that he or she is able to provide an environment more suitable than that of the custodial parent. Touchstone v. Touchstone, 682 So. 2d 374, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 534 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Neither nasty exchanges between former spouses when picking up or dropping off child for visitation, nor former wife’s implication that former husband had sexually abused child warranted change in custody; although child was subjected to some gross unpleasantries between his parents, record did not remotely suggest that these episodes were characteristic of the overall circumstances in which he lived. Touchstone v. Touchstone, 682 So. 2d 374, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 534 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Isolated incident, e.g., an unwarranted striking of a child, does not in and of itself justify a change of custody; rather, it must be the overall circumstances in which a child lives, likely to remain unchanged in the foreseeable future and adversely impacting a child, to warrant change of custody. Touchstone v. Touchstone, 682 So. 2d 374, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 534 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court did not abuse its discretion by excluding, in custody modification proceeding, arguably repetitive testimony concerning incident in which mother bit another woman on the arm. Touchstone v. Touchstone, 682 So. 2d 374, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 534 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Unsubstantiated request for attorney fees would be denied, given that there were no “good guys” in child custody modification action at issue and that former husband’s appeal raised issue of first impression with regard to scope of psychotherapist-patient privilege. Touchstone v. Touchstone, 682 So. 2d 374, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 534 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Change in circumstances warranting modification of custody is one in overall living conditions in which child is found. Riley v. Doerner, 677 So. 2d 740, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 287 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Totality of circumstances must be considered in determining whether to modify child custody. Riley v. Doerner, 677 So. 2d 740, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 287 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Change of circumstances in noncustodial parent is not in and of itself sufficient to warrant a modification of custody. Riley v. Doerner, 677 So. 2d 740, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 287 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       When environment provided by custodial parent is found to be adverse to child’s best interest, and circumstances of noncustodial parent have changed such that he or she is able to provide an environment more suitable than that of custodial parent, Chancellor may modify custody accordingly. Riley v. Doerner, 677 So. 2d 740, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 287 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a child living in a custodial environment clearly adverse to child’s best interest somehow appears to remain unscarred by his or her surroundings, Chancellor is not precluded from removing child for placement in a healthier environment. Riley v. Doerner, 677 So. 2d 740, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 287 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence that home of custodial parent is site of dangerous and illegal behavior, such as drug use, may be sufficient to justify a modification of custody, even without a specific finding that environment has adversely affected child’s welfare. Riley v. Doerner, 677 So. 2d 740, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 287 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Once Chancellor determined that mother’s home was site of illegal drug use, as well as other behavior adverse to child’s welfare, and determined that father’s circumstances had improved such that he was able to provide a good home for child, it was within his discretion to transfer custody from mother to father, despite fact that Chancellor could not discern any negative effect on child caused by mother’s home environment. Riley v. Doerner, 677 So. 2d 740, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 287 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancellor is never obliged to ignore a child’s best interest in weighing a custody change; in fact, a Chancellor is bound to consider child’s best interest above all else. Riley v. Doerner, 677 So. 2d 740, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 287 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Test for custody modification need not be applied so rigidly, nor in such a formalistic manner, so as to preclude Chancellor from rendering a decision appropriate to facts of individual case. Riley v. Doerner, 677 So. 2d 740, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 287 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       A chancellor erred in changing custody of a 6-year-old girl from her mother to her father based solely on the child’s unusual knowledge of sexual conduct allegedly gained from her accidental exposure to sexual relations between her mother and stepfather where the totality of the facts and circumstances failed to support a finding that the child’s best interest would be served by a change in custody. Smith v. Jones, 654 So. 2d 480, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 151 (Miss. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       A chancellor erred in failing to grant a father’s request for modification of custody of his 18-year old daughter where both parents and the daughter agreed that she should be in the father’s custody, she had been living with the father, and the chancellor had reduced the father’s child support obligation to reflect this living arrangement. Shelton v. Shelton, 653 So. 2d 283, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 150 (Miss. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       An extramarital relationship is not, per se, an adverse circumstance warranting modification of a custody decree. Thus, a chancellor’s modification of a joint child custody decree by forbidding the mother to continue conducting her “illicit” relationship with her male friend while her daughter resided with her was sufficient where there was no substantial credible evidence showing an adverse change affecting the child of such proportions that the child’s best interest would be served by further modifying the custody decree. Morrow v. Morrow, 591 So. 2d 829, 1991 Miss. LEXIS 868 (Miss. 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   In determining whether there was a substantial and material change in circumstances to warrant a modification of child custody, the lower court would be required to consider the fact that the child had chosen to live with his mother, as well as the fact that the child had passed 12 years of age and could qualify under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c11s93-11-65" target="_self">93-11-65</a></cite> to choose his custodial parent, as factors to be considered on remand along with any other evidence the parties wished to produce. Polk v. Polk, 589 So. 2d 123, 1991 Miss. LEXIS 820 (Miss. 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       The evidence did not reflect a material change in the circumstances of a child and his parents, which adversely affected the child, to the extent that a change of custody from the mother to the father was warranted, where the mother called upon the father for help when she fell upon hard times, the father had custody of the child for 16 months while the mother had liberal visitation, and the mother asked the father to restore custody to her when her situation stabilized, but the father declined; the parties’ act, in temporarily modifying the custody decree, was not binding upon the court. Arnold v. Conwill, 562 So. 2d 97, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 227 (Miss. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       A chancellor was not “manifestly in error” in refusing to modify the custody of 2 children from their father to their mother, even though the father’s activities in attempting to exclude the mother from the children’s lives were very iniquitous and hurtful to the children, where the mother failed to show a material change in circumstances that adversely affected the children. Stevison v. Woods, 560 So. 2d 176, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 205 (Miss. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       A chancellor did not err in his determination that a material change in circumstances adverse to the welfare and best interests of the children warranted a change in custody from the mother to the father where the mother had moved and changed employment several times during the year after the parties’ divorce, daycare arrangements were similarly changed, the mother had subjected the children to numerous unwarranted physical and psychological examinations, not for treatment, but for investigation and interrogation as to alleged sexual abuse, and the daughter had exhibited distress and disturbance when being returned to the mother at the end of a visitation period with the father, while the father held a stable position and maintained a stable home, with his parents providing alternative care. Newsom v. Newsom, 557 So. 2d 511, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 43 (Miss. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       There are 2 prerequisites to a modification of child custody. First, the moving party must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that, after the entry of the judgment sought to be modified, there has been a material change in circumstances which adversely affects the welfare of the child. Second, if such an adverse change has been shown, the moving party must show by like evidence that the best interest of the child requires the change of custody. Phillips v. Phillips, 555 So. 2d 698, 1989 Miss. LEXIS 510 (Miss. 1989).
      </p>
      <p>
       A father was entitled to regain custody of his minor son from the child’s maternal grandmother, who had been awarded the custody previously, where a change in circumstances was shown in that, since his discharge from military service, the father had obtained a job as a barber earning approximately $80 per week, had additional income from the G. I. bill, was attending college, had remarried and was living in a good neighborhood, and, further, that he had visited the child often in the home of the grandmother and had contributed regularly to the child’s support. Thompson v. Foster, 244 So. 2d 395, 1971 Miss. LEXIS 1328 (Miss. 1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       A decree in a custody proceeding, adjudicating that a father had abandoned his child and awarding custody to the maternal grandmother, was not res judicata with respect to the father’s petition in which he sought a modification of the decree on the ground of a change in circumstances, since such rule would be too rigid and inflexible for such a sensitive area of the law as the custody of a child, the most important consideration in such case being what is for the best interest of the child. Thompson v. Foster, 244 So. 2d 395, 1971 Miss. LEXIS 1328 (Miss. 1971).

   Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c11s93-11-65" target="_self">93-11-65</a></cite>, nor indirectly through

   Pursuant to Miss.

The Chancery Court of Rankin County did not possess continuing jurisdiction over the child as the result of a 1978 habeas corpus proceeding which awarded custody of the child to its father since a habeas corpus court is a special court convened to try a single cause, and when a final judgment is rendered, its functions and powers cease; the holding in Leggett v.

   In a child custody proceeding brought by the mother pursuant to this section, the trial court’s error in dismissing the mother’s action was harmless where the court immediately held a full hearing on the father’s petition for a writ of habeas corpus, which hearing was the same as would have been held under the mother’s original suit; the trial court had jurisdiction to hear the mother’s suit alleging a change of circumstances, where the Alabama court that had granted custody to the father had the right to modify the terms of the decree. Further, the trial court had complete jurisdiction to hear a child custody matter in a habeas corpus proceeding under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.11.html#t11c43s11-43-1" target="_blank">11-43-1</a></cite>.

      <p>
       The authority of the court mentioned in Code 1942, § 1263.5, does not act to deprive the original chancery court of jurisdiction of child custody cases where custody has been awarded in a divorce proceeding previously filed, and this is true although the child is later removed to another county.

      <p>
       The rule being well established that a chancery court which grants the custody of children in a divorce proceeding has, as between the same parties, continuing exclusive jurisdiction to modify the decree upon subsequent changed circumstances, the chancery court in the county in which the children and divorced parents resided was without jurisdiction to modify the decree of custody entered by the chancery court of another county, notwithstanding the statute providing that an action to determine the legal custody of a child may be brought in the county where the child is actually residing, in the county of residence of a party who has actual custody, or in the county of the residence of the defendant.

      </p>
      <p>
       Assuming that the chancery court did not have jurisdiction to render a divorce decree, the court did have jurisdiction to entertain the proceeding with respect to the custody, care, support, and maintenance of the minor children of the parties where the husband to whom custody was awarded and the children were physically present within the county in which the action was brought at the time the decree was entered.

       This section [Code 1942, § 1263.5] was intended to give the chancery court independent jurisdiction of suits for the custody of minor children and implements its constitutional power in this respect, and a custody proceeding brought to modify an agreed judgment entered in a prior habeas corpus proceeding will be treated as if brought under this section.

       Chancery court did not abuse its discretion by not appointing a guardian ad litem (GAL) sua sponte in a contempt proceeding because a mother never asked the chancery court to appoint a GAL; the appointment of a GAL was not mandatory because the mother failed to cite to any concrete allegation of abuse.

       Chancellor sufficiently addressed a report by a guardian ad litem (GAL) report because the chancellor’s ruling was consistent with the GAL’s recommendation. Furthermore, the chancellor did not err or abuse its discretion by giving the GAL’s opinion some weight because the GAL’s testimony did not indicate bias, prejudgment of the case, or an improper view of his role, but simply reflected that, based on the evidence gathered during the investigation, the GAL had a definite opinion as to which parent was to have custody.

      <p>
       Chancery court did not err in failing to appoint a guardian ad litem, sua sponte, to investigate a father’s allegations of neglect because the allegations were either not severe enough to require investigation or were adequately investigated by an agent of the court who acted as a guardian ad litem in all but name, the agent, the parties, and the court all seemed to have understood the agent to have been assigned to act as a neutral, investigative agent for the court, and, while the mother’s home environment could have had some harmful effects on the child and the father was more attendant to her care, a pediatric endocrinologist found no evidence that the child was abused or neglected.

       Plaintiff’s tort action based on events that occurred when he was 19 years old was timely as it was filed less than three years after his 21st birthday; removal of the disability of minority did not arise automatically upon the occurrence of specified events except for reaching the age of 21, and thus, plaintiff’s emancipation did not trigger the automatic removal of disability of minority.

       Chancery court did not err by ordering the payment of some child support from the veteran’s benefits of a father because there was no indication that his benefits were being garnished; moreover, he failed to show that he had waived a portion or all of his retirement benefits in order to receive greater disability benefits.

       Father’s request to terminate child support for his eldest son was properly denied because the facts did not show that their relationship had deteriorated to the necessary point merely based on the fact that the two did not communicate after the father filed a legal action against the mother alleging abuse; the relationship could have been salvaged, and the father had not done everything possible to try and repair it.

       When an action for contempt was started by a former wife, the child of the parties was well into adulthood, so that the obligation to pay child support had ended, and, although the former husband should have sought to have had the divorce decree modified prior to changing his former wife as a beneficiary on his life insurance policy, a finding of contempt was a seemingly harsh result because their child was an adult and to have required him to have complied with the decree would have resulted in the former wife being unjustly enriched.

       Although the majority of states exempted SSI benefits from inclusion in calculating gross income for child support purposes, the trial court’s award was not based solely on the SSI benefits; the father did have the ability to pay some child support and was not as destitute as he claimed or that he was as incapacitated as he claimed, or that he was precluded from earning some income for his child.

       Trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the former husband was entitled to a credit for the amount he paid as child support past the time his oldest child turned 21-years-old as the former husband’s duty of support terminated by operation of law at the time the older child turned 21-years-old.

       The chancellor was well within his discretion in ordering the non- custodial parent to pay child support to the custodial parent, even though it was a mother paying to her ex-husband, where the mother earned about $15,000 per year and the father earned about $40,000 per year.

       A chancellor erred in dismissing a father’s petition for abatement of child support where the father was in compliance with the court’s previous decree at the time he filed for modification, preventing a finding of unclean hands, and he showed a material change in his financial circumstances which arose subsequent to entry of the previous decree; however, the modification could not relate back to the time of filing, and therefore the chancellor’s award for child support payments which accrued during litigation of the father’s motion would be affirmed.

       A chancellor erred in finding a father in willful contempt for failure to make child support payments and jailing him after allowing only one week to purge himself of such contempt, since the father should have been given a more reasonable, limited amount of time to make the payment where he had been unemployed for approximately 6 months due to a fire that destroyed his office building and had reopened his medical practice and was again earning income at the time of the hearing.

       In a proceeding to modify child support provisions, the burden of proof is on the petitioner to show a material change of circumstances of one or more of the interested parties-the father, mother, or child-arising subsequent to the original decree. However, the material change which must be proved in support modification proceedings does not have to be a change which “adversely affects the minor child,” as is required in custody modification proceedings.

      <p>
       The fact that a child has been emancipated does not pretermit recovery of vested but unpaid child support. Either the child or the former custodial parent may bring an action against the defaulting parent, though the latter receives any recovery in his or her continuing fiduciary capacity subject to all of the duties and strictures thereof. If by reason of the supporting parent’s default, the custodial parent is forced to dip into his or her own resources beyond what would otherwise be expected of him or her, he or she may recover and retain amounts so proved, subject to equitable adjustment should the child’s prior needs so suggest.

       A father would be required to continue to pay support for his 15-year-old son, in spite of the father’s argument that his son had totally abandoned the father-son relationship and the son’s admission that he felt a great deal of hostility toward his father, where the son had sought professional counseling and advice to deal with his feelings toward his father and openly talked of trying to improve the relationship. While it is possible that there could be a situation where a minor child as young as 15 might by his or her actions forfeit support from a non-custodial parent, those actions would have to be clear and extreme.

       A mother was not automatically entitled to reasonable attorney’s fees merely because she successfully defeated the father’s efforts to reduce his child support obligation. The general rule that a father who seeks alteration of his child support liability to the mother without justification should pay for the mother’s attorney’s fees does not hold where the equities are otherwise. Thus, a court was within its authority when it held that the mother was not entitled to an award of attorney’s fees where there had been a large volume of claims and counterclaims and intervening discovery disputes, so that the equities differed and were relatively balanced. Additionally, the mother possessed the ability to earn sufficient income to pay reasonable attorney’s fees, and much of the expense that the mother’s attorneys incurred in litigating the case was unreasonable. McPhail v. McPhail, 564 So. 2d 839, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 163 (Miss. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       Social Security benefits received by a mother for the benefit of a minor child under the Social Security Act are considered an alternative source of payment that satisfies child support and should be credited toward that obligation. Moreover, child support obligations are to be off-set, not only to the extent of payments actually received under the Social Security Act, but also for payments that the child was entitled to receive, based on the parent’s retirement. Thus, a father’s child support obligations would be credited for social security benefits that the minor child was entitled to receive based on the father’s retirement, even though social security benefits were elected based on the child’s step-father’s retirement.

The national guideline must not dictate the amount of food, the need of clothing, the requirement of education or the standard of living of the children. Rather, this should be done by a chancellor who hears all the facts, views the witnesses, and is informed at trial of the circumstances of the parties and particularly the circumstances of the children. The guidelines may be received and considered in all support matters as relevant, but the guidelines may not determine the specific need or the specific support required; this is to be done by a chancellor at a time real, on a scene certain, and with a knowledge special to the actual circumstances and to the individual child or children.

       A father was not in contempt for failure to pay child support under an automatic adjustment clause of a property settlement agreement where the agreement was uncertain in that a genuine dispute existed over the amount owed, over the commencement year of the escalation clause, and over which consumer price index was to be utilized.

   The age of majority for purposes of child care and maintenance orders issued pursuant to §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c05s93-5-23" target="_self">93-5-23</a></cite> and §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c11s93-11-65" target="_self">93-11-65</a></cite> is 21 years. Thus, the courts have no authority under these statutes to require parents to provide for the care and maintenance of their child after the child becomes emancipated, by reaching the age of 21, or otherwise, whichever occurs first. This does not foreclose the enforceability of agreements by the parties providing for the post-emancipation care and maintenance of their children, whether those agreements are separate contracts, or have been incorporated into the divorce decree.

      <p>
       The fact that one child became emancipated and the other child moved into the father’s home did not automatically grant the father the right to receive a credit for child support payments made after that point in time. However, the father was allowed the opportunity to prove before a trial judge that he should receive such a credit. Nichols v. Tedder, 547 So. 2d 766, 1989 Miss. LEXIS 328 (Miss. 1989).

      <p>
       Trial courts have the authority to allocate income tax dependency exemptions by ordering the custodial parent to sign the required release where the equities of the case favor such action. A trial court’s authority to allocate the exemption to the non-custodial parent reduces the amount of income tax to be paid to the federal government, and produces a tax saving to the non-custodial parent which exceeds the moderate increase in the tax liability of the custodial parent. This result will almost always prevail where, as is often the case, the custodial parent’s adjusted gross income is less than the adjusted gross income of the non-custodial parent. In such a situation, the after-tax spendable income of the non-custodial parent is increased. This savings in tax liability could easily be channeled into increased child support or other payments thereby rendering the custodial parent’s after-tax spendable income, including child support or other payments, the same or better than if he or she had claimed the dependency exemption.

   Trial court erred in ordering a divorced father to reimburse the mother’s expenses for attorney fees to defend their child in a murder trial; the supreme court found no provisions within Miss.

   A $350 per month award to be paid by a father for the support of his 3 children was manifestly erroneous where the father’s adjusted gross income based on his salary, which was his only significant and reliable source of income, was approximately $2,350 per month, the guidelines set forth in §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.99.html#t99c19s99-19-101" target="_blank">99-19-101</a></cite> suggested that he should pay $495 per month in child support, and the chancellor failed to make a specific finding on the record that application of the statutory guidelines would be unjust or inappropriate.

   An increase in a father’s child support obligation from $300 to $750 per month was excessive and unsupported by the evidence in the record, even though the father’s income and resources had increased over time, where the mother’s income had also steadily increased, the child had not required any extraordinary or unexpected care or treatment, there was no evidence that any of the child’s needs had gone unmet, the child’s actual expenses averaged approximately $260 per month, and utilization of the child support guidelines set forth in §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.43.html#t43c19s43-19-101" target="_blank">43-19-101</a></cite> produced a monthly figure of approximately $583.

       A provision in a child support decree ordering an automatic $50 per month increase in child support when the child started kindergarten was improper where there was no evidence that kindergarten would cost more than what was previously being spent; if the automatic increase was a modification, it was improper since a modification can result only from substantial and material changes that follow the decree to be modified, and the automatic increase lacked the specificity required for an escalation clause since the specific basis for the calculation of the increase was not provided.

       A child support award of $400 per month for one 6-year-old child was excessive where the father, who had custody of the child, only asked for $100 per month in child support, the chancellor recognized that $400 per month was not required at the time for child support, and both parents had approximately the same earnings. The chancellor should have considered the amount of money which reasonably should have been required in child support from each parent, but apparently considered only the guidelines developed by the Governor’s Commission on Child Support.

       A chancery court’s order reducing a father’s child support obligation, predicated on its finding that there was a material change in circumstances, could not relate back to the date that the father first filed and sought a reduction in child support; such a rule provides sharp incentives for one who would have his or her support obligation reduced to bring the matter to trial as expeditiously as possible. Accordingly, the father’s reduction in child support obligations became effective on the date of the court judgment. McPhail v. McPhail, 564 So. 2d 839, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 163 (Miss. 1990).

      <p>
       There was a material change in circumstances which warranted modification of a child support order requiring the father to pay $400 per month per child for the parties’ 2 children who were in the mother’s custody, where the oldest child went to live with his father while the matter was pending, and the father had experienced a substantial reduction in his income while the mother had experienced an increase in hers, so that “both parties receive approximately the same amount of money,” and therefore the court was within its authority in terminating all child support.

       A chancellor did not abuse her discretion in ordering a father to pay $600 per month for the support of 2 children, in spite of the father’s argument that $600 per month constituted 27.5 percent of his adjusted gross income which was 7.5 percent greater than the percentage suggested by the statutory guidelines, where the mother’s monthly net income was $1,168, her monthly expenses were $2,225, the chancellor was skeptical as to the father’s true earnings, and the evidence suggested that the father had some alternative source of support that he had not disclosed.

   A chancellor did not abuse his discretion in ordering a father to pay $300 in child support for his 14-year-old son, in spite of the father’s argument that the amount was excessive because it exceeded 14 percent of his adjusted gross income which was above the statutory guidelines for one child set forth in §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.43.html#t43c19s43-19-101" target="_blank">43-19-101</a></cite>, where the record indicated that the father would be able to support himself as well as pay child support in the amount awarded.

       A child support award of $325 per month was not so high as to constitute reversible error where the mother’s adjusted monthly gross income was between $2100 and $2265, the father, who had custody of the child, performed many in-kind services for the child, and the mother had paid no direct support for the child for a minimum of 5 years.

       Chancery court’s determination that a father was in contempt for failing to pay child support was supported by substantial evidence where the record showed that the father had been denied disability, he had worked for several years after a childhood accident that allegedly caused seizures, he left his last employment for a nonmedical reason, and he was well enough to frequent a relative’s pool hall almost every day and perform pseudo-employment functions there.

       Ex-husband was not entitled to a credit for child support paid directly to one of the parties’ children because the evidence was sufficient to support the chancellor’s finding that the amount each parent had already paid for the support and education of the minor children had already worked equity.

       Emancipation occurred when the child of the former husband and the former wife turned 21 and meant that the former husband had no further obligation to provide child support for that child; moreover, the trial court in its discretion, had the right to grant the former husband a credit for child support he paid on behalf of that child past the time she was emancipated and did not abuse its discretion in granting him such a credit.

       The burden was on the father to make out a clear case of inability to pay child support to prevent a finding of contempt, even though he sought a modification of his child support obligations prior to the mother’s counterclaim for contempt, where he did not follow this course of action promptly, he paid the full amount of child support only one month during the first year following the divorce, and he “adjusted” his support payments without the consent of any court when one of his children moved in with him.

       A chancellor did not err in finding a father in contempt of court for failure to pay child support where he did not file for a reduction of support promptly, when he finally sought such a reduction the mother counterclaimed with an action for contempt, and he failed to carry his burden of proving a clear case of inability to pay.

In the absence of some extraordinary circumstances, a chancery court could not validly render a decree that, regardless of a parent’s future salary, he or she would have to pay 1/2 of it for child support for one child; requiring a parent to pay 1/2 of his or her net salary for support of one child, without examining the child’s needs, is not the escalation clause recommended to take care of inflation in the cost of living.

However, the father’s 18-year-old daughter was not emancipated where she did not work full time and her earnings were insufficient to support the necessities for her continued education, she was enrolled as a student at Mississippi State University, and her record as a student was acceptable; the father was therefore required to continue to support the daughter at the rate of $300 per month.

       Chancellor did not abuse its discretion by not ordering a wife to pay child support for a child who was attending college away from home during the duration of the parties’ divorce proceedings and by not ordering the wife to pay child support, including college expenses, for the year preceding the filing of the husband’s complaint. Pettersen v. Pettersen, 269 So.3d 466, 2018 Miss. App. LEXIS 529 (Miss. Ct. App. 2018), cert. denied, 268 So.3d 1282, 2019 Miss. LEXIS 182 (Miss. 2019).

       Chancellor did not err in finding that a father was no longer required to pay for his son’s college expenses because the child would be rendered emancipated, and the son desired not to have any relationship with the father; however, the chancellor erred in requiring the son to maintain a “C” average to continue receiving child support.

       Chancellor abused the chancellor’s discretion by requiring a parent to pay a lump sum toward the purchase of a vehicle for the parent’s child as an educational expense to attend college because there was no evidence that the parent was financially able to pay the cost of the vehicle and the costs of the child’s other college expenses.

       Because the chancellor found that the children were emancipated, as they were 24 and 22 years old at the time of the 2012 order, the chancellor erred in requiring the father to pay child support, college expenses, and life and health insurance for the benefit of the children.

       Chancery court did not abuse its discretion when it relieved an ex-husband of his daughters’ college expenses after their first semester since the girls failed to show the responsibility and aptitude to succeed at college by making at least a 2.0 grade point average; the divorce judgment required him to pay one-half of all reasonable and necessary costs of college provided that each child maintain full-time status and a 2.0 grade point average, and it was a reasonable interpretation of the provision to use a semester as the appropriate time period in which the girls could maintain a 2.0 grade point average.

   In a paternity suit, the county court ordered the father to pay the child’s tuition expenses for college and one-full year of graduate school but did not make his obligation to pay college expenses conditional upon the child’s age. Under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c11s93-11-65ol18" target="_self">93-11-65(8)</a></cite>, the county court erred by extending the father’s obligations beyond the point at which the child could become emancipated.

   In an irreconcilable differences divorce, Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c05s93-5-2ol12" target="_self">93-5-2(2)</a></cite>, the chancery court did not err in refusing to offset the ex-husband’s child support obligation by his payments for his oldest child’s college education because, inter alia: (1) although the child lived at college, he frequently came home on the weekend and for holidays; (2) the child received financial support from both parents as the ex-wife gave him money to pay for his car insurance; (3) the wife used a portion of the child’s support payment to provide for the child when he came home for visits and to maintain the household for the rest of the family; and (4) the child support agreement contained no provision for reducing child support payments to the wife once the children left home.

      <p>
       According to the judgment of divorce, the father was obligated to pay one-half of all of the son’s educational expenses, which included his private school tuition payments; as a result, the tuition payments became a judgment against the father each month he failed to make the payments. The father’s obligation to make those payments could not be excused by the mother’s tardiness in seeking enforcement of the father’s obligation to pay. Durr v. Durr, 912 So. 2d 1033, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 244 (Miss. Ct. App. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Substantial evidence existed in the record to support the chancellor’s finding of contempt due to the father’s failure to pay his share of the son’s private school tuition because (1) the mother showed that the judgment of divorce obligated the father to make the tuition payments; (2) she presented evidence that the father had failed to comply with the decree by not making the tuition payments; and (3) the father failed to present sufficient evidence to rebut the mothers prima facie case of contempt.

      <p>
       Although the father claimed that he paid all medical, optical, and drug bills submitted to him by the mother, during the hearing he could only provide proof that he had paid one bill. As a result, the chancellor did not err in finding the father in contempt for failing to pay his share of the son’s medical expenses as ordered in the judgment of divorce. Durr v. Durr, 912 So. 2d 1033, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 244 (Miss. Ct. App. 2005).

       Chancellor considered the wife financially able to pay a portion of the children’s college expenses, and this finding was supported by the evidence; in addition to the money the wife made from her job, her father purchased a house for her and gave her a vehicle to drive, thus lowering her monthly expenses; when the chancellor divided the marital property, he ordered the husband to pay all marital debts and awarded alimony to the wife.

       A father was not entitled to credit against past due child support payments for the sum of $1,301.24, which he had deposited in his daughter’s bank account from which she paid her educational expenses at college, where the original divorce decree provided for child support payments to be made in addition to any educational expenses.

      </p>
      <p>
       A finding that a son was emancipated and that his father had no further duty to support him would be reversed, and the father would be required to abide by the terms of a court order requiring him to pay for his son’s college expenses, even though the son worked full-time, where the father had ignored the court order to pay his son’s college expenses, in effect forcing his son to abandon his schooling and become a full-time worker. Caldwell v. Caldwell, 579 So. 2d 543, 1991 Miss. LEXIS 236 (Miss. 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       In determining whether there had been a substantial change in circumstances necessary to modify child support, the trial court should have considered an increase in expenses as a result of the children’s attendance at college; this was not something that should have been anticipated at the time of the entry of the original decree since few parents can anticipate with certainty, 5 years ahead of time, that their children will attend college. Lawrence v. Lawrence, 574 So. 2d 1376, 1991 Miss. LEXIS 17 (Miss. 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       A trial court’s finding that a daughter was not emancipated despite the fact that she was 22 years old and a fifth-year college student was error; the father’s obligation to support his daughter, absent a contract, terminated after her majority. However, the father’s 18-year-old daughter was not emancipated where she did not work full time and her earnings were insufficient to support the necessities for her continued education, she was enrolled as a student at Mississippi State University, and her record as a student was acceptable; the father was therefore required to continue to support the daughter at the rate of $300 per month.

Regular child support refers to the sums of money which the particular parent is ordered to pay for the child’s basic, necessary living expenses, namely food, clothing and shelter. Other sums which a parent may be ordered to pay for the care and maintenance of the child are the expenses of a college or other advanced education. Other items which may properly be awarded pursuant to a valid child care and maintenance order are health related expenses such as reasonable and necessary medical, dental, optical, and psychiatric/psychological expenses. A parent can also be required to absorb insurance expenses such as maintaining medical and hospitalization insurance on the child, and maintaining a life insurance policy on his or her own life with the child named as beneficiary. Additionally, a trial court may require a parent to furnish an automobile and make mortgage payments as part of an award for the care and maintenance of children. The foregoing items are not an exclusive listing, but are merely examples of the real distinction between regular child support and other types of payments for which the parent may become obligated under the terms of a valid child care and maintenance order under §§<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c05s93-5-23" target="_self">93-5-23</a></cite> and<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c11s93-11-65" target="_self">93-11-65</a></cite>.

       Father was entitled to credit on an arrearage judgment for child support obligations that vested after his 21-year-old son’s emancipation because the father’s duty to pay child support for the son ceased upon the son’s emancipation, and the father’s child support obligation then became solely for his daughter.

      <p>
       On a mother’s counterclaim against a father for contempt concerning child support, medical insurance, and medical bills, a chancellor erred in giving the father credit for the payment of private school tuition because the private school tuition payments were based on an agreement between the parties; the voluntary payments could not be used to offset the father’s obligations. Farrior v. Kittrell, 12 So.3d 20, 2009 Miss. App. LEXIS 189 (Miss. Ct. App. 2009).

       Amount of past-due child support awarded to a mother was proper where the chancery court properly credited the father for the time that the mother and child lived in his home; during that time, the father provided shelter for both the mother and child, as well as basic necessities.

       Chancery court erred by finding that a husband had an arrearage of one payment of child support because the husband entered into evidence a spreadsheet showing the dates and payments, and he also introduced his bank statements showing all of the corresponding checks from his spreadsheet and when they were presented for payment. Stuart v. Stuart, 956 So. 2d 295, 2006 Miss. App. LEXIS 759 (Miss. Ct. App. 2006).

       Chancellor erred in forgiving the husband’s child support arrearages where although the husband paid child support directly to the children, he did not present the receipt book into evidence, nor did he present the cancelled checks, corroborating witnesses, or evidence of any kind other than his own testimony; the husband did not present clear and convincing evidence in order to allow him to receive child support credit for expenses he paid directly; therefore, his obligations could not be discharged.

   Trial court did not err in failing to recognize and apply the waiver, joinder and assignment documents signed by a mother’s children regarding her claims for child support arrearages on their behalves because although Miss.

       A chancellor properly refused to have an arrearage of approximately $4300 in child support payments placed in a trust fund that would begin to generate a monthly income for a hearing-impaired child when he reached the arbitrarily-designated age of 36, since past due child support payments become vested as of the date they were due and cannot be modified; furthermore, the chancellor would have abused his discretion by allowing the funds to be placed in a trust that was not established and maintained in accordance with applicable regulations and guidelines governing governmental assistance programs for the disabled. Hammett v. Woods, 602 So. 2d 825, 1992 Miss. LEXIS 299 (Miss. 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       A chancellor erred in determining that the matter of a child support arrearage was previously settled by a court-approved modification of child support, which effectively amounted to a forgiveness of vested but unpaid child support obligations, since this is contrary to the well-established rule that “a court cannot relieve the civil liability for support payments that have already accrued.” Tanner v.

      <p>
       A former husband failed to show that he was financially unable to comply with the divorce decree so as to avoid paying child support arrearage, where he failed to offer substantial evidence which was “particular and not general” to support his contention, and he had failed to pay medical expenses and school expenses at a time when he held a well paying job, which indicated that financial hardship was not the sole factor in his failure to make payments. Additionally, the husband’s argument that he had to pay other bills before making support payments was meritless, since such payments are paramount. Gregg v. Montgomery, 587 So. 2d 928, 1991 Miss. LEXIS 712 (Miss. 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       A trial court properly dismissed a former wife’s fraudulent conveyance claim against her former husband, based upon the former husband’s conveyance of 15.2 acres of farm property to his father for inadequate consideration, where the husband had tendered the amount of the child support judgment owed to the former wife. However, since the matter was to be remanded for a determination of an additional amount of child support owed by the former husband, the judgments would be vacated to the extent necessary to provide the lower court with the opportunity to consider the need for security with regard to the child support arrearage or any of the father’s further obligations to and for the benefit of his children.

       Trial court erred in terminating a father’s college-expense obligation to his daughter, as he did not request that relief, and the daughter was a child with the aptitude and desire to attend college, for whom the parties agreed to provide at least a four year college education. A.M.L. v. J.W.L., 98 So.3d 1001, 2012 Miss. LEXIS 398 (Miss. 2012).
      </p>
      <p>
       Father who ceased making child support payments for his son without permission from a court came into court with unclean hands. However, when the chancellor entered an arrearage judgment, the father’s hands were cleansed and the chancellor could fairly consider the father’s child support modification petition. Andres v. Andres, 22 So.3d 314, 2009 Miss. App. LEXIS 682 (Miss. Ct. App. 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       Father was entitled to a modification of his child support obligation because his child support obligation legally terminated upon his son becoming emancipated after reaching age 21 and the parties’ separation agreement provided that the support obligation would terminate upon the emancipation of the children. There was no evidence presented that the agreement was not entered into freely, and the clause was unambiguous. Andres v. Andres, 22 So.3d 314, 2009 Miss. App. LEXIS 682 (Miss. Ct. App. 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the former husband voluntarily ceased work as a truck-shop foreman, moved in with his girlfriend, and began paying some of her expenses, the chancellor did not err by finding that the former husband failed to show a material change in circumstances to warrant a reduction in his child support payments even though his expenses had increased. Sessums v. Vance, 12 So.3d 1146, 2009 Miss. App. LEXIS 131 (Miss. Ct. App. 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       A father was not entitled to a downward modification of his child-support obligation because the fact that a daughter, who had become emancipated, no longer needed private-school tuition was not an unanticipated change in circumstances and the fact that a son resided with the father half of the time was foreseeable when support was negotiated. Evans v. Evans, 994 So. 2d 765, 2008 Miss. LEXIS 582 (Miss. 2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a father’s modification of child support case, the court properly found the father to be in contempt for non payment because he continued his standard of living without providing his children with the court-ordered funds. The chancellor noted that the father had continued to buy houses while claiming inability to pay, he bought a house located on a golf course, and the father had contravened a court order requiring him to have a life insurance policy in favor of his children in the amount of $ 750,000. Howard v. Howard, 968 So. 2d 961, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 760 (Miss. Ct. App. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       Court erred by dismissing a father’s petition for modification of child support on the basis of unclean hands because the court’s May 19, 2003, order adjudicating the amount of the father’s total arrearage effectively cleansed the father’s hands and revived the issue of modification of the father’s child support obligations. No new modification petition was before the court and the proceedings on remand simply were a continuation of the April 2003 proceedings instigated by the father’s January 16, 2003, petition for modification. Howard v. Howard, 968 So. 2d 961, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 760 (Miss. Ct. App. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       Court erred by dismissing a father’s petition for modification of child support on the basis of res judicata because the first modification proceeding did not foreclose the father from demonstrating that his physician’s new assessment of his hand condition was a material change in circumstances justifying a reduction in child support. The father had moderate nerve damage to the right hand when the physician last saw the father in March 2003, he still had problems with holding objects and performing fine manipulation, and the physician opined to a reasonable degree of medical certainty that the father was disabled from performing surgery due to those conditions. Howard v. Howard, 968 So. 2d 961, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 760 (Miss. Ct. App. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a child support modification case, attorney’s fees were properly awarded to the mother because she earned $ 11 per hour at a retail job, a vocational report showed that her income for the year 2004 was $ 16,005, with a $ 6,000 mileage reimbursement, and there was no evidence that she had any other assets from which to pay her attorney.

      </p>
      <p>
       Change in a visitation schedule alone is not enough for an appellate court to find that a chancellor’s decision to deny a reduction in child support was manifestly wrong or an abuse of discretion; therefore, father’s request for a reduction in child support was properly denied by a chancery court where the record did not demonstrate that any of the 10 factors used to show a material change in circumstances were discussed. Allen v. Allen, 953 So. 2d 279, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 186 (Miss. Ct. App. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       Father’s request to modify his child support and medical expense obligations was granted because he showed a material change in circumstances where the father lost his job through no fault of his own, and his decision to open his own business to support the family was not made in bad faith; moreover, there was no improper retroactive reduction, the father requested a reduction in his obligation to provide medical insurance, and the reduction was appropriate where an arrearage was owed.

      <p>
       Chancery court erred by granting the ex-husband modification of child support; while a decrease in his monthly income from $2,866 to $1,644 qualified as a material and subsustantial change, his changed financial situation upon leaving the Marine Corps was both anticipated and foreseeable. The chancery court erred by granting the modification without considering his inability to perform the original decree or whether he had clean hands. Dill v. Dill, 908 So. 2d 198, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 521 (Miss. Ct. App. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancellor erred in giving no explanation for denying a husband’s request for child support from his former wife other than simply citing the couple’s previous property settlement agreement; the chancellor made no apparent determinations as to the best interests of the child or the possibility of a material change in circumstances due to the award of permanent physical custody to the husband.

       Where the father was severely in arrears in his child support payments and had voluntarily left his employment for early retirement, he came into court with unclean hands.

   Trial court properly granted a father summary judgment under Miss. R. Civ. P. 56 in the father’s action seeking to terminate his child support obligation on the ground that the children had attained the age of majority; where, absent an agreement to the contrary, the father was not required to provide child support under Miss. Code Ann. §§<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c05s93-5-23" target="_self">93-5-23</a></cite> and<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c11s93-11-65" target="_self">93-11-65</a></cite> after the children reached age 21, the father’s obligation had ceased, as the children were at least 21, and there was no written agreement providing for post-emancipation child support payments. Little v. Little, 878 So. 2d 1086, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 713 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).

       Modification of child support was improper where the father’s general characterization that the costs associated with his sons had increased was unsubstantiated and did not rise to the level of a material change in circumstances warranting modification of child support.

   In a paternity suit, the county court did not err in ordering the father to pay one-hundred percent of the child’s health coverage pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c11s93-11-65ol12" target="_self">93-11-65(2)</a></cite>. The evidence indicated that the father was a doctor and had a monthly income roughly ten times that of the mother. Daniels v. Bains, 967 So. 2d 77, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 714 (Miss. Ct. App. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancery court did not err by failing to order that a father pay half of a child’s medical bills that were not covered by Medicaid instead of ordering the payment of those expenses by veterans’ insurance, because there was no showing that the child was eligible for that insurance. Edmond v. Townes, 949 So. 2d 99, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 40 (Miss. Ct. App. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       Order requiring the father to reimburse the mother for the child’s medical bills was affirmed because the father had not provided a shred of evidence that the child was covered by his insurance policy at the time the medical expenses were incurred. The father had been ordered to pay child support and provide insurance coverage for the child, and if he failed to provide the child with insurance coverage, he would be responsible for all health care expenses.

       Upon the parties’ divorce, the mother was granted paramount physical custody of the parties, minor child; the chancellor did not err in ordering the father to pay $ 1,030 per month in child support and granting the income tax child dependency exemption to the father until such time as that the mother could show an income of over $ 50,000 per year. A chancellor has the authority to require that a custodial parent waive the income tax child dependency exemption in favor of the non-custodial parent. Fitzgerald v.

       Where the mother established the father’s paternity of her three-year-old daughter, the county court did not err by ordering the father to maintain a $ 500,000 term life insurance policy on himself for the benefit of the child. The father maintained a life insurance policy in the names of his two children from a previous marriage. Daniels v. Bains, 967 So. 2d 77, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 714 (Miss. Ct. App. 2007).

       In a case where a mother sought to hold a father in contempt for failing to pay child support allegedly owed from a temporary order entered in 1988, the issue was procedurally barred because the mother failed to cite to any authority; she was held to the same pleading standards that applied to represented parties. Despite the procedural bar, the mother was precluded from raising this issue because she failed to appeal the denial of her request for back child support in another case brought against the father.

      </h4>
      <p>
       Chancery court did not abuse its discretion by failing to find that a child was emancipated because the child was a full time student, did not have a job, still relied on the mother’s support, and her need for support would increase once she transferred from a junior college to a university; subsection (8)(b)(iii) applied but did not require the chancery court to declare the child emancipated or terminate child support, but rather that provision merely gave the chancery court discretion. Dixon v. Dixon, 238 So.3d 1191, 2018 Miss. App. LEXIS 57 (Miss. Ct. App. 2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancery court erred in determining that a child was emancipated for child support purposes was sometime in August where there was no solid testimony as to when her summer classes ended nor any school records to show the state and end dates of her full-time enrollment in school. Instead, the correct emancipation date was the date the child joined the military. Ratliff v. Ratliff, 271 So.3d 697, 2018 Miss. App. LEXIS 629 (Miss. Ct. App. 2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancellor’s determination that both the mother and the mother’s teenage child contributed to the erosion of the parent child relationship was supported by substantial credible evidence, and, despite the mother’s assertion, the chancellor’s judgment reflected that the chancellor possessed an awareness of the child’s extensive mental-health issues and history. As a result, there was no error in the chancellor’s judgment ordering the mother to pay child support. Collins v. Miss. Dep't of Human Servs., — So.3d —, 2017 Miss. App. LEXIS 351 (Miss. Ct. App. June 13, 2017).
      </p>
      <p>
       The chancery court did not err in finding that children’s move into a shared apartment did not result in their emancipation because the children were both full-time students during the entire time that they lived in the apartment, they had not established independent living arrangements, and the father assisted the children financially. Oster v. Ratliff, 205 So.3d 1149, 2016 Miss. App. LEXIS 229 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 205 So.3d 1086, 2016 Miss. LEXIS 528 (Miss. 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although a chancery court erred in granting the parties a divorce based on irreconcilable differences without addressing custody or support of their seventeen-year-old child, who was residing with his older sister, the error was harmless and the issue was moot because the child was no longer a minor and the parties were no longer obligated to pay child support for him. Gordon v. Gordon, 126 So.3d 922, 2013 Miss. App. LEXIS 273 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 127 So.3d 1115, 2013 Miss. LEXIS 631 (Miss. 2013).

       Whenever a court orders any person to make periodic payments of a sum certain for the maintenance or support of a child, and whenever such payments as have become due remain unpaid for a period of at least thirty (30) days, a judgment by operation of law shall arise against the obligor in an amount equal to all payments that are then due and owing.

       Any judgment arising under the provisions of this section shall operate as a lien upon all the property of the judgment debtor, both real and personal, which lien shall be perfected as to third parties without actual notice thereof only upon enrollment on the judgment roll. The department or attorney representing the party to whom support is owed shall furnish an abstract of the judgment for periodic payments for the maintenance and support of a child, along with sworn documentation of the delinquent child support, to the circuit clerk of the county where the judgment is rendered, and it shall be the duty of the circuit clerk to enroll the judgment on the judgment roll.

      <p>
       The 2007 amendment substituted “begun at any time” for “commenced at any time” in (1)(a); substituted “subsection (2) of this section” for “paragraph (2)” in (3); added (4) and (6) and redesignated former (4) as present (5); and made minor stylistic changes throughout.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 2009 amendment provided for two versions of the section; in the version of the section effective until July1, 2010, in (3), added “and such assets shall apply to all child support owed including all arrears” at the end of the introductory language, added (f), and made a minor stylistic change; and deleted former (6), which read: “This section shall stand repealed on July 1, 2010”; and in the version effective from and after July 1, 2010, substituted “July 1, 2011” for “July 1, 2010” in (6).
      </p>
      <p>
       The 2010 amendment substituted “July 1, 2011” for “July 1, 2010” in the bracketed effective date language in both versions.

      <p>
       The 2011 amendment deleted the automatic reverter; substituted “disestablishment of paternity granted pursuant to Section 93-9-10” for “a motion filed by the obligor” near the beginning of (4); and added (6).

       It was error to award a father a credit against the father’s child support arrearage for the entire amount of a lump sum payment of past-due Social Security benefits payable to the children on account of the father’s disability because the father was only entitled to such a credit for benefits paid after the onset of disability when the father was under a child support order.

       Upon entry of any order for support by a court of this state where the custodial parent is a recipient of services under Title IV-D of the federal Social Security Act, issued on or after October 1, 1996, the court entering such order shall enter a separate order for withholding which shall take effect immediately without any requirement that the obligor be delinquent in payment. All such orders for support issued prior to October 1, 1996, shall, by operation of law, be amended to conform with the provisions contained herein. All such orders for support issued shall:
       <ol type="a">

Any person who willfully and knowingly files a false affidavit, record or judgment shall be subject to a fine of not more than One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00). The Department of Human Services shall be the designated agency to receive payments made by income withholding in child support orders enforced by the department. All withholding orders shall be on a form as prescribed by the department.

Such orders shall not be subject to immediate income withholding under this subsection: (a) if one (1) of the parties (i.e., noncustodial or custodial parent) demonstrates, and the court finds, that there is good cause not to require immediate income withholding, or (b) if both parties agree in writing to an alternative arrangement. The Department of Human Services shall be the designated agency to receive payments made by income withholding in all child support orders.

There shall be no need for further notice, hearing, order, process or procedure before service of said order on the payor or any additional or subsequent payor. The obligor may contest, if grounds exist, service of the order of withholding on additional or subsequent payors, by filing an action with the issuing court. Such filing shall not stay the obligor’s duty to support pending judicial determination of the obligor’s claim.

   Trial court correctly complied with Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c11s93-11-103" target="_self">93-11-103</a></cite> when he entered the order for withholding several days after the order for support was entered. The statute applies to all orders issued or modified, not only to those found to be in arrears. McNeese v. McNeese, 119 So.3d 264, 2013 Miss. LEXIS 172 (Miss. 2013).
      </p>
      <p>
       The chancellor did not err in failing to enter a withholding order where (1) the child support obligation at issue was created prior to the effective date of the amendment which required such an order, (2) there was no finding by the chancellor that the father was in arrears on his child support, and (3) the chancellor did not modify the support order.

      <p>
       In light of the mandatory language of the statute on orders for withholding and the fact that the matter was raised both in pleadings and at the hearing, there was clear error where the trial court failed either to enter such an order or to give reasons as to why it was not justified. Meeks v. Meeks, 757 So. 2d 364, 2000 Miss. App. LEXIS 212 (Miss. Ct. App. 2000).

       It shall be the duty of any payor who has been served with a copy of the order for withholding and an attached affidavit of accounting, a certified record of payments, or judgment for delinquency to deduct and pay over income as provided in this section. The payor shall deduct the amount designated in the order for withholding beginning with the next payment of income that is payable to the obligor after fourteen (14) days following service of the order and notice. The payor shall pay the amounts withheld to the department within seven (7) days of the date the obligor is paid in accordance with the order for withholding and in accordance with any later notification received redirecting payments. The department shall then forward those amounts to the obligee.
      </li>
      <li id="t93c11s93-11-111ol12">
       For each intrastate withholding of income, the payor shall be entitled to receive a fee of Two Dollars ($2.00) to be withheld from the income of the obligor in addition to the support payments, regardless of the number of payments the payor makes to the department. However, in all interstate withholding, the rules and laws of the state where the obligor works shall determine the payor’s processing fee.
      </li>
      <li id="t93c11s93-11-111ol13">
       The payor shall, unless otherwise notified by the department, withhold from the income of the obligor and forward to the department each month, an amount specified by the department not to exceed Fifteen Dollars ($15.00) per month to defray the department’s administrative costs incurred in receiving and distributing money withheld under Sections 93-11-101 through 93-11-119. The payor may pay such amount to the department in any manner determined by the payor to be convenient and may include that amount in checks to the department for amounts withheld pursuant to the order for withholding.
      </li>
      <li id="t93c11s93-11-111ol14">
       Regardless of the amount designated in the order for withholding and regardless of other fees imposed or amounts withheld under this section, the payor shall not deduct from the income of the obligor in excess of the amounts allowed under Section 303(b) of the Consumer Credit Protection Act, being 15 USCS 1673, as amended.
      </li>
      <li id="t93c11s93-11-111ol15">
       A payor may combine all amounts that he is required to withhold and pay to the department in one (1) payment; however, the payor must send to the department a list showing the amount of the payment attributable to each obligor.

       Whenever the obligor is no longer receiving income from the payor, the payor shall return a copy of the order for withholding to the department and shall forward the obligor’s last known address and name and address of the obligor’s new employer, if known, to the department. The payor shall cooperate in providing further information for the purpose of enforcing Sections 93-11-101 through 93-11-119.

       Withholding of income under this section shall be made without regard to any prior or subsequent garnishments, attachments, wage assignments or any other claims of creditors. Payment as required by the order for withholding shall be a complete defense by the payor against any claims of the obligor or his creditors as to the sum so paid.
      </li>
      <li id="t93c11s93-11-111ol18">
       In cases in which the payor has been served more than one (1) order for withholding for the same obligor, the payor shall honor the orders on a pro rata basis to result in withholding an amount for each order that is in direct proportion to the percentage of the obligor’s adjusted gross income that the order represents, and the payor shall honor all those withholdings to the extent that the total amount withheld does not exceed the maximum amount specified in subsection (1) of this section.

       The division shall review the information received under Section 93-11-155 and any other information available to the division, and shall determine if a licensee is out of compliance with an order for support. If a licensee is out of compliance with the order for support, the division shall notify the licensee by first class mail that ninety (90) days after the licensee receives the notice of being out of compliance with the order, the licensing entity will be notified to immediately suspend the licensee’s license unless the licensee pays the arrearage owing, according to the accounting records of the Mississippi Department of Human Services or the attorney representing the party to whom support is due, as the case may be, or enters into a stipulated agreement and agreed judgment establishing a schedule for the payment of the arrearage. The licensee shall be presumed to have received the notice five (5) days after it is deposited in the mail.
      </li>
      <li id="t93c11s93-11-157ol12">
       Upon receiving the notice provided in subsection (1) of this section the licensee may:

        <li id="t93c11s93-11-157ol12a">
         Request a review with the division; however, the issues the licensee may raise at the review are limited to whether the licensee is the person required to pay under the order for support and whether the licensee is out of compliance with the order for support; or
        </li>
        <li id="t93c11s93-11-157ol12b">
         Request to participate in negotiations with the division for the purpose of establishing a payment schedule for the arrearage.

       The division director or the designees of the division director may and, upon request of a licensee, shall negotiate with a licensee to establish a payment schedule for the arrearage. Payments made under the payment schedule shall be in addition to the licensee’s ongoing obligation under the latest entered periodic order for support.
      </li>
      <li id="t93c11s93-11-157ol12b4">
       Should the division and the licensee reach an agreement on a payment schedule for the arrearage, the division director may submit to the court a stipulated agreement and agreed judgment containing the payment schedule which, upon the court’s approval, is enforceable as any order of the court. If the court does not approve the stipulated agreement and agreed judgment, the court may require a hearing on a case-by-case basis for the judicial review of the payment schedule agreement.
      </li>
      <li id="t93c11s93-11-157ol12b5">
       If the licensee and the division do not reach an agreement on a payment schedule for the arrearage, the licensee may move the court to establish a payment schedule. However, this action does not stay the license suspension.

      <li id="t93c11s93-11-157ol12b6">
       The notice given to a licensee that the licensee’s license will be suspended in ninety (90) days must clearly state the remedies and procedures that are available to a licensee under this section.

       If at the end of the ninety (90) days the licensee has an arrearage according to the accounting records of the Mississippi Department of Human Services or the attorney representing the party to whom support is due, as the case may be, and the licensee has not entered into a stipulated agreement and agreed judgment establishing a payment schedule for the arrearage, the division shall immediately notify all applicable licensing entities in writing to suspend the licensee’s license, and the licensing entities shall immediately suspend the license and shall within three (3) business days notify the licensee and the licensee’s employer, where known, of the license suspension and the date of such suspension by certified mail return receipt requested. Within forty-eight (48) hours of receipt of a request in writing delivered personally, by mail or by electronic means, the department shall furnish to the licensee, licensee’s attorney or other authorized representative a copy of the department’s accounting records of the licensee’s payment history. A licensing entity shall immediately reinstate the suspended license upon the division’s notification of the licensing entities in writing that the licensee no longer has an arrearage or that the licensee has entered into a stipulated agreement and agreed judgment.
      </li>
      <li id="t93c11s93-11-157ol12b8">
       Within thirty (30) days after a licensing entity suspends the licensee’s license at the direction of the division under subsection (7) of this section, the licensee may appeal the license suspension to the chancery court of the county in which the licensee resides or to the Chancery Court of the First Judicial District of Hinds County, Mississippi, upon giving bond with sufficient sureties in the amount of Two Hundred Dollars ($200.00), approved by the clerk of the chancery court and conditioned to pay any costs that may be adjudged against the licensee. Notice of appeal shall be filed in the office of the clerk of the chancery court. If there is an appeal, the appeal may, in the discretion of and on motion to the chancery court, act as a supersedeas of the license suspension. The department shall be the appellee in the appeal, and the licensing entity shall not be a party in the appeal. The chancery court shall dispose of the appeal and enter its decision within thirty (30) days of the filing of the appeal. The hearing on the appeal may, in the discretion of the chancellor, be tried in vacation. The decision of the chancery court may be appealed to the Supreme Court in the manner provided by the rules of the Supreme Court. In the discretion of and on motion to the chancery court, no person shall be allowed to practice any business, occupation or profession or take any other action under the authority of any license the suspension of which has been affirmed by the chancery court while an appeal to the Supreme Court from the decision of the chancery court is pending.

       If a licensee who has entered a stipulated agreement and agreed judgment for the payment of an arrearage under this section subsequently is out of compliance with an order for support, the division shall immediately notify the licensing entity to suspend the licensee’s license, and the licensing entity shall immediately suspend the license without a hearing and shall within three (3) business days notify the licensee in writing of the license suspension. In the case of a license suspension under the provisions of this subsection, the procedures provided for under subsections (1) and (2) of this section are not required; however, the appeal provisions of subsection (8) of this section still apply. After suspension of the license, if the licensee subsequently enters into a stipulated agreement and agreed judgment or the licensee otherwise informs the division of compliance with the order for support, the division shall within seven (7) days notify in writing the licensing entity that the licensee is in compliance. Upon receipt of that notice from the division, a licensing entity shall immediately reinstate the license of the licensee and shall within three (3) business days notify the licensee of the reinstatement.
      </li>
      <li id="t93c11s93-11-157ol12b10">
       Nothing in this section prohibits a licensee from filing a motion for the modification of an order for support or for any other applicable relief. However, no such action shall stay the license suspension procedure, except as may be allowed under subsection (8) of this section.

      <li id="t93c11s93-11-157ol12b11">
       If a license is suspended under the provisions of this section, the licensing entity is not required to refund any fees paid by a licensee in connection with obtaining or renewing a license.

      <li id="t93c11s93-11-157ol12b12">
       The requirement of a licensing entity to suspend a license under this section does not affect the power of the licensing entity to deny, suspend, revoke or terminate a license for any other reason.

       The procedure for suspension of a license for being out of compliance with an order for support, and the procedure for the reissuance or reinstatement of a license suspended for that purpose, shall be governed by this section and not by the general licensing and disciplinary provisions applicable to a licensing entity. Actions taken by a licensing entity in suspending a license when required by this section are not actions from which an appeal may be taken under the general licensing and disciplinary provisions applicable to the licensing entity. Any appeal of a license suspension that is required by this section shall be taken in accordance with the appeal procedure specified in subsection (8) of this section rather than any procedure specified in the general licensing and disciplinary provisions applicable to the licensing entity. If there is any conflict between any provision of this section and any provision of the general licensing and disciplinary provisions applicable to a licensing entity, the provisions of this section shall control.

     <p>
      In addition to the procedures in Section 93-11-157, the court may, upon a finding that a defendant is delinquent for being out of compliance with an order for support, order the licensing entity as defined in Section 93-11-153(a) to suspend the license of the defendant. In its discretion, the court may stay such an order for a reasonable time to allow the defendant to purge himself of the delinquency. If a license is suspended under this section, the court may also order the licensing entity to reinstate the license when it is satisfied that the defendant has purged himself of the delinquency. Licensing entities shall treat a suspension under this section the same as a suspension under Section 93-11-157. Defendants whose license is suspended under this section shall be subject to any administrative fees established for reinstatement under Section 93-11-159.

       § 93-13-1.
    Parental guardianship of minor children.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The father and mother are the joint natural guardians of their minor children and are equally charged with their care, nurture, welfare and education, and the care and management of their estates. The father and mother shall have equal powers and rights, and neither parent has any right paramount to the right of the other concerning the custody of the minor or the control of the services or the earnings of such minor, or any other matter affecting the minor. If either father or mother die or be incapable of acting, the guardianship devolves upon the surviving parent. Neither parent shall forcibly take a child from the guardianship of the parent legally entitled to its custody. But if any father or mother be unsuitable to discharge the duties of guardianship, then the court, or chancellor in vacation, may appoint some suitable person, or having appointed the father or mother, may remove him or her if it appear that such person is unsuitable, and appoint a suitable person.

       Divorced parent who had no authority to bind the estate of the parent’s teenage child in a settlement could not bind the estate to an attorney’s fee contract, particularly when such a contract would have to have been, but was not, approved by the chancery court. In re Wilhite, 121 So.3d 301, 2013 Miss. App. LEXIS 582 (Miss. Ct. App. 2013).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancellor’s findings on the factor of stability of the home environment and employment of each parent were supported by substantial evidence; the employment factor favored the mother, who held the same job for over eight years, but the home factor favored the father because he remained in the marital home and accepted the support offered by his family. Woodham v. Woodham, 17 So.3d 153, 2009 Miss. App. LEXIS 173 (Miss. Ct. App. 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding the continuity of care factor, the chancellor found that this favored neither parent and sufficient evidence supported this finding; the testimony indicated that both parents cared for the child while receiving assistance from family members. Woodham v. Woodham, 17 So.3d 153, 2009 Miss. App. LEXIS 173 (Miss. Ct. App. 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       Child was four years old at the time of trial, the chancellor found that both parents could and did take care of the child’s basic needs, and although the child was female, the father’s mother and grandmother were very active in the child’s life; the court could not say that the chancellor was without sufficient evidence to find that this factor concerning the age, health, and sex of the child favored neither party. Woodham v. Woodham, 17 So.3d 153, 2009 Miss. App. LEXIS 173 (Miss. Ct. App. 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       Mother’s argument that the chancellor improperly weighed the Albright v. Albright factors was without merit; the chancellor was in the best position to evaluate the evidence and was not manifestly wrong in finding that child’s best interests would be served by awarding custody to the father. Woodham v. Woodham, 17 So.3d 153, 2009 Miss. App. LEXIS 173 (Miss. Ct. App. 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       Modification of divorce decree awarding custody of minor children to father, and not maternal grandmother, was proper where, although grandmother met burden of showing that children’s mother was unfit to have custody, she had not met that burden as to children’s father. Milam v. Milam, 509 So. 2d 864, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2509 (Miss. 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       Award of custody of children to husband is not impermissibly based solely on wife’s adultery where chancellor looks to work schedules, life styles, and other criteria and, while finding that no special circumstances exist to justify granting custody to adulterous mother, considers adultery as but one factor in overall consideration. Carr v. Carr, 480 So. 2d 1120, 1985 Miss. LEXIS 2379 (Miss. 1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       In determining relative fitness of parents to be awarded custody of child, adultery may be unwholesome influence and impairment to child’s best interest or may have no effect; this factor should be considered by trial court along with all others when making original custody determinations; marital fault should not be used as sanction in custody award. Carr v. Carr, 480 So. 2d 1120, 1985 Miss. LEXIS 2379 (Miss. 1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c13s93-13-1" target="_self">93-13-1</a></cite>, the polestar consideration in child custody cases is the best interest and welfare of the child, and the age of the child is subordinated to that rule and is but one factor to be considered; other factors to be considered are health and sex of the child, a determination of which parent had the continuing care of the child prior to the separation, which parent has the best parenting skills, which has the willingness and capacity to provide primary child care, employment responsibilities of the parents, physical and mental health and age of the parents, emotional ties of parent and child, moral fitness of parents, the home, school and community record of the child, the preference of the child at the age sufficient by law to express a preference, the stability of the home environment and employment of each parent, and other factors relevant to the parent-child relationship; on the other hand, marital fault should not be used as a sanction in custody awards, relative financial situations are not controlling, and differences in religion, personal values and lifestyles should not be the sole basis for custody decisions. Albright v. Albright, 437 So. 2d 1003, 1005, 1983 Miss. LEXIS 2906 (Miss. 1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       In order to overcome the presumption that it is to the best interest of children that they should be put in the custody of their parents, there must be a clear showing that the parent has abandoned the child, or that the conduct of the parent is so immoral as to be detrimental to the child, or that the parent is unfit mentally or otherwise to have the custody of his or her child. Simpson v. Rast, 258 So. 2d 233, 1972 Miss. LEXIS 1488 (Miss. 1972).
      </p>
      <p>
       The custody of a child may, where the parents are divorced, be awarded to either; as the best interest of the child may indicate. Shoffner v. Shoffner, 244 Miss. 557, 145 So. 2d 149, 1962 Miss. LEXIS 476 (Miss. 1962).
      </p>
      <p>
       In determining the right to the custody of a minor child, as between parents, the best interest of the child rather than the selfish desires of the parents, is of paramount concern. Davis v. Holland, 239 Miss. 514, 123 So. 2d 850, 1960 Miss. LEXIS 316 (Miss. 1960).
      </p>
      <p>
       Neither father nor mother has any paramount right over the other concerning the custody of a minor child, unless the child’s welfare is involved. Brown v. Brown, 237 Miss. 53, 112 So. 2d 556, 1959 Miss. LEXIS 448 (Miss. 1959).
      </p>
      <p>
       The chancery court has a broad discretion in determining issue of custody of a child. Scott v. Scott, 219 Miss. 614, 69 So. 2d 489, 1954 Miss. LEXIS 370 (Miss. 1954).
      </p>
      <p>
       Neither the father nor the mother has any paramount right over the other concerning the custody of a child, where such custody would not adversely affect the child’s welfare and the paramount consideration is the welfare of the child and where the child is of such tender age as to require the mother’s care for its physical welfare it should be awarded to her custody, at least until it reaches that age and maturity where it can be equally cared for by other persons. Scott v. Scott, 219 Miss. 614, 69 So. 2d 489, 1954 Miss. LEXIS 370 (Miss. 1954); Bland v. Stoudemire, 219 Miss. 526, 69 So. 2d 225, 1954 Miss. LEXIS 359 (Miss. 1954).
      </p>
      <p>
       Neither the father nor the mother has any paramount right over the other concerning the custody of a minor, where such custody would not adversely affect the child’s welfare. Boswell v. Pope, 213 Miss. 31, 56 So. 2d 1, 1952 Miss. LEXIS 328 (Miss. 1952); Kennedy v. Kennedy, 222 Miss. 469, 76 So. 2d 375, 1954 Miss. LEXIS 666 (Miss. 1954).
      </p>
      <p>
       In determining the custody of a child, the paramount consideration is the welfare of the child. Boswell v. Pope, 213 Miss. 31, 56 So. 2d 1, 1952 Miss. LEXIS 328 (Miss. 1952).
      </p>
      <p>
       Policy of law is that children of divorced parents shall remain in custody of one of the parents unless they are both clearly unfit, and unfitness may be found in such want of willingness or ability to control and discipline child that child is obviously in serious danger of becoming immoral or delinquent to extent of being, in future, unacceptable member of adult citizenship of state. Mahaffey v. Mahaffey, 176 Miss. 733, 170 So. 289, 1936 Miss. LEXIS 170 (Miss. 1936).

      </h4>
      <p>
       Chancery court did not err in granting custody to the father after finding that he had not deserted his child because there was no legally compelling reason to alter or abandon the established standards for rebuttal of the natural-parent presumption; requiring the maternal grandmother first to demonstrate that the father had relinquished his right to parent his child was not an undue burden. Davis v. Vaughn, 126 So.3d 33, 2013 Miss. LEXIS 594 (Miss. 2013).
      </p>
      <p>
       In an action on a maternal grandmother’s petition for custody of a minor child, it was error to find that the natural parent presumption had been rebutted because a father agreed to a temporary custody order, as the father did not relinquish custody or abandon the child but allowed the grandmother to retain custody pending a hearing. Vaughn v. Davis, 36 So.3d 1261, 2010 Miss. LEXIS 303 (Miss. 2010).

       Regarding the home, school, and community record of the child, substantial evidence supported the finding of the chancellor that this factor favored the father because he remained in the marital home and his grandmother would continue to spend seven or eight hours a day with the child, five days a week or more, and the grandmother taught the child how to count, write her name, and recite the alphabet; the mother’s relationship with the father’s family, including the grandmother, had degraded. Woodham v. Woodham, 17 So.3d 153, 2009 Miss. App. LEXIS 173 (Miss. Ct. App. 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding the factor of moral fitness of the parents, the chancellor found that this favored the father because of the mother’s adultery; the mother admitted that the child was present on some occasions when the mother was with her paramour and the evidence supported the chancellor’s finding in this regard. Woodham v. Woodham, 17 So.3d 153, 2009 Miss. App. LEXIS 173 (Miss. Ct. App. 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       Court found no abuse of discretion in the chancellor’s decision to grant sole legal and physical custody of the child to the father; although the mother claimed joint custody was better, her assertion was belied by testimony that her relationship with the father had been strained by adultery and the child would soon be in kindergarten and the court had held that the stability of the home was crucial to the beginning stages of a child’s education. Woodham v. Woodham, 17 So.3d 153, 2009 Miss. App. LEXIS 173 (Miss. Ct. App. 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding the factor of physical and mental health of the parents, substantial evidence supported the chancellor’s finding that this factor favored the father because the mother manifested poor judgment in combining alcohol with the anti-depressants and the child had a generally low energy level and often appeared unusually tired in the afternoons. Woodham v. Woodham, 17 So.3d 153, 2009 Miss. App. LEXIS 173 (Miss. Ct. App. 2009).

   Appointment of the father as co-guardian of the person and estate of his children with the children’s aunt was inappropriate under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c13s93-13-1" target="_self">93-13-1</a></cite> and Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c19s93-19-5" target="_self">93-19-5</a></cite> because parental deficiencies not sinking to the level of unfitness were not sufficient to deny a parent the management of his or her minor children’s financial affairs.

      </p>
      <p>
       A father’s act of signing a routine waiver of process incident to a proceeding for the appointment of a guardian for his son did not constitute “abandonment” and he did not thereby relinquish his custody rights to the child; the mere appointment of a guardian of the person and/or estate of a minor does not of itself strip a parent of all of his or her rights in the child, nor is there anything in the nature of a guardianship that requires it to last until adulthood. Ethredge v. Yawn, 605 So. 2d 761, 1992 Miss. LEXIS 440 (Miss. 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the chancellor found that a father who had killed his child’s mother was mentally and morally unfit to have the child’s custody, and granted complete custody to the maternal grandparents, it was not error for the chancellor to grant liberal visitation rights to the father. Veselits v. Cruthirds, 548 So. 2d 1312, 1989 Miss. LEXIS 430 (Miss. 1989).

       Natural father is entitled to custody of his minor children unless it is clearly shown that he has (1) abandoned the children, or (2) his conduct is so immoral as to be detrimental to the children, or (3) he is unfit mentally or otherwise to have custody. Rutland v. Pridgen, 493 So. 2d 952, 1986 Miss. LEXIS 2594 (Miss. 1986).

       In a custody dispute between the father of a three-year-old child and the child’s stepfather that arose after the child’s mother had died in a car accident, the trial court erred in awarding custody to the stepfather, even though the court found that the father had failed to make support payments, where it made no finding, required by this section, that the father was an immoral or unfit person, or that he had abandoned his child.

       The fact that the natural father of 3 children drank beer on Sunday and did not attend church, was not sufficient to show that the father was unfit to rear his own children so as to prevent him from regaining custody from the husband of his former wife, who was awarded custody in a divorce decree, after the death of the former wife, particularly where failure to allow the father to regain custody would deliver the petitioner’s teenage daughter into the care of a man who admitted that the girl’s mother had been his mistress and whose amorous proclivities were well documented in the record.

       Mother was not entitled to the natural parent presumption because she had previously consented to the adoption of her child by her parents and relinquished her legal relationship with the child as his parent. An adoption, once entered, acted as an irrevocable surrender of all rights, obligations, and privileges of the natural parent with and to the child. D.M. v. D.R., 62 So.3d 920, 2011 Miss. LEXIS 172 (Miss. 2011).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancellor found that the factor regarding parenting skills favored the father because he showed greater willingness and capacity to provide primary childcare and the mother sacrificed the relationship with her child and marriage to be with her paramour; the court was satisfied that the chancellor’s findings on this issue were supported by the evidence and did not amount to a sanction against the mother for her adultery. Woodham v. Woodham, 17 So.3d 153, 2009 Miss. App. LEXIS 173 (Miss. Ct. App. 2009).

       Fact that no guardian ad litem had been appointed for minor in Ohio proceeding did not render Ohio court without jurisdiction to enter order finding that father had not sexually abused the minor, since, it would be presumed that the mother, as actual guardian of the child, had acted in the best interest of the child in the Ohio proceeding and, thus, mother was not entitled to relitigate the abuse issue in Mississippi.

       The court which granted divorce decree to wife improperly directed that payment of $200 by husband should be in full settlement of alimony for wife and support for nine-month-old child, and three years later, on showing that wife could earn nothing and that child needed medical attention, court properly directed husband, who was remarried, had another child, and was earning about $80.00 per month, to pay $12.00 per month for child’s support, since a father’s duty to support his child is absolute when necessity arises.

      <p>
       Chancellor did not abuse its discretion in awarding joint physical custody of a child to the paternal grandparent and to the maternal great-grandparents of the child, after finding both natural parents unfit, because the chancellor considered the statutory and the caselaw factors, and acted within its authority, in determining the best interests of the child. Moreover, the chancellor’s award of joint custody was supported by substantial evidence. Darby v. Combs, 229 So.3d 136, 2016 Miss. App. LEXIS 681 (Miss. Ct. App. 2016), aff'd, 229 So.3d 108, 2017 Miss. LEXIS 433 (Miss. 2017).
      </p>
      <p>
       Law does not allow parental rights to supercede the best interests of the child; parental rights, as is true of other fundamental rights, can be forfeited or taken away, and the law does recognize some means by which third parties can overcome the law’s preference of natural parents. Davis v. Vaughn, 126 So.3d 33, 2013 Miss. LEXIS 594 (Miss. 2013).
      </p>
      <p>
       In evaluating custody, the trial court focused on the father’s desire to have custody of the child, but the undisputed record revealed that for two and a half years, the father had no contact with the child; further, the father provided no financial support, nor did he send any birthday or Christmas cards or gifts to the child. As a matter of law the father’s actions (or lack thereof) during the two and a half years before the mother’s death constituted desertion; because the evidence of desertion was clear, the trial court erred in awarding custody to the natural father without an on-the-record analysis of the child’s best interests utilizing the Albright factors. Pendleton v. Leverock (In re Marriage of Leverock), 23 So.3d 424, 2009 Miss. LEXIS 599 (Miss. 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancellor effectively found that a mother was an unfit parent, while holding out hope that with some assistance, she might be rehabilitated; based upon that belief of possible rehabilitation, the chancellor made a determination that it was in the best interest of the child that her primary custody be placed with her grandmother, but with the mother continuing to have a role in the child’s life. The chancellor specifically noted and gave proper consideration to a guardian ad litem’s recommendation, and he stated why he felt the best interest of the child required that the child’s grandmother have primary custody. McCraw v. Buchanan, 10 So.3d 979, 2009 Miss. App. LEXIS 242 (Miss. Ct. App. 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court did not err in finding the father to be an unfit parent and awarding custody of his son to custodial parents where the evidence, such as immoral behavior and traits, demonstrated that the father was unfit and the chancellor properly applied the Albright factors to award custody; the decision was supported by the evidence and was not an abuse of discretion. In re Custody of M. A. G., 859 So. 2d 1001, 2003 Miss. LEXIS 451 (Miss. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       Grandparents have no right to custody of a grandchild as against a natural parent; thus, a chancellor erred in awarding custody of a child to his grandmother based on the finding that the child’s father was “unprepared” where the chancellor did not make a specific finding as to whether the father was an unfit parent. Carter v. Taylor, 611 So. 2d 874, 1992 Miss. LEXIS 790 (Miss. 1992).
      </p>

       A chancellor erred in declining to award attorney’s fees to a child’s maternal grandparents for defending a custody action brought by the child’s father, who had killed the child’s mother. Veselits v. Cruthirds, 548 So. 2d 1312, 1989 Miss. LEXIS 430 (Miss. 1989).
      </p>

       The trial court erred by retaining the paternal grandmother as the guardian of the estate of her two grandchildren where the court had held that the mother was a suitable person to have custody of the children. In re Guardianship of Brown, 402 So. 2d 354, 1981 Miss. LEXIS 2143 (Miss. 1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       The law presumes that parents will love their children most and will care for them most wisely and that it is to the best interests of children that they should be put in the custody of their parents, and while such presumption may be overcome, children are not to be taken from their parents and given to a third person simply because the third person is more able financially to give the child a greater advantage in life.

       Where a child over the age of fourteen years, whose mother died in childbirth and whose father left her with her maternal grandparent, was passionately opposed to going with her father, custody was awarded to the maternal grandparents where it was for the best interests of the child, notwithstanding that the father and his second wife were suitable to have custody of such child.

   Appointment of the father as co-guardian of the person and estate of his children with the children’s aunt was inappropriate under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c13s93-13-1" target="_self">93-13-1</a></cite> and Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c19s93-19-5" target="_self">93-19-5</a></cite> because parental deficiencies not sinking to the level of unfitness were not sufficient to deny a parent the management of his or her minor children’s financial affairs. Anderson v. Hoover (In re the Guardianship of Williams), 930 So. 2d 491, 2006 Miss. App. LEXIS 429 (Miss. Ct. App. 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       A father’s act of signing a routine waiver of process incident to a proceeding for the appointment of a guardian for his son did not constitute “abandonment” and he did not thereby relinquish his custody rights to the child; the mere appointment of a guardian of the person and/or estate of a minor does not of itself strip a parent of all of his or her rights in the child, nor is there anything in the nature of a guardianship that requires it to last until adulthood. Ethredge v. Yawn, 605 So. 2d 761, 1992 Miss. LEXIS 440 (Miss. 1992).

       Custody of persons and estates of wards can be determined only by chancery court; not by habeas corpus. Herndon v. Bonner, 97 Miss. 328, 52 So. 513, 1910 Miss. LEXIS 246 (Miss. 1910).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the guardian is not the parent of the ward, but the latter has a parent living, the guardianship of the estate is distinct from the guardianship of the person of the ward. In granting letters, ordinarily, the court should not award the custody of the infant. McDowell v. Bonner, 62 Miss. 278, 1884 Miss. LEXIS 70 (Miss. 1884).

       A provision in the will of a married woman purporting to make her husband the guardian of their child was not aided by Code 1880, § 2095, providing that a father might, by will, give to another the custody of his child during its infancy and thereby invest the custodian with the powers of a guardian, although the will was executed and the testatrix died while said code was operative. Edwards v. Kelly, 83 Miss. 144, 35 So. 418, 1903 Miss. LEXIS 22 (Miss. 1903).

    Appointment of guardian by court [Effective until January 1, 2020].

     <p>
      When a testamentary guardian has not been appointed by the parent, or if appointed, has not qualified, the chancery court of the county of the residence of a ward who has an estate, real or personal, shall appoint a general guardian of his estate for him or may appoint a general guardian of his person and estate for him. If a ward have no estate the chancery court of the county of the residence of such ward may appoint a general guardian of his person only for him, giving preference in all cases to the natural guardian, or next of kin, if any apply, unless the applicant be manifestly unsuitable for the discharge of the duties. The court may allow a minor who is over the age of fourteen (14) years and under no legal disability except minority to select a general guardian, by petition to the court, signed and acknowledged before the clerk or a justice of the peace, and duly filed, but if the general guardian so selected by the minor be guardian of the person and estate of the minor or the person only of the minor then such general guardian so selected by said minor shall be a suitable and qualified person who is a resident of this state and the county in which the guardianship proceedings are pending. If the said minor desires to so select a person as general guardian of his person and estate or of his person only who is a resident of this state but who is not a resident of the county in which the guardianship proceedings are pending he may do so but thereupon such guardianship proceedings or cause shall be transferred to the county of the residence of such general guardian so selected and thereupon the minor shall be and become a legal resident of the county of the residence of such general guardian so selected. The said minor may select in the above manner a general guardian of his estate only which may be a corporation but such corporation shall be duly qualified to do business in this state and otherwise suitable. If said minor select a person other than the natural guardian to be either the general guardian of his estate or general guardian of his person and estate or general guardian of his person only the court shall, notwithstanding, have power to appoint the natural guardian, if deemed suitable. And if any such minor over the age of fourteen (14) years fail to appear and select a general guardian of his estate only or of his estate and person or of his person only when summoned, or if the general guardian chosen fail to qualify, and no other be chosen in his stead, the court shall appoint a general guardian to the minor as if he were under fourteen (14) years. When any ward, who is not a resident of the state, owns property, real or personal, in this state, the chancery court of the county in which the property may be, may appoint a general guardian for such ward who shall be the general guardian of his estate only. If the ward be a minor over fourteen (14) years of age and under no legal disability except minority, the selection of guardian may be made before a clerk of a court of record of the state or county of his residence, and a certificate of such clerk, under his seal of office, shall be received as evidence of the selection.

       Laws, 1981, ch. 471, as part of a continuing overall legislative design to replace justice of the peace courts with justice courts and justices of the peace with justice court judges, amended numerous sections of the Mississippi Code of 1972 affecting justices of the peace and justice of the peace courts.

       Where minors were residents of Webster County at the time of their parents’ death and were without an estate in another county, appointment of a guardian or guardians for the minors was governed by this section, and the Chancery Court of Webster County had exclusive jurisdiction. Although the minors had resided with their grandmother in Choctaw County since the death of their parents, the relatively short time since the parents’ death refuted the creation of an in loco parentis status carrying with it the exclusive right of custody and upbringing which would prohibit the application of this section. In re Guardianship of Watson, 317 So. 2d 30, 1975 Miss. LEXIS 1723 (Miss. 1975).

   A child’s paternal grandmother was entitled to reasonable advance notice of a guardianship proceeding with respect to the child and an opportunity to be heard because she was an eligible next of kin under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c13s93-13-13" target="_self">93-13-13</a></cite>. Thus, a judgment appointing a guardian for the child would be vacated where the grandmother did not receive notice of the proceeding; a hearing on a motion to vacate the order appointing the guardian did not afford the grandmother the opportunity for a hearing to which she was entitled because she was in the posture of one seeking to remove a guardian and as such, carried a heavy burden, above and beyond what would have been demanded of her had she been a party in the original proceeding. In re Guardianship of Jefferson, 573 So. 2d 769, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 799 (Miss. 1990).

       The manner of selection of guardians as provided by the statute is not exclusive and a selection made by a notary public was sufficient where the notary public was authorized to administer oaths. Vaughn v. Vaughn, 226 Miss. 153, 83 So. 2d 821, 1955 Miss. LEXIS 618 (Miss. 1955).

       Appointment of orphaned child’s grandmother as guardian without notice was of no effect against persons who, having lawfully taken such child into their custody and assumed the obligations to her incident to the parental relation, stood in loco parentis to her.

      </p>
      <p>
       In habeas corpus proceedings by grandmother who had obtained appointment as guardian of orphaned child without notice, evidence sustained award of custody to persons who, having lawfully taken child into their custody and assumed the obligations to her incident to the parental relation, stood in loco parentis to her.

       If the record of the appointment of a guardian shows that the minor resides in this state, but in a county other than the one where the appointment is made, the appointment is void. Duke v. State, 57 Miss. 229, 1879 Miss. LEXIS 52 (Miss. 1879).

    Appointment of guardian by court [Repealed effective January 1, 2020]
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      When a testamentary guardian has not been appointed by the parent, or if appointed, has not qualified, the chancery court of the county of the residence of a ward who has an estate, real or personal, shall appoint a general guardian of his estate for him or may appoint a general guardian of his person and estate for him. If a ward have no estate the chancery court of the county of the residence of such ward may appoint a general guardian of his person only for him, giving preference in all cases to the natural guardian, or next of kin, if any apply, unless the applicant be manifestly unsuitable for the discharge of the duties. The court may allow a minor who is over the age of fourteen (14) years and under no legal disability except minority to select a general guardian, by petition to the court, signed and acknowledged before the clerk or a justice of the peace, and duly filed, but if the general guardian so selected by the minor be guardian of the person and estate of the minor or the person only of the minor then such general guardian so selected by said minor shall be a suitable and qualified person who is a resident of this state and the county in which the guardianship proceedings are pending. If the said minor desires to so select a person as general guardian of his person and estate or of his person only who is a resident of this state but who is not a resident of the county in which the guardianship proceedings are pending he may do so but thereupon such guardianship proceedings or cause shall be transferred to the county of the residence of such general guardian so selected and thereupon the minor shall be and become a legal resident of the county of the residence of such general guardian so selected. The said minor may select in the above manner a general guardian of his estate only which may be a corporation but such corporation shall be duly qualified to do business in this state and otherwise suitable. If said minor select a person other than the natural guardian to be either the general guardian of his estate or general guardian of his person and estate or general guardian of his person only the court shall, notwithstanding, have power to appoint the natural guardian, if deemed suitable. And if any such minor over the age of fourteen (14) years fail to appear and select a general guardian of his estate only or of his estate and person or of his person only when summoned, or if the general guardian chosen fail to qualify, and no other be chosen in his stead, the court shall appoint a general guardian to the minor as if he were under fourteen (14) years. When any ward, who is not a resident of the state, owns property, real or personal, in this state, the chancery court of the county in which the property may be, may appoint a general guardian for such ward who shall be the general guardian of his estate only. If the ward be a minor over fourteen (14) years of age and under no legal disability except minority, the selection of guardian may be made before a clerk of a court of record of the state or county of his residence, and a certificate of such clerk, under his seal of office, shall be received as evidence of the selection.

    Bond and oath of guardian.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Every guardian, before he shall have authority to act, shall, unless security be dispensed with by will or writing or as hereinafter provided, enter into bond payable to the state, in such penalty and with such sureties as the court may require; and the bond shall be recorded and may be put in suit for any breach of the condition, whether the appointment be legal or not; and the condition shall be as follows:
     </p>
     <p>
      “The condition of the above obligation is that if the above bound_______________ , as guardian of_______________ , of_______________County, shall faithfully discharge all the duties required of him by law, then the above obligation shall cease.”
     </p>
     <p>
      And the guardian shall also take and subscribe an oath, at or prior to the time of his appointment, faithfully to discharge the duties of guardian of the ward according to law.
     </p>
     <p>
      A guardian need not enter into bond, however, as to such part of the assets of the ward’s estate as may, pursuant to an order of the court in its discretion, be deposited in any one or more banking corporations, building and loan associations or savings and loan associations in this state so long as such deposits are fully insured, such deposits there to remain until the further order of the court, and a certified copy of the order for deposit having been furnished the depository or depositories and its receipt acknowledged.

       Chancery court erred by not requiring the disabled son’s mother to deposit all support paid by the father for the benefit of the son to a conservatorship account and in not requiring the mother to file an inventory and accounting of all support funds and to post a bond because the son may receive funds in the future that would constitute a separate financial estate and therefore the mother should have been required to comply with the statutory safeguards. Ravenstein v. Hawkins, 167 So.3d 210, 2014 Miss. LEXIS 326 (Miss. 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       Former wife’s claim that a conservatorship was invalid due to the chancery court’s failure to require the co-conservators to post a bond was procedurally barred from consideration because the wife failed to raise the issue in the chancery court; assuming that a bond should have been required, mere irregularities in the appointment or proceedings were immune from collateral attack, and thus, the absence of bond was a curable defect. Collins v. Pinnacle Trust, 147 So.3d 830, 2014 Miss. LEXIS 103 (Miss. 2014).

   A person’s authority to act as a legal guardian under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c13s93-13-17" target="_self">93-13-17</a></cite> may not be attacked, collaterally or otherwise, unless he or she is given the opportunity to post the bond required by decree of the chancellor.

   A bank was improperly held in contempt for allowing a former guardian to make withdrawals from an infant’s account without a court order, where the decree of the chancellor waiving the guardian’s bond and requiring that funds in the infant’s estate not be withdrawn from the bank without a court order, made pursuant to §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c13s93-13-17" target="_self">93-13-17</a></cite>, was void as to the bank, which was neither served with notice nor given an opportunity to be heard, and thus, the bank could not be held in contempt for failure to abide by the chancellor’s decree. Mississippi Bank v. Kelly, 445 So. 2d 849, 1984 Miss. LEXIS 1632 (Miss. 1984).
      </p>
      <p>
       Guardian who never posted the bond required by decree of the court authorizing her to settle doubtful claim of ward acted without authority in releasing such claim, and the release which she executed was null and void; it is incumbent upon those paying money to a guardian to make certain that the chancellor’s decree is faithfully executed in every respect. Joyce v. Brown, 304 So. 2d 634, 1974 Miss. LEXIS 1455 (Miss. 1974).

       A guardian’s bond is not discharged by the execution of a second bond given to meet an increase of the ward’s estate. Baum v. Lynn, 72 Miss. 932, 18 So. 428, 1895 Miss. LEXIS 52 (Miss. 1895).

       Where a guardian appeared in open court and voluntarily tendered a new bond, which was by the chancellor approved, the necessity for a summons and a precedent order is dispensed with.

       Demurrer was properly sustained to bill of review by restored incompetent against his wife (as former guardian), the successor guardian, together with the sureties on their respective bonds, as to the sale of land by the successor guardian to the wife after her resignation, then subsequently sold by her to third persons, where there was no charge in the bill that any of the expenditures made by the guardians were not fully authorized by the court, or that they were not fully supported by legal vouchers, there was no charge that the land was sold for less than a full and fair value, and it appeared that the proceeds of the sales were expended under orders of the court mainly for the support and maintenance of the complainant’s minor children. O'Flarity v. O'Flarity, 201 Miss. 61, 28 So. 2d 569, 1947 Miss. LEXIS 368 (Miss. 1947).

      <p>
       Sustaining demurrer to bill of complaint by restored incompetent against his wife as former guardian to the effect that the complainant owned a stock of goods which was withheld from the inventory and was converted by such former guardian to her own use, was erroneous since such allegation required an answer when considered as being in the nature of a bill of review to surcharge her account as guardian. O'Flarity v. O'Flarity, 201 Miss. 61, 28 So. 2d 569, 1947 Miss. LEXIS 368 (Miss. 1947).
      </p>
      <p>
       When guardian converts ward’s money to his personal use without previously having arranged by proper proceeding to borrow funds on security approved by court, guardian is guilty of breach of his bond, and guardian and his bondsmen are liable as in debt for money converted and such debt cannot be released except on payment therefor in money. Reily v. Crymes, 176 Miss. 133, 168 So. 267, 1936 Miss. LEXIS 121 (Miss. 1936).

       The liability of a surety is a debt chargeable upon his lands over and above what his personal estate may be sufficient to pay. Savings Bldg. & Loan Ass'n v. Tart, 81 Miss. 276, 32 So. 115, 1902 Miss. LEXIS 103 (Miss. 1902).

      <p>
       When a guardian has taken possession of, and for years exercises control over, the estate of his ward, the sureties on his bond are estopped by its recitals to deny the validity of his appointment in a proceeding after his death to recover the balance due the estate of the ward.

       A surety is not released by decree of the court approving acts of the guardian subsequent to the unauthorized acts; nothing but the payment can discharge the obligation. Bell v. Rudolph, 70 Miss. 234, 12 So. 153, 1892 Miss. LEXIS 95 (Miss. 1892).

      </p>
      <p>
       If a guardian neglect to collect a specified note due him as such, and delivers the same to his successor, his wards are not estopped from charging him and his sureties, as if he had actually collected the money due on the note, with interest, by the fact that they reduced the note to judgment against the maker even where the guardian is himself the maker of the note.

       Sureties held not relieved from liability on bond of incompetent’s guardian for guardian’s conversion of incompetent’s funds prior to time when court issued orders allowing guardian to borrow such funds on ground that court without sureties’ knowledge or consent made improvident orders releasing security given by guardian until security became inadequate to cover amount converted. Reily v. Crymes, 176 Miss. 133, 168 So. 267, 1936 Miss. LEXIS 121 (Miss. 1936).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence held to justify decree holding sureties on bond of incompetent’s guardian liable for guardian’s conversion of incompetent’s funds, notwithstanding court’s orders allowing guardian to borrow incompetent’s funds, on ground that guardian appropriated funds to his own personal use as fast as he received money for incompetent, and hence orders were void for fraud in procuring them because of failure to disclose previous conversion of funds. Reily v. Crymes, 176 Miss. 133, 168 So. 267, 1936 Miss. LEXIS 121 (Miss. 1936).
      </p>
      <p>
       Sureties on bond of incompetent’s deceased guardian could not claim that successor guardian failed to prove that guardian had converted incompetent’s funds prior to petitioning court for permission to borrow such funds because of failure of administrator of deceased guardian to testify as to what money and effects deceased guardian had on his death, where admitted decree of insolvency of guardian’s estate at time of his death made such proof unnecessary. Reily v. Crymes, 176 Miss. 133, 168 So. 267, 1936 Miss. LEXIS 121 (Miss. 1936).
      </p>
      <p>
       Except as authorized by statute, guardian has no right to convert money of his ward to his own use and to spend it for his own personal purposes, and when he does so, it is as much an “embezzlement” as when treasurer of corporation or other fiduciary of funds does the like. Reily v. Crymes, 176 Miss. 133, 168 So. 267, 1936 Miss. LEXIS 121 (Miss. 1936).

       The sureties of the new bond are liable, not only for the money and assets of the ward’s estate, which actually came into the hands of the guardian after the execution of the new bond, but also for such as he might and could have collected by faithful administration of his office. McWilliams v. Norfleet, 63 Miss. 183, 1885 Miss. LEXIS 43 (Miss. 1885).

       When guardian converts ward’s money to his personal use without previously having arranged by proper proceeding to borrow funds on security approved by court, guardian is guilty of breach of his bond, and guardian and his bondsmen are liable as in debt for money converted and such debt cannot be released except on payment thereof in money.

      </p>
      <p>
       Court may aid bondsmen of guardian who has converted ward’s money without authority by accepting security for accrued debt from guardian, and enforcing it in behalf of bondsmen, but court has no power to release obligation of bondsmen on such security however ample, and liability continues until satisfied by payment and security of payment by mortgage or deed of trust on property, however adequate at time, is not such “payment.” Reily v. Crymes, 176 Miss. 133, 168 So. 267, 1936 Miss. LEXIS 121 (Miss. 1936).

       The sureties cannot claim exemption from the rule excluding parol evidence in such case on the ground that they were not parties to the contract. As they claim under it, they are bound by its terms. Baum v. Lynn, 72 Miss. 932, 18 So. 428, 1895 Miss. LEXIS 52 (Miss. 1895).

       The fact that the personal representative has filed an account of the guardianship, to which exceptions are pending, does not prevent suit on the bond by the wards for an account and to recover their estate and to subject property fraudulently conveyed by one of the sureties.

      <p>
       To sustain an action on a guardian’s bond for a failure to deliver property to a subsequent guardian, it is unnecessary first to establish a decree of the chancery court directing its delivery; and in a suit thereon for a defalcation, it is unnecessary to show a decree in the first instance establishing the amount of the debt.

       Attorney’s disbarment from the practice of law was appropriate because his fraud, perjury, embezzlement, and abuse concerning a minor client’s guardianship rendered him grossly unfit to practice law. Consequently, the Mississippi Bar met its burden to show that the attorney should be disbarred immediately. Miss. Bar v. Brown, 118 So.3d 545, 2012 Miss. LEXIS 474 (Miss. 2012).

       This section [Code 1942, § 407] committing the guardianship of minors to the clerk of the chancery court in certain cases does not confer jurisdiction on the court, but is merely statutory direction as to its general jurisdiction already existing under the constitution, and its decree appointing the clerk guardian cannot be collaterally attacked. This can only be done by showing that under no circumstances could the court have exercised jurisdiction. Ames v. Williams, 72 Miss. 760, 17 So. 762, 1895 Miss. LEXIS 28 (Miss. 1895).
      </p>
      <p>
       In minor’s business, as in matters of general equity, the chancery court exercises a general jurisdiction conferred by the constitution, and its records need not show the facts authorizing the exercise of such jurisdiction in a particular case. Ames v. Williams, 72 Miss. 760, 17 So. 762, 1895 Miss. LEXIS 28 (Miss. 1895).
      </p>
      <p>
       The power of the chancery court to appoint guardians for minors does not depend on the statute regulating its exercise, but is a part of the general jurisdiction conferred by the constitution, and when such appointment is made every presumption applicable to the judgment of any other court of record is to be indulged in support of the decree. Ames v. Williams, 72 Miss. 760, 17 So. 762, 1895 Miss. LEXIS 28 (Miss. 1895).

       Because a chancery court clerk could be appointed as a guardian when no one else would qualify, the clerk’s official bond could be used to secure the performance of the clerk’s duties as guardian. United States Fid. & Guar. Co. v. Melson, 809 So. 2d 647, 2002 Miss. LEXIS 100 (Miss. 2002).
      </p>

       Where the chancery clerk has been appointed guardian, if no specified bond be required of him, the code provisions control, and his official bond will stand as security for the ward. Faust v. Murphy, 71 Miss. 120, 13 So. 862, 1893 Miss. LEXIS 135 (Miss. 1893).

       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       Whenever any guardian has wholly collected and wholly disbursed money arising from personalty or rents of land, the aggregate sum so collected and disbursed constitutes a part of the estate finally settled, and as to that amount he has discharged the guardian’s whole duty, and should receive a guardian’s whole compensation. Maxwell v. Harkleroad, 77 Miss. 456, 27 So. 990, 1899 Miss. LEXIS 99 (Miss. 1899).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where two or more clerks act successively for the same ward, no one of them (not having finally settled the estate) is entitled as compensation to five per centum commission on the value of the corpus of the ward’s real estate, in addition to the commission on his personal estate.

     <p>
      The court by which a guardian was appointed, may, for sufficient cause, remove him after having him cited to appear. If the court should ascertain that the sureties of a guardian were insufficient at the time the bond was executed, or have since become so, or are of doubtful solvency, it may require the guardian to give a new bond; and if he refuse or neglect to do so, he may be removed. If the sureties of any guardian apprehend danger, and desire to be discharged, they may petition the court for that purpose, and the guardian shall be cited, and if, on hearing, the court should be of opinion that the complaint is well founded, the guardian may be required to give a new bond, and, on failure to do so, may be removed.

       The terms “sureties” and “security” are used in their proper sense, the one indicating “persons” and the other “instruments,” which secure. If the old bond were executed by new sureties, it would thereby become a new security, and a new bond distinct from the former would be a new security. The name is not important.

       Conviction of guardian of embezzlement warrants removal, regardless of his appeal and release on bail. Clark v. Smith, 110 Miss. 728, 70 So. 897, 1916 Miss. LEXIS 202 (Miss. 1916); Hemphill v. Smith, 128 Miss. 586, 91 So. 337, 1922 Miss. LEXIS 141 (Miss. 1922).

    Removing guardian; requiring new bond [Repealed effective January 1, 2020]
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The court by which a guardian was appointed, may, for sufficient cause, remove him after having him cited to appear. If the court should ascertain that the sureties of a guardian were insufficient at the time the bond was executed, or have since become so, or are of doubtful solvency, it may require the guardian to give a new bond; and if he refuse or neglect to do so, he may be removed. If the sureties of any guardian apprehend danger, and desire to be discharged, they may petition the court for that purpose, and the guardian shall be cited, and if, on hearing, the court should be of opinion that the complaint is well founded, the guardian may be required to give a new bond, and, on failure to do so, may be removed.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The chancery court or chancellor in vacation, may, at discretion, settle the sum to be expended in the maintenance and education of a ward, having regard to his or her station, future prospects and destination; and may allow expenditures in excess of the income of the estate, and, if necessary, may order sale of so much of the personal estate as may be necessary to meet such expenditures. And if the personal estate and the rents and profits of the real estate be not sufficient for the maintenance and education of the ward, the court may, on investigation, decree the sale of such part of the real estate of the ward as may be necessary for the purpose; but if it be more advantageous to the ward, the court may order the sale of real estate in preference to the sale of personal property. No guardian shall make any expenditure in excess of his ward’s income for the ward’s support and education without a previous order of the court or chancellor authorizing the same.

       Where a former conservator applied to receive fees from the ward’s estate before he had filed an inventory of the estate, the chancery court improperly authorized the payment of excess fees that the conservator could not substantiate.

       A minor under guardianship is a ward of the chancery court, and all receipts and disbursements of his estate are required to be under the authority and direction of the chancery court or the chancellor in vacation.

       The amount of the expenditures by a guardian for the maintenance, support and education of his ward must be fixed by the court, there being no discretion in the guardian. Welch v. Childers, 195 Miss. 415, 15 So. 2d 690, 1943 Miss. LEXIS 167 (Miss. 1943).

      </p>
      <p>
       The guardian has no power to bind the estate of his ward without the sanction of the chancery court or the chancellor, and if the guardian contracts for the maintenance, support and education of his ward without the sanction of the court or chancellor, the liability therefor is personal to him, and he cannot be allowed for it in his accounts for the ward.

       Where a guardian applies for the sale of a ward’s land because of the insufficiency of the personal estate and the rents and profits of the real estate to maintain and educate him, or because it is deemed preferable that the real estate be sold instead of the personal, the court may act upon such application without previous issuance of a summons.

And such guardian may be authorized by the court or chancellor to purchase on behalf of and in the name of the ward with any funds of such ward’s estate sufficient and appropriate property for a home for such ward or his family on five (5) days’ notice to a member of said family, or the necessary funds may be borrowed and the property purchased given as security. The guardian is empowered to collect and sue for and recover all debts due his said ward, and shall make payment of his debts out of the personal estate as executors and administrators discharge debts out of the estate of decedents, but the exempt property of the ward shall not be liable for debts, and no debts against such estate shall be payable by such guardian unless first probated and registered, as required of claims against the estate of decedent.

         On application of the guardian or any interested party, and after notice to all interested persons and to such other persons as the court may direct, and on a showing that the ward will probably remain incompetent during his lifetime, the court may, after hearing and by order, authorize the guardian to apply such principal or income of the ward’s estate as is not required for the support of the ward during his lifetime or of his family towards the establishment of an estate plan for the purpose of minimizing income, estate, inheritance, or other taxes payable out of the ward’s estate. The court may authorize the guardian to make gifts of the ward’s personal property or real estate, outright or in trust, on behalf of the ward, to or for the benefit of (i) organizations to which charitable contributions may be made under the Internal Revenue Code and in which it is shown the ward would reasonably have an interest, (ii) the ward’s heirs at law who are identifiable at the time of the order, (iii) devisees under the ward’s last validly executed will, if there be such a will, and (iv) a person serving as guardian of the ward provided he is eligible under either category (ii) or (iii) above.

   Savings clause in Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.15.html#t15c01s15-1-59" target="_blank">15-1-59</a></cite> did not act to toll the statute of limitations regarding a judgment a ward’s conservator obtained in divorce action against the ward’s former husband. The right to pursue money owed to the ward was in the conservator not the ward so under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.15.html#t15c01s15-1-53" target="_blank">15-1-53</a></cite>, the statute of limitations ran against the conservator. Lewis v. Smith (In re Lewis), 110 So.3d 811, 2013 Miss. App. LEXIS 122 (Miss. Ct. App. 2013).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Chancery court did not err by refusing to appoint a first son as the conservator over a father’s estate because there was a conflict of interest, as the first son candidly admitted that he would not sue himself under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c13s93-13-38ol12" target="_self">93-13-38(2)</a></cite> to recover indebtedness he owed; moreover, a second son was properly appointed as a temporary conservator over the father’s person, despite the second son’s habit of drinking and smoking, because the second son was able to care for the father, and the father wished to remain in his residence. Cole v. Cole (In re Cole), 958 So. 2d 276, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 398 (Miss. Ct. App. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Where a former conservator applied to receive fees from the ward’s estate before he had filed an inventory of the estate, pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.39.html#t39c13s39-13-38ol12" target="_blank">39-13-38(2)</a></cite> the chancery court improperly authorized the payment of excess fees that the conservator could not substantiate. Bardwell v. Bardwell (In re Bardwell), 849 So. 2d 1240, 2003 Miss. LEXIS 336 (Miss. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section does not incorporate all statutes relating to estates and administration of decedents into the body of law regulating guardianships; rather, it only extends as far as applicable those provisions relating to settlement or disposition of property limitations, notices to creditors, probate and registration of claims, proceedings to insolvency and distribution of assets of insolvent estates. Jackson v. Jackson, 732 So. 2d 916, 1999 Miss. LEXIS 54 (Miss. 1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   This section does not incorporate §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.91.html#t91c07s91-7-3" target="_blank">91-7-3</a></cite>, which requires that letters of administration in the estate of a deceased person be granted preferring first the husband or wife into the body of law regulating guardianships. Jackson v. Jackson, 732 So. 2d 916, 1999 Miss. LEXIS 54 (Miss. 1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       A chancellor did not abuse his discretion in removing a conservator where inventories were not timely filed and no reason was given therefor, the conservator failed to seek court approval prior to making expenditures, and he purchased certificates of deposit, invested in stock and sold stock without prior approval. Mathews v. Williams (In re Mathews), 633 So. 2d 1038, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 123 (Miss. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Although the appointment of non-distributee relatives lies within the discretion of the chancery court under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.91.html#t91c07s91-7-63" target="_blank">91-7-63</a></cite>, a non-distributee relative had a legal right to letters of administration under the statute where she was the guardian of the sole minor heir. Matter of In re Estate of Moreland, 537 So. 2d 1337, 1989 Miss. LEXIS 2 (Miss. 1989).
      </p>
      <p>
       The chancery court erroneously held that payments of allowances directly to a ward, and expenditures for his support and maintenance, should be calculated on a monthly basis, for the entire statutory scheme of accounting for management of the estates of adult wards is on the basis of an annual accounting, so that the proper period for such calculation is a year. Neville v. Guardianship of Kelso, 247 So. 2d 828, 1971 Miss. LEXIS 1460 (Miss. 1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the guardian of an adult non compos mentis received several thousand dollars from insurance companies over a two-year period in settlement of claims of the ward arising out of automobile accidents, and paid considerable sums during those two years for medical and hospital expenses of the ward as a result of those accidents, and the recoveries reduced the net amount which had to be paid from the ward’s estate for his benefit, the guardian was entitled to have those recoveries applied as offsets to the expenses for the two-year period. Neville v. Guardianship of Kelso, 247 So. 2d 828, 1971 Miss. LEXIS 1460 (Miss. 1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the guardian of a non compos mentis adult fails to obtain a prior order approving a payment for his ward from income, he risks its disallowance by the court if the court finds insubstantial evidence that it was unreasonable or improper in supporting, maintaining, or educating the ward, and this interpretation is consistent with the terms of this section [Code 1942, § 440] with the legislative history of guardian and ward in Mississippi, and with the early, large body of case law on this subject. Neville v. Guardianship of Kelso, 247 So. 2d 828, 1971 Miss. LEXIS 1460 (Miss. 1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       Previously unauthorized but reasonable and proper expenditures from income for an adult non compos mentis ward may be ratified and approved by the court after they are made, either by special order or on the annual or final account, and it was error for the chancellor to refuse to ratify and approve reasonable income expenditures on the ground that they were not emergency expenditures and only emergency expenditures might be ratified in that way. Neville v. Guardianship of Kelso, 247 So. 2d 828, 1971 Miss. LEXIS 1460 (Miss. 1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       Supreme court, in affirming chancellor’s refusal to confirm first of several sales of land by guardian of non compos mentis, would not determine validity of guardian’s appointment or legality of sale to the highest bidder at the last sale, such matters not being presented by the record and the court being without the power or duty to render advisory opinions. Van Norman v. Barney, 199 Miss. 581, 24 So. 2d 866, 1946 Miss. LEXIS 227 (Miss. 1946).
      </p>
      <p>
       By virtue of this section [Code 1942, § 439], the statute requiring actions against executors or administrators to be brought within four years after their qualification as such (Code 1930, § 2295 [Code 1942, § 725] ), applies to claims against guardians for liability of their wards as well. First Nat'l Bank & Trust Co. v. Landau, 183 Miss. 651, 184 So. 618, 1938 Miss. LEXIS 278 (Miss. 1938).
      </p>
      <p>
       Guardian with approval of the chancery court may renounce husband’s will for widow non compos mentis. Hardy v. Richards, 98 Miss. 625, 54 So. 76, 1910 Miss. LEXIS 101 (Miss. 1910).

        2. Sale of ward’s land.
       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       Where both guardian’s petition and the advertisement under which sale of land was conducted omitted the township and range in which the land was located, the sale was void and consequently chancellor correctly refused to confirm title in the highest bidder. Van Norman v. Barney, 199 Miss. 581, 24 So. 2d 866, 1946 Miss. LEXIS 227 (Miss. 1946).
      </p>
      <p>
       Sale of lands of person of unsound mind for payment of his debts can only be made by order of court. Sale by execution is void. Saunders v. Mitchell, 61 Miss. 321, 1883 Miss. LEXIS 131 (Miss. 1883).

        3. Expenditure of ward’s income.
       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       While the capital of a ward’s estate could not be expended without court order, where funds were disbursed without such order directly to a ward, who had regained her mental competency, at her direction, and were also expended on her behalf to comply with a court order in another action, it was not the intent of the legislature to require the guardian, or his insurer, to repay those amounts to the estate, as such a result would create an unintended windfall to the estate. United States Fid. & Guar. Co. v. Melson, 809 So. 2d 647, 2002 Miss. LEXIS 100 (Miss. 2002).
      </p>
      <p>
       Guardian in order to expend more than income of ward’s estate, except under extraordinary circumstances, must first secure court order fixing amount to be expended. Deposit Guaranty Bank & Trust Co. v. Mangum, 172 Miss. 443, 160 So. 386, 1935 Miss. LEXIS 145 (Miss. 1935).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section [Code 1942, § 440] is not a mere re-enactment of common-law rule so as to give court authority to approve expenditures after they had been made, if court would have approved same had they been presented for allowance prior thereto. Deposit Guaranty Bank & Trust Co. v. Mangum, 172 Miss. 443, 160 So. 386, 1935 Miss. LEXIS 145 (Miss. 1935).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where record disclosed that guardian had expended ward’s funds and given ward money on ward’s request without written court order authorizing such expenditures as required by statute, decree which approved guardian’s final account was reversed and cause remanded to determine amount of sums which had to be expended before court order could be secured. Deposit Guaranty Bank & Trust Co. v. Mangum, 172 Miss. 443, 160 So. 386, 1935 Miss. LEXIS 145 (Miss. 1935).

       <p>
   Where it appeared from the order discharging the conservator that the chancellor did ratify an expense disputed by the son but used to provide the required care for decedent, and it was within her discretion to do so, the son’s claim pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c13s93-13-38" target="_self">93-13-38</a></cite> failed because there was substantial evidence to support the chancellor’s decision to overrule the son’s objections and discharge the conservator. Vinson v. Benson, 972 So. 2d 694, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 349 (Miss. Ct. App. 2007), cert. denied, 973 So. 2d 244, 2008 Miss. LEXIS 8 (Miss. 2008).

       All the provisions of the law on the subject of executors and administrators, relating to settlement or disposition of property limitations, notice to creditors, probate and registration of claims, proceedings to insolvency and distribution of assets of insolvent estates, shall, as far as applicable and not otherwise provided, be observed and enforced in a guardianship of the person and estate. The requirements in a guardianship of the person are modified to the extent that notice to creditors is not required, reports will be made only as often as the court requires, and the guardianship may be closed without the need for any accounting unless otherwise determined by the court. Any assets that are received shall be reported immediately and at that point the guardianship shall be deemed to be a guardianship of the person and estate and all requirements for guardianship of the person and estate shall be followed.

       It shall be the duty of the guardian of wards as defined by Section 1-3-58, Mississippi Code of 1972, to improve the estate committed to his charge, and to apply so much of the income, profit or body thereof as may be necessary for the comfortable maintenance and support of the ward and of his family, if he have any, after obtaining an order of the court fixing the amount. And such guardian may be authorized by the court or chancellor to purchase on behalf of and in the name of the ward with any funds of such ward’s estate sufficient and appropriate property for a home for such ward or his family on five (5) days’ notice to a member of said family, or the necessary funds may be borrowed and the property purchased given as security. The guardian is empowered to collect and sue for and recover all debts due his said ward, and shall make payment of his debts out of the personal estate as executors and administrators discharge debts out of the estate of decedents, but the exempt property of the ward shall not be liable for debts, and no debts against such estate shall be payable by such guardian unless first probated and registered, as required of claims against the estate of decedent.

The court may authorize the guardian to make gifts of the ward’s personal property or real estate, outright or in trust, on behalf of the ward, to or for the benefit of (i) organizations to which charitable contributions may be made under the Internal Revenue Code and in which it is shown the ward would reasonably have an interest, (ii) the ward’s heirs at law who are identifiable at the time of the order, (iii) devisees under the ward’s last validly executed will, if there be such a will, and (iv) a person serving as guardian of the ward provided he is eligible under either category (ii) or (iii) above.

       When it would be for the interest of a ward, the guardian of said ward is hereby empowered to lease and grant oil, gas and other mineral rights, in consideration of the payment of an annual rental and/or a royalty or part or portion of the production thereof, upon such terms and for such length of time as may be for the best interests of the estate of his ward. A petition for said purpose shall be filed in the chancery court, setting forth the reasons why such lease should be made and the benefits to be derived therefrom, and a summons shall issue for the near relations of the ward as provided in Section 93-13-281. When the process has been duly served, the court in termtime or chancellor in vacation shall examine the allegations and evidence introduced by the guardian, and also the objections and evidence of those, if any, who may appear and object. If, on the hearing, the court be satisfied that the interest of the ward will be promoted by a lease as herein provided, it may authorize the guardian to enter into such lease on behalf of the ward and prescribe the terms and conditions thereof and may require the guardian to give an additional bond, if necessary, faithfully to account for the proceeds of said lease. The notice to the near relations herein provided for shall be not less than ten (10) days before the hearing by the chancellor of the petition. In the event the near relations of the ward shall join in the petition in compliance with Section 93-13-281, the notice and summons herein provided shall not be required and said matter shall be proceeded with ex parte.

       When a ward, who has no guardian of his estate duly appointed and qualified pursuant to the laws of Mississippi, owns a mineral interest in real estate situated in the state, and an offer is made to lease the mineral interest on terms of an original consideration or bonus of not more than Two Thousand Dollars ($2,000.00), a primary term of not more than five (5) years, a royalty provision of not less than the one-eighth (1/8) of the oil which may be produced from the mineral interest, and reasonable royalty provisions as to all other minerals, a petition may be filed in the chancery court of the residence of the ward or in the chancery court wherein the mineral interest is located requesting approval and authority to execute the lease. The petition shall be brought by the ward by his next friend, and it shall join as defendants the parties provided in Section 93-13-281, or the parties designated by Section 93-13-281 may join and unite with the ward in the petition.
       <p>
        The court shall carefully consider the allegations of the petition and, if the court is satisfied from the evidence presented or otherwise that the proposed terms of the lease are adequate and reasonable and that it would be to the best interest of the ward that the lease be executed according to its terms, then the court may enter an order approving the proposed lease. The court or chancellor may direct the clerk to execute the lease to the lessee on the payment of the original bonus or consideration fixed and may direct the clerk to pay over the proceeds as provided in Section 93-13-211, provided that no part of the cost of said proceedings shall be taxed against said ward or his interests.
       </p>
       <p>
        Any royalty payments which may accrue under the lease shall be paid according to the provisions of Section 93-13-215 and any delay rentals which may be paid shall be paid according to the provisions of Section 93-13-213, but if the amounts to be paid are in excess of the sums set forth in those sections, a guardian must then be appointed to receive the same.

       When it would be for the interest of a ward, the guardian of said ward is hereby empowered to lease and grant oil, gas and other mineral rights, in consideration of the payment of an annual rental and/or a royalty or part or portion of the production thereof, upon such terms and for such length of time as may be for the best interests of the estate of his ward. A petition for said purpose shall be filed in the chancery court, setting forth the reasons why such lease should be made and the benefits to be derived therefrom, and a summons shall issue for the near relations of the ward as provided in Section 93-13-281. When the process has been duly served, the court in termtime or chancellor in vacation shall examine the allegations and evidence introduced by the guardian, and also the objections and evidence of those, if any, who may appear and object. If, on the hearing, the court be satisfied that the interest of the ward will be promoted by a lease as herein provided, it may authorize the guardian to enter into such lease on behalf of the ward and prescribe the terms and conditions thereof and may require the guardian to give an additional bond, if necessary, faithfully to account for the proceeds of said lease. The notice to the near relations herein provided for shall be not less than ten (10) days before the hearing by the chancellor of the petition. In the event the near relations of the ward shall join in the petition in compliance with Section 93-13-281, the notice and summons herein provided shall not be required and said matter shall be proceeded with ex parte.

       When a ward, who has no guardian of his estate duly appointed and qualified pursuant to the laws of Mississippi, owns a mineral interest in real estate situated in the state, and an offer is made to lease the mineral interest on terms of an original consideration or bonus of not more than Two Thousand Dollars ($2,000.00), a primary term of not more than five (5) years, a royalty provision of not less than the one-eighth (1/8) of the oil which may be produced from the mineral interest, and reasonable royalty provisions as to all other minerals, a petition may be filed in the chancery court of the residence of the ward or in the chancery court wherein the mineral interest is located requesting approval and authority to execute the lease. The petition shall be brought by the ward by his next friend, and it shall join as defendants the parties provided in Section 93-13-281, or the parties designated by Section 93-13-281 may join and unite with the ward in the petition.
       <p>
        The court shall carefully consider the allegations of the petition and, if the court is satisfied from the evidence presented or otherwise that the proposed terms of the lease are adequate and reasonable and that it would be to the best interest of the ward that the lease be executed according to its terms, then the court may enter an order approving the proposed lease. The court or chancellor may direct the clerk to execute the lease to the lessee on the payment of the original bonus or consideration fixed and may direct the clerk to pay over the proceeds as provided in Section 93-13-211, provided that no part of the cost of said proceedings shall be taxed against said ward or his interests.
       </p>
       <p>
        Any royalty payments which may accrue under the lease shall be paid according to the provisions of Section 93-13-215 and any delay rentals which may be paid shall be paid according to the provisions of Section 93-13-213, but if the amounts to be paid are in excess of the sums set forth in those sections, a guardian must then be appointed to receive the same.

    Purchase of land [Effective until January 1, 2020].
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The court may, on the application of a guardian, authorize him to purchase real estate for his ward with any surplus funds belonging to the ward, if the court be of opinion that it will promote the interest of the ward. The guardian shall be required to take sufficient title in the name of the ward, to be approved of by the court, and the deed shall be recorded in the proper county. A guardian may be authorized in like manner to complete payment for any land contracted for by the deceased ancestor of the ward in his lifetime; and if the payment cannot be completed without the sale of personal property or other real estate, the court may authorize a sale to be made, and direct the application of the proceeds to the payment of the purchase-money for the land; or, if the court should deem it more advisable, a sale of the ward’s interest in the land which remains unpaid for may be decreed.

       Statements made to chancellor by solicitor of guardian on his personal knowledge regarding value of property which guardian desired to purchase for ward, held to authorize order authorizing purchase, notwithstanding statements were not made under oath.

       Evidence held to sustain finding that property purchased by guardian for ward was worth purchase price and that sale was made in good faith; hence guardian was not liable to his successor for amount so expended. Henry v. Baker, 174 Miss. 676, 165 So. 444, 1936 Miss. LEXIS 211 (Miss. 1936).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a guardian has bought land in his own name, partly with his own money and partly with the money of his ward, the ward, on coming of age, may elect either to take ratable interest in the land or to charge upon it the amount of his money so used and interest. Fant v. Dunbar, 71 Miss. 576, 15 So. 30, 1893 Miss. LEXIS 112 (Miss. 1893).

       When it would be for the personal best interest of the ward or advantageous to his estate to sell a part or the whole of his real estate, including timber or wood, the guardian may present a petition to the court for that purpose, setting forth the reasons why the proposed sale would be beneficial to the ward, and a summons shall issue as provided in Section 93-13-281. If the process be served, or if the petition be joined in by that person or those persons prescribed by Section 93-13-281, or if the guardian ad litem appointed by the court answer within the time fixed, the court shall examine the allegations of and evidence introduced by the guardian, and also the objections and evidence of those, if any, who may appear and object. If on the hearing, the court be satisfied that the interest of the ward will be promoted by the proposed sale, it may decree a sale, and prescribe the terms and conditions thereof, and the notice which shall be requisite, and may require the guardian of said ward or the clerk or commissioner of said court to execute the deed of conveyance to the purchaser of the land, timber or wood sold and require the guardian, clerk or commissioner to give an additional bond, if necessary, faithfully to account for the proceeds.
       <p>

      Whenever the guardian has money of his ward not needed for current expenditures, or directed to be invested for the ward, he shall apply to the court, or chancellor in vacation, for direction as to the disposition he shall make of it. The court or chancellor shall determine whether he shall lend it at interest, and upon what security, or how he shall dispose of it.

The court or chancellor in its or his discretion may direct an investment in the bonds of the state or of any county, or municipality thereof, or of a levee board, or of the United States, or in shares of a building and loan association or a savings and loan association or in collateral trust notes registered and authenticated by trust departments of any approved state or national bank or in a common trust established by a bank or trust company, pursuant to the Uniform Common Trust Fund Law of Mississippi. Any guardian who fails to report to the court the fact that he has money of his ward not needed or allowed to be used for current expenditures, and to ask the order of the court as to the disposition of such money, may be chargeable with interest on the same at the rate of eight percent (8%) per annum during the time of failure.

       A chancellor did not abuse his discretion in removing a conservator where inventories were not timely filed and no reason was given therefor, the conservator failed to seek court approval prior to making expenditures, and he purchased certificates of deposit, invested in stock and sold stock without prior approval. Mathews v. Williams (In re Mathews), 633 So. 2d 1038, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 123 (Miss. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       This statute does not authorize the investment of guardianship money in a partnership, and an order of chancery court so authorizing is void. Shemper v. Hancock Bank, 206 Miss. 775, 40 So. 2d 742, 1949 Miss. LEXIS 299 (Miss. 1949).
      </p>
      <p>
       The provision of the statute requiring a guardian to apply to the chancery court or the chancellor for authority so to do before investing the funds of his ward is mandatory. Brewer v. Herron, 171 Miss. 435, 157 So. 522, 1934 Miss. LEXIS 242 (Miss. 1934).
      </p>
      <p>
       Purpose of statutory requirement that guardian receive authority from chancery court or chancellor before investing wards’ funds was to make it precedent duty of chancellor to supervise investment of wards’ funds as security to be taken, and not to leave it to his subsequent discretion as to best way to protect wards’ interests after loan had been made and funds expended. Brewer v. Herron, 171 Miss. 435, 157 So. 522, 1934 Miss. LEXIS 242 (Miss. 1934).

       A minor is not bound by her guardian’s purchase of bank stock, even if such purchase should be sanctioned by the chancery court, because of the liability of stockholders which is imposed by law. Dorsey v. Murphy, 188 Miss. 291, 194 So. 603, 1940 Miss. LEXIS 29 (Miss. 1940).
      </p>
      <p>
       Guardian held liable to ward for premiums paid on ward’s life policy, notwithstanding chancellor had authorized procurement of policy and expenditures thereunder, since investments in life policies are not specified in statute authorizing investments by guardian, but whatever value policy had, inured to benefit of guardian. In re Guardianship of Horne, 178 Miss. 714, 173 So. 660, 1937 Miss. LEXIS 234 (Miss. 1937).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence held to justify decree holding sureties on bond of incompetent’s guardian liable for guardian’s conversion of incompetent’s funds, notwithstanding court’s orders allowing guardian to borrow incompetent’s funds, on ground that guardian appropriated funds to his own personal use as fast as he received money for incompetent, and hence orders were void for fraud in procuring them because of failure to disclose previous conversion of funds. Reily v. Crymes, 176 Miss. 133, 168 So. 267, 1936 Miss. LEXIS 121 (Miss. 1936).
      </p>
      <p>
       Sureties held not relieved from liability on bond of incompetent’s guardian for guardian’s conversion of incompetent’s funds prior to time when court issued orders allowing guardian to borrow such funds on ground that court without sureties’ knowledge or consent made improvident orders releasing security given by guardian until security became inadequate to cover amount converted. Reily v. Crymes, 176 Miss. 133, 168 So. 267, 1936 Miss. LEXIS 121 (Miss. 1936).
      </p>
      <p>
       Statutory requirement that guardian apply to chancery court, or chancellor, for authority before investing ward’s funds being mandatory, guardian is liable for any loss resulting from inadequacy of security where loan is made without an antecedent order, notwithstanding subsequent order approving annual or final account. Brewer v. Herron, 171 Miss. 435, 157 So. 522, 1934 Miss. LEXIS 242 (Miss. 1934).
      </p>
      <p>
       No stockholder’s liability rested on guardian or ward where orders relating to investment of ward’s funds in bank stock were invalid and ward, aged 20, repudiated investment. Carlisle v. Love, 170 Miss. 621, 155 So. 197, 1934 Miss. LEXIS 153 (Miss. 1934).
      </p>

       Court’s orders, allowing insane person’s guardian to borrow ward’s funds, held not void on their face. Pan-American Life Ins. Co. v. Crymes, 169 Miss. 701, 153 So. 803, 1934 Miss. LEXIS 76 (Miss. 1934).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where guardian applied to chancellor with reasonable promptness for order authorizing time deposit of ward’s money in state bank, deposit of money in bank in meantime was authorized, particularly where deposit was then protected by state bank depositors’ guaranty fund. In re Adams' Guardianship, 169 Miss. 20, 152 So. 836, 1934 Miss. LEXIS 30 (Miss. 1934).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancellor’s order authorizing guardian to deposit ward’s money in state bank on time deposit protected guardian thereafter so long as reputation of bank remained good and deposit was secured by bank depositors’ guaranty fund. In re Adams' Guardianship, 169 Miss. 20, 152 So. 836, 1934 Miss. LEXIS 30 (Miss. 1934).

       Compound interest ordinarily is chargeable in cases of fraud, gross negligence, or abuse of trust on the part of the guardian, but only simple interest will be charged in cases of simple neglect of duty without fraud or intentional misconduct. Jones v. Parker, 216 Miss. 64, 61 So. 2d 681, 1952 Miss. LEXIS 615 (Miss. 1952).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where funds of mentally incompetent ward were commingled with those of guardian without any arrangement for borrowing such funds, estate of deceased guardian was chargeable with interest of six per cent per annum on amounts received by guardian from time to time less expenditures made for maintenance of ward and in absence of fraud or intentional misconduct, the interest allowed should not be compounded. Jones v. Parker, 216 Miss. 64, 61 So. 2d 681, 1952 Miss. LEXIS 615 (Miss. 1952).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where guardian of a minor ward deposited ward’s estate in bank on time deposit at 4 per cent interest per annum, and thereafter withdrew such deposit without authority of the chancery court, and such guardian failed to file annual account or have expenditures for ward’s maintenance, support and education approved by the court, guardian is liable for the amount so deposited with interest at 4 per cent from the time it was deposited in the bank until withdrawn therefrom, and thereafter he is liable for 8 per cent interest per annum. Welch v. Childers, 195 Miss. 415, 15 So. 2d 690, 1943 Miss. LEXIS 167 (Miss. 1943).
      </p>
      <p>
       A guardian’s purchase of bank stock with funds of his ward, without the consent of the chancery court, was void, and the guardian and bank were liable under this section [Code 1942, § 421], with interest at the rate of 8 per cent per annum from the date of the sale of the stock. Dorsey v. Murphy, 188 Miss. 291, 194 So. 603, 1940 Miss. LEXIS 29 (Miss. 1940).
      </p>
      <p>
       The liability of a guardian for the interest, under the statute, does not cease on the termination of the guardianship by the expiration or removal of the ward’s disability, but continues until the debt be paid. Boyd v. Hawkins, 60 Miss. 277, 1882 Miss. LEXIS 50 (Miss. 1882).

      <p>
       A prudent guardian acting with average business judgment, under the sanction of the chancery court as directed by this section [Code 1942, § 421], would be acquitted of responsibility for such losses as are necessarily incurred in the reorganization of a bank in which funds of a ward have been deposited. Dorsey v. Murphy, 188 Miss. 291, 194 So. 603, 1940 Miss. LEXIS 29 (Miss. 1940).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the guardian was not authorized by the chancery court to deposit, on time certificates, the first instalment payment of 20 per cent under a freezing agreement plan, the guardian and the bank were liable for that sum of money so redeposited with interest at 8 per cent. Dorsey v. Murphy, 188 Miss. 291, 194 So. 603, 1940 Miss. LEXIS 29 (Miss. 1940).
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that the disability of a minor ward was removed by the chancery court, together with the fact that she signed and approved the final account of her guardian, did not bind her as to the use of her funds for the improper purchase of bank stock by her guardian and the improper deposit of her funds under a freezing agreement, where the guardian did not make full disclosure to the ward of the exact status of his account so approved and she was not advised of the value of the securities. Dorsey v. Murphy, 188 Miss. 291, 194 So. 603, 1940 Miss. LEXIS 29 (Miss. 1940).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where guardian was warned that state bank was in failing condition at least three weeks before it closed, and time deposit was not protected by bank depositors’ guaranty fund, her failure to act promptly in accordance with changed condition made her liable for resulting loss, plus six per cent interest, less any legal expenditures for ward. In re Adams' Guardianship, 169 Miss. 20, 152 So. 836, 1934 Miss. LEXIS 30 (Miss. 1934).
      </p>
      <p>
       Guardian, on being warned that state bank in which ward’s money was on time deposit was in failing condition, should have taken note of fact that theretofore bank depositors’ guaranty law had been suspended. In re Adams' Guardianship, 169 Miss. 20, 152 So. 836, 1934 Miss. LEXIS 30 (Miss. 1934).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where guardian deposited money in C Bank under order of chancellor permitting such deposit and providing “the court does not relieve” the guardian of his bondsmen, sureties were not liable for loss due to failure of C Bank as the court could not add to their liability without their consent. Cohn v. Winslow, 115 Miss. 275, 76 So. 264, 1917 Miss. LEXIS 208 (Miss. 1917).
      </p>
      <p>
       Mere failure of bank depository of ward’s funds, did not operate ipso facto as breach of guardian’s bond. United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co. v. Jackson, 111 Miss. 752, 72 So. 150, 1916 Miss. LEXIS 384 (Miss. 1916).

      <p>
       When guardian converts ward’s money to his personal use without previously having arranged by proper proceeding to borrow funds on security approved by court, guardian is guilty of breach of his bond, and guardian and his bondsmen are liable as in debt for money converted and such debt cannot be released except on payment thereof in money. Reily v. Crymes, 176 Miss. 133, 168 So. 267, 1936 Miss. LEXIS 121 (Miss. 1936).
      </p>
      <p>
       Except as authorized by statute, guardian has no right to convert money of his ward to his own use and to spend it for his own personal purposes, and when he does so, it is as much an “embezzlement” as when treasurer of corporation or other fiduciary of funds does the like. Reily v. Crymes, 176 Miss. 133, 168 So. 267, 1936 Miss. LEXIS 121 (Miss. 1936).
      </p>
      <p>
       Court may aid bondsmen of guardian who has converted ward’s money without authority by accepting security for accrued debt from guardian, and enforcing it in behalf of bondsmen, but court has no power to release obligation of bondsmen on such security however ample, and liability continued until satisfied by payment and security of payment by mortgage or deed of trust on property, however adequate at time, is not such “payment.” Reily v. Crymes, 176 Miss. 133, 168 So. 267, 1936 Miss. LEXIS 121 (Miss. 1936).

       Bill for loss from unauthorized loan made by former guardian out of guardianship funds was not prematurely brought where exact amount of loss could be determined in pending suit by staying proceedings against former guardian until foreclosure of deed of trust securing loan could be made, or bill amended so as to authorize sale of security or foreclosure of deed of trust by court for credit of proceeds of sale on note for which loan was given.

Any guardian who fails to report to the court the fact that he has money of his ward not needed or allowed to be used for current expenditures, and to ask the order of the court as to the disposition of such money, may be chargeable with interest on the same at the rate of eight percent (8%) per annum during the time of failure.

       Chancery court properly awarded an insured attorney’s fees because it did not abuse its discretion in determining that an insured’s removal to federal court was unsubstantiated and contrary to well-established precedent; there was clearly established precedent that the Employment Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 did not preempt a chancery court’s power to settle the claims of minors.

       Chancery court did not abuse its discretion in awarding an insured attorney’s fees on the ground that an insurer’s removal of the case to federal court was frivolous because the award was inextricably intertwined with its determination that it was clearly established that the chancery court’s statutory duty to approve the settlement of the insured’s liability insurance claims was not preempted by the Employment Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.

    Removal of ward and property to another county [Effective until January 1, 2020].
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      If a guardian desire to remove the person and/or personal property of his ward to any county other than that in which he was appointed guardian, he may, on petition, be allowed to do so, if the court deem it proper, and it may make an order to that effect, on condition that the guardian will qualify in the county to which he removes, or it may allow the removal and retain jurisdiction over the guardianship. The court of the county to which he removes, on production of the order authorizing the removal, may appoint him guardian. And when he shall produce to the court which originally appointed him the letters of guardianship from the court of the county to which he has removed, and make a settlement of his guardianship accounts, he may be discharged from his original bond; and thereafter he shall present his inventories and accounts to and be under the control of the court of the county to which he has removed. And the clerk of the court in which the settlement was made shall transmit a certified copy of the settlement, at the cost of the guardian, to the clerk of the court in which he was last appointed.

       Except as herein provided, and as provided in Section 93-13-7, or 93-13-37 and 93-13-38, every guardian shall, at least once in each year, and oftener if required, exhibit his account, showing the receipts of money on account of his ward, and showing the annual product of the estate under his management, and the sale or other disposition thereof, and showing also each item of his expenditure in the maintenance and education of his ward and in the preservation and management of his estate, supported by legal vouchers. In the event that the account shall be presented by a bank or trust company which is subject to the supervision of the Mississippi Department of Banking and Consumer Finance of the State of Mississippi or of the comptroller of the currency of the United States and such account, or the petition for the approval of same, shall contain a statement under oath by an officer of said bank or trust company showing that the vouchers covering the disbursements in the account presented are on file with the bank or trust company, the bank or trust company shall not be required to file vouchers. The bank or trust company shall produce the vouchers for inspection of any interested party or his or her attorney at any time during legal banking hours at the office of the bank or trust company; the court on its own motion or on the motion of any interested party may require that the vouchers be produced and inspected at any hearing of any objections to the annual account. The accounts shall be examined, approved, and allowed by the court in the same way that the accounts of executors and administrators are examined, approved, and allowed. Compliance with the duties required, in this section, of guardian shall be enforced by the same means and in the same manner as is provided in respect to the accounts of executors and administrators.

         However, when the funds and personal property of the ward do not exceed the sum or value of Three Thousand Dollars ($3,000.00) and there is no prospect of further receipt to come into the hands of the guardian other than interest thereon, or in guardianships in which the only funds on hand or to be received by the guardian are funds paid or to be paid by the Department of Human Services for the benefit of the ward, the chancery court or chancellor in vacation, may, for good cause shown, in his discretion and upon being satisfied it is to the best interest and welfare of the ward, authorize the guardian to dispense with further such annual accounts, except such as may be a final account.Furthermore, the chancery court or chancellor in vacation may dispense with annual accounts if the ward’s assets consist solely of funds on deposit at any banking corporation, building and loan association or savings and loan association in this state; have been so deposited under order of the court to remain until otherwise ordered; are fully insured; and a certified copy of the order to deposit, properly receipted, furnished the depository. If the court, or chancellor in vacation, authorizes the discontinuance of annual accounts, the guardian may, without further order of the court, from time to time pay the court costs and bond premiums owing by the estate or him as guardian, and, as well, he may likewise pay emergency obligations as he may have been empowered and allowed to do by necessity except for this section; but, he shall not pay from guardianship funds any other sums without further order of such court or chancellor without having first obtained order of the court or chancellor to do so. If emergency expenditure is needed for the immediate and necessary welfare of the ward, it shall at once be reported to the court, or chancellor in vacation, for approval. Furthermore, the court on its own motion or on the motion of any interested party may require the resumption and continuance of annual accounts.

       Chancery court erred by not requiring the disabled son’s mother to deposit all support paid by the father for the benefit of the son to a conservatorship account and in not requiring the mother to file an inventory and accounting of all support funds and to post a bond because the son may receive funds in the future that would constitute a separate financial estate and therefore the mother should have been required to comply with the statutory safeguards. Ravenstein v. Hawkins, 167 So.3d 210, 2014 Miss. LEXIS 326 (Miss. 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Approval of the chancery court of the settlement had to be reversed and the monies awarded to the mother and her children had to be removed from their possession and added to the child’s estate; a neutral conservator had to be appointed to replace the mother as conservator, and the conservator was required to make a quarterly accounting for the sake of protection of the estate and the child’s interests pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c13s93-13-67" target="_self">93-13-67</a></cite>. In re Brantley v. Brantley, 865 So. 2d 1126, 2004 Miss. LEXIS 184 (Miss. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       A chancellor did not abuse his discretion in removing a conservator where inventories were not timely filed and no reason was given therefor, the conservator failed to seek court approval prior to making expenditures, and he purchased certificates of deposit, invested in stock and sold stock without prior approval. Mathews v. Williams (In re Mathews), 633 So. 2d 1038, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 123 (Miss. 1994).

       A minor under guardianship is a ward of the chancery court, and all receipts and disbursements of his estate are required to be under the authority and direction of the chancery court or the chancellor in vacation. Welch v. Childers, 195 Miss. 415, 15 So. 2d 690, 1943 Miss. LEXIS 167 (Miss. 1943).
      </p>
      <p>
       The expenses for the maintenance and support of the ward cannot be proved in any other way than that provided by statute. Welch v. Childers, 195 Miss. 415, 15 So. 2d 690, 1943 Miss. LEXIS 167 (Miss. 1943).
      </p>
      <p>
       The amount of the expenditures by a guardian for the maintenance, support and education of his ward must be fixed by the court, there being no discretion in the guardian. Welch v. Childers, 195 Miss. 415, 15 So. 2d 690, 1943 Miss. LEXIS 167 (Miss. 1943).
      </p>
      <p>
       The guardian of a minor will not be permitted to file and have allowed the final account of his guardianship where he has failed to make annual accounts, as required by statute, and the expenditures shown by such final accounts were not authorized by previous orders of the chancery court, and are unsupported by any voucher. Welch v. Childers, 195 Miss. 415, 15 So. 2d 690, 1943 Miss. LEXIS 167 (Miss. 1943).

   Chancellor did not err in approving the final accounting and discharging the conservator because under Miss. R. Civ. P. 19 joinder was not feasible because no person had been appointed to represent the estate, the estate suffered no prejudice, and neither Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c13s93-13-67" target="_self">93-13-67</a></cite> nor case law indicated that the failure of the conservator to file accountings was fatal to the approval of a final accounting. Vinson v. Benson, 972 So. 2d 694, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 349 (Miss. Ct. App. 2007), cert. denied, 973 So. 2d 244, 2008 Miss. LEXIS 8 (Miss. 2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       The guardian has no power to bind the estate of his ward without the sanction of the chancery court or the chancellor, and if the guardian contracts for the maintenance, support and education of his ward without the sanction of the court or chancellor, the liability therefor is personal to him, and he cannot be allowed for it in his accounts for the ward. Welch v. Childers, 195 Miss. 415, 15 So. 2d 690, 1943 Miss. LEXIS 167 (Miss. 1943).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where guardian of a minor ward deposited ward’s estate in bank on time deposit with 4 per cent interest per annum, and thereafter withdrew such deposit without authority of the chancery court, and such guardian failed to file annual account or have expenditures for ward’s maintenance, support and education approved by the court, guardian is liable for the amount so deposited with interest at 4 per cent from the time it was deposited in the bank until withdrawn therefrom, and thereafter he is liable for 8 per cent interest per annum. Welch v. Childers, 195 Miss. 415, 15 So. 2d 690, 1943 Miss. LEXIS 167 (Miss. 1943).

       Guardian held not chargeable with stock which was at one time held by guardian of ward’s father, which stock never came to guardian’s possession, and existence of which was not proven. In re Guardianship of Horne, 178 Miss. 714, 173 So. 660, 1937 Miss. LEXIS 234 (Miss. 1937).
      </p>
      <p>
       Guardian, who had obtained authorization from chancellor to invest ward’s funds in savings banks, and in loans, withdrew savings accounts because of apprehension as to soundness of banks, and whose annual accounts were not accompanied with detailed reports as to loans held not chargeable with interest because his accounts designated as cash assets represented by loans, where evidence showed that guardian accounted for interest which he collected, and that he did not use idle money for his own benefit. In re Guardianship of Horne, 178 Miss. 714, 173 So. 660, 1937 Miss. LEXIS 234 (Miss. 1937).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence disclosing that ward’s stock never paid a dividend after coming into hands of guardian, that only offer guardian ever had for stock was a nominal sum, and that guardian was not successful in realizing anything in bankruptcy proceedings of corporation which issued stock, held to transfer burden of proof to exceptor to show that at some time something could have been obtained out of such stock. In re Guardianship of Horne, 178 Miss. 714, 173 So. 660, 1937 Miss. LEXIS 234 (Miss. 1937).

       Except as herein provided, and as provided in Section 93-13-7, or 93-13-37 and 93-13-38, every guardian shall, at least once in each year, and oftener if required, exhibit his account, showing the receipts of money on account of his ward, and showing the annual product of the estate under his management, and the sale or other disposition thereof, and showing also each item of his expenditure in the maintenance and education of his ward and in the preservation and management of his estate, supported by legal vouchers. In the event that the account shall be presented by a bank or trust company which is subject to the supervision of the Mississippi Department of Banking and Consumer Finance of the State of Mississippi or of the comptroller of the currency of the United States and such account, or the petition for the approval of same, shall contain a statement under oath by an officer of said bank or trust company showing that the vouchers covering the disbursements in the account presented are on file with the bank or trust company, the bank or trust company shall not be required to file vouchers. The bank or trust company shall produce the vouchers for inspection of any interested party or his or her attorney at any time during legal banking hours at the office of the bank or trust company; the court on its own motion or on the motion of any interested party may require that the vouchers be produced and inspected at any hearing of any objections to the annual account. The accounts shall be examined, approved, and allowed by the court in the same way that the accounts of executors and administrators are examined, approved, and allowed. Compliance with the duties required, in this section, of guardian shall be enforced by the same means and in the same manner as is provided in respect to the accounts of executors and administrators.
       <ol type="a">
        <li id="t93c13s93-13-67.1ol11a">
         However, when the funds and personal property of the ward do not exceed the sum or value of Three Thousand Dollars ($3,000.00) and there is no prospect of further receipt to come into the hands of the guardian other than interest thereon, or in guardianships in which the only funds on hand or to be received by the guardian are funds paid or to be paid by the Department of Human Services for the benefit of the ward, the chancery court or chancellor in vacation, may, for good cause shown, in his discretion and upon being satisfied it is to the best interest and welfare of the ward, authorize the guardian to dispense with further such annual accounts, except such as may be a final account.Furthermore, the chancery court or chancellor in vacation may dispense with annual accounts if the ward’s assets consist solely of funds on deposit at any banking corporation, building and loan association or savings and loan association in this state; have been so deposited under order of the court to remain until otherwise ordered; are fully insured; and a certified copy of the order to deposit, properly receipted, furnished the depository. If the court, or chancellor in vacation, authorizes the discontinuance of annual accounts, the guardian may, without further order of the court, from time to time pay the court costs and bond premiums owing by the estate or him as guardian, and, as well, he may likewise pay emergency obligations as he may have been empowered and allowed to do by necessity except for this section; but, he shall not pay from guardianship funds any other sums without further order of such court or chancellor without having first obtained order of the court or chancellor to do so. If emergency expenditure is needed for the immediate and necessary welfare of the ward, it shall at once be reported to the court, or chancellor in vacation, for approval. Furthermore, the court on its own motion or on the motion of any interested party may require the resumption and continuance of annual accounts.

        <li id="t93c13s93-13-67.1ol11b">
         At the time of any annual account, the court, or a judge thereof in vacation, in its discretion, may allow to the guardian a minimum commission of One Hundred Dollars ($100.00) per annum for its services, anything in the statutes of this state to the contrary notwithstanding.

       If the ward was a minor and the guardianship terminates by any means upon the ward obtaining majority, if a final accounting is not made and the ward does not petition the court to compel a final accounting on or before July 1, 2014, or the twenty-second birthday of the ward, whichever comes last, the court may close its file on the guardianship unless it appears to the court that the court should seek accounting on its own motion.

     <p>
      The powers and duties of every guardian of a minor over the person and estate of the ward shall cease and determine when the ward shall arrive at the age of twenty-one (21) years, or, in the discretion of the chancellor, may cease and determine when the ward shall arrive at the age of eighteen (18) years. And the powers and duties of every guardian of the estate of a minor, person of unsound mind, or convict of felony, may also cease and determine on the approval of the chancery court or of the chancellor in vacation, when the funds and personal property, either or both, of the ward do not exceed the sum or value of Two Thousand Dollars ($2,000.00) and there is no prospect of further receipts to come into the hands of the guardian; provided that the court or chancellor, on the approval of the final account of such guardian, shall have power to require the property of such minor or adult incompetent, to be delivered to him or to some person, or bank for him, under such conditions and restrictions as the court or chancellor may impose; and compliance by the guardian with such order shall acquit him and his sureties. Any person or bank who under such an order or decree shall receive the money or property of a person under such disability shall thereby become amenable to the court for the proper disposition of it for the use and benefit of such incompetent; but shall not be required to give security therefor unless the court or chancellor shall so order. In either event the guardian shall forthwith deliver to the ward, or to such person or bank as the court or chancellor may designate, as the case may be, all the property of every description of the ward in his hands, and on failure, shall be liable to an action on his bond.

     <p>
      The powers and duties of every guardian of a minor over the person and estate of the ward shall cease and determine when the ward shall arrive at the age of twenty-one (21) years, or, in the discretion of the chancellor, may cease and determine when the ward shall arrive at the age of eighteen (18) years. And the powers and duties of every guardian of the estate of a minor, person of unsound mind, or convict of felony, may also cease and determine on the approval of the chancery court or of the chancellor in vacation, when the funds and personal property, either or both, of the ward do not exceed the sum or value of Two Thousand Dollars ($2,000.00) and there is no prospect of further receipts to come into the hands of the guardian; provided that the court or chancellor, on the approval of the final account of such guardian, shall have power to require the property of such minor or adult incompetent, to be delivered to him or to some person, or bank for him, under such conditions and restrictions as the court or chancellor may impose; and compliance by the guardian with such order shall acquit him and his sureties. Any person or bank who under such an order or decree shall receive the money or property of a person under such disability shall thereby become amenable to the court for the proper disposition of it for the use and benefit of such incompetent; but shall not be required to give security therefor unless the court or chancellor shall so order. In either event the guardian shall forthwith deliver to the ward, or to such person or bank as the court or chancellor may designate, as the case may be, all the property of every description of the ward in his hands, and on failure, shall be liable to an action on his bond.

    Final account and settlement; closure of guardianship file without final accounting under certain circumstances [Effective until January 1, 2020].
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      When the guardianship shall cease in any manner, except as provided in Section 93-13-37 or 93-13-67, the guardian shall make a final settlement of his guardianship by making out and presenting to the court, under oath, his final account, which shall contain a distinct statement of all the balances of his annual accounts, either as debits or credits, and also all other charges, expenditures, and amounts received, and not contained in any previous annual account. The final account shall remain on file for the inspection of the ward, and summons for him shall be issued, which shall notify him to appear on a day not less than one month after service thereof or completion of its publication, and show cause why the final account of the guardian should not be allowed and approved. In the event that the account shall be presented by a bank or trust company which is subject to the supervision of the Mississippi Department of Banking and Consumer Finance or of the comptroller of the currency of the United States and the account, or the petition for the approval of the account, shall contain a statement under oath by an officer of the bank or trust company showing that the vouchers covering the disbursements in the account presented are on file with the bank or trust company, the bank or trust company shall not be required to file vouchers. The bank or trust company shall produce the vouchers for inspection of any interested party or his or her attorney at any time during legal banking hours at the office of the bank or trust company, and the court on its own motion, or on the motion of any interested party, may require that the vouchers be produced and inspected at the time of hearing of any objections that may be filed to any final account. The court shall examine the final account, and hear the evidence for and against it; and if the court is satisfied, after examination, that the account is just and true, shall make a final decree of approval, or may allow only so much of the account as is right; and in the decree it shall make an allowance to the guardian for his trouble, not exceeding ten percent (10%) on the value of the estate; and shall also decree that the property of the ward shall be delivered to him, if not already delivered, and that the guardian be discharged. In like manner, and under like restrictions, it shall be made the duty of an executor or administrator of a deceased guardian to make final settlement of their testator’s or intestate’s guardianship accounts in the chancery court in which the same may be pending; but any ward arriving at the age of twenty-one (21) years may petition the chancery court in which the guardianship is pending to waive the final settlement required by this section and discharge the guardian and his sureties, which petition shall be verified by oath, and the court shall grant the same unless there be reason to suspect that the petition was procured by the guardian through fraud or undue influence over the ward, in which case the court shall require proof of the good faith thereof.
     </p>
     <p>
      If a final accounting is not made and the ward does not petition the court to compel a final accounting on or before July 1, 2014, or the twenty-second birthday of the ward, whichever comes last, the court may close its file on the guardianship unless it appears to the court that the court should seek accounting on its own motion.

       Appellant daughter did not deny that she failed to seek reimbursement prior to the closure of the conservatorship; neither had she provided a reason why she failed to file such a claim for reimbursement. Accordingly, there was no error with the chancellor’s determination that her claims for expenses were untimely and, therefore, barred. DeMoville v. Johnson (In re DeMoville P'ship), 26 So.3d 366, 2009 Miss. App. LEXIS 286 (Miss. Ct. App. 2009), cert. denied, 24 So.3d 1038, 2010 Miss. LEXIS 37 (Miss. 2010), cert. denied, 2010 Miss.

      </p>
      <p>
       Request for compensation for services rendered had to be made at the time a final accounting was filed and compensation, if any, included in the final decree approving the closure of the conservatorship; the conservator made no claim for compensation until after the heir filed suit against her, many months after the conservatorship was closed, and thus allowed the small remainder of the decedent’s estate to be distributed to his heirs without making provision for the compensation she claimed to have earned. In re Estate of Thomas v. Thomas, 853 So. 2d 134, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 158 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 852 So. 2d 577, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 833 (Miss. Ct. App. 2003).

       A minor under guardianship is a ward of the chancery court, and all receipts and disbursements of his estate are required to be under the authority and direction of the chancery court or the chancellor in vacation. Welch v. Childers, 195 Miss. 415, 15 So. 2d 690, 1943 Miss. LEXIS 167 (Miss. 1943).
      </p>
      <p>
       The guardian of a minor will not be permitted to file and have allowed the final account of his guardianship where he has failed to make annual accounts, as required by statute, and the expenditures shown by such final accounts were not authorized by previous orders of the chancery court, and are unsupported by any voucher.

       Settlement between administrator delaying settlement of estate and distributee, just reaching majority, must be closely scrutinized, and burden of proving good faith rested upon administrator. Russell v. Russell, 164 Miss. 335, 144 So. 542, 1932 Miss. LEXIS 248 (Miss. 1932).

       When an order accepting a guardian’s resignation provides that he and his sureties be discharged upon payment and delivery to his successor, when appointed, of all money and effects of his ward in his hands, the guardian, until such payment and delivery, may reduce to judgment the promissory notes belonging to the ward and have execution thereon.

       Where a guardian makes final settlement with a ward who has become adult, and the ward appears and files an answer and admits the correctness of the account, and afterwards files a bill denying the payment and seeking to surcharge the account, a decree dismissing the bill and refusing to open the account is correct, if the evidence establishes the truth of the answer.

       The expenses for the maintenance and support of the ward cannot be proved in any other way than that provided by statute. Welch v. Childers, 195 Miss. 415, 15 So. 2d 690, 1943 Miss. LEXIS 167 (Miss. 1943).
      </p>
      <p>
       The guardian has no power to bind the estate of his ward without the sanction of the chancery court or the chancellor, and if the guardian contracts for the maintenance, support and education of his ward without the sanction of the court or chancellor, the liability therefor is personal to him, and he cannot be allowed for it in his accounts for the ward. Welch v. Childers, 195 Miss. 415, 15 So. 2d 690, 1943 Miss. LEXIS 167 (Miss. 1943).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where guardian of a minor ward deposited ward’s estate in bank on time deposit with 4 per cent interest per annum, and thereafter withdrew such deposit without authority of the chancery court, and such guardian failed to file annual account or have expenditures for ward’s maintenance, support and education approved by the court, guardian is liable for the amount so deposited with interest at 4 per cent from the time it was deposited in the bank until withdrawn therefrom, and thereafter he is liable for 8 per cent interest per annum. Welch v. Childers, 195 Miss. 415, 15 So. 2d 690, 1943 Miss. LEXIS 167 (Miss. 1943).

       The state, although nominally the obligee, is not a necessary party to a suit in chancery on the bond of the chancery clerk acting as guardian of minors to recover their estate. Only those who have some concern in the litigation, or whose presence is necessary to do justice between the parties in interest are necessary parties. Patty v. Williams, 71 Miss. 837, 15 So. 43, 1894 Miss. LEXIS 38 (Miss. 1894).

      <p>
       In a chancery suit by wards on the bond of their former guardian to recover their estate, they may join as defendants voluntary grantees of a deceased surety, in order to subject property in their hands so conveyed.

    Final account and settlement; closure of guardianship file without final accounting under certain circumstances

      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      When the guardianship shall cease in any manner, except as provided in Section 93-13-37 or 93-13-67, the guardian shall make a final settlement of his guardianship by making out and presenting to the court, under oath, his final account, which shall contain a distinct statement of all the balances of his annual accounts, either as debits or credits, and also all other charges, expenditures, and amounts received, and not contained in any previous annual account. The final account shall remain on file for the inspection of the ward, and summons for him shall be issued, which shall notify him to appear on a day not less than one month after service thereof or completion of its publication, and show cause why the final account of the guardian should not be allowed and approved. In the event that the account shall be presented by a bank or trust company which is subject to the supervision of the Mississippi Department of Banking and Consumer Finance or of the comptroller of the currency of the United States and the account, or the petition for the approval of the account, shall contain a statement under oath by an officer of the bank or trust company showing that the vouchers covering the disbursements in the account presented are on file with the bank or trust company, the bank or trust company shall not be required to file vouchers. The bank or trust company shall produce the vouchers for inspection of any interested party or his or her attorney at any time during legal banking hours at the office of the bank or trust company, and the court on its own motion, or on the motion of any interested party, may require that the vouchers be produced and inspected at the time of hearing of any objections that may be filed to any final account. The court shall examine the final account, and hear the evidence for and against it; and if the court is satisfied, after examination, that the account is just and true, shall make a final decree of approval, or may allow only so much of the account as is right; and in the decree it shall make an allowance to the guardian for his trouble, not exceeding ten percent (10%) on the value of the estate; and shall also decree that the property of the ward shall be delivered to him, if not already delivered, and that the guardian be discharged. In like manner, and under like restrictions, it shall be made the duty of an executor or administrator of a deceased guardian to make final settlement of their testator’s or intestate’s guardianship accounts in the chancery court in which the same may be pending; but any ward arriving at the age of twenty-one (21) years may petition the chancery court in which the guardianship is pending to waive the final settlement required by this section and discharge the guardian and his sureties, which petition shall be verified by oath, and the court shall grant the same unless there be reason to suspect that the petition was procured by the guardian through fraud or undue influence over the ward, in which case the court shall require proof of the good faith thereof.
     </p>
     <p>
      If a final accounting is not made and the ward does not petition the court to compel a final accounting on or before July 1, 2014, or the twenty-second birthday of the ward, whichever comes last, the court may close its file on the guardianship unless it appears to the court that the court should seek accounting on its own motion.

       Attorney’s fees in the management of statutory estates are not a charge upon the estate itself, but are personal obligations of the administrator or executor or guardian, and an allowance for attorney’s fees must be done on the request or petition of the administrator or executor or guardian and not on the direct petition of the attorney himself.

       Where the testator prescribed that his wife should be the guardian of the person and estate of his minor son until he should become twenty-one years of age and should give a bond as guardian effective during that time, and that after the minor had reached his majority the guardian should thereupon become trustee and should give bond as such trustee until the son should become thirty-one years old, at which time the balance of the estate was to be distributed, period of minority constituted a statutory guardianship and attorney’s fees for services rendered during that period could not be allowed on the direct petition of the attorney himself.

      The chancellor may appoint guardians of the person and estate, or either, of persons found to be in need of mental treatment as defined in Section 41-21-61 et seq. and incapable of taking care of his person and property, upon the motion of the chancellor or clerk of the chancery court, or upon the application of relatives or friends of such persons or upon the application of any other interested party. Such proceeding may be instituted by any relative or friend of such person or any other interested party by the filing of a sworn petition in the chancery court of the county of the residence of such person, setting forth that such person is in need of mental treatment and incapable of taking care of his person and estate, or either. Upon the filing of such petition, the chancellor of said court shall, by order, fix the day, time and place for the hearing thereof, either in termtime or in vacation, and the person who is alleged to be in need of mental treatment and incapable of taking care of his person or property shall be summoned to be and appear before said court at the time and place fixed, which said summons shall be served upon such person not less than five (5) days prior to the date fixed for such hearing. At such hearing all interested parties may appear and present evidence as to the truth and correctness of the allegations of the said petition. If the chancellor should find from the evidence that such person is in need of mental treatment and incapable of taking care of his estate and person, or either, the chancellor shall appoint a guardian of such person’s estate and person, or either, as the case may be. In such cases, the costs and expenses of the proceedings shall be paid out of the estate of such person if a guardian is appointed. If a guardian is appointed and such person has no estate, or if no guardian is appointed, then such costs and expenses shall be paid by the person instituting the proceedings.

      <p>
       The chancery court of the county in which a mental incompetent resided had jurisdiction of a proceeding by the sheriff, who had possession of incompetent’s property, for the appointment of a guardian for the incompetent’s estate and person, and since the chancellor had taken jurisdiction, the subsequent appointment by the chancery clerk of another county of another as guardian was ineffective. Swaney v. White, 230 Miss. 865, 92 So. 2d 453, 1957 Miss. LEXIS 434 (Miss. 1957).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a proceeding by an executor to revoke the letters of guardianship of the estate of the testator’s son who was alleged to be the devisee and legatee of the bulk of the estate, and who was adjudged insane, the executor’s motion to include, by amendment to his petition, the file in proceedings whereby the guardian was appointed for insane ward, was properly overruled, even though the executor was not served with process. Frierson v. Moorhead, 211 Miss. 811, 51 So. 2d 925, 1951 Miss. LEXIS 410 (Miss. 1951).
      </p>
      <p>
       The statute [Code 1942, § 430] does not require that notice of the application for the appointment of a guardian be given to a person who has been adjudicated upon inquisition to be of unsound mind, and there is no good reason why such notice should be required in cases where appointment is made immediately after the adjudication of insanity. Kimbrough v. Wright, 211 Miss. 63, 50 So. 2d 909, 1951 Miss. LEXIS 332 (Miss. 1951).
      </p>
      <p>
       Under this section [Code 1942,§ 430] no preference is given to the nearest of kin in the appointment of a guardian to an adjudged lunatic, the power of appointment being confided to the discretion of the chancery court so long as not palpably abused. Barney v. Barney, 203 Miss. 228, 33 So. 2d 823, 1948 Miss. LEXIS 253 (Miss. 1948).
      </p>
      <p>
       The refusal of the chancellor to appoint either the wife or the daughter of a lunatic as guardian was not abuse of discretion where their own testimony sufficiently showed that neither of them possessed the mental capacity which would make them competent for appointment. Barney v. Barney, 203 Miss. 228, 33 So. 2d 823, 1948 Miss. LEXIS 253 (Miss. 1948).
      </p>
      <p>
       Proceeding under this section [Code 1942, § 430] can be instituted only by person interested such as public officer or relative or friend of alleged lunatic; chancery court may appoint guardian for person adjudged insane. Baum v. Greenwald, 95 Miss. 765, 49 So. 836, 1909 Miss. LEXIS 293 (Miss. 1909).
      </p>
      <p>
       To justify the appointment of a guardian the evidence must clearly establish unsoundness of mind or inability to care for himself or property. Baum v. Greenwald, 95 Miss. 765, 49 So. 836, 1909 Miss. LEXIS 293 (Miss. 1909).
      </p>
      <p>
       The next of kin has no legal right to the guardianship of a person or estate of a lunatic, but the power of appointment is confided to the discretion of the chancery court. Muse v. Muse, 76 Miss. 372, 24 So. 168, 1898 Miss. LEXIS 71 (Miss. 1898).

       This proceeding may be instituted before chancery court or the clerk; when instituted before clerk jury must report to clerk who must enter their finding on his minutes and report same at next sitting of chancery court for approval or rejection; clerk cannot set aside verdict or enter decree other than in accordance with it. Baum v. Greenwald, 95 Miss. 765, 49 So. 836, 1909 Miss. LEXIS 293 (Miss. 1909).
      </p>
      <p>
       In proceeding before clerk not necessary to reduce testimony to writing, but where done is part of record and may be considered by chancellor on motion for approval. Baum v. Greenwald, 95 Miss. 765, 49 So. 836, 1909 Miss. LEXIS 293 (Miss. 1909).

       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       While a chancellor might take notice of a petition filed by a person who does not have some legitimate present or prospective interest in a lunatic’s estate, or who does not have some personal responsibility to the estate, care or welfare of the lunatic, for the removal of a guardian, such stranger would have no privilege to appeal should the chancellor refuse to do so. Barney v. Barney, 203 Miss. 228, 33 So. 2d 823, 1948 Miss. LEXIS 253 (Miss. 1948).
      </p>
      <p>
       Any appeal by the guardian or next friend of a person of an unsound mind is within the saving of the statute of limitations. Such appeal is of the non compos mentis, though taken by his representative. Finney v. Speed, 71 Miss. 32, 14 So. 465, 1893 Miss. LEXIS 188 (Miss. 1893).

       Individual bringing proceeding must be taxed with costs where evidence does not establish incompetency of alleged insane person. Baum v. Greenwald, 95 Miss. 765, 49 So. 836, 1909 Miss. LEXIS 293 (Miss. 1909).

      </h4>
      <p>
       The person who in his own name would petition to have a guardian of an estate removed must be a person who has some legitimate interest present or prospective in that estate, or who has some personal responsibility as regards the estate or the care or welfare of the lunatic. Barney v. Barney, 203 Miss. 228, 33 So. 2d 823, 1948 Miss. LEXIS 253 (Miss. 1948).

     <p>
      In any case where a guardian has been appointed for an adult person by a court of competent jurisdiction of any state, and the adult thereafter, at the time of filing the petition provided for in this section, is a resident of this state and is incompetent to manage his or her estate, the chancery court of the county of the domicile of the adult shall have jurisdiction and authority to appoint a guardian for the incompetent adult upon the conditions specified in this section; however, infirmities of old age shall not be considered elements of infirmities.
     </p>
     <p>
      The petition for the appointment of a guardian under the provisions of this section shall be filed by the incompetent person or his guardian in the office of the clerk of the chancery court in the county of the residence of the incompetent person and process shall be served as provided in Section 93-13-281, unless joined in by that person or those persons prescribed in that section.
     </p>
     <p>
      Upon the return day of the process, the chancellor, if in vacation, or the court, if in termtime, shall cause the applicant to appear in person and then and there examine the applicant and all interested parties, and if, after the examination, the chancellor in vacation or the court in termtime is of the opinion that the applicant is incompetent to manage his or her estate, then it shall be the duty of the court to appoint a guardian of the estate of the applicant; however, in no instance shall the court have authority to appoint a guardian under the provisions of this section unless it examines the applicant in person and finds after the examination that the applicant is incompetent to manage his or her estate.
     </p>
     <p>
      A guardian appointed under the provisions of this section shall be required to make and file annual accounts of his acts and doings as in case of guardians for persons with mental illness.

     </h3>
     <p>
      In any case where a guardian has been appointed for an adult person by a court of competent jurisdiction of any state, and the adult thereafter, at the time of filing the petition provided for in this section, is a resident of this state and is incompetent to manage his or her estate, the chancery court of the county of the domicile of the adult shall have jurisdiction and authority to appoint a guardian for the incompetent adult upon the conditions specified in this section; however, infirmities of old age shall not be considered elements of infirmities.
     </p>
     <p>
      The petition for the appointment of a guardian under the provisions of this section shall be filed by the incompetent person or his guardian in the office of the clerk of the chancery court in the county of the residence of the incompetent person and process shall be served as provided in Section 93-13-281, unless joined in by that person or those persons prescribed in that section.
     </p>
     <p>
      Upon the return day of the process, the chancellor, if in vacation, or the court, if in termtime, shall cause the applicant to appear in person and then and there examine the applicant and all interested parties, and if, after the examination, the chancellor in vacation or the court in termtime is of the opinion that the applicant is incompetent to manage his or her estate, then it shall be the duty of the court to appoint a guardian of the estate of the applicant; however, in no instance shall the court have authority to appoint a guardian under the provisions of this section unless it examines the applicant in person and finds after the examination that the applicant is incompetent to manage his or her estate.
     </p>
     <p>
      A guardian appointed under the provisions of this section shall be required to make and file annual accounts of his acts and doings as in case of guardians for persons with mental illness.

       When a ward is entitled under a judgment, order or decree of any court, or from any other source, to a sum of money not greater than Twenty-five Thousand Dollars ($25,000.00), or to personal property not exceeding in value that sum, the chancery court of the county of the residence of the ward or the chancery court of the county wherein the person is entitled to the money or property, may order the money or property to be delivered to the ward or to some other person for him if he has no guardian, and compliance with the order shall acquit and release the person so delivering the same.

       However, if the sum of money or personal property is not due the ward under a judgment, order or decree of a court, the chancery court before ordering the money or personal property paid over or delivered as provided in this section shall fully investigate the matter and shall satisfy itself by evidence, or otherwise, that the proposed sum of money to be paid, either as liquidated or unliquidated damages because of any claim of the ward whatsoever whether arising ex delicto or ex contractu, is a fair settlement of the claim of the ward, and that it is to the best interest of the ward that the settlement be made, or that the personal property be delivered to the ward. Thereupon the chancery court may authorize and decree that said sum of money or personal property be accepted by the ward and paid or delivered by the party owing or having the same as authorized by the decree of the court, and compliance with the order in the latter event shall acquit and release the person so paying or delivering the same. He, who under the order shall receive the money or property of a person under such disability, shall thereby become amenable to the court for the disposition of it for the use and benefit of the person under disability but shall not be required to furnish security therefor unless the chancery court shall so order.

      Whenever any interest, legal or equitable, in any real property in this state is owned by a ward or wards, whether said owner is a resident or a nonresident, and the interest is worth at a fair and reasonable market price less than the sum of Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000.00), and a purchaser desires to purchase said ward’s property or interest therein for less than Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000.00) a petition may be filed in the chancery court of the county of the residence of the ward or in the chancery court of the county where the property or any part thereof is located requesting approval and authority to sell said ward’s property. The petition shall be brought by the ward through next friend and shall join as respondents the parties provided in Section 93-13-281 or the parties designated by Section 93-13-281 may join and unite with the ward in the petition. The court shall consider the allegations of the petition and if the court is satisfied from the evidence presented that the proposed sales price is adequate and reasonable and the sale would be to the best interest of the ward then the court may enter an order authorizing the proposed sale. The court shall direct the clerk to execute a deed to the purchaser on the payment of the purchase price fixed and may direct the clerk to pay over the proceeds to some suitable person as provided in Section 93-13-211 provided no part of the costs of said proceedings shall be taxed against said ward or his interest.

       Chancery court erred by applying the legal standard for modification of child custody in appointing the mother as the son’s conservator and the appointment was reversed. Ravenstein v. Hawkins, 167 So.3d 210, 2014 Miss. LEXIS 326 (Miss. 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancellor did not err in appointing a conservator to the mother’s estate where the undisputed medical condition of the mother’s severe dementia rendered her incapable of managing her own property; the sister’s own admission that her mother could not handle matters on her own, as well as the physicians’ testimony and chancellor’s findings, illustrated that the mother was in need of a conservator. In re DeMoville v. Johnson, 856 So. 2d 607, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 558 (Miss. Ct. App. 2003), cert. denied, 866 So. 2d 473, 2004 Miss. LEXIS 207 (Miss. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Decedent’s conservatorship was imposed due to physical incapacity and advancing age, the fact that he was mentally alert and competent was of no consequence; the deeds the decedent signed over to the conservator were not valid where the conservator failed to seek approval of the court for the conveyance of the decedent’s land to herself. In re Estate of Thomas v. Thomas, 853 So. 2d 134, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 158 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 852 So. 2d 577, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 833 (Miss. Ct. App. 2003).

       <p>
   Under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c13s93-13-251" target="_self">93-13-251</a></cite>, a conservator for the management of property may be appointed by the chancery court of the county of the residence of any person who, by reason of advanced age, physical incapacity, or mental weakness is incapable of managing his own estate, and, additionally, if the court deems it advisable, the conservator may have charge and custody of the person as well as the property. Harvey v. Meador, 459 So. 2d 288, 1984 Miss. LEXIS 1985 (Miss. 1984).

      <p>
       Where adult ward, a resident and citizen of Lee County, after suffering injuries allegedly caused by defendant, convalesced at the home of his wife’s parents in Itawamba County, the Chancery Court of Lee County could properly appoint a conservator for the ward, notwithstanding the argument that only the Chancery Court of Itawamba County had authority to make such an appointment since ward presently resided in the latter county, where no showing was made that ward had voluntarily abandoned his Lee County domicil and established a residence, as such is recognized by law, in Itawamba County.

       Former wife’s claim that a conservatorship was invalid due to the chancery court’s failure to require the co-conservators to post a bond was procedurally barred from consideration because the wife failed to raise the issue in the chancery court; assuming that a bond should have been required, mere irregularities in the appointment or proceedings were immune from collateral attack, and thus, the absence of bond was a curable defect. Collins v. Pinnacle Trust, 147 So.3d 830, 2014 Miss. LEXIS 103 (Miss. 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because conservators’ position that a former husband was competent to join in the petition to appoint a conservator was not inconsistent with a position taken in prior litigation,judicial estoppel was not applicable; there was no evidence that the conservators took any position with regard to Stuart’s competency in a criminal matter. Collins v. Pinnacle Trust, 147 So.3d 830, 2014 Miss. LEXIS 103 (Miss. 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancery court did not err in denying a former wife’s petition to set aside the conservatorship over her former husband because the conservatorship was not invalid due to lack of notice to the wife; the husband was competent to join in the petition to appoint a conservator, and absent a finding that he was not competent to join the petition, the wife was not entitled to notice of the hearing. Collins v. Pinnacle Trust, 147 So.3d 830, 2014 Miss. LEXIS 103 (Miss. 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       Appointment of a conservator for an elderly ward was supported by substantial evidence where the ward testified that she had been told she had Alzheimer’s and that her mind was not as clear as it once had been and both a doctor and a psychologist who examined the ward testified that she was unable to attend to her physical needs or to manage her financial affairs. Salter v. Johnston, 98 So.3d 1130, 2012 Miss. App. LEXIS 626 (Miss. Ct. App. 2012).
      </p>
      <p>
       Order appointing a son conservator over the person and estate of his mother was upheld where the mother, a 76-year-old woman, was of below average intellect and had never concerned herself with the handling of her own business affairs; she exhibited overall indifference to her business affairs and her living conditions alike. Hester v. Hester (In re Hester), 989 So. 2d 986, 2008 Miss. App. LEXIS 247 (Miss. Ct. App. 2008).

      If a person is incapable of managing his own estate by reason of advanced age, physical incapacity or mental weakness, or because the person is missing or outside of the United States and unable to return, the chancery court of the county wherein the person resides or, in the case of a missing or absent person, the chancery court of the county where the person most recently resided, upon the petition of the person or of one or more of his friends or relatives, may appoint a conservator to have charge and management of the property of the person and, if the court deems it advisable, also to have charge and custody of the person subject to the direction of the appointing court.

      Upon the filing of the petition, the clerk of the court shall set a time and place for hearing and shall cause not less than five (5) days’ notice thereof to be given to the person for whom the conservator is to be appointed, except that the court may, for good cause shown, direct that a shorter notice be given. Unless the court finds that the person for whom the conservator is to be appointed is competent and joins in the petition, the notice shall also be given to one (1) relative of the person for whom the conservator is to be appointed who is not the petitioner and who resides in Mississippi if such relative is within the third degree of kinship, preferring first the spouse, unless legally separated, then an ascendant or descendant, then a brother or sister, then an adult niece, nephew, aunt or uncle, so that personal service is had on the person for whom the conservator is to be appointed and on one (1) relative who resides in Mississippi other than the petitioner. If no relative within the third degree of kinship to the person for whom the conservator is to be appointed is found residing in the State of Mississippi, the court shall either designate some other appropriate person to receive the notice or appoint a guardian ad litem to receive notice. If the person for whom the conservator is to be appointed is entitled to any benefit, estate or income paid or payable by or through the Veterans’ Administration of the United States government, such administration shall also be given such notice.

      <p>
       Chancery court properly appointed a nephew as conservator of his aunt’s person and estate because the nephew’s failure to give statutory notice to the aunt’s other relative (the nephew’s brother) was not a reversible error where the brother later voluntarily signed a waiver of notice, two physicians determined that the aunt could not manage her affairs, the nephew had been acting on the aunt’s behalf for several years, and the evidence presented by the aunt claiming that the nephew breached his fiduciary duty under her power of attorney was vague and speculative. Jackson v. Reed (In re Estate of Jackson), 203 So.3d 4, 2016 Miss. App. LEXIS 632 (Miss. Ct. App. 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancery court did not err by awarding post-majority child support to the mother on the ground that she did not have standing to seek such support because a review of the record indicated that the parties complied with all notice requirements prior to the conservatorship hearing. Ravenstein v. Hawkins, 167 So.3d 210, 2014 Miss. LEXIS 326 (Miss. 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancery court did not err in denying a former wife’s petition to set aside the conservatorship over her former husband because the conservatorship was not invalid due to lack of notice to the wife; the husband was competent to join in the petition to appoint a conservator, and absent a finding that he was not competent to join the petition, the wife was not entitled to notice of the hearing. Collins v. Pinnacle Trust, 147 So.3d 830, 2014 Miss. LEXIS 103 (Miss. 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   In the conservator’s suit to set aside a deed conveyed by the ward, where his sister claimed the conservatorship was invalid because process was never served on a relative, the chancellor erred by concluding that Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c13s93-13-253" target="_self">93-13-253</a></cite> did not require service of process on a relative when the party petitioning for a conservatorship was the ward; the Court of Appeals of Mississippi found that it was unreasonable to conclude that the legislature intended that a person in need of a conservatorship due to mental incompetency could waive the statutorily-mandated service of process on a relative by signing the petition to establish the conservatorship. Armstrong v. Estate of Thames, 958 So. 2d 1258, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 397 (Miss. Ct. App. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       Appointment of conservator was invalid because the conservator failed to give any family members notice of the appointment, especially the wife of the person for whom she was appointed conservator. Smith v. King, 942 So. 2d 1290, 2006 Miss. LEXIS 586 (Miss. 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the mother failed to meet the requirement of sending notice to next of kin, the father of the child, the mistake was not fatal considering all of the facts of the case; the father was present in the courtroom during the proceeding; while in court, the father was asked directly if he had any problem with the granting of the conservatorship, and he responded that he had no objection, which constituted an overt act that submitted the father to the jurisdiction of the court and therefore amounted to notice of the proceedings. In re Brantley v. Brantley, 865 So. 2d 1126, 2004 Miss. LEXIS 184 (Miss. 2004).

   Appellant daughter did not deny that she failed to seek reimbursement prior to the closure of the conservatorship; neither had she provided a reason why she failed to file such a claim for reimbursement. Accordingly, there was no error with the chancellor’s determination that her claims for expenses were untimely and, therefore, barred under Miss.

   This section cannot be read to make applicable to conservators those statutes or portions of statutes which are intended only to address issues relating to orphaned minors, such as §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c13s93-13-13" target="_self">93-13-13</a></cite>, which addresses the appointment of testamentary guardians for children. Jackson v. Jackson, 732 So. 2d 916, 1999 Miss. LEXIS 54 (Miss. 1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       A chancellor did not abuse his discretion in removing a conservator where inventories were not timely filed and no reason was given therefor, the conservator failed to seek court approval prior to making expenditures, and he purchased certificates of deposit, invested in stock and sold stock without prior approval. Mathews v. Williams (In re Mathews), 633 So. 2d 1038, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 123 (Miss. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       A finding that a conservator and his wife violated the fiduciary duty to the ward and converted the ward’s funds to their own use was supported by evidence that the ward’s funds had been used to purchase a van which was used by the conservator and his wife, and that the conservator, his wife, and their children were the recipients of loans and gifts from monies in the conservatorship account, without previous court approval. Bryan v. Holzer, 589 So. 2d 648, 1991 Miss. LEXIS 762 (Miss. 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Chancery Court has discretion in determining whether a ward under conservatorship should have an allowance and if so, how much allowance that ward should be granted. This is so because wards under conservatorship may have sufficient mental ability to manage a limited monthly income. The court has broad discretion to authorize modest allowances to be given to and used by the ward as he or she sees fit without further accounting. In re Conservatorship of Stallings, 523 So. 2d 49, 1988 Miss. LEXIS 69 (Miss. 1988).

       <p>
   In view of statute (§<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c13s93-13-259" target="_self">93-13-259</a></cite>) stating that conservators have same powers, rights and duties as guardians, statute (§<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.11.html#t11c51s11-51-99" target="_blank">11-51-99</a></cite>) governing appeals by guardians also governs appeals by conservators; accordingly, conservator appealing decree discharging conservator is entitled to do so with supersedeas without bond in accordance with §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.11.html#t11c51s11-51-99" target="_blank">11-51-99</a></cite>. Conservatorship of Harris v. King, 480 So. 2d 1131, 1985 Miss. LEXIS 2371 (Miss. 1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       Elderly individual who has had conservator appointed to handle business affairs has standing to object to conservator’s petition for approval of annual accounting, inventory and discharge; court should appoint guardian ad litem, probably attorney, for individual and instruct guardian ad litem to investigate matters alleged by individual; if proper and necessary, court should grant guardian ad litem permission to file suit against conservator on behalf of individual. Anthony v. National Bank of Commerce, 468 So. 2d 41, 1985 Miss. LEXIS 2033 (Miss. 1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   The feature distinguishing a conservatorship from a guardianship is the lack of necessity of an incompetency determination or of the existence of a legal disability for its initiation; however, after establishment of such protective procedures, the duties, responsibilities, and powers, under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c13s93-13-259" target="_self">93-13-259</a></cite>, of a guardian or conservator are the same. Harvey v. Meador, 459 So. 2d 288, 1984 Miss. LEXIS 1985 (Miss. 1984).
      </p>
      <p>
       Before a conservator is permitted to withdraw his ward’s funds from a joint account with another, during the life of both, it is necessary for him to secure an order from a chancery court that a certain amount of the funds are required for the ward’s necessities, since this corresponds with the duty of a guardian as it has existed for a long time, and since by statute the duties and powers of a conservator and guardian are the same. In re Estate of Atkins, 422 So. 2d 754, 1982 Miss. LEXIS 2316 (Miss. 1982).

       Decedent’s conservatorship was imposed due to physical incapacity and advancing age, the fact that he was mentally alert and competent was of no consequence; the deeds the decedent signed over to the conservator were not valid where the conservator failed to seek approval of the court for the conveyance of the decedent’s land to herself. In re Estate of Thomas v. Thomas, 853 So. 2d 134, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 158 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 852 So. 2d 577, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 833 (Miss. Ct. App. 2003).

     <p>
      In all proceedings involving a ward and brought under Chapter 13, Title 93, Mississippi Code of 1972, except as hereinafter provided, the proceedings shall join as defendants the parents or parent of the ward then living, or if neither be living, two of his adult kin within the third degree computed according to the civil law. When such petition shall be filed, the clerk shall issue process as in other suits to make such person or persons parties defendants, which process shall be executed and returned as in other cases. The clerk shall make publication for nonresident defendants as required by law. Any person so made a party, or any other relative or friend of the ward, may appear and resist the application.
     </p>
     <p>
      In cases where a ward has been adopted by decree of court, the adoptive parent or parents, or the next of kin of the adoptive parent or parents, as the case may be, shall be joined as defendants in lieu of the natural parents or the next of kin of the natural parents, as herein provided. Where the custody and control of a ward has been by decree of court awarded to one of the natural parents, it shall be sufficient herein to join as defendant only the parent to whom the custody and control has been awarded.
     </p>
     <p>
      In case there be no adult relations within said third degree, the court may, in its discretion, designate a guardian ad litem who shall be required to answer the said petition for and on behalf of said ward within a time fixed by the court.
     </p>
     <p>
      Process need not be served hereunder, however, if the parent or parents then living, or if they both be not living if any two (2) of his adult kin within the third degree computed according to the civil law, shall unite with the guardian in his petition. If the ward has no parent then living and no kindred within the prescribed degree whose place of residence is known to him or his next friend, it shall not be necessary to make any person defendant thereto.
     </p>
     <p>
      In cases where a ward has been adopted by decree of court, the adoptive parent or parents, or the next of kin of the adoptive parent or parents, as the case may be, may unite with the guardian in his petition in lieu of the natural parents as herein provided. Where the custody and control of a ward has been by decree of court awarded to one of the natural parents or adopted parents, as the case may be, to the exclusion of the other, it shall be sufficient herein for only the parent to whom the custody and control has been awarded to unite with the guardian in his petition as herein provided.
     </p>
     <p>
      Provided, however, in all proceedings involving a ward who is married, in lieu of the foregoing provisions, there may be joined as defendants the spouse of the ward and one (1) other adult kin within the third degree computed according to the civil law if the spouse is at least twenty-one (21) years of age or the spouse and two (2) adult kin within the third degree computed according to the civil law if the spouse is not at least twenty-one (21) years of age or the said spouse and kin may unite with the ward in his petition.

       § 93-14-302.
    Accepting guardianship or conservatorship transferred from another state.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      [Effective from and after January 1, 2020, this section will read as follows:].
     </p>
     <p>
      To confirm transfer of a guardianship or conservatorship transferred to this state under provisions similar to Section 93-14-301, the guardian or conservator must petition the court in this state to accept the guardianship or conservatorship. The petition must include a certified copy of the other state’s provisional order of transfer.
     </p>
     <p>
      Notice of a petition under subsection (a) must be given to those persons that would be entitled to notice if the petition were a petition for the appointment of a guardian or conservator or issuance of a protective order in both the transferring state and this state. The notice must be given in the same manner as notice is required to be given in this state.
     </p>
     <p>
      On the court’s own motion or on request of the guardian or conservator, the incapacitated or protected person, or other person required to be notified of the proceeding, the court shall hold a hearing on a petition filed pursuant to subsection (a).
     </p>
     <p>
      The court shall issue an order provisionally granting a petition filed under subsection (a) unless:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t93c14s93-14-302.1ol11">
       An objection is made and the objector establishes that transfer of the proceeding would be contrary to the interests of the incapacitated or protected person; or
      </li>
      <li id="t93c14s93-14-302.1ol12">
       The guardian or conservator is ineligible for appointment in this state.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      The court shall issue a final order accepting the proceeding and appointing the guardian or conservator as guardian or conservator in this state upon its receipt from the court from which the proceeding is being transferred of a final order issued under provisions similar to Section 93-14-301 transferring the proceeding to this state.
     </p>
     <p>
      Not later than ninety (90) days after issuance of a final order accepting transfer of a guardianship or conservatorship, the court shall determine whether the guardianship or conservatorship needs to be modified to conform to the law of this state.
     </p>
     <p>
      In granting a petition under this section, the court shall recognize a guardianship or conservatorship order from the other state, including the determination of the incapacitated or protected person’s incapacity and the appointment of the guardian or conservator.
     </p>
     <p>
      The denial by a court of this state of a petition to accept a guardianship or conservatorship transferred from another state does not affect the ability of the guardian or conservator to seek appointment as guardian or conservator in this state under Article 2, 3 or 4 of Title 93, Chapter 20, Mississippi Code of 1972, or under Section 35-5-1 et seq., if the court has jurisdiction to make an appointment other than by reason of the provisional order of transfer.

   Although the chancellor initially granted the mother’s motion to terminate the father’s parental rights, the Hinds County Chancery Court did not have proper subject matter jurisdiction to do so because the Scott County Chancery Court entered the initial order of child custody; when presented with information regarding the jurisdictional problem, the chancellor immediately corrected the defect by setting aside his previous orders and instructing that any further proceedings regarding the case be brought before the Scott County Chancery Court, pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c05s93-5-23" target="_self">93-5-23</a></cite>. C.M. v. R.D.H., 947 So. 2d 1023, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 29 (Miss. Ct. App. 2007).

      <p>
       <p>
   Termination of the mother’s parental rights was inappropriate under the Termination of Rights of Unfit Parents Law because the county’s evidence did not overcome the strong presumption of retaining parental rights in the mother’s favor; there was a failure to show an extreme and deep-seated antipathy by the child toward the parent or any other substantial erosion of the relationship between the two as required pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. [former] §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c15s93-15-103ol13f" target="_self">93-15-103(3)(f)</a></cite>. In re V.M.S., 938 So. 2d 829, 2006 Miss. LEXIS 530 (Miss. 2006).

       In situation where adoption necessarily meant that natural father’s parental rights would be terminated, appointment of guardian ad litem was made mandatory by statute governing termination of parental rights. E.M.C. v. S.V.M., 695 So. 2d 576, 1997 Miss. LEXIS 236 (Miss. 1997).

       Appointment of guardian ad litem is mandatory in termination of parental rights proceedings, and guardian ad litem should be someone who is unbiased and independent of natural parent to insure protection for the child’s best interests.

      </p>
      <p>
       Failure to appoint guardian ad litem for child was reversible error, even though proceeding was referred to as adoption rather than for termination of parental rights, as complaint for adoption specifically alleged that natural father had abandoned child under statutory provision dealing with termination of parental rights for unfit parents; adoption and termination of parental rights proceedings were not separable under the circumstances and appointment of guardian ad litem was mandatory.

   The chancellor erred in terminating the parental rights of a mother in her children where the mother had not abandoned the children, there was no evidence that she was mentally unfit to rear and train them, and the state had failed to show by a preponderance of the evidence that she was morally or otherwise unfit to rear and train them; the parental rights of the father in the same children were improperly terminated by another chancellor who had conducted a hearing prior to the hearing concerning the mother’s parental rights where the procedure of two hearings violated the requirement of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c15s93-15-7" target="_self">93-15-7</a></cite> [repealed] that all evidence be presented before the termination of parental rights.

      </p>
      <p>
       Prior to statutory revision, an order terminating parental rights in four of five children would be reversed where, although a strong case was presented that the severely retarded mother was mentally unfit to rear the children, the proof was not sufficient to show that the father was mentally unfit for this task and where the proof showed that the parents had visited with the children while in foster care, loved the children, were concerned about their welfare and wanted custody of the children. Also, no justifiable reason was given for the arbitrary decision to terminate parental rights in the four youngest children but not in the oldest child. Reyer v. Harrison County Dep't of Public Welfare, 404 So. 2d 1023, 1981 Miss. LEXIS 2192 (Miss. 1981).

       Chancellor erred in denying a mother’s request to terminate the father’s parental rights because, while the chancellor appointed a guardian ad litem (GAL) to represent the child’s interests, the chancellor made no mention of the GAL’s various findings and recommendations, the bulk of which favored terminating the father’s parental rights, and erroneously believed that a pending adoption petition was necessary before termination could be considered.

Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c15s93-15-107" target="_self">93-15-107</a></cite>, was without merit because (1) the father had not shown that the guardian ad litem was incompetent or inadequately informed; (2) the father had not shown that the guardian ad litem acted other than in the best interests of the child; (3) the father failed to take advantage of his opportunities to have supplemental meetings with the guardian ad litem, evidencing a lack of desire to initiate a relationship with his child of tender years; and (4) there were no allegations that the child was not well cared for by the mother or that his health and welfare were lacking in any way.

   In the proceeding upon the mother’s petition to modify a prior joint custody order and terminate the father’s parental rights, the chancellor erred in failing to appoint a guardian ad litem to represent the child’s interests because Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c15s93-15-107ol11" target="_self">93-15-107(1)</a></cite> clearly and unambiguously mandated that a guardian ad litem be appointed to protect the interest of a child in a termination of parental rights proceeding.

       Trial court erred in terminating father’s parental rights by failing to state the reasons for not adopting the guardian as litem’s recommendation Gunter v. Gray, 876 So. 2d 315, 2004 Miss. LEXIS 774 (Miss. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Termination of parental rights case was remanded for the guardian ad litem to conduct an investigation and make recommendations where the record as to the guardian ad litem’s role in determining what was in the best interest of the children was lacking; there was nothing in the record to indicate that the guardian ever talked privately with the children, no independent report was presented to the trial court during the termination hearing or prior to the judge’s decision, and the guardian did not testify at the hearing, but only limited himself to the cross-examination of other witnesses.

       A chancellor is not required to appoint a guardian ad litem to protect the interest of the child in an uncontested adoption proceeding which necessarily involves the termination of parental rights. J. C. v. In re R.Y., 797 So. 2d 209, 2001 Miss. LEXIS 47 (Miss. 2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       The court vacated an order terminating parental rights and remanded the matter for further proceedings where the guardian ad litem appointed to represent the minor children failed to personally interview the children and offer an independent recommendation to the chancellor, where the sole reason the guardian ad litem did not personally interview the children was that he was informed by the therapist for one of the children and by the children’s social worker that such contact would not be in the children’s best interest.

       The court properly ordered the Department of Human Services and the natural parents of the children at issue to pay 60 percent and 40 percent, respectively, of the costs of a guardian ad litem and a special investigator in an action commenced by the natural mother’s brother and his wife for termination of parental rights and adoption of the children, even though the action was dismissed on motion by the natural parents: (1) the likelihood of recovery from the plaintiffs was extremely remote in light of their finances, (2) the children were in the legal custody of the department, and (3) the natural father was on the verge of the receipt of a substantial sum of money as award for personal injuries received in past employment.

       Termination of parental rights and adoption was appropriate because there was serious neglect and abuse of children and a substantial erosion of the parent-child relationship as there was clear and convincing proof that the children were exposed to dangerous levels of methamphetamine while under the mother’s care. Also, the father was inactive when the children were exposed to drugs while the father and the mother were separated, was unable to provide for the children with any stability, and lacked involvement in the children’s care. J.P. v. L.S., — So.3d —, 2019 Miss. App. LEXIS 46 (Miss. Ct. App. Jan. 29, 2019).
      </p>

   Even where a chancellor finds one or more grounds which justify termination of parental rights, nothing in the law requires the chancellor to do so; rather, Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c15s93-15-109" target="_self">93-15-109</a></cite> provides that if the chancellor is satisfied by clear and convincing proof that grounds justifying termination of parental rights exist then the court may terminate all the parental rights of the parent or parents. Pendleton v. Leverock (In re Marriage of Leverock), 23 So.3d 424, 2009 Miss. LEXIS 599 (Miss. 2009).

   Where a father had been paying child support, he occasionally exercised visitation, and he expressed a desire to have a relationship with his child, the termination of the father’s parental rights was properly denied under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c15s93-15-103ol13b" target="_self">93-15-103(3)(b)</a></cite> based on a lack of clear and convincing evidence of abandonment. A.C.W. v.

       Chancellor did not err in awarding custody of a child to a paternal aunt where there was ample evidence presented to show that the child’s mother had led an unstable life, including the use of illegal narcotics, for an extended period of time and that her attention to the welfare of her child appeared to be of secondary interest to her.

   Termination of the mother’s parental rights was appropriate because her ongoing behavior of choosing to remain on runaway status prevented her from maintaining a bond with the child; it was impossible to return the child to her custody when she avoided the Department of Human Services and the burden of proof under Miss.

       A chancellor was not manifestly wrong in refusing to terminate a father’s parental rights, even though the father had killed the child’s mother, where there was no abandonment of the child by her father and the father had made 5 $100 payments in support of his daughter.

       The standard of proof in action to terminate parental rights, under statute, requires that the chancellor must be satisfied by all of the evidence that the proof is clear and convincing that the grounds for termination are present.

   The chancellor erred in terminating the parental rights of a mother in her children where the mother had not abandoned the children, there was no evidence that she was mentally unfit to rear and train them, and the state had failed to show by a preponderance of the evidence that she was morally or otherwise unfit to rear and train them; the parental rights of the father in the same children were improperly terminated by another chancellor who had conducted a hearing prior to the hearing concerning the mother’s parental rights where the procedure of two hearings violated the requirement of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c15s93-15-7" target="_self">93-15-7</a></cite> that all evidence be presented before the termination of parental rights.

       The statute does not provide for the court to be bound by the Department of Human Services’s consent or the lack thereof to the adoption of a child in its custody. L.W. v. C.W.B., 762 So. 2d 323, 2000 Miss. LEXIS 168 (Miss. 2000).

      <p>
       Chancellor’s finding that best interest of minor child would be served by termination of parental rights of natural parents, and his adoption by petitioners, was supported by evidence showing that the natural parents were mentally and morally unfit to rear and train child, and further showing improvement in child during time he was in home of petitioner.

       Chancery court’s judgment terminating a mother’s parental rights was valid because the mother waived service of process by voluntarily signing a surrender and release form; the language the county department of human services used in the surrender and release form conformed with the requirements of the statute since it specified that signing the document would result in a waiver of service of process and further notice of any court proceedings regarding the child. Simmons v. Harrison Cty. Dep't of Human Servs., 228 So.3d 347, 2017 Miss. App. LEXIS 582 (Miss. Ct. App. 2017).
      </p>
      <p>
       Rules of civil procedure clearly defer to Mississippi’s statutory provisions for matters concerning termination of parental rights and adoption; when a chancellor is faced with matters concerning the termination of parental rights or adoption, the controlling body of law is the statute rather than the rules of civil procedure. Simmons v. Harrison Cty. Dep't of Human Servs., 228 So.3d 347, 2017 Miss. App. LEXIS 582 (Miss. Ct. App. 2017).

       Clerical error made to a child’s date of birth had no effect on the mother’s voluntary surrender of her parental rights and waiver of service of process because the mother acknowledged her intent to surrender her parental rights when she signed the document.

   Grandmother who sought to have parent’s parental rights terminated failed to prove abandonment or any of the grounds under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c15s93-15-103" target="_self">93-15-103</a></cite>, and the appellate court was not inclined to terminate a parent’s rights merely because the mother happened to work as a stripper. Further, where the chancellor found that the grandmother had frequent visitation, including overnight visitation, with the children, and that the parents had not unreasonably withheld visitation, given concerns about the grandmother’s boyfriend, the chancellor properly declined to impose court-ordered visitation. Hillman v. Vance, 910 So. 2d 43, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 34 (Miss. Ct. App. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence did not establish that a father was mentally, morally, or otherwise unfit to raise a child where the only evidence offered to show that he was unfit was one allegedly abusive incident between the father and the mother. S.N.C. v. J.R.D., 755 So. 2d 1077, 2000 Miss. LEXIS 21 (Miss. 2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancellor was not manifestly in error when he found neither abandonment nor such immoral conduct as to make natural father of child unfit, where: father had been behind in child support payments; had been arrested for possession of marijuana with intent to deliver; and had cohabited with someone not his spouse; constant arrearages in child support payments do not constitute abandonment or desertion under statutory definition, and that was only evidence of desertion in case; there was no evidence that father had ever exposed daughter to illegal or immoral conduct during visits, and at time of hearing father was out of school and held good job; commission of crime alone was insufficient to find him morally unfit to rear and train child, especially where rehabilitation was evident; and, cohabitation by custodial parent in itself is insufficient to modify custody order absent showing of substantial detrimental effect; same rule applies in adoption cases. In Interest of J.D., 512 So. 2d 684, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2738 (Miss. 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancellor’s finding that best interest of minor child would be served by termination of parental rights of natural parents, and his adoption by petitioners, was supported by evidence showing that the natural parents were mentally and morally unfit to rear and train child, and further showing improvement in child during time he was in home of petitioner. G.M.R. v. H.E.S., 489 So. 2d 498, 1986 Miss. LEXIS 2467 (Miss. 1986).
      </p>

   Where a statute is repealed by a new statute which substantially reenacts provisions of the prior statute simultaneously with the repeal, the operation of the original statute is not interrupted by the repeal as to an action which was filed and pending before the effective date of the new legislation. Thus, a suit to terminate the parental rights of a natural father instituted on June 30, 1980, was controlled by the provisions of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c15s93-15-1" target="_self">93-15-1</a></cite>, et seq., although that statute was repealed by §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c15s93-15-1" target="_self">93-15-1</a></cite>01, et seq., which became effective the following day, July 1, 1980. The trial court correctly terminated the parental rights of the natural father on the grounds that he had abandoned the child and was “morally unfit” where the evidence established that he had suggested to the natural mother that she have an abortion, he had refused to contribute to the expense of prenatal care, he had demanded that the natural mother not use his name in applying for welfare assistance, he had terminated his relationship with the natural mother after being informed that she was pregnant, he had left the decision regarding the child’s destiny entirely up to the mother, and a month prior to the baby’s birth, he had advised the mother that he would surrender the child for adoption, and where the evidence also established that the father, a married man separated from his wife, had entered into an adulterous affair with the natural mother, a teenage girl. Doe v. Attorney W., 410 So. 2d 1312, 1982 Miss. LEXIS 1882 (Miss. 1982).

      <p>
       <p>
   Termination of the mother’s parental rights was inappropriate because, although her mental illness affected her ability to care for her child, there was no clear and convincing evidence proving that the mother’s condition made her unable to assume minimally, acceptable care of the child under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c15s93-15-103ol13ei" target="_self">93-15-103(3)(e)(i)</a></cite>. Psychiatric reports indicated that the mother’s insight and judgment were good; her attitude was cooperative; and her motivation for ongoing treatment was good. J.J. v. Smith, 31 So.3d 1271, 2010 Miss. App. LEXIS 147 (Miss. Ct. App. 2010).
      </p>
      <p>
       The mental unfitness of a mother to raise her child was not established where the record revealed a complete and total absence of any substantive evidence supporting the conclusion that the mother suffered from any mental short-comings sufficient in degree to warrant a termination of her parental rights. N. E. v. L. H., 761 So. 2d 956, 2000 Miss. App. LEXIS 281 (Miss. Ct. App. 2000).

    Involuntary termination when child in care and custody or under the supervision of the Department of Child Protection Services pursuant to youth court proceedings and reasonable efforts for reunification are required; standard of proof.

     </h3>
     <p>
      When reasonable efforts for reunification are required for a child who is in the custody of, or under the supervision of, the Department of Child Protection Services pursuant to youth court proceedings, the court hearing a petition under this chapter may terminate the parental rights of a parent if, after conducting an evidentiary hearing, the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that:
     </p>
     <p>
      The child has been adjudicated abused or neglected;
     </p>
     <p>
      The child has been in the custody and care of, or under the supervision of, the Department of Child Protection Services for at least six (6) months, and, in that time period, the Department of Child Protection Services has developed a service plan for the reunification of the parent and the child;
     </p>
     <p>
      A permanency hearing, or a permanency review hearing, has been conducted pursuant to the Uniform Rules of Youth Court Practice and the court has found that the Department of Child Protection Services, or a licensed child caring agency under its supervision, has made reasonable efforts over a reasonable period to diligently assist the parent in complying with the service plan but the parent has failed to substantially comply with the terms and conditions of the plan and that reunification with the abusive or neglectful parent is not in the best interests of the child; and
     </p>
     <p>
      Termination of the parent’s parental rights is appropriate because reunification between the parent and child is not desirable toward obtaining a satisfactory permanency outcome based on one or more of the grounds set out in Section 93-15-119 or 93-15-121.

       The standard of proof in action to terminate parental rights, under statute, requires that the chancellor must be satisfied by all of the evidence that the proof is clear and convincing that the grounds for termination are present.

   The chancellor erred in terminating the parental rights of a mother in her children where the mother had not abandoned the children, there was no evidence that she was mentally unfit to rear and train them, and the state had failed to show by a preponderance of the evidence that she was morally or otherwise unfit to rear and train them; the parental rights of the father in the same children were improperly terminated by another chancellor who had conducted a hearing prior to the hearing concerning the mother’s parental rights where the procedure of two hearings violated the requirement of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c15s93-15-7" target="_self">93-15-7</a></cite> that all evidence be presented before the termination of parental rights.

       The 2017 amendment, effective March 20, 2017, deleted “chancery” preceding “court hearing” in the introductory paragraph of (1); rewrote former (1)(a), which read: “That the parent has engaged in conduct constituting abandonment or desertion of the child or is mentally, morally, or otherwise unfit to raise the child. The court shall inquire as to the military status of any absent parent. Proof that a parent is mentally, morally, or otherwise unfit to raise the child shall be established by showing past or present conduct of the parent that demonstrates a substantial risk of compromising or endangering the child’s safety and welfare; and,” and redesignated it (1)(a)(i); rewrote former (b), which read: “That termination of the parent’s parental rights is appropriate because future contacts between the parent and child are not desirable toward obtaining a satisfactory permanency outcome based on one or more of the factors set out in Section 93-15-121,” and redesignated it (1)(a)(ii); added (1)(b); and added (3).

       There was substantial credible proof supporting the chancery court’s decision to terminate a mother’s parental rights because the case was replete with drug addiction, child neglect, crime, and past behavior demonstrating the mother’s unfitness to raise her minor children; the mother conceded to using drugs and alcohol during her pregnancies and while breastfeeding her children, and she was charged and arrested for driving under the influence with her children in the vehicle.

       Because there was clear and convincing evidence that a father made no serious effort to see his children or to provide financial support for them from 2014 to 2017, the appellate court found no manifest error in the chancery court’s determination that the father had engaged in conduct constituting abandonment and that it would not be in the children’s best interest to be reunified with him.

       Chancellor properly terminated a father’s parental rights because he had not seen his daughter in three years, had not made any serious efforts to do so, failed to pay any child support for approximately two years, and only began to pay once the mother filed her termination action.

      <p>
       There was credible proof to support the chancellor’s decision to terminate a mother’s parental rights pursuant to this section. The chancellor specifically found that the mother was a drug addict and was unlikely to change in the foreseeable future, was unwilling to care for her children because of her drug addiction, and had repeatedly failed to comply with court orders regarding her rehabilitation, including entering a drug and alcohol rehabilitation program.

      <p>
       Termination of a parent’s parental rights and support obligations to the parent’s child was appropriate because the chancellor found by clear and convincing evidence that termination was in the best interest of the child as the parent had not visited or communicated with the child in almost five years and had not financially supported her for more than four years.

Further, during that year, hte mother actively pursued her right to visitation with the daughter by filing proceedings with the chancery court. L.O. v. G.V., 37 So.3d 1248, 2010 Miss.

       In evaluating custody, the trial court focused on the father’s desire to have custody of the child, but the undisputed record revealed that for two and a half years, the father had no contact with the child; further, the father provided no financial support, nor did he send any birthday or Christmas cards or gifts to the child. As a matter of law the father’s actions (or lack thereof) during the two and a half years before the mother’s death constituted desertion; because the evidence of desertion was clear, the trial court erred in awarding custody to the natural father without an on-the-record analysis of the child’s best interests utilizing the Albright factors.

       Youth court did not err in terminating parents’ rights because the parents failed to eliminate prior behavior identified by a child caring agency and the court; among other things, the mother admitted to having used drugs while she was pregnant with her third child, and the father was arrested on drug charges and was not present during the current termination of parental rights proceedings. The children had been previously removed but not even six months after they regained custody after the children had been previously removed, a social worker saw the three young children inside the home, but she did not see an adult; one of the children’s diapers was saturated with urine and feces, and the mother was found in bed, dazed.

   ), a child may be adjudicated neglected if that child’s parent, guardian or custodian or any person responsible for his care or support, neglects or refuses, when able so to do, to provide for him proper and necessary care or support, or medical, surgical, or other care necessary for his well-being or who, for any reason, lacks the care necessary for his health, morals or well-being; there is nothing in the language of Miss.

   ) which requires that an adjudication of neglect be made specifically with respect to the parent whose rights are being terminated. Indeed, the language of the neglect statute defines a “neglected child” – not a “neglecting parent” – and defines a “neglected child” in such a way that both parents have the responsibility to insure that a child is not being neglected, regardless of who the custodial parent is; in other words, if a child is being neglected by the custodial parent, that child is also being neglected by the non-custodial parent if that parent fails to remedy the situation when he or she is able to do so.

   Minor child could be found neglected, regardless of who the custodial parent was, if the non-custodial parent failed to remedy the situation when he or she was able to do so, and a non-custodial father, knowing that the children’s mother opposed taking one of the children to see a doctor, allowed the child to remain with the mother, untreated, for 10 additional days before taking the child back to see a doctor and because of that delay, the child’s bones began healing incorrectly. In addition to the medical neglect, the father was undoubtedly aware of the living conditions that his children were forced to endure, as he had lived at the very same residence in the past, he had undoubtedly witnessed the continuing nature of the living conditions when he came for his regular visits with the children, and according to the language of the “neglected child” statute, Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.43.html#t43c21s43-21-105ol1a" target="_blank">43-21-105(a)</a></cite>, the children were neglected for purposes of Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c15s93-15-103ol13h" target="_self">93-15-103(3)(h)</a></cite> as much because of the father’s in action as they were because of anything the mother did or did not do.

       A mother had her child taken out of her custody previously, but the adjudication of neglect was not enough to sober the mother because similar incidents continued to occur, and the child was formally adjudicated neglected twice and one time the parties agreed to a consent judgment under the agreement that the mother had a drug problem that had to be addressed; therefore, the youth court’s adjudication of neglect was supported by clear and convincing evidence and termination of her parental rights was appropriate. B.S.G. v. J.E.H., 958 So. 2d 259, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 402 (Miss. Ct. App. 2007).

       Lauderdale County Department of Human Services made numerous attempts to aid the mother in regaining custody of her child, consistently from March 2004 until July 2005, however each time the mother regained custody or visitation with the child, she would abuse drugs and/or leave the child for extended periods in the care of relatives, which ultimately placed the responsibility of the child’s best interest with the youth court; that cycle continued for over two years until the mother was incarcerated, and thus termination of her parental rights was appropriate. B.S.G. v. J.E.H., 958 So. 2d 259, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 402 (Miss. Ct. App. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       Termination of the mother’s parental rights was proper because: (1) the mother neglected and abandoned her child; (2) she had a history of drug abuse; (3) she was unable to complete the youth court’s requirements to regain custody; (4) she was presently incarcerated; (5) there was little evidence that the mother was capable of providing stability and long-term care for the child; and (6) reunification with the mother was not in the child’s best interest. B.S.G. v. J.E.H., 958 So. 2d 259, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 402 (Miss. Ct. App. 2007).

       <p>
   At least nine months prior to the termination of parental rights hearing the mother presumably was in contact with the child for court ordered joint counseling; thus, the youth court improperly found that termination was proper under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c15s93-15-103ol13b" target="_self">93-15-103(3)(b)</a></cite> because she had contact with her child within the last year. However, while Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c15s93-15-103ol13b" target="_self">93-15-103(3)(b)</a></cite> was not an applicable ground for termination, the youth court’s determination to terminate the mother’s parental rights was sufficiently supported with the application of the other listed grounds; thus, any error was harmless error.

Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c15s93-15-103ol13e" target="_self">93-15-103(3)(e)</a></cite> because the mother’s ongoing behavior of choosing to remain on runaway status prevented her from maintaining a bond with the child; it was impossible to return the child to her custody when she avoided the Department of Human Services.

       Even though the trial court erred in finding that the mother abandoned her child, since the record did not show that she had manifested her severance of all ties with the child, the error was harmless as the trial court properly found parental rights could be terminated on other proper statutory grounds. The record reflected that the mother had not been totally absent from the child’s life for any significant period of time, as she continually exercised her visitation rights. In re Adoption of a Minor Child, 931 So. 2d 566, 2006 Miss. LEXIS 111 (Miss. 2006).

      <p>
       Trial court erred in terminating father’s parental rights where there was testimony that the father communicated with the children and exercised his visitation rights up to the time of his incarceration. Furthermore, there was an effort by him to have his mother granted visitation rights in which he would have been able to have contact with his children while she had them; therefore, the father did not abandon his children once he was incarcerated. Gunter v. Gray, 876 So. 2d 315, 2004 Miss. LEXIS 774 (Miss. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Clear and convincing evidence did not establish abandonment of a child by his mother where no evidence, either pro or con, was presented concerning any parental contributions the mother made to the rearing of the child, either in the form of monetary support or in the form of basic nurturance, and there were no specific questions put to the witnesses on the ground of abandonment.

      </p>
      <p>
       The Court of Appeals did not err when it reversed the chancery court’s termination of a mother’s parental rights because the Court of Appeals, while acknowledging that there had been a substantial erosion of the relationship between the mother and her children and that the parent-child relationship in question was not a good one, found that the substantial burden of proof necessary for termination had not been met. M.L.B. v. S.L.J., 806 So. 2d 1023, 2000 Miss. LEXIS 93 (Miss. 2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence did not establish that a father had abandoned his child without contact for a year; even though the father’s contacts with the child were minimal, the evidence showed that the father did maintain ties to the child and did not relinquish all parental claims to the child. S.N.C. v. J.R.D., 755 So. 2d 1077, 2000 Miss. LEXIS 21 (Miss. 2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       The natural mother and stepfather failed to establish that the natural father deserted or abandoned the child at issue where there was conflicting evidence as to how long the natural father went without seeing his child, and the natural father testified that he saw the child on several occasions through his mother and by visiting her secretly at her babysitters, that he sent a letter with a poem, and that he bought Christmas gifts that he had attempted to give to the child. In re M. L. W., 755 So. 2d 558, 2000 Miss. App. LEXIS 89 (Miss. Ct. App. 2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       The evidence was insufficient to show a settled purpose of the natural father to forego all parental rights and relinquish all parental claim to the minor child where, inter alia, he visited his daughter four or five times since the parties divorced and there was continued contact through frequent telephone calls. S.N.C. v. J.R.D., 1999 Miss. App. LEXIS 45 (Miss. Ct. App. Feb. 9, 1999), aff'd, 755 So. 2d 1077, 2000 Miss. LEXIS 21 (Miss. 2000).
      </p>

       The evidence was sufficient to support a finding that a mother had abandoned and deserted her minor children, where the mother had only seen the children 2 times between January of 1986 when she left them with their father and the time of the trial in January of 1990, the mother did not contribute any financial assistance during that time, the mother did not send birthday cards or Christmas gifts to the children and ignored other events in the children’s lives, the children thought of and referred to their aunt, with whom they were living, as their mother, and though the older child knew who the mother was when she saw her, the younger child did not know the mother at all as the mother had left when the younger child was 6 months old.

       A chancellor was not manifestly wrong in refusing to terminate a father’s parental rights, even though the father had killed the child’s mother, where there was no abandonment of the child by her father and the father had made 5 $100 payments in support of his daughter.

       Chancellor was not manifestly in error when he found neither abandonment nor such immoral conduct as to make natural father of child unfit, where: father had been behind in child support payments; had been arrested for possession of marijuana with intent to deliver; and had cohabited with someone not his spouse; constant arrearages in child support payments do not constitute abandonment or desertion under statutory definition, and that was only evidence of desertion in case; there was no evidence that father had ever exposed daughter to illegal or immoral conduct during visits, and at time of hearing father was out of school and held good job; commission of crime alone was insufficient to find him morally unfit to rear and train child, especially where rehabilitation was evident; and, cohabitation by custodial parent in itself is insufficient to modify custody order absent showing of substantial detrimental effect; same rule applies in adoption cases.

       Termination of a parent’s parental rights and support obligations to the parent’s child was appropriate because the chancellor found by clear and convincing evidence that termination was in the best interest of the child as the parent had not visited or communicated with the child in almost five years and had not financially supported the child for more than four years.

   Where a statute is repealed by a new statute which substantially reenacts provisions of the prior statute simultaneously with the repeal, the operation of the original statute is not interrupted by the repeal as to an action which was filed and pending before the effective date of the new legislation. Thus, a suit to terminate the parental rights of a natural father instituted on June 30, 1980, was controlled by the provisions of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c15s93-15-1" target="_self">93-15-1</a></cite>, et seq., although that statute was repealed by §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c15s93-15-1" target="_self">93-15-1</a></cite>01, et seq., which became effective the following day, July 1, 1980. The trial court correctly terminated the parental rights of the natural father on the grounds that he had abandoned the child and was “morally unfit” where the evidence established that he had suggested to the natural mother that she have an abortion, he had refused to contribute to the expense of prenatal care, he had demanded that the natural mother not use his name in applying for welfare assistance, he had terminated his relationship with the natural mother after being informed that she was pregnant, he had left the decision regarding the child’s destiny entirely up to the mother, and a month prior to the baby’s birth, he had advised the mother that he would surrender the child for adoption, and where the evidence also established that the father, a married man separated from his wife, had entered into an adulterous affair with the natural mother, a teenage girl.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Any of the following, if established by clear and convincing evidence, may be grounds for termination of the parent’s parental rights if reunification between the parent and child is not desirable toward obtaining a satisfactory permanency outcome:

     <p>
      The parent has been medically diagnosed by a qualified mental health professional with a severe mental illness or deficiency that is unlikely to change in a reasonable period of time and which, based upon expert testimony or an established pattern of behavior, makes the parent unable or unwilling to provide an adequate permanent home for the child;
     </p>
     <p>
      The parent has been medically diagnosed by a qualified health professional with an extreme physical incapacitation that is unlikely to change in a reasonable period of time and which, based upon expert testimony or an established pattern of behavior, prevents the parent, despite reasonable accommodations, from providing minimally acceptable care for the child;
     </p>
     <p>
      The parent is suffering from habitual alcoholism or other drug addiction and has failed to successfully complete alcohol or drug treatment;
     </p>

     <p>
      The parent has failed to exercise reasonable visitation or communication with the child;
     </p>
     <p>

     </p>
     <p>
      The parent has committed an abusive act for which reasonable efforts to maintain the children in the home would not be required under Section 43-21-603, or a series of physically, mentally, or emotionally abusive incidents, against the child or another child, whether related by consanguinity or affinity or not, making future contacts between the parent and child undesirable; or
     </p>
     <p>
      (i) The parent has been convicted of any of the following offenses against any child:
     </p>
     <p>

      2. Sexual battery of a child under Section 97-3-95(c);
     </p>
     <p>
      3. Touching a child for lustful purposes under Section 97-5-23;

      4. Exploitation of a child under Sections 97-5-31 through 97-5-37;
     </p>
     <p>
      5. Felonious abuse or battery of a child under Section 97-5-39(2);
     </p>
     <p>
      6. Carnal knowledge of a step or adopted child or a child of a cohabitating partner under Section 97-5-41; or
     </p>
     <p>
      7. Human trafficking of a child under Section 97-3-54.1; or
     </p>
     <p>
      The parent has been convicted of:
     </p>
     <p>
      1. Murder or voluntary manslaughter of another child of the parent;
     </p>
     <p>
      2. Aiding, abetting, attempting, conspiring or soliciting to commit murder or voluntary manslaughter of the child or another child of the parent; or
     </p>
     <p>
      3. A felony assault that results in the serious bodily injury to the child or another child of the parent.

       Chancery court erred in terminating a mother’s parental rights on the grould that she had no contact with the child because the father, at time, did not answer his phone and had changed both his phone number and his address without notifying the mother, and the mother spent extended periods of time in drug treatments in an effort to get clean; thus, there was not clear and convincing evidence showing that the mother made no contact with the child for over one year.

       Chancery court erred in terminating a mother’s parental rights because there was not sufficient credible evidence to show that the mother was a drug addict unlikely to change within a reasonable time such that she was unable to assume minimally acceptable care of the child; the record evidenced the mother’s efforts at rehabilitation and attempts to stay in contact with her son.

       Statute does not address a loss of custody, but it deals with a removal from the home; a restriction of custody and visitation does not constitute a removal from the home. Doe v. Doe, — So.3d —, 2017 Miss. App. LEXIS 62 (Miss. Ct. App. Feb. 7, 2017).

       Chancery court erred in terminating a mother’s parental rights because it incorrectly applied the statute in determining its prerequisites had been met; the child had not been removed from the home of his natural parents, but the mother’s custody and visitation were restricted due to substance abuse, the mother made attempts to visit with the child, had entered rehabilitation programs, and had been clean of illegal drugs for six months, and the father and his wife had full custody of the child.

       There is no language indicating retroactive intent, but rather, the effective-date provision for the statutes governing termination of parental rights as amended in the 2016 legislative session specifically states: “This act shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage [approved April 18, 2016]”; accordingly, the court of appeals applied the version of the statute in effect at the time, which, contained the three prerequisites.

       Chancellor’s decision to grant the adoption over a father’s objection was supported by substantial credible evidence because the father’s parents never took any legal action requesting custody of the children, and they made no effort to visit the children for almost six years; accordingly, the chancellor correctly concluded that the only options available were granting the adoption or denying the adoption and keeping the children in the legal custody of the adoptive parents.

       This section should be read as follows: the court shall consider the grounds for termination of parental rights if either (1) the child has been removed from the home of its natural parents and cannot be returned to the home of his natural parents within a reasonable length of time because returning to the home would be damaging to the child or (2a) the parent is unable or unwilling to care for the child, (2b) relatives are not appropriate or are unavailable, and (2c) adoption is in the best interest of the child. Hall v. Jackson Cnty. Dep't of Human Servs. (In the Interest of B.A.H.), 225 So.3d 1220, 2016 Miss. App. LEXIS 37 (Miss. Ct. App. 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       Enumerated grounds for termination of the father’s parental rights under this section were not applicable, because the children remained in the custody of the natural mother, there was no evidence a relative was unavailable to care for the children since the mother sought to retain custody, and there was no evidence that adoption was in the best interest of the children.

       Chancellor erred in denying a mother’s request to terminate the father’s parental rights because, while the chancellor appointed a guardian ad litem (GAL) to represent the child’s interests, the chancellor made no mention of the GAL’s various findings and recommendations, the bulk of which favored terminating the father’s parental rights, and erroneously believed that a pending adoption petition was necessary before termination could be considered. Farthing v. McGee, 158 So.3d 1223, 2015 Miss. App. LEXIS 71 (Miss. Ct. App. 2015).
      </p>
      <p>
       Decision terminating a father’s parental rights was proper, as testimony of the parties and witnesses, as well as a guardian ad litem’s report and recommendation, supported a finding that the mother proved at least one of the grounds enumerated in the termination statute by clear and convincing evidence; the father acknowledged that the father had suffered from an alcohol addiction since 2005.

Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c15s93-15-103" target="_self">93-15-103</a></cite>, the former parents’ action failed because no evidence existed to support the adoptive parents’ claims; the guardian ad litem testified there was no evidence the adoptive parent was unfit.

       In a proceeding by a natural mother and a stepfather to terminate the parental rights of the natural father and to adopt the child at issue, an incident of alleged abuse of the mother by the natural father was not admissible as the incident did not involve the child.

      </p>
      <p>
       Failure to appoint guardian ad litem for child was reversible error, even though proceeding was referred to as adoption rather than for termination of parental rights, as complaint for adoption specifically alleged that natural father had abandoned child under statutory provision dealing with termination of parental rights for unfit parents; adoption and termination of parental rights proceedings were not separable under the circumstances and appointment of guardian ad litem was mandatory.

       In a proceeding for termination of parental rights and adoption, the trial court properly refused to hear the natural mother’s petition for writ of habeas corpus in which she alleged that a prior court order awarding custody of the children to their aunt was void, which would be construed as an amendment to the natural mother’s original answer, where the mother sought to amend her pleading a mere 2 days before trial. Since the adoption proceeding not only determined the best interests of the children, but also who should have custody, there was no need for the trial court to address the habeas application; by addressing and granting the petition for adoption, the trial court necessarily adjudicated custody anew.

       Chancellor properly terminated a father’s parental rights because he had not seen his daughter in three years, had not made any serious efforts to do so, failed to pay any child support for approximately two years, and only began to pay once the mother filed her termination action.

      <p>
       There was credible proof to support the chancellor’s decision to terminate a mother’s parental rights pursuant to this section. The chancellor specifically found that the mother was a drug addict and was unlikely to change in the foreseeable future, was unwilling to care for her children because of her drug addiction, and had repeatedly failed to comply with court orders regarding her rehabilitation, including entering a drug and alcohol rehabilitation program.

       Termination of a parent’s parental rights and support obligations to the parent’s child was appropriate because the chancellor found by clear and convincing evidence that termination was in the best interest of the child as the parent had not visited or communicated with the child in almost five years and had not financially supported her for more than four years.

       In evaluating custody, the trial court focused on the father’s desire to have custody of the child, but the undisputed record revealed that for two and a half years, the father had no contact with the child; further, the father provided no financial support, nor did he send any birthday or Christmas cards or gifts to the child. As a matter of law the father’s actions (or lack thereof) during the two and a half years before the mother’s death constituted desertion; because the evidence of desertion was clear, the trial court erred in awarding custody to the natural father without an on-the-record analysis of the child’s best interests utilizing the Albright factors.

   ) which requires that an adjudication of neglect be made specifically with respect to the parent whose rights are being terminated. Indeed, the language of the neglect statute defines a “neglected child” – not a “neglecting parent” – and defines a “neglected child” in such a way that both parents have the responsibility to insure that a child is not being neglected, regardless of who the custodial parent is; in other words, if a child is being neglected by the custodial parent, that child is also being neglected by the non-custodial parent if that parent fails to remedy the situation when he or she is able to do so.

   Minor child could be found neglected, regardless of who the custodial parent was, if the non-custodial parent failed to remedy the situation when he or she was able to do so, and a non-custodial father, knowing that the children’s mother opposed taking one of the children to see a doctor, allowed the child to remain with the mother, untreated, for 10 additional days before taking the child back to see a doctor and because of that delay, the child’s bones began healing incorrectly. In addition to the medical neglect, the father was undoubtedly aware of the living conditions that his children were forced to endure, as he had lived at the very same residence in the past, he had undoubtedly witnessed the continuing nature of the living conditions when he came for his regular visits with the children, and according to the language of the “neglected child” statute, Miss.

Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c15s93-15-103ol13e" target="_self">93-15-103(3)(e)</a></cite> because the mother’s ongoing behavior of choosing to remain on runaway status prevented her from maintaining a bond with the child; it was impossible to return the child to her custody when she avoided the Department of Human Services.

       Even though the trial court erred in finding that the mother abandoned her child, since the record did not show that she had manifested her severance of all ties with the child, the error was harmless as the trial court properly found parental rights could be terminated on other proper statutory grounds. The record reflected that the mother had not been totally absent from the child’s life for any significant period of time, as she continually exercised her visitation rights.

       Trial court erred in terminating father’s parental rights where there was testimony that the father communicated with the children and exercised his visitation rights up to the time of his incarceration. Furthermore, there was an effort by him to have his mother granted visitation rights in which he would have been able to have contact with his children while she had them; therefore, the father did not abandon his children once he was incarcerated.

       Clear and convincing evidence did not establish abandonment of a child by his mother where no evidence, either pro or con, was presented concerning any parental contributions the mother made to the rearing of the child, either in the form of monetary support or in the form of basic nurturance, and there were no specific questions put to the witnesses on the ground of abandonment.

       The Court of Appeals did not err when it reversed the chancery court’s termination of a mother’s parental rights because the Court of Appeals, while acknowledging that there had been a substantial erosion of the relationship between the mother and her children and that the parent-child relationship in question was not a good one, found that the substantial burden of proof necessary for termination had not been met.

       Evidence did not establish that a father had abandoned his child without contact for a year; even though the father’s contacts with the child were minimal, the evidence showed that the father did maintain ties to the child and did not relinquish all parental claims to the child.

       The natural mother and stepfather failed to establish that the natural father deserted or abandoned the child at issue where there was conflicting evidence as to how long the natural father went without seeing his child, and the natural father testified that he saw the child on several occasions through his mother and by visiting her secretly at her babysitters, that he sent a letter with a poem, and that he bought Christmas gifts that he had attempted to give to the child.

       The evidence was insufficient to show a settled purpose of the natural father to forego all parental rights and relinquish all parental claim to the minor child where, inter alia, he visited his daughter four or five times since the parties divorced and there was continued contact through frequent telephone calls.

      <p>
       The evidence was sufficient to support a finding that a mother had abandoned and deserted her minor children, where the mother had only seen the children 2 times between January of 1986 when she left them with their father and the time of the trial in January of 1990, the mother did not contribute any financial assistance during that time, the mother did not send birthday cards or Christmas gifts to the children and ignored other events in the children’s lives, the children thought of and referred to their aunt, with whom they were living, as their mother, and though the older child knew who the mother was when she saw her, the younger child did not know the mother at all as the mother had left when the younger child was 6 months old.

       Chancellor was not manifestly in error when he found neither abandonment nor such immoral conduct as to make natural father of child unfit, where: father had been behind in child support payments; had been arrested for possession of marijuana with intent to deliver; and had cohabited with someone not his spouse; constant arrearages in child support payments do not constitute abandonment or desertion under statutory definition, and that was only evidence of desertion in case; there was no evidence that father had ever exposed daughter to illegal or immoral conduct during visits, and at time of hearing father was out of school and held good job; commission of crime alone was insufficient to find him morally unfit to rear and train child, especially where rehabilitation was evident; and, cohabitation by custodial parent in itself is insufficient to modify custody order absent showing of substantial detrimental effect; same rule applies in adoption cases.

       There was sufficient proof that there had been a substantial erosion of the relationship between the mother and her children that was caused at least in part by the mother’s actions where because of own choices she was unable to regain custody within a reasonable period of time, and this was especially damaging because the children were infants when they were placed in foster care and they now viewed their foster families as their real families, and there was not observable bond between the mother and her children.

       Termination of a parent’s parental rights and support obligations to the parent’s child was appropriate because the chancellor found by clear and convincing evidence that termination was in the best interest of the child as there had been a substantial erosion of the relationship between the parent and the child, which was caused at least in part by the parent’s serious neglect, prolonged and unreasonable absence, and unreasonable failure to visit or communicate.

After the mother breached an agreement with the DHS by failing to attend parenting and counseling classes, and continued to have contact with her husband after his conviction, there was a substantial erosion of the relationship between the mother and the children, constituting grounds for termination of her parental rights pursuant to Miss.

       Evidence supported a determination that there had been a substantial erosion of the parent-child relationship, notwithstanding the parents’ contention that they had continuously sought and exercised visitation, but were restricted by court order to only limited, supervised visitation, where the court found (1) that this was the worst case of child abuse ever to pass before his bench, (2) that the child had bonded with her foster parents and considered them to be her parents, and (3) that it would be detrimental for the child to be removed from her foster parents’ care.

       Evidence was insufficient to support the termination of a mother’s parental rights on the ground of a substantial erosion of the relationship between her and the minor children caused, at least in part, by her serious neglect, abuse, prolonged and unreasonable absence or unreasonable failure to visit or communicate with the minor children; although her visits with her children were very infrequent, it was not shown that she wished to relinquish all parental claims to the children constituting an abandonment of her children, and her conduct did not imply a conscious disregard of all the obligations owed by a parent to the child, leading to the destruction of the parent-child relationship.

       The evidence was sufficient to support a finding of a “substantial erosion of the relationship” between a mother, who was incarcerated for murder and armed robbery, and 2 of her children, where a social worker testified that there was indifference at best on the part of the children towards the mother, a psychologist concurred in this opinion, one of the children testified that he had not seen his mother for 5 years though he had written to her and talked with her on the phone, he seemed indifferent to the possibility that his mother’s parental rights might be terminated and he seemed anxious to be adopted by someone, and the other child seemed to have no memory of her mother as she was 2 years old when they were separated.

       The termination of a mother’s parental rights, in part because of her criminal acts and resulting imprisonment, did not amount to cruel and unusual punishment since the termination of her parental rights was a separate matter from that of her criminal conviction, and the action for termination of parental rights was not brought to further punish the mother, but was a reasonable exercise of the State’s legitimate interest in providing for the welfare of the children.

The trial court correctly terminated the parental rights of the natural father on the grounds that he had abandoned the child and was “morally unfit” where the evidence established that he had suggested to the natural mother that she have an abortion, he had refused to contribute to the expense of prenatal care, he had demanded that the natural mother not use his name in applying for welfare assistance, he had terminated his relationship with the natural mother after being informed that she was pregnant, he had left the decision regarding the child’s destiny entirely up to the mother, and a month prior to the baby’s birth, he had advised the mother that he would surrender the child for adoption, and where the evidence also established that the father, a married man separated from his wife, had entered into an adulterous affair with the natural mother, a teenage girl.

   Termination of the mother’s parental rights was inappropriate because, although her mental illness affected her ability to care for her child, there was no clear and convincing evidence proving that the mother’s condition made her unable to assume minimally, acceptable care of the child under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c15s93-15-103ol13ei" target="_self">93-15-103(3)(e)(i)</a></cite>.

       Substantial evidence supported the determination that an 18-month-old child was subjected to a series of abusive incidents where the evidence showed that she was intentionally burned with hot water, that medical treatment was withheld until her condition deteriorated to the point that a terrible odor emitted from her body due to serious infection, and that she suffered from malnutrition, notwithstanding the parents’ contention that the burn was caused by accident, that the mother genuinely believed that the child was healing, and that failure to properly nourish the child was a by-product of doctor’s orders that the child be fed only small amounts of food at frequent intervals to keep her from vomiting.

       Termination of parental rights was appropriate where both parents refused to acknowledge the father’s sexual abuse of the children at issue, the father failed to obtain counseling though the court-ordered program, and the mother failed to establish her own home independent of the father and work with the department of human services for the return of the children.

       In light of the fact that the Family Court ordered counseling on the theory that the natural parents could rehabilitate themselves from their abusive conduct, the Family Court was not manifestly erroneous in terminating their parental rights for their failure to acknowledge their abuse and to participate in counseling.

       Mother’s parental rights were properly terminated because, even with the extended deadline granted by the trial court, the mother failed to make progress on the terms of a service agreement, and because of the mother’s inability to achieve reunification within a reasonable amount of time, continued drug use, and failure to eliminate identified harmful behaviors, and the substantial erosion of the parent/child relationship. The termination also served the children’s best interests as they had bonded and were doing well with their foster family. C.S.H. v. Lowndes Cty. Dep't of Human Servs., 246 So.3d 908, 2018 Miss. App. LEXIS 212 (Miss. Ct. App. 2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       Termination of the mother’s and the father’s parental rights was proper because the mother had been responsible for a series of abusive incidents concerning both children as she had repeatedly exposed the children to her drug lifestyle and neglected them as a result; both children had been with a Christian group home for at least one year and the parents had failed to exercise reasonable visitation with the children; the parents exhibited ongoing behavior that prevented placing the children back home; and there had been a substantial erosion of the relationship between the parents and the children.

      <p>
       Termination of the mother’s and the father’s parental rights was proper as they removed the children from their home by placing them in the physical custody of a Christian group home; when an individual from the group home went to pick up one of the children to return her to the group home, the parent’s house was in disrepair and there was dog feces throughout the house; the guardian ad litem (GAL) described the home as being in a decrepit condition and that it would likely be unapproved for placement of children by any licensed agency; the GAL stated that the family was living in abject poverty, without finances to provide for the children; and ample evidence was presented to show adoption would be in the best interest of the children.

       Chancellor’s findings in support of a termination of parental rights were properly made by clear and convincing evidence because the chancellor’s written order terminating parental rights stated the findings were based on clear and convincing evidence.

      </p>
      <p>
       Termination of a parent’s parental rights and support obligations to the parent’s child was appropriate because the chancellor found by clear and convincing evidence that termination was in the best interest of the child as the parent had not visited or communicated with the child in almost five years and had not financially supported the child for more than four years. Barnes v. McGee, 178 So.3d 801, 2013 Miss. App. LEXIS 706 (Miss. Ct. App. 2013).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Grounds for termination of parental rights were not established by clear and convincing evidence because, under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c15s93-15-109" target="_self">93-15-109</a></cite>, the youth court erred in failing to consider all the relevant evidence; under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c15s93-15-103ol13h" target="_self">93-15-103(3)(h)</a></cite>, the prior adjudication of neglect did not determine that reunification was not in children’s best interests.

      </p>
      <p>
       A mother had her child taken out of her custody previously, but the adjudication of neglect was not enough to sober the mother because similar incidents continued to occur, and the child was formally adjudicated neglected twice and one time the parties agreed to a consent judgment under the agreement that the mother had a drug problem that had to be addressed; therefore, the youth court’s adjudication of neglect was supported by clear and convincing evidence and termination of her parental rights was appropriate.

    Court discretion not to terminate.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the court may exercise its discretion not to terminate the parent’s parental rights in a proceeding under this chapter if the child’s safety and welfare will not be compromised or endangered and terminating the parent’s parental right is not in the child’s best interests based on one or more of the following factors:
     </p>
     <p>
      The Department of Child Protection Services has documented compelling and extraordinary reasons why terminating the parent’s parental rights would not be in the child’s best interests;
     </p>
     <p>
      There is a likelihood that continuing reasonable efforts for achieving reunification will be successful;
     </p>
     <p>
      Terminating the parent’s parental rights would inappropriately relieve the parent of the parent’s financial or support obligations to the child; or
     </p>
     <p>
      The child is being cared for by the other parent, or a relative, guardian, or custodian, in a residence not occupied by the abusive or neglectful parent and terminating the parent’s parental rights would not expedite the process for obtaining a satisfactory permanency outcome.

   Even where a chancellor finds one or more grounds which justify termination of parental rights, nothing in the law requires the chancellor to do so; rather, Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c15s93-15-109" target="_self">93-15-109</a></cite> provides that if the chancellor is satisfied by clear and convincing proof that grounds justifying termination of parental rights exist then the court may terminate all the parental rights of the parent or parents.

     <p>
      In any proceeding under this chapter, where the court knows or has reason to know that an Indian child is involved, the court must comply with the Indian Child Welfare Act (25 USCS Section 1901 et seq.) in regard to notice, appointment of counsel, examination of reports or other documents, remedial services and rehabilitation programs, and other protections the act provides. Additionally, no termination of parental rights may be ordered in the proceeding in the absence of a determination, supported by evidence beyond a reasonable doubt, including testimony of qualified expert witnesses, that the continued custody of the Indian child by the parent is likely to result in serious emotional or physical damage to the Indian child.

       Under common law principles, there were no legal rights of grandparents for visitation privileges with their grandchildren where the parents did not permit such communication. Olson v. Flinn, 484 So. 2d 1015, 1986 Miss. LEXIS 2417 (Miss. 1986).

       Whenever a court of this state enters a decree or order awarding custody of a minor child to one (1) of the parents of the child or terminating the parental rights of one (1) of the parents of a minor child, or whenever one (1) of the parents of a minor child dies, either parent of the child’s parents may petition the court in which the decree or order was rendered or, in the case of the death of a parent, petition the chancery court in the county in which the child resides, and seek visitation rights with the child.
      </li>
      <li id="t93c16s93-16-3ol12">
       Any grandparent who is not authorized to petition for visitation rights pursuant to subsection (1) of this section may petition the chancery court and seek visitation rights with his or her grandchild, and the court may grant visitation rights to the grandparent, provided the court finds:

        <li id="t93c16s93-16-3ol12a">
         That the grandparent of the child had established a viable relationship with the child and the parent or custodian of the child unreasonably denied the grandparent visitation rights with the child; and

       For purposes of subsection (2) of this section, the term “viable relationship” means a relationship in which the grandparents or either of them have voluntarily and in good faith supported the child financially in whole or in part for a period of not less than six (6) months before filing any petition for visitation rights with the child, the grandparents have had frequent visitation including occasional overnight visitation with said child for a period of not less than one (1) year, or the child has been cared for by the grandparents or either of them over a significant period of time during the time the parent has been in jail or on military duty that necessitates the absence of the parent from the home.

Upon a showing of financial hardship for the parents, the court shall on motion of the parent or parents direct the grandparents to pay reasonable attorney’s fees to the parent or parents at any time, including before a hearing, without regard to the outcome of the petition.

      <p>
       Absent a showing that the child’s parents had unreasonably withheld visitation, there was no basis for a court to order grandparent visitation, and thus the grandmother’s argument that she was entitled to additional visitation was without merit. Patrick v. Boyd, 198 So.3d 436, 2016 Miss. App. LEXIS 174 (Miss. Ct. App. 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section does not include the term “great-grandparent.” Therefore, two great-grandparents lacked standing and should not have been awarded visitation rights because they were not “grandparents” within the meaning of this section. The appellate court lacked authority to add words or meaning to a statute that was plain on its face. Lott v. Alexander, 134 So.3d 369, 2014 Miss. App. LEXIS 127 (Miss. Ct. App. 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       Right to grandparent visitation is purely statutory and may only be considered if the grandparent meets certain statutory criteria, and the criteria in Mississippi’s grandparent-visitation statute are important; by placing limitations on who may petition for visitation, the criteria keep a grandparent’s statutory right to visitation from impermissibly encroaching on the parents’ rights to rear their children as they see fit. Aydelott v. Quartaro, 124 So.3d 97, 2013 Miss. App. LEXIS 327 (Miss. Ct. App. 2013).
      </p>
      <p>
       Broadening the limiting criterion of a “viable relationship” to grandparents who wish they had a viable relationship would render the grandparent-visitation statute unconstitutional because it would permit any grandparent to petition for visitation and not just those who meet the narrow circumstances under the statute. Aydelott v. Quartaro, 124 So.3d 97, 2013 Miss. App. LEXIS 327 (Miss. Ct. App. 2013).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because the chancellor did not give the grandparent-visitation statute the necessary narrower reading, his explicit finding of a viable relationship and implicit finding of unreasonable denial of visitation failed to pass constitutional muster; the chancellor erred in weighing the grandparents’ wishes into whether there was a viable relationship and never explicitly found the parents had unreasonably denied the grandparents visitation. Aydelott v. Quartaro, 124 So.3d 97, 2013 Miss. App. LEXIS 327 (Miss. Ct. App. 2013).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancellor erred in awarding grandparents visitation because they failed to show they met the criterion of the establishment of a viable relationship with their granddaughters; the chancellor erred in ignoring the grandparents’ admissions and permitting contradictory testimony that they had contributed financially and had frequently visited the grandchildren because they never moved for withdrawal or amendment of their admissions. Aydelott v. Quartaro, 124 So.3d 97, 2013 Miss. App. LEXIS 327 (Miss. Ct. App. 2013).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Chancellor did not err in terminating a paternal grandfather’s visitation with his 13-year-old grandchild under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c16s93-16-3ol11" target="_self">93-16-3(1)</a></cite> because even though the child’s mother was the cause of the child’s negative feelings toward the grandfather, it was in the child’s best interest to cease visitation; the child was unhappy with the forced visitation and would rather visit him by choice. Vinson v. Vidal, 28 So.3d 614, 2009 Miss. App. LEXIS 352 (Miss. Ct. App. 2009), cert. denied, 27 So.3d 404, 2010 Miss. LEXIS 88 (Miss. 2010).
      </p>
      <p>
       Grandmother’s motion to intervene in a custody case to assert visitation rights was properly denied because she had no statutory right to visitation at the time the motion was made, as: (1) the chancery court had not awarded custody of the children to one parent; and (2) the grandmother offered no facts in her motion or at the hearing to demonstrate she had a viable relationship with the children and that she was being unreasonably denied visitation. D.C. v. D.C., 2008 Miss. LEXIS 124 (Miss. Feb. 28, 2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Grandmother who sought to have parent’s parental rights terminated failed to prove abandonment or any of the grounds under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c15s93-15-103" target="_self">93-15-103</a></cite>, and the appellate court was not inclined to terminate a parent’s rights merely because the mother happened to work as a stripper. Further, where the chancellor found that the grandmother had frequent visitation, including overnight visitation, with the children, and that the parents had not unreasonably withheld visitation, given concerns about the grandmother’s boyfriend, the chancellor properly declined to impose court-ordered visitation. Hillman v. Vance, 910 So. 2d 43, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 34 (Miss. Ct. App. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Trial court erred in granting visitation to the child’s paternal grandparents, as the grandparents did not petition for visitation as required in Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c16s93-16-3" target="_self">93-16-3</a></cite> and were never parties to the litigation. Givens v. Nicholson, 878 So. 2d 1073, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 703 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       The statute is constitutional as the factors that are required to be considered before awarding visitation under the statute specifically prohibit a chancellor from ordering visitation that would interfere with a parent’s right to rear his or her children. Zeman v. Stanford, 789 So. 2d 798, 2001 Miss. LEXIS 130 (Miss. 2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (1) was the proper basis for an award of visitation rights to the maternal grandparents of the children where the father had been awarded sole custody of the children. Zeman v. Stanford, 789 So. 2d 798, 2001 Miss. LEXIS 130 (Miss. 2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       Paternal grandparents of child had statutory right to visitation of child following father’s death. Martin v. Coop, 693 So. 2d 912, 1997 Miss. LEXIS 169 (Miss. 1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       Grandparent visitation statute, under which grandparents have statutory right to visitation after parent who is their child has died, does not deprive parents of their right to raise children by determining care, custody, and management of child, and thus does not violate due process clause. Martin v. Coop, 693 So. 2d 912, 1997 Miss. LEXIS 169 (Miss. 1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       Order granting paternal grandparents of child visitation totaling 86 days per year in even-numbered years and 81 days per year in odd-numbered years following death of child’s father was abuse of discretion, as grandparents had improperly been awarded same visitation as would have been awarded to noncustodial parent. Martin v. Coop, 693 So. 2d 912, 1997 Miss. LEXIS 169 (Miss. 1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       While grandparents have statutory right to visitation with child after death of parent who is child of grandparents, grandparents do not stand in lieu of or in shoes of deceased parent, and visitation granted to grandparents should not be equivalent to that which would be granted to noncustodial parent unless circumstances overwhelmingly dictate that it should be. Martin v. Coop, 693 So. 2d 912, 1997 Miss. LEXIS 169 (Miss. 1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       In determining amount of child visitation to which grandparents are entitled following death of parent who is child of grandparents, best interest of child must be polestar consideration, and visitation should be less than that which would be awarded to noncustodial parent, unless circumstances overwhelming dictate that that amount of visitation is in best interest of child, and that it would be harmful to child not to grant it. Martin v. Coop, 693 So. 2d 912, 1997 Miss. LEXIS 169 (Miss. 1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       Factors to be considered by chancery court in determining grandparent visitation, with no one factor being weighed more heavily, include (1) amount of disruption extensive visitation will have on grandchild’s life, (2) suitability of grandparents’ home with respect to amount of supervision received by grandchild, (3) age of grandchild, (4) age and physical and mental health of grandparents, (5) emotional ties between grandparents and grandchild, (6) moral fitness of grandparents, (7) distance of grandparents’ home from grandchild’s home, (8) any undermining of parent’s general discipline of grandchild, (9) employment of grandparents and responsibilities associated with it, and (10) willingness of grandparents to accept that rearing of child is parent’s responsibility and that parent’s manner of childrearing is not to be interfered with. Martin v. Coop, 693 So. 2d 912, 1997 Miss. LEXIS 169 (Miss. 1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       Substantial basis for Chancellor’s finding of viable relationship between minor child and his paternal grandparents, supporting grandparents’ petition for visitation rights following parents’ divorce, was provided by evidence that grandparents gave financial support to parents before parents’ separation through use of grandparents’ gas credit card and monetary support, and that grandparents regularly visited child both before and after parents’ separation. Settle v. Galloway, 682 So. 2d 1032, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 573 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Substantial basis for Chancellor’s finding that granting visitation rights to minor child’s paternal grandparents was in child’s best interest, supporting grandparents’ petition for visitation rights following parents’ divorce, was provided by evidence that child would have little exposure to his father, who was stationed away from home as member of United States Navy, but for child’s contact with grandparents, who exchanged videotapes with father. Settle v. Galloway, 682 So. 2d 1032, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 573 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Granting paternal grandparents right to every-other-weekend visitation with their grandchild was not excessive, where primary basis was father’s inability to exercise his parental visitation rights due to his being stationed away from home as member of United States Navy, and where the right was to be concurrent with any visitation exercised by father. Settle v. Galloway, 682 So. 2d 1032, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 573 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Natural grandparents have no common-law right of visitation with their grandchildren; such right must come from legislative enactment. Settle v. Galloway, 682 So. 2d 1032, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 573 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Natural grandparents’ statutory right to visit their grandchildren is not as comprehensive as parents’ visitation rights. Settle v. Galloway, 682 So. 2d 1032, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 573 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Grandparents Visitation Rights Act did not apply to a maternal grandmother where the grandchildren had been adopted by their paternal grandmother, since the adoption terminated the parental rights of the children’s father and the paternal grandmother was not a parent of the children when she adopted them. Whatever rights to visitation that the maternal grandmother may have acquired under the Grandparents Visitation Rights Act were terminated by the decree of adoption. Muse v. Hutchins, 559 So. 2d 1031, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 194 (Miss. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       The grandparents’ visitation statute envisions granting visitation rights to grandparents following adoption proceedings as well as proceedings limited purely to terminating parental rights. Hill v. Smith, 558 So. 2d 854 (Miss. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       Natural grandparents have no common-law “right” of visitation with their grandchildren. Such right, if any, must come from a legislative enactment. Hill v. Smith, 558 So. 2d 854 (Miss. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       The paternal grandparents of a child, who was adopted by the maternal grandparents, were excluded under the grandparents’ visitation statute from seeking visitation rights with the child because neither of the legal adoptive parents was a natural parent of the child. Neither the chancery court nor the Supreme Court on its own has the authority to bestow visitation rights upon a grandparent. Hill v. Smith, 558 So. 2d 854 (Miss. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>

       <p>
   By enacting Mississippi Code §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c16s93-16-3" target="_self">93-16-3</a></cite> the legislature determined that the best interest of the child lies in termination of natural grandparents’ visitation rights upon the child becoming adopted.

      </p>
      <p>
       The subsequent adoption of a child by a stepfather terminates the visitation rights of a paternal grandparent who had previously petitioned for, but had not yet obtained, court ordered visitation rights. Olson v. Flinn, 484 So. 2d 1015, 1986 Miss. LEXIS 2417 (Miss. 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       An adoption of a child by a step-parent after the death of one of the natural parents terminates visitation rights of natural grandparents, except as to the natural parent who is the spouse of the adopting parent. Olson v. Flinn, 484 So. 2d 1015, 1986 Miss. LEXIS 2417 (Miss. 1986).

       There was no abuse of discretion by the chancellor in awarding attorney’s fees to parents in a grandmother’s action seeking grandparent visitation with her granddaughter because the parents were financially stressed due to the grandparent-visitation action and resulting attorney’s fees. Vermillion v. Perkett, — So.3d —, 2019 Miss. App. LEXIS 101 (Miss. Ct. App. Mar. 19, 2019), cert. denied, — So.3d —, 2019 Miss. LEXIS 317 (Miss. Sept. 5, 2019).

Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c16s93-16-3ol14" target="_self">93-16-3(4)</a></cite> after awarding visitation to a paternal grandmother because, although the mother stated that she was unemployed, her present husband testified that she had been a stay-at-home mom for the majority of their marriage. Solomon v. Robertson, 980 So. 2d 319, 2008 Miss. App. LEXIS 225 (Miss. Ct. App. 2008).

       In a case involving grandparent visitation, adoptive parents were not entitled to recover attorney’s fees because they offered no evidence tending to show any financial hardship. Woodell v. Parker, 860 So. 2d 781, 2003 Miss. LEXIS 752 (Miss. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       The chancellor’s decision not to award attorney fees to the parent in an action for grandparent visitation was not an abuse of discretion where the father earned a gross pay of over $5,000 per month and lived in a home worth in excess of $100,000, notwithstanding the father’s assertion that he was supporting a pregnant wife, with five children living in his home, that he was working two jobs to make ends meet, and that he was receiving no financial assistance from the natural mother.

       Chancery court properly granted the grandparents visitation to their deceased son’s children because, while the appellate court erred by instructing the chancellor to consider the best interest of the children only in the context of the amount of visitation after finding an entitlement to grandparent visitation, the chancellor, once determining that grandparent visitation was appropriate and in the children’s best interests, applied and scrupulously weighed the case-law factors to determine the appropriate visitations that the grandparents should exercise with the children, carefully analyzed the statute, thereby performing the correct analytical process and properly applying the right procedural, evidentiary, and statutory principles. Smith v. Martin, 222 So.3d 255, 2017 Miss. LEXIS 151 (Miss. 2017).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancery court properly awarded visitation of minor children to their paternal grandmother, when both children were wards of their maternal grandparents, who were appointed to children’s co-guardians, because the maternal grandparents unreasonably denied visitation to the grandparent, the paternal grandparent voluntarily and in good faith supported the child financially and had frequent, including overnight, visitation with the children, and the award of visitation was in the children’s best interest. Bolivar v. Waltman, 194 So.3d 889, 2016 Miss. App. LEXIS 371 (Miss. Ct. App. 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancellor did not abuse the chancellor’s discretion by awarding grandparent visitation to grandparents after the death of one of the children’s parents and the remarriage of the children’s other parent, because substantial credible evidence supported the chancellor’s finding that visitation was in the children’s best interests. The chancellor did not exceed the chancellor’s authority by ordering the parent and the parent’s spouse, who had adopted the children, to participate in family counseling to facilitate a smooth visitation experience. Smith v. Martin, 202 So.3d 263, 2016 Miss. App. LEXIS 110 (Miss. Ct. App. 2016), aff'd, 222 So.3d 255, 2017 Miss. LEXIS 151 (Miss. 2017).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancellor properly granted visitation to a child’s maternal grandparents because the chancellor, after considering the statutory factors and Martin v. Coop, 693 So. 2d 912, 916 (Miss. 1997), found, inter alia, that the grandparents had a close, loving, and viable relationship with the grandchild, had provided her some financial support, the grandchild visited them grandparents, at times staying overnight, awarding visitation would not disrupt the grandchild’s life or undermine the father’s parenting or discipline of his daughter, and the amount of visitation awarded–47 days a year–was not excessive. Eaves v. Gatlin, 194 So.3d 171, 2015 Miss. App. LEXIS 624 (Miss. Ct. App. 2015), cert. denied, 202 So.3d 1268, 2016 Miss. LEXIS 271 (Miss. 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancellor did not err by finding that visitation with the grandmother was in the child’s best interest where the evidence showed that the child was four, the grandmother was in good health and only 50 years old, they likely shared emotional ties, the grandmother lived only 10 miles from the child, the grandmother had worked in steady employment for the previous 10 years and rarely worked weekends, the chancellor found the evidence was insufficient to show that the grandmother was morally unfit, and she testified she would uphold the parents’ reasonable discipline of the child and would not interfere with their parenting. Lofton v. Lofton, 176 So.3d 1184, 2015 Miss. App. LEXIS 537 (Miss. Ct. App. 2015).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence showed that the parents unreasonably denied their child’s grandmother visitation where the mother changed her phone number and ceased communication, the grandmother was banished from the parents’ apartment complex, and the grandmother testified that whenever she saw the child in town she was prevented from approaching her. Lofton v. Lofton, 176 So.3d 1184, 2015 Miss. App. LEXIS 537 (Miss. Ct. App. 2015).
      </p>
      <p>
       It was within a chancellor’s discretion to award greater than usual grandparent visitation because the chancellor found that the grandparents had participated extensively in the life of their late son’s child from when the child was approximately four and a half months old and the child’s mother had a history of substance abuse, had neglected her children, and had surrendered the child, along with her two other illegitimate children, to her mother when she sought treatment for substance abuse.

       Chancellor did not err in awarding visitation rights to a grandmother because the chancellor had the discretion to award the visitation rights, and the chancellor thoroughly analyzed the appropriate factors in making his decision.

      </p>
      <p>
       Chancery court owes no deference to the opinion of adoptive parents that visitation with paternal grandparents is not in the best interest of a minor child, and there is no requirement of a finding that a custodial parent is unfit before such visitation is proper; therefore, the chancery court properly awarded visitation to grandparents after examining the 10 applicable factors and finding that the child lived near the grandparents, the grandparents were in good health, one of the grandparents was at home to watch the child, and the grandparents had an established relationship with the child before visitation was denied.

       Chancellor did not err in granting parents a directed verdict because a grandmother failed to meet her burden of showing she had established a viable relationship with her grandchild; counsel for the grandmother admitted that they could not establish a viable relationship because a viable relationship was defined as six months, and it was impossible to comply.

   Paternal grandmother had standing to petition for visitation with her grandchild under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c16s93-16-7" target="_self">93-16-7</a></cite>; the paternal grandmother and the parents were related to the child by blood prior to her adoption and the Legislature would not have given a natural grandparent standing to seek visitation if it considered natural grandparents to be strangers and intended for their visitation rights to be terminated.

      </p>
      <p>
       The Grandparents Visitation Rights Act did not apply to a maternal grandmother where the grandchildren had been adopted by their paternal grandmother, since the adoption terminated the parental rights of the children’s father and the paternal grandmother was not a parent of the children when she adopted them. Whatever rights to visitation that the maternal grandmother may have acquired under the Grandparents Visitation Rights Act were terminated by the decree of adoption. Muse v. Hutchins, 559 So. 2d 1031, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 194 (Miss. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       The grandparents’ visitation statute envisions granting visitation rights to grandparents following adoption proceedings as well as proceedings limited purely to terminating parental rights. Hill v. Smith, 558 So. 2d 854 (Miss. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       The paternal grandparents of a child, who was adopted by the maternal grandparents, were excluded under the grandparents’ visitation statute from seeking visitation rights with the child because neither of the legal adoptive parents was a natural parent of the child. Neither the chancery court nor the Supreme Court on its own has the authority to bestow visitation rights upon a grandparent. Hill v. Smith, 558 So. 2d 854 (Miss. 1990).

   Congress’s intended meaning of “domicile” under Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 (ICWA) to be matter of uniform federal law and not matter of individual state law, although it is permissible to borrow state common-law principles to extent they are not inconsistent with objectives of congressional scheme; under general common-law principles, which indicate that domicile of illegitimate children follows that of mother, children in question were domiciled on reservation within meaning of relevant ICWA provisions, fact that the children were voluntarily surrendered by mother does not change result, because ICWA was intended in part to protect interests of the Indian community in retaining its children within its society, and tribal jurisdiction under ICWA thus not meant to be defeated by actions of individual members; and thus Chancery Court lacked jurisdiction over adoptions and its decree would be vacated.

   Failure to give putative father notice of pending adoption proceedings did not deny him due process, despite the fact that the state had actual notice of his existence and whereabouts, where putative father had never established any custodial, personal or financial relationship with the child and had not taken advantage of statutory procedure by which he would have acquired the right to receive notice of the adoption, which involved mailing a postcard to the putative father registry.

   The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment is violated by a state’s statutory procedure whereby an unwed father is presumed to be unfit to raise his illegitimate children upon their mother’s death, and may be deprived of the custody of his children, without a hearing as to his fitness, by the state’s institution of dependency proceedings to declare the children wards of the state, whereas a hearing is extended to all other parents whose custody of their children is challenged.

       Chancellor had authority to rule on a father’s petition to set aside an adoption based on fraud upon the court because the petition was an independent action; the father was not trying to establish his right to notice or object to ongoing adoption proceedings, but he was arguing to set aside a final adoption obtained through fraud. Doe v. Smith, 200 So.3d 1028, 2016 Miss. LEXIS 397 (Miss. 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       When consent for a supposedly “uncontested” adoption is gained by intentionally concealing the identity of a known natural parent from the chancellor, a fraud is perpetrated upon the court; an intentional fraud aimed solely to circumvent a natural parent’s statutorily mandated consent to an adoption undermines the effective administration of justice. Doe v. Smith, 200 So.3d 1028, 2016 Miss. LEXIS 397 (Miss. 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       It was within the chancellor’s discretion to set aside an adoption based on the mother’s fraud because the heart of the mother’s actions was designed to deceive the court by lying about and omitting material facts to trick the court into granting a supposed uncontested adoption; the mother knew who the child’s father was, and she withheld the information from the court and all parties involved.

   While it was undisputed that a child’s biological father did not receive formal notice of the adoption of his son, this did not void the adoption of the son as, even if the father had received notice, he did not meet the standard of demonstrating a full commitment to the responsibilities of parenthood under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c17s93-17-5ol13" target="_self">93-17-5(3)</a></cite>, which would have allowed him, as an unwed father, to object to the adoption. There was no evidence that the father provided support for the child, that he tried to visit with the child, or that he was now willing and able to assume physical care for the child.

       Whether a natural parent’s consent to adoption may be withdrawn must be determined on a case-by-case basis in timely fashion without unnecessary delay in the proceedings, always keeping in mind that the best interest of the child is paramount.

   Prudence and careful legal draftsmanship suggests that any document entitled “waiver” be executed on a date following filing of the petition for adoption. While §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c17s93-17-5" target="_self">93-17-5</a></cite>, which deals with the parties and consent to adoption, contains no requirement that the consent be filed the day after the adoption petition is filed, §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.13.html#t13c03s13-3-71" target="_blank">13-3-71</a></cite> [repealed], which deals with waiver of process, and Rule 4, Miss.

      <p>
       Because a former adoptive mother’s husband was both a legal custodian and a legal parent of a child, he was entitled to notice of a prospective adoptive mother’s attempts to adopt; although the father was not named in the first adoption decree, he was a de facto party to such due to a chancery court’s questioning of him, the recognition in the final decree that he was married to the former adoptive mother, and the fact that the child was taking his last name.

       In an adoption proceeding in which the grandparents sought to adopt their daughter’s child, the court should have appointed a guardian ad litem who could advise the court as to the infant grandchild’s best interests where the daughter, who was a minor, and the grandchild were living in the grandparents’ home, since such a factual scenario affords too much opportunity for overreaching.

       Grandparents who were legal custodians of a child by court decree were necessary parties to a petition for adoption, but their status as kindred and legal custodians did not vest in them the prerogative of consenting to the adoption or withholding consent and thereby thwarting the adoption.

       Where a mother of a child filed a sworn consent to the adoption of her child but her husband was not made a party to the adoption proceedings nor summoned because he told the attorneys that he was not the father of the child, in view of the presumption that a child born in wedlock is a legitimate child, the husband was a necessary party to the adoption proceedings in order for the court to decree an adoption of the child, and therefore, the decree of adoption was a nullity and could be attacked collaterally in a habeas corpus proceeding.

       The chancellor should not have accepted the natural father’s waiver of process where it was executed prior to the adoption complaint; a waiver of process should be executed on a date following the filing of the petition.

      <p>
       The statute could not be constitutionally applied to bar an unmarried father’s right to be notified of or to withhold his consent to the adoption of his child where he made substantial and prompt attempts to establish a relationship with his child including filing a declaration of paternity, obtaining a permanent injunction against the mother and all others working with her to prohibit an adoption of the child, hiring private investigators to locate the mother, and mailing the permanent injunction to every vital statistics office in Mississippi as well as other states.

       An unwed father had no statutory rights whatsoever with regard to his child’s adoption since the statute, which requires that “parents” be made parties to the adoption proceedings, does not consider the father of an illegitimate child to be a “parent” for the purposes of the statute.

       Chancery court of Pontotoc County, Mississippi, had full jurisdiction and authority to determine competency and capacity of each of petitioners in adoption proceeding, according to law of forum, and he did not err in failing to give full faith and credit to adjudication of insanity of child’s mother in Tennessee, which may have been conclusive until there was an adjudication that sanity had been restored if adoption proceedings had been filed in Tennessee, since presumption of continuance of insanity is rebuttable one under law of Mississippi.

       Any person who would be a necessary party to an adoption proceeding under this chapter and any person alleged or claiming to be the father of a child born out of wedlock who is proposed for adoption or who has been determined to be such by any administrative or judicial procedure (the “alleged father”) may file a petition for determination of rights as a preliminary pleading to a petition for adoption in any court which would have jurisdiction and venue of an adoption proceeding. A petition for determination of rights may be filed at any time after the period ending thirty (30) days after the birth of the child. Should competing petitions be filed in two (2) or more courts having jurisdiction and venue, the court in which the first such petition was properly filed shall have jurisdiction over the whole proceeding until its disposition.

   Chancellor did not err in setting aside the adoption of the adoptive parents’ twins and awarding the twins to the biological father as the mother had consented to the adoption without the father’s knowledge, and the father was willing and able to assume legal and physical care of the children, as provided by Miss.

   While it was undisputed that a child’s biological father did not receive formal notice of the adoption of his son, this did not void the adoption of the son as, even if the father had received notice, he did not meet the standard of demonstrating a full commitment to the responsibilities of parenthood under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c17s93-17-5ol13" target="_self">93-17-5(3)</a></cite>, which would have allowed him, as an unwed father, to object to the adoption. There was no evidence that the father provided support for the child, that he tried to visit with the child, or that he was now willing and able to assume physical care for the child.

       Termination of parental rights and adoption were in children’s best interest because the parents were unfit to rear and train their children as there was serious neglect and abuse by the parents. Moreover, the children were doing well in the care and custody of a cousin’s family which wanted to adopt the children, deep bonds had developed among the children and the cousin’s family, the children were receiving needed therapy, and a family therapist expressed concerns over the children reuniting with the parents.

Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c17s93-17-7ol11" target="_self">93-17-7(1)</a></cite> (Rev. 2004), only a natural parent had a statutory right to object to the adoption of a child. The railroad company was not a natural parent of the children, and it therefore lacked standing to object to their adoption. D.C.S. v. J.F., 44 So.3d 1006, 2009 Miss. App. LEXIS 714 (Miss. Ct.

   When the adoptive parents’ petition and agreed pretrial order, which raised additional issues of fact, was read in connection with the statutory requirements of Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c15s93-15-103" target="_self">93-15-103</a></cite> and Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c17s93-17-7" target="_self">93-17-7</a></cite>, it was readily apparent that the adoptive parents had sufficiently pleaded allegations that, if proven, would entitle them to terminate the mother’s parental rights and adopt her child. Therefore, the trial court did not commit manifest error in finding that the pleadings and the pretrial order, taken together, satisfied a claim for relief sufficient to defeat the mother’s Miss. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) motion. In re Adoption of a Minor Child, 931 So. 2d 566, 2006 Miss. LEXIS 111 (Miss. 2006).

   Congress’s intended meaning of “domicile” under Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 (ICWA) to be matter of uniform federal law and not matter of individual state law, although it is permissible to borrow state common-law principles to extent they are not inconsistent with objectives of congressional scheme; under general common-law principles, which indicate that domicile of illegitimate children follows that of mother, children in question were domiciled on reservation within meaning of relevant ICWA provisions, fact that the children were voluntarily surrendered by mother does not change result, because ICWA was intended in part to protect interests of the Indian community in retaining its children within its society, and tribal jurisdiction under ICWA thus not meant to be defeated by actions of individual members; and thus Chancery Court lacked jurisdiction over adoptions and its decree would be vacated.

       The burden of proof rests with the adoptive parents to establish that the adopted child’s natural parents had abandoned or deserted such infant or are mentally or morally, or otherwise, unfit to rear and train it; and in the absence of such proof a decree of adoption will be reversed and custody of the child restored to its natural mother.

       Court properly terminated a seven-year-old child’s parents’ parental rights and allowed the child’s adoption, as there was substantial evidence that the parents suffered from chemical dependency, the mother admitted that the mother never bought any food or clothes for the child, and the parents had never provided consistent individual care of the child. Little v. Norman, 119 So.3d 382, 2013 Miss. App. LEXIS 457 (Miss. Ct. App. 2013).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence did not establish that a father had abandoned his child without contact for a year; even though father’s contacts with the child were minimal, the evidence showed that the father did maintain ties to the child and did not relinquish all parental claims to the child. S.N.C. v. J.R.D., 755 So. 2d 1077, 2000 Miss. LEXIS 21 (Miss. 2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancellor’s denial of a petition to adopt a child and to terminate the natural father’s parental rights on the grounds of abandonment and unfitness was affirmed because the chancellor’s findings of fact and determination were supported by credible evidence as the natural father was led by the mother to believe that he was not the father of the child. K.D.F. v. J.L.H., 933 So. 2d 971, 2006 Miss. LEXIS 286 (Miss. 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       The natural mother and stepfather failed to establish that the natural father deserted or abandoned the child at issue where there was conflicting evidence as to how long the natural father went without seeing his child, and the natural father testified that he saw the child on several occasions through his mother and by visiting her secretly at her babysitters, that he sent a letter with a poem, and that he bought Christmas gifts that he had attempted to give to the child. In re M. L. W., 755 So. 2d 558, 2000 Miss. App. LEXIS 89 (Miss. Ct. App. 2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       The evidence was sufficient to support a finding that a mother had abandoned and deserted her minor children, where the mother had only seen the children 2 times between January of 1986 when she left them with their father and the time of the trial in January of 1990, the mother did not contribute any financial assistance during that time, the mother did not send birthday cards or Christmas gifts to the children and ignored other events in the children’s lives, the children thought of and referred to their aunt, with whom they were living, as their mother, and though the older child knew who the mother was when she saw her, the younger child did not know the mother at all as the mother had left when the younger child was 6 months old.

       Chancellor was not manifestly in error when he found neither abandonment nor such immoral conduct as to make natural father of child unfit, where: father had been behind in child support payments; had been arrested for possession of marijuana with intent to deliver; and had cohabited with someone not his spouse; constant arrearages in child support payments do not constitute abandonment or desertion under statutory definition, and that was only evidence of desertion in case; there was no evidence that father had ever exposed daughter to illegal or immoral conduct during visits, and at time of hearing father was out of school and held good job; commission of crime alone was insufficient to find him morally unfit to rear and train child, especially where rehabilitation was evident; and, cohabitation by custodial parent in itself is insufficient to modify custody order absent showing of substantial detrimental effect; same rule applies in adoption cases.

   In an action in which a natural mother and her new husband petitioned for adoption of her minor children over objection of their natural father, petitioners failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the father had abandoned his children, or was unfit, within the meaning of §§<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c17s93-17-7" target="_self">93-17-7</a></cite> and<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c15s93-15-103ol13" target="_self">93-15-103(3)</a></cite>, where, although he was living in an adulterous relationship at the time of the divorce, he had subsequently married his second wife, where, although he was over $7,000 in arrears in court ordered child support, he proved that he was unable to make the support payments or purge himself of contempt, and where, although there had been few visits between him and the children, he had not so totally shown that he wished to relinquish all parental claims to the children as to justify a finding of abandonment or desertion.

   A complete disregard for the welfare of a child of tender years over a period of more than three and one-half years, and a contumacious refusal to abide by a valid decree of support, with no effort to have it modified, amounts to desertion of the child within the meaning of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c17s93-17-7" target="_self">93-17-7</a></cite>; moreover, such desertion results in forfeiture of parental rights whether or not there was an intent to relinquish them.

       Termination
   of parental rights and adoption was appropriate because children were
   exposed to dangerous levels of methamphetamine while under the mother’s
   care and a substantial erosion of the parent-child relationship was
   caused by the mother’s serious neglect and abuse. There was
   serious neglect and abuse by the father as the father was inactive
   when the children were being exposed to drugs while the father and
   the mother were separated, was unable to provide for the children
   with any stability, and lacked involvement in the children’s
   care. J.P. v. L.S., — So.3d —, 2019 Miss. App. LEXIS 46 (Miss. Ct. App. Jan. 29, 2019).

       Chancery court did not err in granting an adoption because clear and convincing evidence supported a finding that the father was unfit to rear and train his children since he was sentenced to life imprisonment and continued to exhibit threatening and violent behavior; the father’s past and present conduct would pose a risk of substantial harm to the physical, mental or emotional health of his children, and the passage of time evinced a substantial erosion of the parent-child relationship.

       In a proceeding for termination of parental rights and adoption, the trial court properly refused to hear the natural mother’s petition for writ of habeas corpus in which she alleged that a prior court order awarding custody of the children to their aunt was void, which would be construed as an amendment to the natural mother’s original answer, where the mother sought to amend her pleading a mere 2 days before trial. Since the adoption proceeding not only determined the best interests of the children, but also who should have custody, there was no need for the trial court to address the habeas application; by addressing and granting the petition for adoption, the trial court necessarily adjudicated custody anew.

       In adoption proceedings involving a contest between natural parent and collateral relatives or others seeking adoption, the issue is not what is to the best interest of the children but it is whether the natural parent has abandoned and deserted the children and whether he is morally or mentally unfit to rear them.

       Where mother of bastard child appeared and objected to the adoption of the child by another, the mother’s consent to the adoption previously given about five years prior thereto became ineffective, and, in order to sustain decree granting adoption petition, the evidence must have warranted trial court in finding that the child had been abandoned by the mother.

     </h3>
     <p>
      At any time after the filing of the petition for adoption and completion of process thereon, and before the entering of a final decree, the court may, in its discretion, of its own motion or on motion of any party to the proceeding, require an investigation and report to the court to be made by any person, officer or home as the court may designate and direct concerning the child, and shall require in adoptions, other than those in which the petitioner or petitioners are a relative or stepparent of the child, that a home study be performed of the petitioner or petitioners by a licensed adoption agency or by the Department of Human Services, at the petitioner’s or petitioners’ sole expense and at no cost to the state or county. The investigation and report shall give the material facts upon which the court may determine whether the child is a proper subject for adoption, whether the petitioner or petitioners are suitable parents for the child, whether the adoption is to its best interest, and any other facts or circumstances that may be material to the proposed adoption. The home study shall be considered by the court in determining whether the petitioner or petitioners are suitable parents for the child. The court, when an investigation and report are required by the court or by this section, shall stay the proceedings in the cause for such reasonable time as may be necessary or required in the opinion of the court for the completion of the investigation and report by the person, officer or home designated and authorized to make the same.
     </p>
     <p>
      Upon the filing of that consent or the completion of the process and the filing of the investigation and report, if required by the court or by this section, and the presentation of such other evidence as may be desired by the court, if the court determines that it is to the best interests of the child that an interlocutory decree of adoption be entered, the court may thereupon enter an interlocutory decree upon such terms and conditions as may be determined by the court, in its discretion, but including therein that the complete care, custody and control of the child shall be vested in the petitioner or petitioners until further orders of the court and that during such time the child shall be and remain a ward of the court. If the court determines by decree at any time during the pendency of the proceeding that it is not to the best interests of the child that the adoption proceed, the petitioners shall be entitled to at least five (5) days’ notice upon their attorneys of record and a hearing with the right of appeal as provided by law from a dismissal of the petition; however, the bond perfecting the appeal shall be filed within ten (10) days from the entry of the decree of dismissal and the bond shall be in such amount as the chancellor may determine and supersedeas may be granted by the chancellor or as otherwise provided by law for appeal from final decrees.
     </p>
     <p>
      After the entry of the interlocutory decree and before entry of the final decree, the court may require such further and additional investigation and reports as it may deem proper. The rights of the parties filing the consent or served with process shall be subject to the decree but shall not be divested until entry of the final decree.

       Although chancery courts may order an investigation as to whether certain prospective adopting parents are suitable for a particular child, such reports are not conclusive on the courts if deemed not to be in the child’s best interests. J. C. v. Natural Parents, 417 So. 2d 529, 1982 Miss. LEXIS 1878 (Miss. 1982).
      </p>
      <p>
       The granting of authority to the court in adoption proceedings to make investigations limited to matters concerning whether the child is a proper subject for adoption, the petitioners are suitable parents for the child, the adoption is in the best interest of the child, and any other facts or circumstances which might be material to the proposed adoption, is not unreasonable, and such procedures do not constitute a denial of due process of law. Brunt v. Watkins, 233 Miss. 307, 101 So. 2d 852, 1958 Miss. LEXIS 381 (Miss. 1958).
      </p>
      <p>
       So long as a procedure for adoption affects all persons alike who are similarly situated and is suitable to accomplish the paramount purpose for which adoption laws are enacted, which is the promotion of the welfare of the children, and is not unjust, unreasonable or arbitrary, it will be adjudged due process. Brunt v. Watkins, 233 Miss. 307, 101 So. 2d 852, 1958 Miss. LEXIS 381 (Miss. 1958).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where, in an adoption proceeding, the rights of the prospective adoptive child’s natural parents were not involved, the admission in evidence of the welfare department report, which contained hearsay material consisting of a statement by a welfare worker of conversation and correspondence with others, did not deny the prospective adoptive parents of due process of the law.

The fee shall be paid directly to the Mississippi Department of Human Services prior to the home study being conducted by the department or to the entity if the study is performed by another entity. The judge may order the fee be paid by one or both of the parents or guardian. If the court determines that both parents or the guardian are unable to pay the fee, the judge shall waive the fee and the cost of the home study shall be defrayed by the Department of Human Services.

       The “unless otherwise specifically provided”; in language of the statute must be interpreted in light of the context of the adoption statutes as a whole, and these statutes are clearly written to foster legal stability in the relationship between adoptive parents and their children; such language was intended by the legislature to provide natural and adoptive parents with the option of entering into limited arrangements such as post-adoption visitation agreements as long as the best interests of the child would be served by such an arrangement. Humphrey v. Pannell, 710 So. 2d 392, 1998 Miss. LEXIS 145 (Miss. 1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       The statute was not intended by the legislature to grant a natural parent the right to weaken the legal bonds of the adoptive parent-child relationship by reserving the right to, in effect, sit and wait for the circumstances of the adoptive family to materially change and thendivest the adoptive family of the custody of the child. Humphrey v. Pannell, 710 So. 2d 392, 1998 Miss. LEXIS 145 (Miss. 1998).

       Under wrongful death statute, adopted child was wrongful death beneficiary of his natural father; right to bring wrongful death action fornatural father’s death was not terminated at time of adoption. Estate of Jones v. Howell, 687 So. 2d 1171, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 421 (Miss. 1996).

       Rights, duties, and obligations do not shift to the adoptive parents from the natural parents until the time of the adoption; thus, adoptive parents were not liable for medical expenses incurred during the adopted baby’s 7-week hospital stay prior to the adoption where the adoptive parents did not enter into a contract with the hospital or the birth mother to provide for prenatal or newborn expenses.

       Chancery court did not err in granting an adoption because clear and convincing evidence supported a finding that the father was unfit to rear and train his children since he was sentenced to life imprisonment and continued to exhibit threatening and violent behavior; the father’s past and present conduct would pose a risk of substantial harm to the physical, mental or emotional health of his children, and the passage of time evinced a substantial erosion of the parent-child relationship.

       It was the intention of the legislature in the passage of this section [Code 1942, § 1269.06] to sever all rights, duties, and obligations of the natural parent toward the child adopted, and to bestow those rights, duties, and obligations upon the adopting parent just the same as if the child had been born in wedlock to the adoptive parent. W. R. Fairchild Constr. Co. v. Owens, 224 So. 2d 571, 1969 Miss. LEXIS 1295 (Miss. 1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       The 1955 adoption law has no effect upon any adoption proceeding consummated prior to July 1, 1955, and applies to pending adoption proceedings on the effective date of the statute only if amendments were made so as to bring the proceedings under the provisions of the statute, and the statute was not intended to affect the rights of adoptive parents and adopted children where the final decree of adoption had been rendered prior to the effective date of the statute. Gray v. Morgan, 236 Miss. 245, 110 So. 2d 346, 1959 Miss. LEXIS 314 (Miss. 1959).
      </p>

       The proceeding of the adoption of a child is purely statutory, and the method provided by this section [Code 1942, § 1269], which was in force at the time of an alleged oral contract of adoption, was the exclusive method whereby a child could be adopted with the right of inheritance from the adoptive parents.

      </p>
      <p>
       This section did not prohibit an adopted child from sharing in a testamentary trust established by his grandmother for the benefit of the children or descendants of her adopted son; it was the legislative intent to elevate an adopted child to the same status in law as a natural child, for purposes of inheritance from the adopting parents and their children. As a descendant of his father by adoption, the child was entitled to share in the trust unless there was language in the will directing otherwise. Dodds v. Deposit Guaranty Nat'l Bank, 371 So. 2d 878, 1979 Miss. LEXIS 2092 (Miss. 1979).

       Although the effect of a final decree of adoption is that natural parents will not inherit through the child, and all rights of the natural parents are terminated, the section [Code 1942, § 1269.06] does not state that the right of the child to inherit from natural parents is to be terminated, indicating that the legislature intended that a child might continue to inherit from his or her natural parents.

       This section [Code 1942, § 1269] does not confer any property or inheritability rights upon the adopted child, it simply empowers the chancery court to grant the adoption. Reeves v. Lowe, 213 Miss. 152, 56 So. 2d 475, 1952 Miss. LEXIS 344 (Miss. 1952).

       A child, adopted under a pre-1955 statute and granted full rights of inheritance from his adoptive parents, became vested by gift with an undivided one-half interest in real property purchased by his adoptive mother with her own funds. When he died intestate his interest in the property reverted to his adoptive mother and was not subject to inheritance by his blood relatives; for it would be neither equitable nor fair that strangers to the blood of the adopting parents should benefit from a status to which they were not parties.

   Chancery court did not err in dismissing an action by former parents to set aside the adoption of their child because the former parents filed the case well past the six-month statute of limitations in Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c17s93-17-15" target="_self">93-17-15</a></cite>; even if the procedural bar was inapplicable, no evidence existed to support setting aside the adoption or terminating the adoptive parent’s parental rights under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c15s93-15-103" target="_self">93-15-103</a></cite>. In re A Child: C.K. &amp; K.K. v. N.F., 53 So.3d 870, 2011 Miss. App. LEXIS 68 (Miss. Ct. App. 2011).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Any petition to set aside an adoption alleging fraud had to be brought within six months after the entry of the adoption. The railroad company’s complaint was filed approximately one year after the entry of adoption, and thus, the strict, six-month statute of limitations imposed by Miss. Code Ann. §§<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c17s93-17-15" target="_self">93-17-15</a></cite> and<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c17s93-17-17" target="_self">93-17-17</a></cite> was fatal to the claim.

      <p>
       The statute of limitations for challenging an adoption decree in Mississippi is six months after entry of the adoption decree except for jurisdictional defects and failure to file and prosecute the same under the adoption chapter of the Mississippi Code. A.M.T.O. v. H.S.L. (In re M.D.T.), 722 So. 2d 702, 1998 Miss. LEXIS 562 (Miss. 1998).

      <p>
       <p>
   Final decree of adoption, coupled with lapse of more than 2 years time with no action taken, is sufficient to insulate decree from attack on grounds that requirements of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c17s93-17-3" target="_self">93-17-3</a></cite> had not been met, where problem areas asserted by person seeking to overturn adoption decree were not jurisdictional in the sense of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c17s93-17-17" target="_self">93-17-17</a></cite>, because of provision in §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c17s93-17-5" target="_self">93-17-5</a></cite> precluding such action after 6 months had passed following entry of decree. In re Adoption of R.M.P.C., 512 So. 2d 702, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2761 (Miss. 1987).

       <p>
   An adoption decree that had been entered in favor of the child’s maternal grandparents was properly set aside, despite the contention that the natural mother was barred from bringing the action by this section’s six-month statute of limitations, where the trial court was not manifestly wrong in finding that service of process by publication during a two week period when the mother was out-of-state was inadequate since there was too much communication between the parties to support non-resident publication, and that appellants’ could easily have located the mother while she was out of state.

       Natural parents of adopted child are not in position to make collateral attack on adoption decree by habeas corpus proceedings on ground of fraud when they were parties to petition of adoption and were fully advised of all facts relied upon by adopting parents to obtain decree.

       In collateral attack on decree of adoption it will be presumed, where the court had general jurisdiction, that the petition presented by the infant’s mother and adopting father was presented in the proper county. Adams v. Adams, 102 Miss. 259, 59 So. 84, 1912 Miss. LEXIS 50 (Miss. 1912).

       Such decree is good against collateral attack though the petition did not show name of father or guardian, or whether they were living or their consent had been obtained. Adams v. Adams, 102 Miss. 259, 59 So. 84, 1912 Miss. LEXIS 50 (Miss. 1912).

    Revised birth certificate.

      <li id="t93c17s93-17-21ol11">
       A certified copy of the final decree shall be furnished to the Bureau of Vital Statistics, together with a certificate signed by the clerk giving the true or original name and the place and date of birth of the child. The said bureau shall prepare a revised birth certificate which shall contain the original date of birth, with the place of birth being shown as the residence of the adoptive parents at the time the child was born, but with the names of the adopting parents and the new name of the child. In all other particulars, the certificate shall show the true facts of birth. The fact that a revised birth certificate is issued shall be indicated only by code numbers or some letter inconspicuously placed on the face of the certificate. The word “revised” shall not appear thereon. However, in the event an unmarried adult shall be the adopting parent, then such birth certificate may show thereon, upon order of the chancellor as set forth in the decree of adoption, that same is a revised birth certificate, giving the court where said decree was issued and the date of such decree. The original birth certificate shall be removed and placed, with reference made to the decree of adoption, in a safely locked drawer or vault, and the same shall not be public records and shall not be divulged except upon the order of the court rendering the said final decree or pursuant to Sections 93-17-201 through 93-17-223, and for all purposes the revised certificate shall be and become the birth certificate of the child. However, the Bureau of Vital Statistics of the State of Mississippi shall be required to prepare and register revised certificates only for births which occurred in the State of Mississippi as shown either by the court decree or by the original birth record on file in the bureau; but if the birth occurred in some other state, then the Director of the Bureau of Vital Statistics of the State of Mississippi shall be required to furnish to the attorney or other person representing the adopted child the name and address of the proper official in the state where the child was born, to whom the adoption decree and other information may be referred for appropriate action, and shall furnish to such attorney the certified copy of the decree and the certificate furnished by the clerk.
      </li>
      <li id="t93c17s93-17-21ol12">
       Provided, however, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, either an original or a revised birth certificate may be issued, as hereinafter provided, by the Bureau of Vital Statistics to any child who was born outside the United States or its possessions and adopted, either heretofore or hereafter, by an order of a court in this state. Upon presentation of a certified copy of the final decree of adoption containing the required information, the Director of the Bureau of Vital Statistics shall be authorized and directed to receive said certified copy of the decree of adoption and prepare therefrom, and record, a birth certificate which shall disclose the following information: The name of the child (being the adopted name), race, sex, date of birth, place of birth (being the actual town, district and county of said child’s birth, except where the child is born in a penal or mental institution where the name of the county shall be sufficient), names, race, ages, places of birth and occupation of parents (being the adoptive parents) including the maiden name of the adoptive mother. Such certificate shall comport in appearance and indicia with the foregoing requirements for a “revised” certificate issued to a child born in this state. The Director of the Bureau of Vital Statistics shall be authorized and directed to issue certified copies thereof, the same as if the birth certificate were that of a child who had never been adopted.

     <p>
      Any child heretofore adopted under the laws of the State of Mississippi and any child who may have been adopted under the provisions of this chapter, may be re-adopted under the provisions hereof. If any such prior adoption is valid, and the re-adoption proceedings be instituted by the persons who previously adopted the child, there shall be no waiting period and no investigation and no interlocutory decree, and a final decree of adoption may be granted by the court ex parte if it be to the best interest of the child that it be re-adopted. If the re-adoption be by any person who was not a petitioner in the prior adoption or adoptions, then in such re-adoption proceedings, the persons who previously adopted the child shall be substituted in the place and stead of the natural parent and the same procedure shall be followed as if such child sought to be re-adopted was being for the first time adopted under the provisions of this chapter.

      As used in Sections 93-17-51 through 93-17-67, the word “child” shall mean a minor as defined by Mississippi law who is:
     </p>
     <p>
      A dependent of a public or voluntary licensed child-placing agency, eligible for Supplemental Security Income prior to the finalization of the adoption, one (1) for whom supplemental benefits were paid pursuant to the aforementioned sections in a previous adoption that was dissolved or wherein the adoptive parents died, or is the child of a minor parent in foster care for whom the board payment was increased on account of the birth;
     </p>
     <p>
      Legally eligible for adoption; and
     </p>
     <p>
      In special circumstances whether:
     </p>
     <p>
      Because he has established significant emotional ties with prospective adoptive parents while in their care as a foster child and it is deemed in the best interest of the child by the agency to be adopted by the foster parents, or
     </p>
     <p>
      Because he is not likely to be adopted because of one or more of the following special needs: 1. severe physical or mental disability, 2. severe emotional disturbance, 3. recognized high risk of physical or mental disease, 4. older than two (2) years of age, 5. a sibling group to be adopted together, or 6. any combination of these special needs.

       When parents are found and approved for adoption of a child certified as eligible for supplemental benefits, and before the final decree of adoption is issued, there shall be executed a written agreement between the family entering into the adoption and the Department of Human Services. In individual cases, supplemental benefits may commence with the adoptive placement or at the appropriate time after the adoption decree and will vary with the needs of the child as well as the availability of other resources to meet the child’s needs. The supplemental benefits may be for special services only or for money payments as allowed under Section 43-13-115, Mississippi Code of 1972, and either for a limited period, for a long-term not exceeding the child’s eighteenth birthday, or for any combination of the foregoing.

These benefits shall be extended so long as the parents remain legally responsible for and are providing support for the child.

     <p>
      INSTRUCTIONS FOR FILINGPETITION TO REGISTER FOREIGN ADOPTION DECREE
     </p>
     <p>
      When a child is adopted in conformity with the laws of a foreign country, the adopting parent(s) may register the foreign adoption and obtain a Mississippi adoption decree so that a Mississippi birth certificate can be obtained.
     </p>
     <p>
      Adopting parent(s) seeking to register the foreign adoption must:
     </p>
     <p>
      1. Complete, sign and date the Petition to Register Foreign Adoption including Verification. If a foreign adoption decree shows that there are two (2) adopting parents, both parents must execute the Petition to Register Foreign Adoption and verification thereof.
     </p>
     <p>
      2. Attach the following documents to the Petition:
     </p>
     <p>
      * A copy of the Foreign Adoption Decree;
     </p>
     <p>
      * A copy of the child’s foreign birth certificate. If no birth certificate was issued, a copy of any other birth identification issued by the country of birth should be attached. If no birth certificate or birth identification can be obtained, an Affidavit stating the reason should be submitted;
     </p>
     <p>
      * A copy of the child’s United States visa;
     </p>
     <p>
      * An English translation of all documents not in English, with a verification by the translator that all translations are true and correct;
     </p>
     <p>
      * A copy of the home studies.
     </p>
     <p>
      * If available, a copy of the child’s Certificate of Citizenship (U.S. Government Form N-560) or a copy of the child’s U.S. passport, or both.
     </p>
     <p>
      3. The Petition to Register with the attachments should be filed with the chancery court in the county in which the adopting parent(s) reside(s). A filing fee for the adoption will be charged in accordance with the fee schedule of the chancery court.
     </p>
     <p>
      After the Petition to Register is filed, it will be submitted to the Court for review. If the Petition to Register and accompanying documents establish that the foreign adoption of the child is full and final, the Court will enter its order directing the registration of the Foreign Adoption Decree. The chancery clerk will then issue an order of adoption to which will be attached a copy of U.S. Government Form N-560 and/or a copy of the child’s United States passport if those items are in the court file for the Petitioner to submit to the Department of Health, Bureau of Vital Records, in order to obtain a birth certificate.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the Court cannot determine that the foreign adoption is full and final, it will enter its order denying the Petition. In that case, it will be necessary to proceed under Title 93, Chapter 17, applying to adoptions generally without payment of an additional filing fee.
     </p>
     <p>
      A foreign adoption may not be a full and final adoption eligible for registration if the child has an IH-4 or IR-4 United States visa, in which case it will be necessary to proceed under Mississippi general adoption law because the adoption of the foreign-born child was not finalized in the country of the child’s birth.
     </p>
     <p>
      Only one (1) state court, whether in this or another state, should exercise jurisdiction over the registration of the foreign adoption or the completion of the adoption initiated in the native country of the foreign-born child. Thus, if the adoption has been finalized or the foreign adoption decree has been registered in another state court or in another court within this state, the adopting parent(s) need not and should not proceed under this article. In similar fashion, if the adoption of the foreign-born child has been finalized in this state, and thereafter, another petitioner seeks to adopt this child, the subsequent proceeding will be a standard proceeding under the applicable provisions of this chapter. Such a situation could occur when the child is to be adopted by a stepparent after divorce or death of the original adopting parent(s), or when, after termination of parental rights, the child is to be adopted by different adopting parent(s).

      The chancery court of the county in which a minor resides, or the chancery court of a county in which a resident minor owns real estate in matters pertaining to such real estate, may remove the disability of minority of such minor. In cases of married minors, the residence of the husband shall be the residence of the parties. The chancery court of a county in which a nonresident minor of the State of Mississippi owns real estate or any interest in real estate may remove the disability of minority of such minor as to such real estate, so as to enable said minor to do and perform all acts with reference to such real estate, to sell and convey, to mortgage, to lease, and to make deeds of trust and contracts, including promissory notes, concerning said real estate, or any interest therein which may be owned by such minor, as fully and effectively as if said minor were twenty-one (21) years of age. The jurisdiction thus exercised shall be that of a court of general equity jurisdiction, and all presumptions in favor of that adjudged shall be accorded at all times.

        1. Removal of disability of minor in general.
       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       A petition for the removal of disabilities was properly filed in the county in which the minor resided rather than the county where a guardianship over the minor had been established. Barrett v. The Mississippi Bar, 648 So. 2d 1154, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 27 (Miss. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   In a proceeding to remove the disability of minority, the attorney representing the minor violated §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.73.html#t73c03s73-3-35" target="_blank">73-3-35</a></cite> by failing to make a full disclosure to the chancellor regarding the existence of a guardianship over the minor in another county; the attorney’s oath of office required the attorney to deal honestly with the court and disclose all material facts. Barrett v. The Mississippi Bar, 648 So. 2d 1154, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 27 (Miss. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       Decree removing disabilities of minority held invalid, where evidence disclosed that minor did not reside in county in judicial district of court which entered order, and hence minor’s signing of mortgage was ineffectual, notwithstanding petition recited that minor lived in such county. Howard v. McMurchy, 175 Miss. 328, 166 So. 917, 1936 Miss. LEXIS 43 (Miss. 1936).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where no petition could be found praying removal of disabilities of minors, presumption was that chancery court, a court not of record in such proceeding when rendering decree removing disabilities, did not have jurisdiction. 162 Miss. 877, 140 So. 340.
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancery court has no jurisdiction to remove disability of minority where petition does not show minor resides in county. Dulion v. Folkes, 153 Miss. 91, 120 So. 437, 1928 Miss. LEXIS 194 (Miss. 1928).
      </p>
      <p>
       No presumption is raised in favor of chancery court’s jurisdiction in removing disability of minority. Dulion v. Folkes, 153 Miss. 91, 120 So. 437, 1928 Miss. LEXIS 194 (Miss. 1928).
      </p>
      <p>
       Minor not residing in county cannot, by appearance by petition to remove disability of minority, confer jurisdiction on court. Dulion v. Folkes, 153 Miss. 91, 120 So. 437, 1928 Miss. LEXIS 194 (Miss. 1928).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancery court may remove disabilities of person under 14 years of age. McLeiter v. Rackley, 148 Miss. 75, 114 So. 128, 1927 Miss. LEXIS 13 (Miss. 1927).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancery court had jurisdiction to remove disabilities of minority of illegitimate minor, though petition alleged minor’s father was dead. Wilkerson v. Swayze, 147 Miss. 141, 113 So. 327, 1927 Miss. LEXIS 347 (Miss. 1927).
      </p>
      <p>
       The chancery court, when removing the disabilities of minority, is one of limited jurisdiction, and therefore no presumption as to its jurisdiction arises, and it is incumbent upon one relying upon the decree to show that the court had acquired jurisdiction under the law. Marks v. McElroy, 67 Miss. 545, 7 So. 408, 1890 Miss. LEXIS 94 (Miss. 1890); Howard v. McMurchy, 175 Miss. 328, 166 So. 917, 1936 Miss. LEXIS 43 (Miss. 1936).

        2. Effect of removal of disability.
       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       Decrees removing disabilities of minority whereby minors were authorized to sue and be sued, to buy and sell real and personal property in their own names, and perform all acts necessary for proper management of their estates, held insufficient to authorize minors to mortgage their property. Howard v. McMurchy, 175 Miss. 328, 166 So. 917, 1936 Miss. LEXIS 43 (Miss. 1936).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where words of decree removing disabilities of minority are unambiguous, power thereby conferred cannot be extended beyond plain meaning of language used. Howard v. McMurchy, 175 Miss. 328, 166 So. 917, 1936 Miss. LEXIS 43 (Miss. 1936).
      </p>
      <p>
       Decree authorizing infant to sell land and receive trust deed for the price did not empower her to cancel the trust deed. Watson v. Peebles, 102 Miss. 725, 59 So. 881, 1912 Miss. LEXIS 112 (Miss. 1912).
      </p>
      <p>
       Emancipation of minor does not empower him to demand a conveyance of a trustee who holds land by deed directing a conveyance to him when he becomes of age. Ray v. Kelly, 82 Miss. 597, 35 So. 165, 1903 Miss. LEXIS 184 (Miss. 1903).

       A lease is enforceable against persons twenty-one years of age or older and married persons eighteen years of age or older for property to be occupied by them as a residence. A lease is also enforceable against a minor tenant who has had his or her disability removed for that purpose by an order entered by the appropriate chancery court. McArty, December 20, 1995, A.G.

       Power of chancery court to remove disability of minority is statutory and one relying on a decree removing disability must show that the court acquired jurisdiction. Lake v.

       The recitals of a decree removing the disability of minority import verity and cannot be drawn in question collaterally. Johnson v. Mississippi Power Co., 68 F.2d 545, 1934 U.S. App. LEXIS 4904 (5th Cir. Miss. 1934).

       Decree of chancery court, in proceeding to remove disabilities of minority, is valid though failing to recite jurisdictional facts when allegations of petition show basis of jurisdiction of court to act, as petition is part of record of the proceeding.

      The decree may be for the partial removal of the disability of the minor so as to enable him to do some particular act proposed to be done and specified in the decree; or it may be general, and empower him to do all acts in reference to his property, and making contracts, and suing and being sued, and engaging in any profession or avocation, which he could do if he were twenty-one years of age; and the decree made shall distinctly specify to what extent the disability of the minor is removed, and what character of acts he is empowered to perform notwithstanding his minority, and may impose such restrictions and qualifications as the court may adjudge proper.

       Plaintiff’s tort action based on events that occurred when he was 19 years old was timely as it was filed less than three years after his 21st birthday; removal of the disability of minority did not arise automatically upon the occurrence of specified events except for reaching the age of 21, and thus, plaintiff’s emancipation did not trigger the automatic removal of disability of minority. Baker v. RR Brink Locking Sys., 721 F.3d 716, 2013 U.S. App. LEXIS 13884 (5th Cir. Miss. 2013).

   A chancery court order, removing the disabilities of a 19-year-old woman and empowering her to engage “in any profession or avocation which she could do if she were 21 years of age”, as decreed pursuant to Code 1972 §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c19s93-19-9" target="_self">93-19-9</a></cite>, would take precedence over an Alcoholic Beverage Control Division regulation prohibiting the employment of persons under age 21 from the handling of alcoholic beverages, since the regulatory authority vested in the Division by Code 1972 §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.67.html#t67c01s67-1-37ol1h" target="_blank">67-1-37(h)</a></cite> requires that such regulations not be inconsistent with other laws of the state.

       Decrees removing disabilities of minors and empowering them to buy or sell real and personal property and to do all things necessary for the proper management of their property, to make contracts, and to sue and be sued, but distinctly specifying what acts they were empowered to perform, did not authorize such minors to mortgage their property.

       In making a decision for a ward, the guardian must make the decision the guardian reasonably believes the adult would make if the adult were able unless doing so would unreasonably harm or endanger the welfare or personal or financial interests of the adult.

In determining the best interest of the adult, the guardian may consider:

        <li id="t93c20s93-20-312ol12c3d5a">

       A conservator must promote the self-determination of the ward and, to the extent feasible, encourage the ward to participate in decisions, act on the ward’s own behalf, and develop or regain the capacity to manage the ward’s personal affairs.

To determine the decision the ward would make if able, the conservator must consider the ward’s prior or current directions, preferences, opinions, values, and actions, to the extent actually known or reasonably ascertainable by the conservator.

In determining the best interest of the ward, the conservator shall consider:

         Information received from professionals and persons who demonstrate sufficient interest in the welfare of the ward;

     <p>
      Except as otherwise provided in Section 93-20-414 or qualified or limited in the court’s order of appointment and stated in the letters of conservatorship, and unless contrary to a conservator’s plan under Section 93-20-419, the conservator may expend or distribute income or principal of the conservatorship estate for the support, care, education, health, or welfare of the ward or an individual who is in fact dependent on the ward, including the payment of child or spousal support, without specific court authorization or confirmation in accordance with the following rules:
     </p>
     <p>
      The conservator shall consider a recommendation relating to the appropriate standard of support, care, education, health, or welfare for the ward or individual who is dependent on the ward, made by a guardian for the ward, if any, and, if the ward is a minor, a recommendation made by a parent of the minor. If the minor has a father or mother, the court shall determine whether the expense of maintaining and educating the minor shall be borne by the ward’s estate.
     </p>
     <p>
      The conservator acting in compliance with the conservator’s duties under Section 93-20-418 is not liable for an expenditure or distribution made based on a recommendation under paragraph (a) unless the conservator knows the expenditure or distribution is not in the best interest of the ward.
     </p>
     <p>
      In making an expenditure or distribution under this section, the conservator must consider:
     </p>
     <p>
      The size of the conservatorship estate, the estimated duration of the conservatorship, and the likelihood the ward, at some future time, may be fully self-sufficient and able to manage the individual’s financial affairs and the conservatorship estate;
     </p>
     <p>
      The accustomed standard of living of the ward and individual who is dependent on the ward;
     </p>
     <p>
      Other funds or sources used for the support of the ward; and
     </p>
     <p>
      The preferences, values, and prior directions of the ward.
     </p>
     <p>
      Funds expended or distributed under this section may be paid by the conservator to any person, including the ward, as reimbursement for expenditures the conservator might have made, or in advance for services to be provided to the ward or individual who is dependent on the ward if it is reasonable to expect the services will be performed and advance payment is customary or reasonably necessary under the circumstances.

Before payment, the conservator may change an allowance of the claim to a disallowance in whole or in part, but not after allowance under a court order or order directing payment of the claim.

       There is no precedent for converting a Miss. R. Civ. P. 65 domestic violence protection order into an injunction under the rule; neither the Domestic Abuse Protection Act nor the rule contemplates this action. Pratt v. Nelson, 170 So.3d 620, 2015 Miss. App. LEXIS 381 (Miss. Ct. App. 2015).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancellor’s decision to enter a restraining order and injunction under Miss. R. Civ. P. 65(b) was clearly erroneous because he applied the wrong legal standard; a sister did not request relief under the rule but only requested a domestic violence order of protection under the Domestic Abuse Protection Act, and since relief was not originally requested under the rule, the requirements of Rule 65(d)(2) had not been met regarding the petition for a domestic violence protection order. Pratt v. Nelson, 170 So.3d 620, 2015 Miss. App. LEXIS 381 (Miss. Ct. App. 2015).

       Chancery court erred by granting a permanent restraining order under Miss. R. Civ. P. 65 without finding a girlfriend was entitled to relief under the Protection from Domestic Abuse Law (PDAL) because in the absence of a finding of abuse under the PDAL, there was no basis to grant permanent injunctive relief; the girlfriend alleged an independent legal right and action under the PDAL, and the chancery court had to decide whether she proved domestic abuse by a preponderance of the evidence. Waite v. Adkisson, — So.3d —, 2019 Miss. App. LEXIS 387 (Miss. Ct. App. Aug. 13, 2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       Protection from Domestic Abuse Law (PDAL) not only provides a right and cause of action but also a complete scheme for the issuance of injunctive relief in the form of emergency, temporary, and final domestic abuse protection orders; therefore, resorting to Miss. R. Civ. P. 65 is entirely unnecessary in the case of a petition filed under the PDAL. Waite v. Adkisson, — So.3d —, 2019 Miss. App. LEXIS 387 (Miss. Ct. App. Aug. 13, 2019).

       “Family or household member”, as that term is used in Sections 97-3-7 and 99-3-7, includes individuals who are married, were married, or who live together in a relationship, although not married; further, it is not limited to a blood relationship and can relate to an in-law relationship or other relatives of one spouse living in the household; however, “boyfriend-girlfriend” (or any other variation of this) relationships are not included in the definition of “family or household member”, unless the persons reside or resided together as spouses; finally, although not falling into the definition of “family or household member”, if the individuals have a biological or legally adopted child between them, the relationship is also protected.

       A petition seeking a domestic abuse protection order may be filed in any of the following courts: municipal, justice, county or chancery. A chancery court shall not prohibit the filing of a petition which does not seek emergency relief on the basis that the petitioner did not first seek or obtain temporary relief in another court. A petition requesting emergency relief pending a hearing shall not be filed in chancery court unless specifically permitted by the chancellor under the circumstances or as a separate pleading in an ongoing chancery action between the parties.

      </h4>
      <p>
       The 2007 amendment, in (1), substituted “Any person” for “A person” and “respondent” for “defendant” both times it appears, and added the last sentence; rewrote (2); and added (3).
      </p>
      <p>
       The first 2009 amendment (ch. 433) deleted former (3), which read: “(a) For every order of protection that is issued under this chapter, the amount of One Dollar ($1.00) shall be assessed as additional costs of court to be used by the Office of the Attorney General for expenses in developing and providing forms to the courts. “(b) There is hereby created in the State Treasury a special fund designated as the Domestic Violence Court Forms Fund. The fund shall be administered by the Attorney General. Money remaining in the fund at the end of a fiscal year shall not lapse into the State General Fund, and any interest earned from the investment of monies in the fund shall be deposited to the credit of the fund. Monies appropriated to the fund shall be used by the Attorney General for expenses in developing and providing domestic violence forms to the courts. “(c) The clerks of the various courts shall remit the proceeds of the cost of court created under this subsection to the Department of Finance and Administration as is done generally for other fees collected by the clerks.”
      </p>
      <p>
       The second 2009 amendment (ch. 545), in (1), substituted “seek a domestic abuse protection order” for “seek relief” in the first and second sentences, and deleted “with the court” preceding “alleging abuse” in the first sentence; added (2); redesignated former (2) as present (3); deleted former (3), which provided an additional cost of court for order of protection and created the Domestic Violence Court Forms Fund; in (3), substituted “in any action” for “in an action” near the beginning, and inserted “only” preceding “if the allegations of abuse” in the last sentence; and added (4).
      </p>
      <p>
       The 2012 amendment rewrote (2); added (2)(a) and (b); and deleted former (4), which read: “Nothing in this section shall be construed to require that the filing of a petition for relief in the municipal, justice or county court is a prerequisite to initiating an action in the chancery court except when seeking emergency relief as provided in this section. Nothing in this section shall preclude a chancery court from entering an order of emergency relief when deemed necessary by the court under the circumstances.”

       Supreme court accepted and affirmed the recommendation of the Mississippi Commission on Judicial Performance for a public reprimand of the judge because she was involved in her relatives’ cases; she failed to adjudicate the domestic abuse cases properly by dismissing the matters without a hearing or order; she erred in ordering the refund of an expungement fee; she sought the removal of the complainant from her job; she violated the statute dealing with justice court fees; and her conduct was prejudicial to the administration of justice.

       Chancery court erred by granting a permanent restraining order under Miss. R. Civ. P. 65 without finding a girlfriend was entitled to relief under the Protection from Domestic Abuse Law (PDAL) because in the absence of a finding of abuse under the PDAL, there was no basis to grant permanent injunctive relief; the girlfriend alleged an independent legal right and action under the PDAL, and the chancery court had to decide whether she proved domestic abuse by a preponderance of the evidence.

      <p>
       Protection from Domestic Abuse Law (PDAL) not only provides a right and cause of action but also a complete scheme for the issuance of injunctive relief in the form of emergency, temporary, and final domestic abuse protection orders; therefore, resorting to Miss. R. Civ. P. 65 is entirely unnecessary in the case of a petition filed under the PDAL. Waite v. Adkisson, — So.3d —, 2019 Miss. App. LEXIS 387 (Miss. Ct. App. Aug. 13, 2019).

       Chancery court erred by granting a permanent restraining order under Miss. R. Civ. P. 65 without finding a girlfriend was entitled to relief under the Protection from Domestic Abuse Law (PDAL) because in the absence of a finding of abuse under the PDAL, there was no basis to grant permanent injunctive relief; the girlfriend alleged an independent legal right and action under the PDAL, and the chancery court had to decide whether she proved domestic abuse by a preponderance of the evidence. Waite v. Adkisson, — So.3d —, 2019 Miss. App. LEXIS 387 (Miss. Ct. App. Aug. 13, 2019).

      <p>
       Although the chancery court erred by granting a permanent restraining order under Miss. R. Civ. P. 65 without finding a girlfriend was entitled to relief under the Protection from Domestic Abuse Law (PDAL), judgment could not be rendered for the girlfriend because the chancery court, as the finder of fact, had to determine whether she was entitled to relief under the PDAL; therefore, the case was remanded for the chancery court to grant or deny the petition for a protection order under the PDAL. Waite v. Adkisson, — So.3d —, 2019 Miss. App. LEXIS 387 (Miss. Ct. App. Aug. 13, 2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       Protection from Domestic Abuse Law (PDAL) not only provides a right and cause of action but also a complete scheme for the issuance of injunctive relief in the form of emergency, temporary, and final domestic abuse protection orders; therefore, resorting to Miss. R. Civ. P. 65 is entirely unnecessary in the case of a petition filed under the PDAL. Waite v. Adkisson, — So.3d —, 2019 Miss. App. LEXIS 387 (Miss. Ct. App. Aug. 13, 2019).

         De novo appeal.Any party aggrieved by the decision of a municipal or justice court judge to issue a temporary domestic abuse protection order has the right of a trial de novo on appeal in the chancery court having jurisdiction. The trial de novo shall be held within ten (10) days of the filing of a notice of appeal. All such appeals shall be priority cases and the judge must be immediately notified when an appeal is filed in order to provide for expedited proceedings. The appeal will proceed as if a petition for an order of protection from domestic abuse had been filed in the chancery court. Following the trial de novo, if the petitioner has proved the existence of abuse by a preponderance of the evidence, the chancery court may grant a final domestic abuse protection order. In granting a final domestic abuse protection order, the chancery court may provide for relief that includes, but is not limited to, the relief set out in Section 93-21-15(2).

Costs for an appeal by trial de novo shall be calculated as specified in subsection (4) of this section. The written notice of appeal must specify the party or parties taking the appeal and must designate the judgment or order from which the appeal is taken. A copy of the notice of appeal must be provided to all parties or their attorneys of record and to the clerk of the court from which the appeal is taken.

A certificate of service must accompany the written notice of appeal. In all appeals in which the appeal is solely on the record, the record from the county court must be filed with the chancery clerk within thirty (30) days of filing of the notice of appeal. However, in cases involving a transcript, the court reporter or county court may request an extension of time. The court, on its own motion or on application of any party, may compel the compilation and transmission of the record of proceedings. Failure to file the record with the court clerk or to request the assistance of the court in compelling the same within thirty (30) days of the filing of the written notice of appeal may be deemed an abandonment of the appeal and the court may dismiss the same with costs to the appealing party or parties, unless a party or parties is exempt from costs as specified in subsection (4) of this section.

In all cases where the appellant is appealing the denial of an order of protection from domestic abuse by a county court, the appellant shall not be required to pay any costs associated with the appeal, including service of process fees, nor shall the appellant be required to appeal in forma pauperis. In such circumstances, the court may assess costs of the appeal to the appellant if the court finds that the allegations of abuse are without merit and the appellant is not a victim of abuse. Where the issuance of a mutual protection order is the basis of the appeal, the appellant may be entitled to reimbursement of appellate costs paid to the court as a matter of equity if the chancery court finds that the mutual order was issued by the lower court without regard to the requirements of Section 93-21-15(3).

       A person who alleges that he or she or a minor child has been the victim of domestic violence may request the assistance of a local law enforcement agency. The local law enforcement agency shall respond to the request for assistance.

Upon request by the complainant and where feasible, the law enforcement officer shall transport the complainant to appropriate facilities such as hospitals or public or private facilities for shelter and accompany the complainant to his or her residence, within the jurisdiction in which the request for assistance was made, so that the complainant may remove food, clothing, medication and such other personal property as is reasonably necessary to enable the complainant and any minor children who are presently in the care of the complainant to remain elsewhere pending further proceedings.

   Circuit court properly determined that the immunity provisions of Miss. Code Ann. §§<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c21s93-21-28" target="_self">93-21-28</a></cite> and<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c21s93-21-27" target="_self">93-21-27</a></cite> pertaining to a police officer’s response to a domestic abuse call did not apply in a citizen’s excessive force action because the qualifier for immunity under Miss.

The record showed that the police officer’s actions in responding to a domestic disturbance call at the citizen’s parents’ home was not reasonable or in good faith because the officer handcuffed the citizen and then ground his face into the concrete garage floor, which caused his teeth to break.

      The children of Mississippi are its single greatest resource and our children require the utmost protection to guard their future and the future of this state;
     </p>
     <p>
      Child abuse and neglect are a threat to the family unit and impose major expenses on society in addition to the individual and collective damage on the children of this state;
     </p>
     <p>
      There is a need to assist private and public agencies in identifying and establishing community-based educational and service programs for the prevention of child abuse and neglect;
     </p>
     <p>
      An increase in educational, service and prevention programs will assist in breaking the cycle of child abuse and neglect and will assist in reducing the breakdown of families and thus reduce the need for state assistance and intervention and state expenses; and
     </p>
     <p>
      Programs to prevent child abuse and neglect should be partnerships between citizens, local communities and the State of Mississippi.

    Bases for jurisdiction over nonresident.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      In a proceeding to establish or enforce a support order or to determine parentage of a child, a tribunal of this state may exercise personal jurisdiction over a nonresident individual or the individual’s guardian or conservator if:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t93c25s93-25-201ol11">
       The individual is personally served with process within this state;
      </li>
      <li id="t93c25s93-25-201ol12">
       The individual submits to the jurisdiction of this state by consent in a record, by entering a general appearance or by filing a responsive document having the effect of waiving any contest to personal jurisdiction;
      </li>
      <li id="t93c25s93-25-201ol13">
       The individual resided with the child in this state;
      </li>
      <li id="t93c25s93-25-201ol14">
       The individual resided in this state and provided prenatal expenses or support for the child;
      </li>
      <li id="t93c25s93-25-201ol15">
       The child resides in this state as a result of the acts or directives of the individual;
      </li>
      <li id="t93c25s93-25-201ol16">
       The individual engaged in sexual intercourse in this state and the child may have been conceived by that act of intercourse;
      </li>
      <li id="t93c25s93-25-201ol17">
       The individual asserted parentage of a child as provided by law in this state; or

       There is any other basis consistent with the constitutions of this state and the United States for the exercise of personal jurisdiction.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      The bases of personal jurisdiction set forth in subsection (a) or in any other law of this state may not be used to acquire personal jurisdiction for a tribunal of this state to modify a child-support order of another state unless the requirements of Section 93-25-611 are met, or, in the case of a foreign support order, unless the requirements of Section 93-25-615 are met.

       Where a mother filed a complaint for custody and support, the Mississippi court lacked personal jurisdiction over the father sufficient to enter a child support award because the father had no contact with Mississippi and agreeing to an order setting the case for trial did not act as a general appearance or otherwise waive the defense of lack of personal jurisdiction.

   Notwithstanding Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c25s93-25-9ol1b" target="_self">93-25-9(b)</a></cite>, the chancellor could have exercised jurisdiction over the child support question if the father, a resident of California, had voluntarily entered a general appearance, or filed a responsive pleading that effectively waived the issue of jurisdiction. However, while it was correct that the father filed a written answer, with leave of court, he filed an amended answer, which contested jurisdiction; same related back to the filing date of the original answer, and despite his written entry of appearance, and a motion for guardian ad litem, the facts did not suffice for a general appearance or for personal jurisdiction over the father for the purpose of modifying child support.

       § 93-25-207.
    Determination of controlling child-support order.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      If a proceeding is brought under this chapter, and only one (1) tribunal has issued a child-support order, the order of that tribunal controls and must be recognized.
     </p>
     <p>
      If a proceeding is brought under this chapter, and two (2) or more child-support orders have been issued by tribunals of this state, another state, or foreign country with regard to the same obligor and the same child, a tribunal of this state having personal jurisdiction over both the obligor and individual obligee shall apply the following rules and by order shall determine which order controls and must be recognized:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t93c25s93-25-207ol11">
       If only one (1) of the tribunals would have continuing, exclusive jurisdiction under this chapter, the order of that tribunal controls.
      </li>
      <li id="t93c25s93-25-207ol12">
       If more than one (1) of the tribunals would have continuing, exclusive jurisdiction under this chapter:
      </li>
      <li id="t93c25s93-25-207ol13">
       If none of the tribunals would have continuing, exclusive jurisdiction under this chapter, the tribunal of this state shall issue a child-support order, which controls.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      An order issued by a tribunal in the current home state of the child controls; or
     </p>
     <p>
      If an order has not been issued in the current home state of the child, the order most recently issued controls.
     </p>
     <p>
      If two (2) or more child-support orders have been issued for the same obligor and the same child, upon request of a party who is an individual or that is a support enforcement agency, a tribunal of this state having personal jurisdiction over both the obligor and the obligee who is an individual shall determine which order controls under subsection (b). The request may be filed with a registration for enforcement or registration for modification pursuant to Article 6, or may be filed as a separate proceeding.
     </p>
     <p>
      A request to determine which is the controlling order must be accompanied by a copy of every child-support order in effect and the applicable record of payments. The requesting party shall give notice of the request to each party whose rights may be affected by the determination.
     </p>
     <p>
      The tribunal that issued the controlling order under subsection (a), (b) or (c) has continuing jurisdiction to the extent provided in Section 93-25-205 or 93-25-206.
     </p>
     <p>
      A tribunal of this state that determines by order which is the controlling order under subsection (b)(1) or (2) or subsection (c), or that issues a new controlling order under subsection (b)(3), shall state in that order:
     </p>
     <p>
      The basis upon which the tribunal made its determination;
     </p>
     <p>
      The amount of prospective support, if any; and
     </p>
     <p>
      The total amount of consolidated arrearages and accrued interest, if any, under all of the orders after all payments made are credited as provided by Section 93-25-209.
     </p>
     <p>
      Within thirty (30) days after issuance of an order determining which is the controlling order, the party obtaining the order shall file a certified copy of it in each tribunal that issued or registered an earlier order of child support. A party or support enforcement agency obtaining the order that fails to file a certified copy is subject to appropriate sanctions by a tribunal in which the issue of failure to file arises. The failure to file does not affect the validity or enforceability of the controlling order.
     </p>
     <p>
      An order that has been determined to be the controlling order, or a judgment for consolidated arrearages of support and interest, if any, made pursuant to this section must be recognized in proceedings under this chapter.

     <p>
      The complainant may not be required to pay a filing fee or other costs.
     </p>
     <p>
      If an obligee prevails, a responding tribunal of this state may assess against an obligor filing fees, reasonable attorney’s fees, other costs and necessary travel and other reasonable expenses incurred by the obligee and the obligee’s witnesses. The tribunal may not assess fees, costs or expenses against the obligee or the support enforcement agency of either the initiating or responding state or foreign country, except as provided by other law. Attorney’s fees may be taxed as costs, and may be ordered paid directly to the attorney, who may enforce the order in the attorney’s own name. Payment of support owed to the obligee has priority over fees, costs and expenses.
     </p>
     <p>
      The tribunal shall order the payment of costs and reasonable attorney’s fees if it determines that a hearing was requested primarily for delay. In a proceeding under Article 6, a hearing is presumed to have been requested primarily for delay if a registered support order is confirmed or enforced without change.

     <p>
      The physical presence of a nonresident party who is an individual in a tribunal of this state is not required for the establishment, enforcement or modification of a support order or the rendition of a judgment determining parentage of a child.
     </p>
     <p>
      An affidavit, a document substantially complying with federally mandated forms, or a document incorporated by reference in any of them, which would not be excluded under the hearsay rule if given in person, is admissible in evidence if given under penalty of perjury by a party or witness residing outside this state.
     </p>
     <p>
      A copy of the record of child support payments certified as a true copy of the original by the custodian of the record may be forwarded to a responding tribunal. The copy is evidence of facts asserted in it, and is admissible to show whether payments were made.
     </p>
     <p>
      Copies of bills for testing for parentage of a child, and for prenatal and postnatal health care of the mother and child, furnished to the adverse party at least ten (10) days before trial, are admissible in evidence to prove the amount of the charges billed and that the charges were reasonable, necessary and customary.
     </p>
     <p>
      Documentary evidence transmitted from outside this state to a tribunal of this state by telephone, telecopier or other electronic means that do not provide an original record may not be excluded from evidence on an objection based on the means of transmission.
     </p>
     <p>
      In a proceeding under this chapter, a tribunal of this state shall permit a party or witness residing outside this state to be deposed or to testify under penalty of perjury by telephone, audiovisual means or other electronic means at a designated tribunal or other location. A tribunal of this state shall cooperate with other tribunals in designating an appropriate location for the deposition or testimony.
     </p>
     <p>
      If a party called to testify at a civil hearing refuses to answer on the ground that the testimony may be self-incriminating, the trier of fact may draw an adverse inference from the refusal.
     </p>
     <p>
      A privilege against disclosure of communications between spouses does not apply in a proceeding under this chapter.
     </p>
     <p>
      The defense of immunity based on the relationship of husband and wife or parent and child does not apply in a proceeding under this chapter.
     </p>
     <p>
      A voluntary acknowledgement of paternity, certified as a true copy, is admissible to establish parentage of the child.

       Chancery court did not err in dismissing a mother’s request to modify child support because the mother could have taken the appropriate steps under the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act to ensure the chancery court had jurisdiction, first by registering the Tennessee judgment in Mississippi; it is not within the power of the court of appeals to disregard jurisdictional requirements set forth by the Legislature.

   Where chancery court in Mississippi ordered father to pay child support, which he failed to do, and both parents subsequently moved, mother to Texas and father to Georgia, and mother used the Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act (URESA) to force father to comply by filing with an office in Texas, and the Georgia Office of Ancillary Domestic Legal Services filed a URESA petition against father for child support, the Mississippi chancery court properly found that it lacked jurisdiction for child support owed to the mother after Georgia took jurisdiction, because the appellant mother failed to follow the statutory provisions set forth pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c25s93-25-83" target="_self">93-25-83</a></cite>, which required her to register the Georgia orders for enforcement in Mississippi. Williams v.

      If the registering party asserts that two (2) or more orders are in effect, a notice must also:
     </p>
     <p>
      Identify the two (2) or more orders and the order alleged by the registering party to be the controlling order and the consolidated arrearages, if any;

    Modification
    of child-support order of another state.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      If Section 93-25-613 does not apply, upon complaint, a tribunal of this state may modify a child-support order issued in another state which is registered in this state,if,after notice and hearing, it finds that:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t93c25s93-25-611ol11">
       The following requirements are met:
      </li>
      <li id="t93c25s93-25-611ol12">
       This state is the residence of the child, or a party who is an individual is subject to the personal jurisdiction of the tribunal of this state, and all of the parties who are individuals have filed consents in a record in the issuing tribunal for a tribunal of this state to modify the support order and assume continuing, exclusive jurisdiction.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      Neither the child, nor the obligee who is an individual, nor the obligor resides intheissuing state;
     </p>
     <p>
      A complainant who is a nonresident of this state seeks modification; and
     </p>
     <p>
      The defendant is subject to the personal jurisdiction of the tribunal of this state; or
     </p>
     <p>
      Modification of a registered child-support order is subject to the same requirements, procedures and defenses that apply to the modification of an order issued by a tribunal of this state and the order may be enforcedandsatisfied in the same manner.
     </p>
     <p>
      A tribunal of this state may not modify any aspect of a child-support order that may not be modified under the law of the issuing state, including the duration of the obligation of support. If two (2) or more tribunals have issued child-support orders for the same obligor and the same child, the order that controls and must be so recognized under Section 93-25-207 establishes the aspects of the support order which are nonmodifiable.
     </p>
     <p>
      In a proceeding to modify a child-support order, the law of the state that is determined to have issued the initial controlling order governs the duration of the obligation of support. The obligor’s fulfillment of the duty of support established by that order precludes imposition of a further obligation of support by a tribunal of this state.
     </p>
     <p>
      On the issuance of an order by a tribunal of this state modifying a child-support order issued in another state, the tribunal of this state becomes the tribunal having continuing, exclusive jurisdiction.
     </p>
     <p>
      Notwithstanding subsections (a) through (e) and Section 93-25-201(b), a tribunal of this state retains jurisdiction to modify an order issued by a tribunal of this state if:
     </p>
     <p>
      One (1) party resides in another state; and
     </p>
     <p>
      The other party resides outside the United States.

       It was error to deny a mother’s petition to increase child support on the ground she failed to develop the factors relevant to the modification of support under the law of the issuing court because the issue should have been decided under Mississippi law; the mother did not seek to modify the Iowa court’s order that was non-modifiable under Iowa law, but rather, her request was based on alleged increases in the father’s income and the child’s expenses and was governed by subsection (b).

Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c25s93-25-101" target="_self">93-25-101</a></cite>, the modifications concerning health insurance premiums and other health expenses were reversed.

   Mississippi trial court chancellor’s application of a public policy amendment to a California support order, stating that it was against public policy to permit support for a child to end before age 21, was incorrect and was reversed; the California order was not modifiable by Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c25s93-25-21" target="_self">93-25-21</a></cite> because in interstate support modification cases, the law of the issuing state prevails and to register an order, consent from the initiating state is required, therefore, the law of Mississippi could not prevail even though both parents and the children had left California, whose law as to the age for termination of support remained determinative.

      Except as otherwise provided in subsections (c) and (d), a tribunal of this state shall recognize and enforce a foreign support agreement registered in this state.
     </p>
     <p>
      An application or direct request for recognition and enforcement of a foreign support agreement must be accompanied by:

      <li id="t93c25s93-25-710ol11">

       The agreement is incompatible with a support order involving the same parties and having the same purpose in this state, another state, or a foreign country if the support order is entitled to recognition and enforcement under this chapter in this state; or

      A tribunal of this state may vacate the registration of a foreign support agreement only if, acting on its own motion, the tribunal finds that recognition and enforcement would be manifestly incompatible with public policy.
     </p>
     <p>
      In a contest of a foreign support agreement, a tribunal of this state may refuse recognition and enforcement of the agreement if it finds:
     </p>
     <p>
      Recognition and enforcement of the agreement is manifestly incompatible with public policy;
     </p>
     <p>
      The agreement was obtained by fraud or falsification;
     </p>
     <p>
      A proceeding for recognition and enforcement of a foreign support agreement must be suspended during the pendency of a challenge to or appeal of the agreement before a tribunal of another state or a foreign country.

     <p>
      Before making a demand that the governor of another state surrender an individual charged criminally in this state with having failed to provide for the support of an obligee, the governor of this state may require a prosecutor of this state to demonstrate that at least sixty (60) days previously the obligee had initiated proceedings for support pursuant to this chapter or that the proceeding would be of no avail.
     </p>
     <p>
      If, under this chapter or a law substantially similar to this chapter, the governor of another state makes a demand that the governor of this state surrender an individual charged criminally in that state with having failed to provide for the support of a child or other individual to whom a duty of support is owed, the governor may require a prosecutor to investigate the demand and report whether a proceeding for support has been initiated or would be effective. If it appears that a proceeding would be effective but has not been initiated, the governor may delay honoring the demand for a reasonable time to permit the initiation of a proceeding.
     </p>
     <p>
      If a proceeding for support has been initiated and the individual whose rendition is demanded prevails, the governor may decline to honor the demand. If the complainant prevails and the individual whose rendition is demanded is subject to a support order, the governor may decline to honor the demand if the individual is complying with the support order.

   While the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act’s definition of “child custody determination” as “a judgment, decree, or other order of a court providing for the legal custody, physical custody, or visitation with respect to a child”, Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c27s93-27-102ol1c" target="_self">93-27-102(c)</a></cite>, does not explicitly require a court to make a finding as to a specific visitation schedule, it is logical that when a court grants custody to one parent, it must address whether the non-custodial parent receives visitation rights and to what extent.

   Although a chancery court had temporary emergency jurisdiction to hear the complaint of a father, who had kidnapped his children from their mother, alleging substantial neglect and abuse, the court erred when it continued to exercise jurisdiction over the matter after it should reasonably have become apparent that there was no clear and present danger to the children from permitting adjudication of modification, if any, of their custody in the courts of another state which originally granted custody of the children to the mother. Mississippi was not the children’s “home state,” even though they had lived in Mississippi for over 6 consecutive months, since the father brought the children to Mississippi in contravention of a valid custody decree of another state and the children remained in Mississippi by virtue of the chancery court’s custody and protective order; such court-ordered involuntary residence does not generate “so much as a single tick of the UCCJA’s 6 consecutive months clock.” Additionally, the father and the children did not have a “significant connection” with Mississippi, within the meaning of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c23s93-23-5" target="_self">93-23-5</a></cite>, by virtue of the fact that they had lived in Mississippi for over 6 months at the time of the hearing, where they had been in Mississippi for only one or 2 days prior to the time the father filed the original application for modification of custody. In light of the UCCJA’s dominant purpose of preventing interstate parental kidnapping and §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c23s93-23-15" target="_self">93-23-15</a></cite>’s strong injunction against wrongfully taking children from one state to another, the father and the children were required to “have a significant connection” with Mississippi prior to the filing of the application for custody modification, and their presence in Mississippi for one or 2 days was not a “significant connection” within the meaning of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c23s93-23-5" target="_self">93-23-5</a></cite>(1)(b).

       Because a mother and child moved to Mississippi soon after an Ohio divorce decree was entered and remained within the State consecutively for more than six months prior to the decree’s registration in Mississippi, the chancery court was correct in determining that Mississippi was the child’s home state.

   Temporary visitation order was unenforceable in Mississippi because the record did not support Louisiana’s exercise of jurisdiction under the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA); Louisiana made no finding that it was the children’s home state under the UCCJEA, La.

Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c27s93-27-102ol1g" target="_self">93-27-102(g)</a></cite>, and the evidence showed that the children had lived in Mississippi for more than six consecutive months before the father commenced his child-custody proceeding in Louisiana.

       Chancellor properly denied the mother’s motion to dismiss for forum non conveniens because the court had jurisdiction where Mississippi was the home state of the child on the date of the commencement of the proceedings, all of the witnesses, including two of the mother’s witnesses, resided in Mississippi, all of the issues that were raised in both parties’ claims occurred in Mississippi, and the motion to dismiss for forum non conveniens was made on the day of trial, when both parties and their witnesses were present and ready to proceed.

       Denied of a wife’s motion to set aside a chancery court’s prior judgments and orders regarding custody and visitation was appropriate because the issue of the chancery court’s jurisdiction to make an initial custody determination was res judicata as it was established in prior judgments, including one that was affirmed on appeal and two that the wife did not appeal.

       Chancery court lacked authority to modify an Arizona custody determination based on the mother’s residence in Arizona because Mississippi did not have the ability to make an initial custody determination; Arizona had been the children’s home for the entirety of their lives until they came to Mississippi, and at the time the father filed his suit, he and the children had been in Mississippi for only a couple of months and had not established a connection with Mississippi beyond their presence.

       Because a mother and child moved to Mississippi soon after an Ohio divorce decree was entered and remained within the State consecutively for more than six months prior to the decree’s registration in Mississippi, the chancery court was correct in determining that Mississippi was the child’s home state.

       <p>
   In the mother’s child custody modification action, while personal jurisdiction was an affirmative defense, which was waived if not affirmatively pled, the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act (UCCJA), specifically Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c23s93-23-5ol11" target="_self">93-23-5(1)</a></cite>, [repealed] required personal jurisdiction of the minor child and the contestant. The father, who had custody and resided with the child in California, properly raised the issue of lack of jurisdiction over the child in his amended complaint, and the chancellor’s finding that she lacked jurisdiction over the child rendered the issue of jurisdiction over the father moot. Scaife v. Scaife, 880 So. 2d 1089, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 851 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Notwithstanding the presence of his mother and siblings in Mississippi, the older child who was in the father’s custody in California had no connection with Mississippi. Nor was there present in Mississippi any substantial evidence concerning the present or future care, protection, training or personal relations affecting that child; all information concerning the health and welfare of the older child was located in California, and the chancellor correctly found that Mississippi lacked jurisdiction in the mother’s modification action. Scaife v. Scaife, 880 So. 2d 1089, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 851 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).

       While Mississippi was not the home state of an adopted child or her natural mother, and neither had lived there for six months before the adoption complaint was filed, a Mississippi trial court had jurisdiction to grant the adoption since the child was present in Mississippi and the mother had abandoned her by signing the adoption complaint.

       Where parents were divorced in Louisiana, and the father moved to Mississippi where he lived with two of the children, and the mother moved to Texas where she lived with the third child, the Mississippi trial court erred in relinquishing jurisdiction over custody issues because, inter alia, Mississippi was a more appropriate forum than Louisiana for deciding custody. Marr v. Adair, 841 So. 2d 1195, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 283 (Miss. Ct. App. 2003).

   Mississippi had subject matter jurisdiction in divorce and child custody case under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c23s93-23-5ol11b" target="_self">93-23-5(1)(b)</a></cite>, where the parents had met and married in Mississippi, continued to live there for a year, moved back and forth to the state numerous times, and the mother returned to Mississippi where she found a job, a place to live, enrolled the children in school, began receiving Medicaid assistance, and filed her taxes.

      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that a child lived with her mother in Connecticut for 10 months did not create jurisdiction there on the basis that Connecticut was the child’s home state since the father, who lived in Mississippi, was entitled to custody by court order and the child only spent that 10 months in Connecticut because the mother wrongfully refused to send the child back to Mississippi. Mitchell v. Mitchell, 767 So. 2d 1078, 2000 Miss. App. LEXIS 450 (Miss. Ct. App. 2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       A Mississippi court did not have jurisdiction over child custody and visitation issues where (1) the child had been living with his mother in Virginia since June, 1995, and (2) the child was not a resident of Mississippi and, notwithstanding his father’s presence in the state, he had no connections to the state. Peters v. Peters, 744 So. 2d 803, 1999 Miss. App. LEXIS 147 (Miss. Ct. App. 1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       Both California and Mississippi had jurisdiction to modify a custody decree where (1) the original divorce decree was entered in Mississippi and a contempt proceeding was heard in Mississippi, and (2) the mother and daughter had moved to, and lived in, California; however, the chancellor should have relinquished jurisdiction to California based on the fact that California was the “home state” of the child. Ortega v. Lovell, 725 So. 2d 199, 1998 Miss. LEXIS 617 (Miss. 1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancery court had authority to exercise jurisdiction on child custody matter, though Texas court that rendered divorce decree retained exclusive jurisdiction over child support issues, where child resided in state. Caples v. Caples, 686 So. 2d 1071, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 688 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancery court’s loss of former husband’s case file containing pleadings, orders, decrees and any record made of out-of-state court hearings for custody decree did not result in injustice to former husband in his challenge to proposed modification of joint custody, where major contribution of files would have been to give court notice of out-of-state order granting subject matter to state court. Caples v. Caples, 686 So. 2d 1071, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 688 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       A Mississippi court had continuing jurisdiction over 2 children in a child custody action, even though Mississippi was not the “home state” of either child, since a court that enters the original custody decree has jurisdiction to subsequently modify the decree separate and apart from the jurisdictional section of the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act. Jones v. Starr, 586 So. 2d 788, 1991 Miss. LEXIS 755 (Miss. 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   The application of the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act in a dispute over jurisdiction between 2 states is a 3 step process. A court must first determine if it has authority, or jurisdiction, to act following the guidelines of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c23s93-23-5" target="_self">93-23-5</a></cite>. If a court determines that it does not have jurisdiction, the process stops there. However, if that hurdle is cleared, a determination is made as to which court is the more appropriate and convenient forum under the guidelines of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c23s93-23-13" target="_self">93-23-13</a></cite>. A court may decline to exercise jurisdiction if it is not the most appropriate or convenient forum. If the court accepts jurisdiction as the convenient forum, the court must determine if the action to be taken is foreclosed by an order or judgment of the other state court. Stowers v. Humphrey, 576 So. 2d 138, 1991 Miss. LEXIS 56 (Miss. 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   While a court that enters an original custody decree has jurisdiction to subsequently modify the decree separate and apart from the jurisdictional section of the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act, (UCCJA), the continuing jurisdiction of a court is affected by the application of the UCCJA. Thus, although the Mississippi court that entered the original divorce and custody decree, which gave the mother custody of the parties’ 2 minor children, had continuing jurisdiction over the case, the court properly stayed proceedings to modify the custody decree on the finding that Mississippi was an inconvenient forum under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c23s93-23-13" target="_self">93-23-13</a></cite> and that Alabama was the most appropriate forum, where the mother and children had lived in Alabama for 2 1/2 years, and evidence concerning the effects of visitation with the father was more readily available in Alabama than in Mississippi. Stowers v. Humphrey, 576 So. 2d 138, 1991 Miss. LEXIS 56 (Miss. 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       A chancery court had continuing jurisdiction of a child custody matter, despite the fact that the mother and the children had established residency in Louisiana, where pleadings had been pending before the court almost constantly since the parties were initially divorced, the mother had continued to use the court to enforce her rights under the decrees, and the Mississippi court had assumed jurisdiction before any proceeding was begun in Louisiana. Cooley v. Cooley, 574 So. 2d 694, 1991 Miss. LEXIS 15 (Miss. 1991), overruled,
   Powell v. Powell, 644 So. 2d 269, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 627 (Miss. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       In interstate custody conflicts, the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act (UCCJA) provides the exclusive state law source for determining state court subject matter jurisdiction. The chancery courts have no power under the Protection From Domestic Abuse Law that are inconsistent with the jurisdictional injunctions of the UCCJA. Curtis v. Curtis, 574 So. 2d 24, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 850 (Miss. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Although a chancery court had temporary emergency jurisdiction to hear the complaint of a father, who had kidnapped his children from their mother, alleging substantial neglect and abuse, the court erred when it continued to exercise jurisdiction over the matter after it should reasonably have become apparent that there was no clear and present danger to the children from permitting adjudication of modification, if any, of their custody in the courts of another state which originally granted custody of the children to the mother. Mississippi was not the children’s “home state,” even though they had lived in Mississippi for over 6 consecutive months, since the father brought the children to Mississippi in contravention of a valid custody decree of another state and the children remained in Mississippi by virtue of the chancery court’s custody and protective order; such court-ordered involuntary residence does not generate “so much as a single tick of the UCCJA’s 6 consecutive months clock.” Additionally, the father and the children did not have a “significant connection” with Mississippi, within the meaning of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c23s93-23-5" target="_self">93-23-5</a></cite>, by virtue of the fact that they had lived in Mississippi for over 6 months at the time of the hearing, where they had been in Mississippi for only one or 2 days prior to the time the father filed the original application for modification of custody. In light of the UCCJA’s dominant purpose of preventing interstate parental kidnapping and §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c23s93-23-15" target="_self">93-23-15</a></cite>’s strong injunction against wrongfully taking children from one state to another, the father and the children were required to “have a significant connection” with Mississippi prior to the filing of the application for custody modification, and their presence in Mississippi for one or 2 days was not a “significant connection” within the meaning of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c23s93-23-5" target="_self">93-23-5</a></cite>(1)(b). Curtis v. Curtis, 574 So. 2d 24, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 850 (Miss. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       A Mississippi court improperly assumed jurisdiction over a child custody matter where an Indiana court had properly adjudicated the matter under the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act, the mother and the parties’ child had lived in Mississippi for less than one month prior to the time the father’s petition to enforce the Indiana decree was filed, and the mother and the child had no significant connection with Mississippi prior to moving to the state. In re Custody of Jackson, 562 So. 2d 1271, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 263 (Miss. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   A Mississippi court had subject matter jurisdiction, pursuant to §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c23s93-23-5ol11c" target="_self">93-23-5(1)(c)</a></cite>, to hear a child custody modification petition brought by the children’s father, even though the children resided with their mother in California, where the children were present in Mississippi for a vacation visit at the time the petition was filed and the petition alleged an emergency to protect the children from abuse. Castleberry v. Castleberry, 541 So. 2d 457, 1989 Miss. LEXIS 164 (Miss. 1989).
      </p>
      <p>
       A defendant father was not subject to in personam jurisdiction in Mississippi consistent with due process in an action brought by the mother regarding his child support obligations, even though an Ohio court had transferred jurisdiction over the case to a chancery court in Mississippi in accordance with the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act and the child resided in Mississippi, where the father had no minimum contacts with Mississippi and had not purposely availed himself of the benefits of the laws of the state of Mississippi or derived personal or commercial benefit from his child’s presence in Mississippi. Carpenter v. Allen, 540 So. 2d 1334, 1989 Miss. LEXIS 163 (Miss. 1989).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   The provisions of the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act governed a child custody action even though the complaint stated that custody was sought pursuant to §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c11s93-11-65" target="_self">93-11-65</a></cite>, which provides for chancery jurisdiction in child custody cases. Walters v. Walters, 519 So. 2d 427, 1988 Miss. LEXIS 43 (Miss. 1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       First question chancellor should address in action for modification of child custody involving child no longer living in state is whether Mississippi is proper state to exercise jurisdiction, and should not rely solely upon fact that original custody decree had been rendered in his court, where Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act may have applied. Hobbs v. Hobbs, 508 So. 2d 677, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2597 (Miss. 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Chancellor should first determine, before considering actions taken by Louisiana court, whether Mississippi Chancery Court has authority to act under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c23s93-23-5" target="_self">93-23-5</a></cite>; if this section gives him authority to exercise jurisdiction, Chancellor must next determine which state is more appropriate and convenient forum under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c23s93-23-13" target="_self">93-23-13</a></cite>; if both requirements would otherwise be sufficiently present to give Chancery Court jurisdiction, in view of posture of this case in Louisiana court, Chancellor under Act is further required to determine whether modification of original custody decree by Chancery Court is foreclosed by order or judgment of Louisiana court. Hobbs v. Hobbs, 508 So. 2d 677, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2597 (Miss. 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       There is nothing in the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act that would prohibit a state court from requiring a ne exeat writ and bond. Roberts v. Fuhr, 523 So. 2d 20, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2891 (Miss. 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       Texas is appropriate forum and Mississippi should decline jurisdiction in case in which noncustodial parent files motion to modify Mississippi child custody judgment where children have resided in Texas for period of year prior to initiation of action and for 2 years prior to date of trial, notwithstanding presence of one child in Mississippi prior to trial or at time of filing, which child has been retained in Mississippi in violation of existing, valid decree, and where practically all witnesses and evidence of any substantial change adversely affecting children’s future care, protection and training lie within borders of Texas. Siegel v. Alexander, 477 So. 2d 1345, 1985 Miss. LEXIS 2259 (Miss. 1985).

       Pursuant to the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act, the chancery court erred in assuming jurisdiction over custody matters because the father had not moved from the county since the divorce decree was entered, and thus, an Ohio court maintained continuing and exclusive jurisdiction; there was no information indicating the Ohio court’s consideration under the statute, nor did the parties assert that a motion was made to determine whether the Ohio court was a convenient forum.

       Chancery court lacked authority to modify an Arizona custody determination based on the mother’s residence in Arizona because Mississippi did not have the ability to make an initial custody determination; Arizona had been the children’s home for the entirety of their lives until they came to Mississippi, and at the time the father filed his suit, he and the children had been in Mississippi for only a couple of months and had not established a connection with Mississippi beyond their presence.

       Chancellor was not obligated to stay the Mississippi proceedings to modify the New York visitation order simply because the father had taken preliminary steps to perfect his New York appeal, and the chancellor did not err when he heard the mother’s complaint despite the father’s then-unperfected New York appeal as, under Mississippi law, a chancellor could modify another state’s visitation order under certain circumstances; and it was within a Mississippi court’s discretion to go forward with a proceeding to modify a child custody determination – which included aspects of a noncustodial parent’s visitation – when there was a similar proceeding in another state.

       Chancellor was not obligated to stay the Mississippi proceedings to modify the New York visitation order simply because the father had taken preliminary steps to perfect his New York appeal, and the chancellor did not err when he heard the mother’s complaint despite the father’s then-unperfected New York appeal as, under Mississippi law, a chancellor could modify another state’s visitation order under certain circumstances; and it was within a Mississippi court’s discretion to go forward with a proceeding to modify a child custody determination – which included aspects of a noncustodial parent’s visitation – when there was a similar proceeding in another state.

Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c23s93-23-11" target="_self">93-23-11</a></cite> did not prohibit assertion of jurisdiction by the Mississippi courts over the temporary custody and adoption of the child.

       A chancery court had continuing jurisdiction of a child custody matter, despite the fact that the mother and the children had established residency in Louisiana, where pleadings had been pending before the court almost constantly since the parties were initially divorced, the mother had continued to use the court to enforce her rights under the decrees, and the Mississippi court had assumed jurisdiction before any proceeding was begun in Louisiana.

       A court of this state which has jurisdiction under this chapter to make a child custody determination may decline to exercise its jurisdiction at any time if it determines that it is an inconvenient forum under the circumstances and that a court of another state is a more appropriate forum.

   In a case in which a mother appealed an order by a chancery court transferring child custody jurisdiction to Texas under the Uniform Child Custody and Jurisdiction Enforcement Act (UCCJEA), Miss. Code Ann §§<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c27s93-27-101" target="_self">93-27-101</a></cite> through<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c27s93-27-402" target="_self">93-27-402</a></cite>, and denying her motion to reconsider the transfer of jurisdiction, under both the UCCJEA and the Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act of 1980, although the chancellor had continuing jurisdiction over the case, substantial evidence in the record supported his finding that Texas was a more convenient forum than Mississippi. The two children suffered domestic violence while in the mother’s care; the children had lived in Texas with the father since 2004, only returning to Mississippi for court-ordered visitation; the distance between the court in Mississippi and the court in Texas was roughly an eight-hour drive; and all of the current evidence relevant to the determination of custody matters was located in Texas.

       In a divorce and child custody case, the husband’s argument that Mississippi was an inconvenient state failed because a letter he wrote established that not only was he aware of his family’s Mississippi residency, but he was also not opposed to it. Jundoosing v. Jundoosing, 826 So. 2d 85, 2002 Miss. LEXIS 283 (Miss. 2002).
      </p>
      <p>
       The chancellor improperly found that it would not be in the best interest of the children to exercise jurisdiction in Mississippi where (1) at the time of their divorce, the parents were both on active duty in the Navy, and the decree granted joint custody, with paramount custody and control to the parent with shore duty, and (2) the wife subsequently left the Navy and moved to Maryland with the children; unilateral action by the wife would not be permitted to be used as a valid justification for declining the exercise of jurisdiction in Mississippi. Hasse v. Shane, 717 So. 2d 718, 1998 Miss. LEXIS 339 (Miss. 1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   The application of the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act in a dispute over jurisdiction between 2 states is a 3 step process. A court must first determine if it has authority, or jurisdiction, to act following the guidelines of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c23s93-23-5" target="_self">93-23-5</a></cite>. If a court determines that it does not have jurisdiction, the process stops there. However, if that hurdle is cleared, a determination is made as to which court is the more appropriate and convenient forum under the guidelines of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c23s93-23-13" target="_self">93-23-13</a></cite>. A court may decline to exercise jurisdiction if it is not the most appropriate or convenient forum. If the court accepts jurisdiction as the convenient forum, the court must determine if the action to be taken is foreclosed by an order or judgment of the other state court. Stowers v. Humphrey, 576 So. 2d 138, 1991 Miss. LEXIS 56 (Miss. 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   While a court that enters an original custody decree has jurisdiction to subsequently modify the decree separate and apart from the jurisdictional section of the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act, (UCCJA), the continuing jurisdiction of a court is affected by the application of the UCCJA. Thus, although the Mississippi court that entered the original divorce and custody decree, which gave the mother custody of the parties’ 2 minor children, had continuing jurisdiction over the case, the court properly stayed proceedings to modify the custody decree on the finding that Mississippi was an inconvenient forum under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c23s93-23-13" target="_self">93-23-13</a></cite> and that Alabama was the most appropriate forum, where the mother and children had lived in Alabama for 21/2 years, and evidence concerning the effects of visitation with the father was more readily available in Alabama than in Mississippi. Stowers v. Humphrey, 576 So. 2d 138, 1991 Miss. LEXIS 56 (Miss. 1991).
      </p>

   Mississippi was not an inconvenient forum under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c23s93-23-13" target="_self">93-23-13</a></cite> to hear a child custody modification petition brought by the children’s father, even though the children resided with their mother in California, where evidence was presented demonstrating that there was an immediate threat to the best interest of the parties’ children. Castleberry v. Castleberry, 541 So. 2d 457, 1989 Miss. LEXIS 164 (Miss. 1989).
      </p>

   Chancellor should first determine, before considering actions taken by Louisiana court, whether Mississippi Chancery Court has authority to act under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c23s93-23-5" target="_self">93-23-5</a></cite> if this section gives him authority to exercise jurisdiction, Chancellor must next determine which state is more appropriate and convenient forum under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c23s93-23-13" target="_self">93-23-13</a></cite>; if both requirements would otherwise be sufficiently present to give Chancery Court jurisdiction, in view of posture of this case in Louisiana court, Chancellor under Act is further required to determine whether modification of original custody decree by Chancery Court is foreclosed by order or judgment of Louisiana court. Hobbs v. Hobbs, 508 So. 2d 677, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2597 (Miss. 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       Texas is appropriate forum and Mississippi should decline jurisdiction in case in which noncustodial parent files motion to modify Mississippi child custody judgment where children have resided in Texas for period of year prior to initiation of action and for 2 years prior to date of trial, notwithstanding presence of one child in Mississippi prior to trial or at time of filing, which child has been retained in Mississippi in violation of existing, valid decree, and where practically all witnesses and evidence of any substantial change adversely affecting children’s future care, protection and training lie within borders of Texas.

       Chancery court properly retained jurisdiction over a modification of custody case because Mississippi had continuous, exclusive jurisdiction over the matter since it entered the initial child-custody order, not because of any alleged unjustifiable conduct on the part of the father.

   Although a chancery court had temporary emergency jurisdiction to hear the complaint of a father, who had kidnapped his children from their mother, alleging substantial neglect and abuse, the court erred when it continued to exercise jurisdiction over the matter after it should reasonably have become apparent that there was no clear and present danger to the children from permitting adjudication of modification, if any, of their custody in the courts of another state which originally granted custody of the children to the mother. Mississippi was not the children’s “home state,” even though they had lived in Mississippi for over 6 consecutive months, since the father brought the children to Mississippi in contravention of a valid custody decree of another state and the children remained in Mississippi by virtue of the chancery court’s custody and protective order; such court-ordered involuntary residence does not generate “so much as a single tick of the UCCJA’s 6 consecutive months clock.” Additionally, the father and the children did not have a “significant connection” with Mississippi, within the meaning of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c23s93-23-5" target="_self">93-23-5</a></cite>, by virtue of the fact that they had lived in Mississippi for over 6 months at the time of the hearing, where they had been in Mississippi for only one or 2 days prior to the time the father filed the original application for modification of custody. In light of the UCCJA’s dominant purpose of preventing interstate parental kidnapping and §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c23s93-23-15" target="_self">93-23-15</a></cite>’s strong injunction against wrongfully taking children from one state to another, the father and the children were required to “have a significant connection” with Mississippi prior to the filing of the application for custody modification, and their presence in Mississippi for one or 2 days was not a “significant connection” within the meaning of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c23s93-23-5" target="_self">93-23-5</a></cite>(1)(b).

   Arizona court lacks jurisdiction under either Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act (28 USCS § 1738A) or under Mississippi Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act (§§<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c23s93-23-1" target="_self">93-23-1</a></cite> et seq.) over child custody proceeding, and any custody decree entered by Arizona court is not entitled to full faith and credit, where prior to commencement of Arizona action, child custody proceeding has been commenced under act in Mississippi and child involved in proceeding has been abducted from natural mother in Mississippi by grandparent and stepgrandparent; result is not changed by fact that Arizona decree is entered by stipulation where Arizona decree is entered without hearing on best interests of child and Arizona proceedings are not substantially in accordance with act and do not meet its jurisdictional standards.

       In the father’s petition to modify custody, he could not provide the information of the child’s whereabouts because he was unaware of where the mother and child were residing at that time, and the mother claimed she did not reveal her addressed due to Alabama protection orders; any failure to provide this information was not fatal to jurisdiction, and it was within the discretion of the chancellor to go forward with the proceeding.

Const. art.

   As the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act (UCCJA) has only limited applicability to contested adoptions in certain cases, the failure to attach the Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c23s93-23-17" target="_self">93-23-17</a></cite> residency affidavit to an adoption complaint did not defeat jurisdiction where the chancellor allowed the adoptive parents to use the natural mother’s affidavit which was included in her complaint to revoke consent to the adoption.

   Timely compliance with Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c23s93-23-17" target="_self">93-23-17</a></cite> upon filing an initial complaint is essential to facilitate a proper determination of the court’s jurisdiction but failure to do so will not necessarily impair the court’s exercise of jurisdiction if appropriately cured by a timely amendment; a court may validly exercise its jurisdiction if the omitted information is timely supplied by amendment of the pleading or by affidavit annexed to a motion to amend.

       Absence of statutory disclosures was waived by the failure to point it out to the trial court, at least where no indication was given that there were other proceedings that the chancellor needed to consider. Robison v. Lanford, 2001 Miss. App. LEXIS 499 (Miss. Ct. App. Dec. 4, 2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       Statement in a custody modification motion regarding whether other custody proceedings had been previously held or were currently occurring and whether someone else not a party had physical custody of the child was not required on appeal where no objection had been raised before the trial court, and there was no indication that there actually were other proceedings the trial court needed to consider. Robison v. Lanford, 850 So. 2d 91, 2001 Miss. App. LEXIS 253 (Miss. Ct. App. 2001).

   Chancellor should first determine, before considering actions taken by Louisiana court, whether Mississippi Chancery Court has authority to act under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c23s93-23-5" target="_self">93-23-5</a></cite> [repealed]; if this section gives him authority to exercise jurisdiction, Chancellor must next determine which state is more appropriate and convenient forum under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t93c23s93-23-13" target="_self">93-23-13</a></cite>; if both requirements would otherwise be sufficiently present to give Chancery Court jurisdiction, in view of posture of this case in Louisiana court, Chancellor under Act is further required to determine whether modification of original custody decree by Chancery Court is foreclosed by order or judgment of Louisiana court.

    Provisions and measures to prevent abduction.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      If a petition is filed under this chapter, the court may enter an order that must include:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t93c29s93-29-15ol11">
       The basis for the court’s exercise of jurisdiction;

       A detailed description of each party’s custody and visitation rights and residential arrangements for the child;
      </li>

       A provision stating that a violation of the order may subject the party in violation to civil and criminal penalties; and
      </li>
      <li id="t93c29s93-29-15ol15">
       Identification of the child’s country of habitual residence at the time of the issuance of the order.
      </li>
      <li id="t93c29s93-29-15ol16">
       Upon the petitioner’s request, a requirement that the respondent obtain an order from the relevant foreign country containing terms identical to the child-custody determination issued in the United States.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      If, at a hearing on a petition under this chapter or on the court’s own motion, the court after reviewing the evidence finds a credible risk of abduction of the child, the court shall enter an abduction prevention order. The order must include the provisions required by subsection (a) and measures and conditions, including those in subsections (c), (d) and (e), that are reasonably calculated to prevent abduction of the child, giving due consideration to the custody and visitation rights of the parties. The court shall consider the age of the child, the potential harm to the child from an abduction, the legal and practical difficulties of returning the child to the jurisdiction if abducted and the reasons for the potential abduction, including evidence of domestic violence, stalking or child abuse or neglect.
     </p>
     <p>
      An abduction prevention order may include one or more of the following:
     </p>
     <p>
      An imposition of travel restrictions that require that a party traveling with the child outside a designated geographical area provide the other party with the following:
     </p>
     <p>
      The travel itinerary of the child;
     </p>
     <p>
      A list of physical addresses and telephone numbers at which the child can be reached at specified times; and
     </p>
     <p>
      Copies of all travel documents;
     </p>
     <p>
      A prohibition of the respondent directly or indirectly:
     </p>
     <p>
      Removing the child from this state, the United States or another geographic area without permission of the court or the petitioner’s written consent;
     </p>
     <p>
      Removing or retaining the child in violation of a child-custody determination;
     </p>
     <p>
      Removing the child from school or a child-care or similar facility; or
     </p>
     <p>
      Approaching the child at any location other than a site designated for supervised visitation;
     </p>
     <p>
      A requirement that a party register the order in another state as a prerequisite to allowing the child to travel to that state;
     </p>
     <p>
      With regard to the child’s passport:
     </p>
     <p>
      A direction that the petitioner place the child’s name in the United States Department of State’s Child Passport Issuance Alert Program;
     </p>
     <p>
      A requirement that the respondent surrender to the court or the petitioner’s attorney any United States or foreign passport issued in the child’s name, including a passport issued in the name of both the parent and the child; and
     </p>
     <p>
      A prohibition upon the respondent from applying on behalf of the child for a new or replacement passport or visa;
     </p>
     <p>
      As a prerequisite to exercising custody or visitation, a requirement that the respondent provide:
     </p>
     <p>
      To the United States Department of State Office of Children’s Issues and the relevant foreign consulate or embassy, an authenticated copy of the order detailing passport and travel restrictions for the child;
     </p>
     <p>
      To the court:
     </p>
     <p>
      Proof that the respondent has provided the information in subparagraph (A); and
     </p>
     <p>
      An acknowledgment in a record from the relevant foreign consulate or embassy that no passport application has been made, or passport issued, on behalf of the child;
     </p>
     <p>
      To the petitioner, proof of registration with the United States Embassy or other United States diplomatic presence in the destination country and with the Central Authority for the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction, if that convention is in effect between the United States and the destination country, unless one (1) of the parties objects; and
     </p>
     <p>
      A written waiver under the Privacy Act, 5 USCS Section 552a as amended, with respect to any document, application or other information pertaining to the child authorizing its disclosure to the court and the petitioner; and
     </p>
     <p>
      In an abduction prevention order, the court may impose conditions on the exercise of custody or visitation that:
     </p>
     <p>
      Limit visitation or require that visitation with the child by the respondent be supervised until the court finds that supervision is no longer necessary and order the respondent to pay the costs of supervision;
     </p>
     <p>
      Require the respondent to post a bond or provide other security in an amount sufficient to serve as a financial deterrent to abduction, the proceeds of which may be used to pay for the reasonable expenses of recovery of the child, including reasonable attorney’s fees and costs if there is an abduction; and
     </p>
     <p>
      Require the respondent to obtain education on the potentially harmful effects to the child from abduction.
     </p>
     <p>
      To prevent imminent abduction of a child, a court may:
     </p>
     <p>
      Issue a warrant to take physical custody of the child under Section 93-29-17 or the law of this state other than this chapter;
     </p>
     <p>
      Direct the use of law enforcement to take any action reasonably necessary to locate the child, obtain return of the child or enforce a custody determination under this chapter or the law of this state other than this chapter; or
     </p>
     <p>
      Grant any other relief allowed under the law of this state other than this chapter.
     </p>
     <p>
      The remedies provided in this chapter are cumulative and do not affect the availability of other remedies to prevent abduction.

       § 93-29-17.
    Warrant to take physical custody of child.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      If a petition under this chapter contains allegations, and the court finds that there is a credible risk that the child is imminently likely to be wrongfully removed, the court may issue an ex parte warrant to take physical custody of the child.
     </p>
     <p>
      The respondent on a petition under subsection (a) must be afforded an opportunity to be heard at the earliest possible time after the ex parte warrant is executed, but not later than the next judicial day unless a hearing on that date is impossible. In that event, the court shall hold the hearing on the first judicial day possible.
     </p>
     <p>
      An ex parte warrant under subsection (a) to take physical custody of a child must:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t93c29s93-29-17ol11">
       Recite the facts upon which a determination of a credible risk of imminent wrongful removal of the child is based;
      </li>
      <li id="t93c29s93-29-17ol12">
       Direct law enforcement officers to take physical custody of the child immediately;
      </li>
      <li id="t93c29s93-29-17ol13">
       State the date and time for the hearing on the petition; and
      </li>
      <li id="t93c29s93-29-17ol14">
       Provide for the safe interim placement of the child pending further order of the court.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      If feasible, before issuing a warrant and before determining the placement of the child after the warrant is executed, the court may order a search of the relevant databases of the National Crime Information Center system and similar state databases to determine if either the petitioner or respondent has a history of domestic violence, stalking or child abuse or neglect.
     </p>
     <p>
      The petition and warrant must be served on the respondent when or immediately after the child is taken into physical custody.
     </p>
     <p>
      A warrant to take physical custody of a child, issued by this state or another state, is enforceable throughout this state. If the court finds that a less intrusive remedy will not be effective, it may authorize law enforcement officers to enter private property to take physical custody of the child. If required by exigent circumstances, the court may authorize law enforcement officers to make a forcible entry at any hour.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the court finds, after a hearing, that a petitioner sought an ex parte warrant under subsection (a) for the purpose of harassment or in bad faith, the court may award the respondent reasonable attorney’s fees, costs and expenses.
     </p>
     <p>
      This chapter does not affect the availability of relief allowed under the law of this state other than this chapter.
