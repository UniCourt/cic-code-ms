       A right-of-way easement granted to the Mississippi State Highway Commission for a specific public right-of-way of a certain highway ceased to exist when the commission determined that a portion of that easement was no longer needed by the public. Thus, the commission could not convey the fee simple title to the property, but could only abandon its easement. Mississippi State Highway Com. v. McClure, 536 So. 2d 895, 1988 Miss.

       Purchase of insurance is not to be construed as waiver by legislature of highway commission’s immunity from suit. Brady v. Michelin Reifenwerke, 613 F. Supp. 1076, 1985 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17616 (S.D. Miss. 1985).

      <p>
       In an action for wrongful death arising out of an accident on a drawbridge, the complaints against the Mississippi State Highway Commission and its individual employees were properly dismissed under the doctrine of sovereign immunity where the statute did not specifically impose liability in such cases; there was no waiver of the doctrine of sovereign immunity as to the individual defendants by the purchase of fidelity bonds. However, where it was unclear whether the trial judge, in dismissing the complaints, was ruling on the claims against the employees of the Commission in their official capacity or as individuals and where the judge did not address the issue of whether the actions complained of were ministerial or discretionary, the case would be remanded for a determination of whether the doctrine of sovereign immunity shielded the employees of the Commission in their individual capacities. The partial immunity afforded a public official only extends to discretionary acts; a public official remains liable in his individual capacity for ministerial acts. Karpovs v. Mississippi, 663 F.2d 640, 1981 U.S. App. LEXIS 15286 (5th Cir. Miss. 1981).

       The trial court in eminent domain proceedings instituted by the Mississippi State Highway Commission erred in allowing the condemnees to introduce evidence concerning loss of access to an adjoining highway, where the Commission had previously received warranty deeds from the condemnees’ predecessors in title for the purpose of four-laning the highway and locating a sight flare at an adjacent intersection, where the Commission’s payment for the lands so acquired by the predecessors was for “all” surface rights which the grantors and their successors had in the lands conveyed including the right to drive vehicles across the lands, where such purchase of the sight flare area subjected it to control by the Commission under its police powers as set forth in this section, and where the Commission previously promulgated a rule prohibiting driveway access across sight flare areas.

       The adoption by the highway commission of an order under subsection (h) of Code 1942, § 8038 declaring a certain highway a limited access highway, the publication of notice of the adoption of the order, and the erection at various places along the highway of “limited access highway” markers amounted neither to an entry, a trespass, or an ouster by the commission, nor was it effective as a taking of the right of an abutting property owner to direct access to the highway in question.

      </p>
      <p>
       The adoption of a declaratory order by the state highway commission wherein a certain highway was designated as a limited access highway did not amount to a taking of an abutting property owner’s right of direct and free access to the highway, nor did it obviate the constitutional necessity of paying just compensation and damages when and if it actually should be taken or damaged.

       Where the construction of a frontage road paralleling a limited access highway will substantially impair or damage an abutting property owner’s right of access to the highway in question and will effectively destroy his right of direct and free access thereto as it had previously existed, he is entitled to be compensated for this loss of access as well as for the value of a small parcel of land which will be embraced within the frontage road’s easement.

      <p>
       Where a new nonaccess highway was constructed outside the right of way of an old highway, the abutting property owners could not require the state highway commission to maintain direct accesses from their property into the through lanes of the new highway, where the commission provided the abutting property owners with reasonably safe and convenient accesses from all of their abutting property to the highway by means of a frontage road and reasonably convenient interchanges; and such action on the part of the state highway commission was a reasonable exercise of the police power of the state in the interest of the protection of human life and the regulation of public traffic.

       Provision of lease for office space executed by highway director which purported to bind highway commission for three-year period on commission’s failure to give notice to terminate lease held not binding on highway commission where commission authorized execution of only two-year lease, and did not ratify lease provision by order on its minutes.

      Whereas, the public convenience requires that certain roads located on levees or within the boundaries of flood control districts created and presently maintained by the federal government, or other governmental authorities, be taken over temporarily by the State Highway Commission, and whereas, the public purpose for which said flood control districts were established requires that such roads be limited to certain widths and restrictions in the public interest, it is the sense of the legislature that the State Highway Commission should be authorized to take over and maintain such roads as temporary state highways, subject to the restrictions imposed by the governmental authorities establishing such flood control districts.
     </p>
     <p>
      The State Highway Commission, therefore, is hereby authorized to take over and maintain as temporary state highways, for such period and under such terms and conditions as said highway commission may in its discretion prescribe, any road designated by the legislature as a state highway and located on the levee of a flood control district, and in so doing shall not be required to obtain a right of way of more than thirty feet on such type of road, may permit the use of cattle gaps and fencing thereon, and may accept from the federal authorities or other governmental unit having jurisdiction over such flood control district an easement for said road.
     </p>

      </li>
      <li id="t65c01s65-1-46ol12">
       The members serving on the Appeals Board on April 7, 1995, shall continue to serve until July 1, 1995.

Any member serving on the Appeals Board before July 1, 1995, may be reappointed to the reconstituted appeals board. Appointments to the board shall be with the advice and consent of the Senate; however, the advice and consent of the Senate shall not be required for the appointment of a person to the reconstituted appeals board for a term beginning on July 1, 1995, if such person was serving as a member of the Appeals Board on June 30, 1995, and such person received the advice and consent of the Senate for that appointment.

      <li id="t65c01s65-1-46ol13">
       There shall be a chairman and vice chairman of the board who shall be elected by and from the membership of the board. Any member who fails to attend three (3) consecutive regular meetings of the board shall be subject to removal by a majority vote of the board. A majority of the members of the board shall constitute a quorum. The chairman, or a majority of the members of the board, may call meetings as may be required for the proper discharge of the board’s duties.

       <p>
        Application shall be made by petition in writing, within thirty (30) days after assessment of the penalty, for a hearing and a review of the amount of the assessment. At the hearing the Appeals Board shall try the issues presented according to the law and the facts and within guidelines set by the Transportation Commission. Upon due consideration of all the facts relating to the assessment of the penalty, the appeals board, except as otherwise provided under this section or under Section 27-19-89, may require payment of the full amount of the assessment, may reduce the amount of the assessment or may dismiss imposition of the penalty entirely. The Appeals Board shall dismiss in its entirety the imposition of any penalty imposed against the holder of a harvest permit if the permittee proves to the Appeals Board, by clear and convincing evidence, that the average load transported by the permittee during the permittee’s last five (5) haul days immediately preceding the day upon which the penalty appealed from was assessed did not exceed eighty thousand (80,000) pounds. The Appeals Board shall reduce the penalty assessed against the holder of a harvest permit to a maximum of Two Cents (2¢) per pound of overweight if the permittee proves to the Appeals Board, by clear and convincing evidence, that the average load transported by the permittee during the permittee’s last five (5) haul days immediately preceding the day upon which the penalty appealed from was assessed exceeded seventy-nine thousand nine hundred ninety-nine (79,999) pounds but did not exceed eighty-four thousand (84,000) pounds. The board shall make such orders in the matter as appear to it just and lawful and shall furnish copies thereof to the petitioner. If the Appeals Board orders the payment of the penalty, the petitioner shall pay the penalty, damages and interest, if any, within ten (10) days after the order is issued unless there is an application for appeal from the decision of the board as provided in the succeeding paragraph. Interest shall accrue on the penalty at the rate of one percent (1%) per month, or part of a month, beginning immediately after the expiration of the ten-day period.

       § 65-1-47.
    Control of highways; eminent domain.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The State Highway Commission shall have complete authority to issue rules, regulations and orders under which the State Highway Department shall have control and supervision, with full power and authority under rules, regulations and orders issued by the commission, to locate, relocate, widen, alter, change, straighten, construct or reconstruct any and all roads on the state highway system heretofore or hereafter taken over by it for maintenance as a part of such system, and shall have full and complete authority for regulating the making of all contracts, surveys, plans, specifications and estimates for the location, laying out, widening, straightening, altering, changing, constructing, reconstructing and maintaining of and the securing of rights-of-way for any and all such highways, and to authorize the employees of the State Highway Department to enter upon private property for such purposes.
     </p>
     <p>
      The State Highway Department, under the rules, regulations and orders spread upon the minutes of the State Highway Commission, is authorized and empowered to obtain and pay for the rights-of-way of such width as it may determine to be necessary for such highway or for any alteration or change therein or relocation thereof by agreement with the owners of such lands. Rights-of-way of not less than sixty (60) feet wide shall be acquired except within the boundaries of towns and cities where unusual conditions exist, in which case the commission is authorized and empowered to have obtained and paid for such rights-of-way of such width as it may determine to be necessary. Said commission may have condemned any and all land or other property needed for such purposes or either of them; may have condemned or acquired by gift or purchase lands containing road building materials and develop and operate pits, mines or other properties for the purpose of obtaining road material; and have condemned or acquired by gift or purchase lands necessary for the safety and convenience of traffic.
     </p>
     <p>
      Said commission, in case an agreement cannot be reached with the owners of land containing road building materials or of any additional land necessary for widening any existing public highways, for laying out a new public highway, or for changing the route of an existing public highway, as provided in the foregoing part of this section, shall be authorized to have condemned any land needed for either of said purposes, as is fully set forth in this section. The proceedings to acquire such lands by a condemnation shall be in conformity with the statutes on the subject of “eminent domain,” the power of eminent domain being hereby expressly conferred upon said commission for such purposes. Such proceedings shall take precedence over all other causes not involving the public interest in all courts and shall be given preference to the end that construction and reconstruction of highways hereunder may not be unreasonably delayed. The amount of such compensation and damages, if any, awarded to the owner in such proceedings shall be paid out of the State Highway Fund. The authorities constructing such highway, under the authority as provided in this section, shall use diligence to protect growing crops and pastures and to prevent damage to any property not taken. So far as possible, all rights-of-way shall be acquired or contracted for before any construction contract work order is issued.
     </p>
     <p>
      The estate which the State Highway Commission is authorized to acquire by deed or condemnation as set forth above shall include all rights, title and interest in and to the lands or property being acquired, excepting and excluding all the oil and gas therein or thereunder and such other rights, title or interest which are expressly excepted and reserved to the property owner, his successors, heirs or assigns in the deed or condemnation petition by which the property is acquired. Any property interest acquired may be in unlimited vertical dimension. The State Highway Commission shall decide what right, title and interest are necessary for highway purposes on each particular project and may, by order on its minutes, authorize its agents to expressly except all or any others.

       A court is without power to close a public road in private litigation between individuals unless such action is predicated upon a finding that there has been a valid order of the Board of Supervisors closing the road, spread upon its minutes, if it is a county road, or that similar official action has been taken by the State Highway Commission and is reflected by its official records, if it is a state road or highway.

       Taking of property alongside a highway for the purpose of constructing a weighing scale to enforce the regulations regarding weights of loads and vehicles is within the contemplation of the eminent domain statutes.

   Taking of the school’s property in order to expand a state highway was necessary, under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t65c01s65-1-47" target="_self">65-1-47</a></cite>, for the safety and convenience of the traveling public, and this constituted a proper use of the transportation commission’s eminent domain power.

      <p>
       An order by the highway commission designating the name of the record title owner and his successors in title of the land sought to be acquired was sufficient to authorize proceedings in eminent domain in which all of the persons claiming an interest should have been named.

       In an eminent domain proceeding, the state highway commission is bound by its appraiser, and a judgment which is less than the commission’s appraiser’s estimate will be increased by the amount of difference.

       Statutes conferring upon the state highway commission the power of eminent domain do not limit the power to the taking of such property as is needed or necessary, inasmuch as the effect of this legislation is to vest the broad discretion in the highway commission in selecting its routes and other details.

       Whatever reservation the state highway commission could lawfully allow in a deed from the owner, they may allow and stipulate in the petition for condemnation, and when so stipulated, the terms thereof are as binding upon the commission as if the same stipulations had been contained in a deed from the owner, as against the contention that inasmuch as the section provides for the condemnation of the land, the interest condemned must be of the entire land without any reservation whatever. Dantzler v. Mississippi State Highway Com., 190 Miss. 137, 199 So. 367, 1941 Miss. LEXIS 42 (Miss. 1941).

       A condemnor of a right of way for a public road does not take the entire fee in the land, all other rights consistent with the existence of the easement for road purposes remaining in the original owner.

      </p>
      <p>
       Code 1942, § 8023 required as a condition precedent to a condemnation of land by the highway commission that an attempt first be made to agree with the owner; and while this effort had to be in good faith and on reasonable terms, the attempt need not have been pursued further than to develop the fact that an agreement was impossible at any price which the condemning party was willing to pay. Dantzler v. Mississippi State Highway Com., 190 Miss. 137, 199 So. 367, 1941 Miss. LEXIS 42 (Miss. 1941).
      </p>
      <p>
       The charge of arbitrariness or want of good faith on the part of the highway commission as regards an offer made by it for a strip of land for the construction of a highway, was refuted where it was evident from the record in the eminent domain proceeding that no prolongation of the effort of the commission to agree with the owner would have produced an agreement, save on terms which the commission would have regarded as requiring an unjust payment out of public funds which it was their duty to endeavor to conserve, and the verdict in the eminent domain proceedings awarding the sum offered by the commission could be pointed to as a sufficient refutation of the charge. Dantzler v. Mississippi State Highway Com., 190 Miss. 137, 199 So. 367, 1941 Miss. LEXIS 42 (Miss. 1941).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence in eminent domain proceeding of the price paid in settlement of other condemnation proceedings or the sum paid by the condemnor for similar lands, even if proceedings had not been begun is not admissible, such payments being in the nature of compromise to avoid the expense and uncertainty of litigation and not fair indication of market value. Dantzler v. Mississippi State Highway Com., 190 Miss. 137, 199 So. 367, 1941 Miss. LEXIS 42 (Miss. 1941).

       Landowners were entitled to recover compensation from state highway commission for strip of land taken for state highway without condemnation or compensation, as against contention of commission that it was not at time of taking of land a corporation so that it could be sued, where commission was thereafter incorporated, since trespass was continuing one so that cause of action arose when commission was incorporated.

     <p>
      It shall be the duty of the Highway Commission to issue rules and regulations for the State Highway Department to construct all secondary roads, when taken over for construction and maintenance, up to such standard of specifications and with such surfacing material as the Highway Commission may determine from a traffic census of the use and importance thereof as would be justified from a standpoint of economy and convenience to the traveling public. To this end the Highway Commission is authorized, in dealing with said secondary roads, to have the highway department place surfacing material on said secondary roads. All secondary roads shall be constructed and maintained with a view of being eventually hard surfaced as provided for primary roads.

       It shall be the duty of the Mississippi Transportation Commission to have the Mississippi Transportation Department carry out all contracts and agreements, including federal-aid projects and agreements under the County Highway Aid Law of 1946, being Sections 65-11-1 through 65-11-37, heretofore made or entered into with any county, subject, however, to applicable rules and regulations of the Federal Highway Administration. It shall be the duty of the Transportation Commission to continue to have the Mississippi Transportation Department maintain all state highways now under maintenance or hereafter taken over for maintenance, the purpose of this provision being to preserve the status quo of all state highways insofar as such highways have been taken over and control and jurisdiction has been assumed by the Mississippi Transportation Commission and Mississippi Transportation Department; however, except as otherwise provided in this section, if any highway or link of highway is removed from the state highway system by legislative act or by relocation or reconstruction, it shall no longer be maintained by or be under the jurisdiction of the Mississippi Transportation Commission or Mississippi Transportation Department, but shall be returned to the jurisdiction of the board of supervisors of the county or governing authorities of the municipality through which such road runs. Except as to segments of highways shorter than three (3) miles which have been or which are hereafter replaced through curve straightening or minor realignment, the Transportation Commission shall retain and have the Mississippi Transportation Department maintain as state highways all portions of U.S. highways that either before or after July 1, 1989, have been or are replaced and constructed as a part of the interstate highway system, or four-lane primary system, or which are replaced and constructed or are designated to be replaced and constructed as part of the highway system under Section 65-3-97, including portions of all such highways so replaced, or which under Section 65-3-97 are designated to be replaced, by municipal bypasses; and such highways and portions thereof shall be continued to be maintained as a part of the Mississippi state highway system until removed from such system by legislative act. All such highways and portions thereof which, by virtue of the provisions of this section, are returned on or after July 1, 1989, to the jurisdiction of the Mississippi Transportation Commission shall be maintained by the Mississippi Transportation Department only to the traffic capacities existing at the time that they are returned and any subsequent traffic capacity improvements or other improvements desired by the county or municipality within which such highway or portion thereof is located shall be performed in accordance with highway standards approved by the Transportation Commission and the expenses for making such improvements shall be paid by the county or municipality; however, all highways and portions thereof so improved by the county or municipality shall thereafter be maintained by the Mississippi Transportation Department. Before any highway or portion thereof is returned to the Transportation Commission under this section, the county or municipality having jurisdiction thereof shall remove or cause to be removed by July 1, 1991, all right-of-way encroachments along the entire length of the highway or portion thereof which are not permitted by Transportation Commission and Transportation Department policies and rules and regulations adopted pursuant to state and federal law. Any such encroachments may be allowed to remain only by permits issued by the Mississippi Transportation Department in the manner and subject to the same conditions for the issuance of permits for similar encroachments on other highways on the state highway system. If traffic counts indicate that any highway or portions thereof placed under the jurisdiction of the Transportation Commission under the provisions of this section no longer form a substantial part of the state highway system, the Transportation Commission may request the Legislature to remove such highways or portions thereof from the state highway system and return said roads for maintenance to the county or municipality in which they are located, as provided in subsection (2) of this section. The highways which the Transportation Department is required to continue to maintain by virtue of the provisions of this section shall be in addition to the total mileage limitation of eight thousand six hundred (8,600) miles provided in Section 65-3-3.

       Though the Mississippi Department of Transportation was not immune from suit, as the trial court properly found that a five to six inch drop-off on the edge of a road was a dangerous condition that was not obvious, which was created by the negligence of the Department and of which the Department knew but failed to warn against, the trial court erred by not assessing some degree of fault to plaintiff driver, who had been obliged to exercise vigilant caution when she learned the road was under construction.

     <p>
      The State Highway Commission is hereby authorized, empowered, and directed to have the State Highway Department trim with edge lines, of a color and in a manner which conforms with uniform national standards relating thereto which have been adopted by the Federal Highway Administration, the edges of all state-designated hard-surfaced highways which are constructed of asphaltic material, in the interest of public safety on said highways. The commission is authorized and directed to have the highway department utilize its engineers and other highway department employees and to expend available public funds for carrying out the intent and purposes of this section.
     </p>
     <p>
      Except as necessary to accommodate reconstruction, no road or highway shall be opened for public use until the department has complied with the provisions of this section; however, the Director of the State Highway Department may permit segments of roads under contract for maintenance, construction or reconstruction to be open for public use when temporary center line markings are installed. Roadside pennant signs may be used in place of temporary center line markings in no passing lanes on seal-coated roads. All such temporary center lines or roadside pennant signs shall, as nearly as practicable, be in place before work is discontinued for the day or as soon thereafter as weather conditions permit.

     <p>
      Whenever any railroad and state highway or part thereof shall cross each other at the same level and, in the opinion of the State Highway Commission, such crossing is dangerous to public safety or traffic is unreasonably impeded thereby and such crossing should be removed, the State Highway Commission may order such crossing eliminated either by having the State Highway Department carry such state highway under or over the tracks of such railroad.

When plans have been approved, such proposed work shall be advertised and contract awarded as elsewhere provided in this chapter for the advertising and awarding of contracts. Joint supervision of construction may be had by both the State Highway Department and the railroad company. The state highway commission and the railroad company shall pay equal parts of the cost of any underpass or overpass across the right-of-way of the railroad company.

       The Mississippi Transportation Commission is authorized and empowered to have the Transportation Department locate, construct, reconstruct and maintain any designated state highway under its jurisdiction to, through, across or around any municipality in the state, regardless of the width of the street between curbs; and in so locating it is fully empowered to follow the route of the existing street or to depart therefrom, as in its discretion it deems advisable, and to obtain and pay for the necessary rights-of-way, as provided in Section 65-1-47. The municipality in which such construction is to be undertaken is likewise authorized to acquire rights-of-way on any such streets or on any newly located routes, either by purchase, gift or condemnation. Such rights-of-way may be acquired by either the municipality or the Transportation Department, subject to the approval of the commission, and the cost thereof may be borne by either or both as may be mutually agreed upon. In any event such municipality may be required to save the commission and department harmless from any claims for damages arising from the construction of the highway through such municipality, including claims for rights-of-way, change of grade line, interference with public structures, and any and all damages so arising. Municipalities may secure additional improvements by payment of the additional cost of same. The commission may require such municipality to cause to be laid all water, sewer, gas or other pipelines or conduits, together with all necessary house or lot connections or services, to the curb line of such road or street to be constructed, and the commission is authorized to refuse to have the department lay such pipelines or conduits beneath such roads or streets until the municipality has laid same or entered into an agreement to reimburse the commission or department for the expense thereby incurred.
      </li>
      <li id="t65c01s65-1-75ol12">
       All construction of state highways in or through municipalities, where done at the cost and expense of the state, whether heretofore or hereafter, shall be maintained in the same manner and to the same extent as is construction on state highways outside the limits of municipalities to the end that investment of the state in such highway so constructed may be preserved and maintained; and all reasonable rules and regulations with reference to the preservation and maintenance of such highways constructed at state expense, whether within or without municipal limits, may be promulgated by the commission, except that it shall have no power to promulgate police regulations contrary to existing law. On any municipal streets or parts or sections thereof taken over for regular maintenance and maintained by the department as a part of the state highway system, the municipality shall not be liable for negligence occasioned by the maintenance or repair of such streets thus apportioned to and of such width as is maintained by the department. The municipality shall have full control and responsibility beyond the curb lines of any designated highway or street, whether heretofore or hereafter so designated, (except the interstate system) located within its present or future expanded municipal corporate limits, regardless of the ownership of the right-of-way, including but not limited to, the construction and maintenance of sidewalks, grass mowing and drainage systems; however, the department may utilize the right-of-way purchased by the commission without any additional cost or permission.
       <p>
        The municipality shall not allow any encroachments, signs or billboards to be erected or to remain on state-owned rights-of-way on any designated highway within its corporate limits without the consent of the commission. The municipality, at its own expense, shall provide street illumination and shall clean all streets, including storm sewer inlets and catch basins. The commission may enter into an agreement with the municipality or with a private entity to sweep and clean the designated highways within or without the corporate limits. The commission may, at state expense, provide illumination and may clean all interstate highways within the corporate limits of any municipality. The right of the municipality to grant franchises over, beneath and upon such streets is specifically retained, but the municipality shall require every grantee of a franchise to restore, repair and replace to its original condition any portion of any such street damaged or injured by it; however, permission to open the surface of any municipal street maintained by the department must be obtained from both the commission and the municipality concerned before any such opening is made. Each municipality shall retain full police power over its streets, particularly as to regulating and enforcing traffic and parking restrictions on such streets, but any traffic control and parking regulations repugnant to state law shall be null and void. The commission shall have the department erect, control and maintain all highway route markers and directional signs on such streets at state expense. The commission, at state expense, shall have the department install, operate, maintain, control, and have full jurisdiction over, all traffic control devices, including, but not limited to, signals, signs, striping and lane markings on state highway streets in municipalities having a population of twenty thousand (20,000) or less according to the current U.S. census; but municipalities over twenty thousand (20,000) population according to such census shall install, operate, maintain and control such devices at their own expense, subject to approval of the executive director regarding operations, method of installation and type only. Municipalities having a population of five thousand (5,000) or more but less than twenty thousand (20,000) according to the most recent federal census shall only be responsible for electrical operating costs; and all other costs for the installation, operation and maintenance of traffic control devices, including the changing of signal bulbs in traffic signal lights, shall be the responsibility of the Transportation Department. The commission may purchase at state expense and install traffic control devices in municipalities over twenty thousand (20,000) population and donate them to the municipalities for operation and maintenance whenever it appears to the commission that, in the interest of safety or convenience of the motoring public, any of the devices should be upgraded, replaced or removed. Any revenue from parking meters on any such streets shall be controlled by and belong to the municipality.

       The maintenance of all streets within the limits of any municipality in this state, regardless of size, which are presently being regularly maintained, in whole or in part, by the department at state expense as a part or parts of any designated state highway shall be continued. Whenever any state highway runs into or through the corporate limits of any municipality, the municipal street or the street utilized and marked as a part of any such state highway may be a part of the state highway system and may be maintained by the department; however, such route through any municipality shall be selected by the commission by orders spread on its minutes describing all such routes, and such route or routes may be changed, relocated or abandoned by the commission from time to time, all under the provisions, terms and conditions herein provided, but the commission shall have the department maintain only one (1) route of any highway through a municipality. Upon relocation of such state highway or abandonment thereof, the municipal street formerly used as a state highway shall thereby return to the jurisdiction of, and maintenance by, the municipality.

     <ol>
      <li id="t65c01s65-1-85ol11">
       All contracts by or on behalf of the commission for the purchase of materials, equipment and supplies shall be made in compliance with Section 31-7-1 et seq. All contracts by or on behalf of the commission for construction, reconstruction or other public work authorized to be done under the provisions of this chapter, except maintenance, shall be made by the executive director, subject to the approval of the commission, only upon competitive bids after due advertisement as follows, to wit:
       <ol type="a">
        <li id="t65c01s65-1-85ol11a">
         Advertisement for bids shall be in accordance with such rules and regulations, in addition to those herein provided, as may be adopted therefor by the commission, and the commission is authorized and empowered to make and promulgate such rules and regulations as it may deem proper, to provide and adopt standard specifications for road and bridge construction, and to amend such rules and regulations from time to time.
        </li>
        <li id="t65c01s65-1-85ol11b">
         The advertisement shall be inserted twice, being once a week for two (2) successive weeks in a newspaper published at the seat of government in Jackson, Mississippi, having a general circulation throughout the state, and no letting shall be less than fourteen (14) days nor more than sixty (60) days after the publication of the first notice of such letting, and notices of such letting may be placed in a metropolitan paper or national trade publication.
        </li>
        <li id="t65c01s65-1-85ol11c">
         Before advertising for such work, the executive director shall cause to be prepared and filed in the department detailed plans and specifications covering the work proposed to be done and copies of the plans and specifications shall be subject to inspection by any citizen during all office hours and made available to all prospective bidders upon such reasonable terms and conditions as may be required by the commission. A fee shall be charged equal to the cost of producing a copy of any such plans and specifications.
        </li>
        <li id="t65c01s65-1-85ol11d">
         All such contracts shall be let to a responsible bidder with the lowest and best bid, and a record of all bids received for construction and reconstruction shall be preserved.
        </li>
        <li id="t65c01s65-1-85ol11e">
         Each bid for such a construction and reconstruction contract must be accompanied by a cashier’s check, a certified check or bidders bond executed by a surety company authorized to do business in the State of Mississippi, in the principal amount of not less than five percent (5%) of the bid, guaranteeing that the bidder will give bond and enter into a contract for the faithful performance of the contract according to plans and specifications on file.
        </li>
        <li id="t65c01s65-1-85ol11f">
         Bonds shall be required of the successful bidder in an amount equal to the contract price. The contract price shall mean the entire cost of the particular contract let. In the event change orders are made after the execution of a contract which results in increasing the total contract price, additional bond in the amount of the increased cost may be required. The surety or sureties on such bonds shall be a surety company or surety companies authorized to do business in the State of Mississippi, all bonds to be payable to the State of Mississippi and to be conditioned for the prompt, faithful and efficient performance of the contract according to plans and specifications, and for the prompt payment of all persons furnishing labor, material, equipment and supplies therefor. Such bonds shall be subject to the additional obligation that the principal and surety or sureties executing the same shall be liable to the state in a civil action instituted by the state at the instance of the commission or any officer of the state authorized in such cases, for double any amount in money or property the state may lose or be overcharged or otherwise defrauded of by reason of any wrongful or criminal act, if any, of the contractor, his agent or employees.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t65c01s65-1-85ol11f2">
       With respect to equipment used in the construction, reconstruction or other public work authorized to be done under the provisions of this chapter: the word “equipment,” in addition to all equipment incorporated into or fully consumed in connection with such project, shall include the reasonable value of the use of all equipment of every kind and character and all accessories and attachments thereto which are reasonably necessary to be used and which are used in carrying out the performance of the contract, and the reasonable value of the use thereof, during the period of time the same are used in carrying out the performance of the contract, shall be the amount as agreed upon by the persons furnishing the equipment and those using the same to be paid therefor, which amount, however, shall not be in excess of the maximum current rates and charges allowable for leasing or renting as specified in Section 65-7-95; the word “labor” shall include all work performed in repairing equipment used in carrying out the performance of the contract, which repair labor is reasonably necessary to the efficient operation of said equipment; and the words “materials” and “supplies” shall include all repair parts installed in or on equipment used in carrying out the performance of the contract, which repair parts are reasonably necessary to the efficient operation of said equipment.
      </li>
      <li id="t65c01s65-1-85ol11f3">
       The executive director, subject to the approval of the commission, shall have the right to reject any and all bids, whether such right is reserved in the notice or not.
      </li>
      <li id="t65c01s65-1-85ol11f4">
       The commission may require the prequalification of any and all bidders and the failure to comply with prequalification requirements may be the basis for the rejection of any bid by the commission. The commission may require the prequalification of any and all subcontractors before they are approved to participate in any contract awarded under this section.
      </li>
      <li id="t65c01s65-1-85ol11f5">
       The commission may adopt rules and regulations for the termination of any previously awarded contract which is not timely proceeding toward completion. The failure of a contractor to comply with such rules and regulations shall be a lawful basis for the commission to terminate the contract with such contractor. In the event of a termination under such rules and regulations, the contractor shall not be entitled to any payment, benefit or damages beyond the cost of the work actually completed.
      </li>
      <li id="t65c01s65-1-85ol11f6">
       Any contract for construction or paving of any highway may be entered into for any cost which does not exceed the amount of funds that may be made available therefor through bond issues or from other sources of revenue, and the letting of contracts for such construction or paving shall not necessarily be delayed until the funds are actually on hand, provided authorization for the issuance of necessary bonds has been granted by law to supplement other anticipated revenue, or when the department certifies to the Department of Finance and Administration and the Legislative Budget Office that projected receipts of funds by the department will be sufficient to pay such contracts as they become due and the Department of Finance and Administration determines that the projections are reasonable and receipts will be sufficient to pay the contracts as they become due. The Department of Finance and Administration shall spread such determination on its minutes prior to the letting of any contracts based on projected receipts. Nothing in this subsection shall prohibit the issuance of bonds, which have been authorized, at any time in the discretion of the State Bond Commission, nor to prevent investment of surplus funds in United States government bonds or State of Mississippi bonds as presently authorized by Section 12, Chapter 312, Laws of 1956.
      </li>
      <li id="t65c01s65-1-85ol11f7">
       All other contracts for work to be done under the provisions of this chapter and for the purchase of materials, equipment and supplies to be used as provided for in this chapter shall be made in compliance with Section 31-7-1 et seq.
      </li>
      <li id="t65c01s65-1-85ol11f8">
       The commission shall not empower or authorize the executive director, or any one or more of its members, or any engineer or other person to let or make contracts for the construction or repair of public roads, or building bridges, or for the purchase of material, equipment or supplies contrary to the provisions of this chapter as set forth in this section, except in cases of flood or other cases of emergency where the public interest requires that the work be done or the materials, equipment or supplies be purchased without the delay incident to advertising for competitive bids. Such emergency contracts may be made without advertisement under such rules and regulations as the commission may prescribe.
      </li>
      <li id="t65c01s65-1-85ol11f9">
       The executive director, subject to the approval of the commission, is authorized to negotiate and make agreements with communities and/or civic organizations for landscaping, beautification and maintenance of highway rights-of-way; however, nothing in this subsection shall be construed as authorization for the executive director or commission to participate in such a project to an extent greater than the average cost for maintenance of shoulders, backslopes and median areas with respect thereto.
      </li>
      <li id="t65c01s65-1-85ol11f10">
       The executive director may negotiate and enter into contracts with private parties for the mowing of grass and trimming of vegetation on the rights-of-way of state highways whenever such practice is possible and cost effective.

        <li id="t65c01s65-1-85ol11f11a">
         As an alternative to the method of awarding contracts as otherwise provided in this section, the commission may use the design-build method of contracting for the following:
         <ol type="i">
          <li id="t65c01s65-1-85ol11f11ai">

        </li>
        <li id="t65c01s65-1-85ol11f11b">
         As used in this subsection, the term “design-build” method of contracting means a contract that combines the design and construction phases of a project into a single contract and the contractor is required to satisfactorily perform, at a minimum, both the design and construction of the project.
        </li>
        <li id="t65c01s65-1-85ol11f11c">
         The commission shall establish detailed criteria for the selection of the successful design-build contractor in each request for design-build proposals.

         <ol type="i">

       When a contractor sued insurers and their agent for negligently issuing a bid bond without authority, due to expiration of the agent’s certificate for failure to pay a renewal fee, summary judgment erred because the agent was unauthorized to issue the bond, which had to be valid on the date issued but was null and void, and a later payment of the fee and reinstatement of the agent did not retroactively validate the bond, so fact questions existed as to the negligent issuance of the bond contrary to a duty to the contractor. King Metal Bldgs., Inc. v. Renasant Ins., Inc., 159 So.3d 567, 2014 Miss. App. LEXIS 377 (Miss. Ct. App. 2014), cert. denied, 158 So.3d 1153, 2015 Miss. LEXIS 142 (Miss. 2015).

       Although the construction company claimed that the other company’s bid proposal did not meet the requirements of § 102.07(e) of the Mississippi Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction, 1990 Edition, because it did not contain a signed second unnumbered page of the proposal with Addendum, § 102.07 did not require the rejection of any bid that had any irregularity as defined therein and the irregularity was not material; therefore, the irregularity was minor, one which the Mississippi Transportation Commission retained the discretion to waive, and accordingly not reversible error.

       Where a tractor was not substantially consumed in the performance of a highway construction contract and had a useful life expectancy greatly in excess of the particular contract, it was error to hold the surety on the contractor’s bond liable for rental purchase payments on the machine, as this section covers labor, material, equipment, and supplies in connection with a particular project and does not impose upon the surety liability in connection with long-lived equipment reasonably anticipated to be necessary for the fulfillment of the road contract at hand and capable with its life expectancy of use on many other similar projects.

       Except as otherwise provided in subsection (10) of this section, whenever any personal property has been acquired in any manner by the Mississippi Transportation Commission for public use and in the opinion of the commission, all or any part of the property becomes unnecessary for public use, the commission is authorized to dispose of such property for a fair and reasonable cash market price. Any such sale shall be a sale upon the receipt of sealed bids after reasonable advertisement for bids in such manner and at such time and place as the commission may deem proper and advisable, except that the commission may sell at private sale any such personal property not necessary for public purposes the cash market value of which is less than Five Hundred Dollars ($500.00); however, if the personal property is timber, the commission may sell at private sale any such timber not necessary for public purposes the cash market value of which is less than Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000.00), except that whenever persons, groups or agencies are permitted to remove a quantity of timber from highway rights-of-way, and the cash market value of the timber is estimated by the commission to be less than One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00), it shall not be necessary to have the timber cruised or appraised and the commission may sell the timber at private sale. The commission shall have the right to reject any and all bids in its discretion and to sell the property theretofore advertised at private sale for not less than the highest of the rejected bids, or to readvertise.

If the excess property was a total take from the original owner, then the commission shall offer to such owner, in writing, the first right of refusal to purchase such excess property; however, if after due diligence the original owner cannot be located, then the commission shall offer the first right of refusal to purchase the property to the adjoining property owner or owners. If the excess property was a partial take from the current owner of the parcel of real property from which the excess property was originally taken, then the commission shall be required to offer in writing the first right of refusal to purchase such excess property to such owner. If within forty-five (45) days any owner to whom the commission has offered the first right of refusal under the provisions of this subsection fails to accept the offer to purchase, the property shall then be offered to the adjoining property owner or owners. If within forty-five (45) days an adjoining property owner fails to accept the offer to purchase, then the excess property shall be sold to the highest bidder upon the receipt by the commission of sealed bids after reasonable advertisement for bids in such manner and at such time and place as the commission deems proper and advisable; however, the commission shall have the right to reject any and all bids in its discretion and to sell the property theretofore advertised at private sale for not less than the highest of the rejected bids, or to readvertise. Upon payment of the purchase price, the executive director of the department, upon due authorization by the commission entered on its minutes, may execute a quitclaim deed conveying such property to the purchaser.

   In an inverse condemnation proceeding against the Mississippi Transportation Commission (Commission), it was not error to grant the Commission’s motion in limine to bar evidence of the Commission’s alleged abandonment of an easement, apart from the Commission’s minutes, because (1) the Commission could not abandon the easement by nonuse, and (2) any determination releasing the easement had to be on the Commission’s minutes, making such minutes the only relevant admissible evidence of such a release.

Luminous flashing signals or crossing gate devices heretofore installed at grade crossings and those installations hereafter approved by the department shall be deemed adequate and appropriate. The department shall have authority to determine the number, type and location of such signs, signals, gates or other protective devices which shall conform as near as may be with generally recognized national standards, and the department shall have authority to prescribe the division of the cost of the installation and subsequent maintenance of such signs, signals, gates or other warning devices between the rail carrier or carriers, the public highway authority in interest and the Mississippi Department of Transportation.

       Since the State Constitution, at Article 3, Section 17, mandates that a determination of public use be made whenever private property is taken, and the condemnor has the burden of proof on the issue of public use, this article, strictly construed, is unconstitutional for not providing a predeprivation opportunity for the landowner to challenge the taking and to make the condemnor satisfy its burden on the issue of public use.

      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless of the adequacy of this section’s post-deprivation remedies, this section must provide a predeprivation hearing before taking property; because it does not provide for such a pre-deprivation hearing, this article is unconstitutional as violative of procedural due process.

     <p>
      Any person named in and served with a complaint and declaration of taking shall have twelve (12) months from the date of service thereof to file an answer. Failure to answer within the time shall constitute an admission that the amount deposited is just compensation and shall be a waiver of any further proceeding to determine just compensation. In such event, the judge shall enter final judgment in the amount deposited and order disbursement of the money to the owner. However, at any time before the entry of the final judgment, the judge, for good cause shown and after notice to the plaintiff, may extend the time for filing the answer for thirty (30) days.

       Any person whose land or compensable interest therein has been taken by an intentional or unintentional act or omission of the Transportation Department without the filing of a complaint and declaration of taking by the department may, within twenty-four (24) months of the date of the taking of the affected property or interest therein or the completion of the project involving the taking, whichever occurs later, file a complaint in the circuit or county court setting forth the names and places of residence of the parties, so far as the same can by reasonable diligence be ascertained, who own or have, or claim to own or have estates or interests in the real estate. If any such persons are under a legal disability, it must be so stated, together with a statement as to any encumbrances on the real estate. The complaint shall further allege with particularity the facts which constitute the taking together with the dates on which they allegedly occurred. The complaint shall describe the property allegedly owned by the parties and shall describe the area and interests allegedly taken. Upon the filing of the complaint, summons shall issue and, together with a copy of the complaint, shall be served on the Transportation Department as provided in Section 65-1-309. The allegations of the answer shall be deemed denied; however, the Transportation Department, within sixty (60) days of service of summons and complaint, may file an answer. If the taking is admitted by the Transportation Department, it, at the time of filing answer, shall deposit with the court the fair market value of compensation for the taking; and notice of the deposit shall be given to the owner. The owner may apply for disbursement of the deposit, and disbursement shall be made in accordance with applicable provision of Section 65-1-307. If a taking is admitted, the Transportation Department, within ninety (90) days of the filing of the answer to the complaint, shall file a map or plat of the land taken. This procedure shall be followed for the purpose of determining all matters raised by the pleading and the determination of just compensation.

      The board shall hand down its findings, decision and order (hereinafter referred to as its order) within sixty (60) days after it is called into session. If all three (3) members of the board do not agree, the order of the majority shall constitute the order of the board. The board shall furnish to each of the parties a copy of its order and a certified copy thereof shall be filed in the office of the clerk of the circuit court. Unless such order is reversed upon a petition for review filed pursuant to the provisions of Section 65-2-15, such order, together with such agreements as the parties may themselves have reached, shall become binding upon and shall control the relationship between the parties from the date such order is filed with the clerk of the circuit court, as aforesaid.

      </p>
      <p>
       “SECTION 2. This act shall not be construed to repeal, amend or alter in any way any of the provisions contained in chapter 207 of laws of 1954.”

      <p>
       Laws of 1958, ch. 310, designated U. S. Highway 61, commencing at the Mississippi-Tennessee state line and continuing to Redwood, as the Fielding L. Wright Memorial Highway.

        1. In general.

      </h4>
      <p>
       Where the board of supervisors accepted an offer of the Mississippi State Highway Commission to assume jurisdiction of highway (except drainage structures), and then thereafter also accepted an offer to assume jurisdiction of highways except bridges not up to state standards, the second acceptance was a clarification of the first and was effective notwithstanding the passage of statute which provided for preservation of status quo of all highways taken over by the department. Board of Sup'rs v. Mississippi State Highway Com., 221 Miss. 96, 72 So. 2d 237, 1954 Miss. LEXIS 516 (Miss. 1954).
      </p>
      <p>
       Statutes conferring upon the state highway commission the power of eminent domain do not limit the power to the taking of such property as is needed or necessary, inasmuch as the effect of this legislation is to vest the broad discretion in the highway commission in selecting its routes and other details. Erwin v. Mississippi State Highway Com., 213 Miss. 885, 58 So. 2d 52, 1952 Miss. LEXIS 438 (Miss. 1952).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a county entered an order to alter and widen a public road which traversed the lands of appellants, the county had jurisdiction notwithstanding the fact that the road had been taken over for maintenance and construction by the state highway department by an order of the state highway commission, where commission’s order would not be effective until certain conditions were met. McRaney v. Covington County, 210 Miss. 192, 49 So. 2d 248, 1950 Miss. LEXIS 336 (Miss. 1950).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a state highway department, pursuant to Laws 1924, ch. 278, took over certain road in Prentiss County, excepting “all drainage structures not built according to the state standard plans and specifications,” and thereafter order was changed to substitute “bridges” for “drainage structures,” state highway had no jurisdiction over two bridges which did not comply with the standard, and, therefore, was under no obligation to rebuild them after their destruction by flood waters. Board of Sup'rs v. Mississippi State Highway Com., 207 Miss. 839, 42 So. 2d 802, 1949 Miss. LEXIS 394 (Miss. 1949).
      </p>
      <p>
       Action in mandamus by attorney general to compel board of supervisors to repair a bridge on Highway No. 7 could not be maintained where there was no allegation that the board had failed to provide and maintain a bridge adequate for travel in lieu of the collapsed bridge, and the court had no power or authority to tell the board of supervisors in specific terms what kind of a bridge it should maintain at the location in question. State ex rel. Attorney Gen. v. Board of Supervisors, 196 Miss. 806, 17 So. 2d 433, 1944 Miss. LEXIS 258 (Miss. 1944).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the previous applicable statute (Laws 1924, chap. 278), at the time the state highway commission took over a county road under an agreement to maintain it without expense to the county, contained no provision authorizing the commission to obligate itself by any such contract, subsequent abandonment and surrender to the county of a portion of such road so taken over did not constitute an impairment of the obligation of a contract. Wilkinson County v. State Highway Com., 191 Miss. 750, 4 So. 2d 298, 1941 Miss. LEXIS 187 (Miss. 1941).
      </p>
      <p>
       Statutes respecting highway system do not require that State Highway No. 51 follow existing roads between points mentioned in statute. Trahan v. State Highway Com., 169 Miss. 732, 151 So. 178, 1933 Miss. LEXIS 7 (Miss. 1933).
      </p>
      <p>
       Bridge spanning natural stream crossing highway was not a “drainage structure” within highway department’s acceptance of county road which excepted drainage structures not built according to department’s standard plans and specifications. Jefferson Davis County v. Riley, 158 Miss. 473, 129 So. 324, 1930 Miss. LEXIS 14 (Miss. 1930).

       The Mississippi Department of Transportation (MDOT) has the duty to maintain portion of Highway 465 which is a substandard road on a levee until such time as the legislature removes it from the state highway system or enacts legislation which otherwise ends the responsibility of MDOT to maintain it. The Mississippi Highway Patrol is required to enforce traffic laws on Highway 465 as provided in Section 45-3-21. Pace, Aug. 7, 2006, A.G. Op. 06-0285.

For segments with the same year of need, prioritization shall be based on the volume to capacity ratio and the daily traffic volume. In the event that the Transportation Commission deviates from the recommended priorities presented through the needs analysis, the commission shall spread the specific reasons for the deviation on its minutes. The priority schedule shall reflect immediate needs which shall be construction, upgrades and improvements to the state highway system needed over a five-year period based upon the criteria established in this paragraph which shall be reviewed annually by the Mississippi Department of Transportation. The priority schedule shall project mid-range needs which shall include highway corridors that are projected to reach an unacceptable level of service within ten (10) years after each annual review of the priority schedule. The priority schedule shall project long-range needs which shall include highway corridors that are projected to reach an unacceptable level of service ten (10) years or more after each annual review of the priority schedule.

     <p>
      ARTICLE VI.— Nothing in this compact shall be construed so as to conflict with any existing statute, or to limit the powers of any party state, or to repeal or prevent legislation, or to authorize or permit curtailment or diminution of any other highway construction project, or to affect any existing or future cooperative arrangement or relationship between any federal agency and a party state.
     </p>
     <p>

      Before approving any application under this chapter the board shall have the Mississippi Department of Transportation, or the political subdivision if the political subdivision will have the construction or improvement performed, prepare and submit to it a detailed engineering study and report of all estimated costs associated with the construction and improvement of the highways and highway segments requested by the application of the political subdivision along with the estimated annual costs necessary to be expended for maintenance thereof. If the political subdivision will have the construction or improvement performed on a state designated highway that will be maintained by the Mississippi Department of Transportation, the board shall not approve the application of such political subdivision until the engineering study required in this section has been submitted by the board to the Mississippi Department of Transportation and has been certified by the Transportation Department to the board as proposing construction or improvement of highways and highway segments that meets Transportation Department standards for such work. If the political subdivision will have the construction or improvement performed on a highway that is not on the designated state highway system, the board shall not approve the application of such political subdivision until the engineering study required in this section has been submitted by the board to the Office of State Aid Road Construction and has been certified by the Office of State Aid Road Construction to the board as proposing construction or improvement of highways and highway segments that meets Office of State Aid Road Construction standards for such work.

      The Mississippi Department of Transportation or the Office of State Aid Road Construction, as the case may be, may recommend modifications to the location and route of those highways and highway segments proposed in the application of the political subdivision if such modifications are more cost effective and would not have a substantially negative economic impact on the project of the private company.

The issuance by the state of one or more series of bonds shall not preclude it from issuing other series of bonds, but the proceedings under which any subsequent bonds may be issued shall recognize and protect any prior pledge made for any prior issuance of bonds.

       Commercial property sustains greater damage from limitation of access to a highway than does residential property. Fraser v. Mississippi State Highway Com., 303 So. 2d 456, 1974 Miss. LEXIS 1435 (Miss. 1974).

       Under this statute, if the only thing condemned were the limitation on the right of access of the abutting land owners, at least nominal damages would have to be paid, but the statute does not require the payment of substantial damages as a matter of law if in fact such damages were not sustained by the abutting land owners.

       Reconstruction of an existing highway in such a way as to limit and control general access to and from abutting property, converts it into a “controlled access facility”, and entitles the abutter to compensation under this section.

      The highway authorities of the state, county, city, town, and village are authorized to so design any controlled-access facility and to so regulate, restrict, or prohibit access as to best serve the traffic for which such facility is intended. In this connection such highway authorities are authorized to divide and separate any controlled-access facility into separate roadways by the construction of raised curbings, central dividing sections, or other physical separations, or by designating such separate roadways by signs, markers, stripes, and the proper lane for such traffic by appropriate signs, markers, stripes, and other devices. No person shall have any right of ingress or egress to, from, or across controlled-access facilities to or from abutting lands except at such designated points at which access may be permitted, upon such terms and conditions as may be specified from time to time.

     <p>
      For the purposes of this chapter, the highway authorities of the state, county, city, town, or village may acquire private or public property and property rights for controlled-access facilities and service roads, including rights of access, air, view, and light, by gift, devise, purchase, or condemnation in the same manner as such units are now or hereafter may be authorized by law to acquire such property or property rights in connection with highways and streets within their respective jurisdictions. All property rights acquired under the provisions of this chapter shall be acquired in accordance with the provisions of Section 65-1-47, and the estate acquired shall be specified in accordance with said section. In connection with acquisition of property or property rights for any controlled-access facility or portion thereof or service road in connection therewith, the state, county, city, town, or village highway authority may, in its discretion, acquire an entire lot, block, or tract of land if, by so doing, the interests of the public will be best served, even though said entire lot, block, or tract is not needed for the right of way proper.

       A neighborhood road however long it may have been used by the public, does not become a highway in the absence of an assertion by the public of a right of all supervision of it by the county road authorities. Wills v. Reid, 86 Miss. 446, 38 So. 793, 1905 Miss. LEXIS 91 (Miss. 1905).
      </p>
      <p>
       A neighborhood road does not become a highway because of its use at will for more than ten years by all persons whose convenience was thereby promoted where the same was never laid out or worked by public authority although occasionally repaired by those using it.

       A county is liable for damages to land which it wrongfully caused to be covered with water by improper construction of a public causeway. Raney v. Hinds County, 78 Miss. 308, 28 So. 875, 1900 Miss. LEXIS 115 (Miss. 1900).

       There is no statutory requirement for width of right of way of city streets; any additional area required by city for right of way for city street must be obtained by purchase or eminent domain. Fortier, May 7, 1990, A.G. Op. #90-0296.
      </p>
      <p>
       A board of supervisors can block or close public access to a county road only under certain limited circumstances. See Sections 65-7-53 (closing of road while under construction); 65-7-37 (regulation of the use of certain roads during bad weather or by certain types of vehicles). See also, Sections 65-7-1 through 65-7-7 (public roads shall be kept open and shall not be obstructed). Ross, July 12, 1996, A.G. Op. #96-0421.
      </p>
      <p>
       A board of supervisors is not required to create a public road from a private road simply because that road has been brought up to established criteria by private owners. If the board determines that it is in the public’s interest or convenience to create a public road from a private road, then the board may do so after entering the appropriate findings on its minutes. Brown, Oct. 24, 2003, A.G. Op. 03-0477.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sections 65-7-1 and 65-7-3 require that ditches along public roads shall be kept open, connected and of sufficient size to drain off the water from the road bed. A culvert may not be installed for the benefit of an individual but may only be installed in order to benefit the public road. Brooks, Apr. 8, 2005, A.G. Op. 05-0158.

       A county board of supervisors may implement and erect road signs pursuant to a countywide Adopt-A-Roadway program displaying the names of the “adopting” entities. White, Feb. 17, 2006, A.G. Op. 06-0025.

       The statute required a county board of supervisors to make a determination of the status of a road prior to July 1, 2000, even while private litigation was pending over the road’s status as public or private.

      </p>
      <p>
       Any proceeding or change which materially affects the ability to identify, in whole or in part, a county road which may be worked with public funds should be recorded in the county road system register; a work order or project or state aid status which does not add or delete roads or segments of roads would not need to be included on the register.

   If a road is on the county’s official map and road system register, then it is a county road. Pursuant to the authority granted in §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t65c07s65-7-1" target="_self">65-7-1</a></cite>, the county may work or maintain county roads. Crow, Oct. 3, 2003, A.G. Op. 03-0454.

      <p>
       Where the dedication of platted but unopened roads was never accepted by the county, it never assumed any obligation to maintain or open the roads as public roads.
   The simple act of platting a road does not suffice to make the land in question a county road for purposes of county maintenance. Parker, May 14, 2004, A.G. Op. 04-0176.

      The Legislature of the State of Mississippi finds and determines as a matter of public policy and legislative intent that the proceedings and public hearing required for initial adoption of the official map and county road system register required by Section 65-7-4, Mississippi Code of 1972, are not intended to lay out, open, designate or otherwise establish new public roads, but to document and record existing roads which are, at the time of the initial adoption of said map and register, adjudicated by the board, consistent with fact, to be public roads by dedication, under the methods provided by statute, or by prescription and required by public convenience and necessity.

       Circuit court properly affirmed a county board of supervisors’ decisions declining to abandon a road and declining to award damages to an owner because the road at issue was listed as public in the county road registry, it had been maintained by the public since the 1980s, and the owner’s appeal was untimely.

       A court is without power to close a public road in private litigation between individuals unless such action is predicated upon a finding that there has been a valid order of the Board of Supervisors closing the road, spread upon its minutes, if it is a county road, or that similar official action has been taken by the State Highway Commission and is reflected by its official records, if it is a state road or highway.

      If any person shall fell any bush or tree and leave any portion thereof in any stream or on any public highway, road, or ditch draining the roadway or obstruct the same in any manner whatever, and not immediately remove the obstruction, the overseer of the road shall remove the same, and the person so felling the tree or bush, or otherwise obstructing the road or water shall forfeit and pay all expenses of removing the same, to be recovered before any justice of the peace of the county, in the name of the county.

    Regulation of use of certain roads.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Whenever in the discretion of the board of supervisors of any county it seems proper to do so, the board of supervisors may, by order duly entered on its minutes, regulate the use of any hard surfaced or graveled public road in the county by prescribing what kind of wheels may be used on vehicles on said public roads and by prohibiting the use thereon of vehicles using cleats or spikes on wheels. But such order shall, before being in full force and effect, be published in a newspaper published in the county for three (3) consecutive weeks, whereupon such order shall be in full force and effect.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the event of inclement weather, floods, or other causes wherein immediate nonuse of any of such roads is necessary, the supervisor of the district may enter his proclamation prohibiting the use of said road for such period of time as he deems necessary for the proper preservation thereof, or enter his proclamation regulating the type of traffic that may use such road. However, at the next meeting of the board of supervisors, such supervisor as has entered such a proclamation must present his proclamation to the entire board for its action thereon, and if the full board declines to enter an order in the manner set forth in the next preceding paragraph hereof, then the proclamation of such supervisor shall be null and void and of no further effect. Notice of such proclamation at each public entrance, intersection with another public road, shall be sufficient notice of the proclamation of the supervisor.
     </p>
     <p>
      This section shall not be construed as to authorize the board of supervisors to prohibit vehicles with spiked or cleated wheels from crossing or going from one side of said road to another, and shall only be construed so as to authorize said board of supervisors to prohibit the use of said spiked or cleated wheels on said public roads.
     </p>
     <p>
      This section shall not be so construed as to apply to state built or constructed highways or federal aid roads, and shall only be construed to apply to public roads maintained by the county.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any person going upon any hard surfaced road or portion thereof in such county with any kind of vehicle, or who shall cause any such vehicle to be driven upon any such hard surfaced road in such county in violation of such regulations or orders, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction therefor, shall be fined in the sum of not exceeding Fifty Dollars ($50.00) and shall moreover be liable severally to any county or road district for any damage done such roads by such illegal act.
     </p>
     <p>
      As to any county which is required to operate on a countywide system of road administration as described in Section 19-2-3, the duties of a supervisor under this section relating to the issuance of a proclamation shall be performed by the road manager of the county.

     </h3>
     <p>
      When any person shall desire to have a public road other than a road being maintained by the state highway department laid out, altered, or changed, a petition shall be presented to the board of supervisors of the county, signed by ten or more freeholders or householders of the county interested in the road, setting forth the commencement and termination and general course thereof and that the public interest or convenience requires the road to be laid out and opened or altered or changed, as shown in the petition. The petitioners, if not owners of the land through which the road runs or is proposed to be run, or if the land through which the road runs or is proposed to run is owned by the county or a municipality, shall give a copy of the same to the president of the board of supervisors if the county is the owner of the land, or to the mayor if a municipality is the owner thereof, and shall give five days’ notice to the owners of the land in person, or by leaving the same at their residence if they reside in the county, or if the owners be nonresidents of the county, by putting up the notice in some conspicuous place on the land through which the road runs or is proposed to run. Thereupon the board of supervisors shall hear the parties, and if it determine that the prayer of the petitioners ought to be granted, in whole or in part, it shall appoint a committee of two members, of districts other than that of the road or proposed road, who shall examine and view the contemplated route of the road. If they find the same practicable, they shall lay out and mark the road, or the alteration or change, and report their proceedings in writing to the board at its next meeting.

   The Mississippi Supreme Court would remand to a circuit court for its remand to a County Board of Supervisors for further proceedings regarding the layout of a public road, where the board’s order appointing two of the board members as a committee to inspect the proposed road site was not a final order, adjudicating in fact that a road at the proposed location would be laid out and established, from which an appeal could be taken. De La Beckwith v. State, 615 So. 2d 1134, 1992 Miss. LEXIS 807 (Miss. 1992), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">510 U.S. 884</cite>, <cite class="s_court">114 S.

       The Circuit Court on appeal could not permit issues to be raised and tried that were not tried in the special court of eminent domain and the sole question to be determined there was the compensation awarded, and the trial court properly overruled the condemnees’ affirmative defenses based upon the contention that the board of supervisors failed to comply with the provisions of Code 1942, § 8314 regarding the opening or changing of public roads. Wallace v. Board of Supervisors, 210 So. 2d 49, 1968 Miss. LEXIS 1493 (Miss. 1968).

       Where a county entered an order to alter and widen a public road which traversed the lands of appellants, the county had jurisdiction notwithstanding the fact that the road had been taken over for maintenance and construction by the state highway department by an order of the state highway commission, where commission’s order would not be effective until certain conditions were met.

       In the absence of an order of the board of supervisors, or other record evidence showing that the roadway had been designated as a public road, public user and working and maintaining of roadway across defendants’ land by public authorities at public expense for 17 years, without objection of defendants were sufficient to put them on notice that public authorities were asserting a right to deal with the road as part of the road system in the district, and to establish an easement for public road purposes by prescription by adverse user for the period prescribed by law, so as to preclude defendants from placing gates across or otherwise obstructing such road.

    Review by circuit court.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      All proceedings of the board of supervisors in laying out, altering, or changing any public road and assessing damages therefor may be reviewed by the circuit court in respect to any matter of law arising on the face of the proceedings; and on the question of damages the cause may be tried anew, and the damages may be assessed by a jury if the owners of the land so desire. The board of supervisors shall grant appeals for that purpose, when prayed for, on the appellant giving bond for the costs in such penalty as the board may require, not exceeding Two Hundred Dollars ($200.00), payable to the county; and such bond shall have the same effect and be subject to the same proceedings as appeal bonds in other cases. Any person interested and a taxpayer may appeal in like manner and with like effect from the action of the board in assessing, allowing, or disallowing damages in opening or changing a road. If the road laid out or changed is a part of a federal aid project, such appeal to, and such review by, the circuit court shall be without supersedeas and only after the assessment of damages herein provided; on such appeal and review, all of the proceedings involving the taking of land for a public road and assessing damages therefor, and otherwise, shall be before the circuit court for consideration on such review and appeal. If the road laid out or changed is a part of a federal aid project, after the board of supervisors has confirmed the report of the committee examining and viewing the contemplated route of a road and finding the same practicable, such road may be opened, worked, constructed, and used, and such opening, working, constructing, and using of said road shall not be stopped or held up by appeal, by writ of supersedeas, writ of certiorari, direct appeal, other method of appeal, review, by writ of prohibition, or otherwise after the board of supervisors has entered an order on its minutes to the effect that the county shall be liable to the landowner for all damages sustained by such laying out, working, and construction of such road and the taking of the land therefor; and the board of supervisors shall have actually deposited the amount assessed as damages with the clerk of the circuit court, subject to the order of the landowner.

     <p>
      The methods of constructing, reconstructing and maintaining the public roads and bridges in this state, other than those under the actual charge of the State Highway Department, shall be as follows:
     </p>
     <p>
      Any county may purchase implements and material through its central purchase system; may employ labor; may work, construct, reconstruct and maintain the public roads; may build bridges; and may do any and all things necessary to be done to work, construct, reconstruct and maintain the public roads and to build bridges as herein provided. If, in the opinion of the board of supervisors, any part of the work necessary to be done in working, constructing, reconstructing and maintaining the public roads and in building bridges in such county, or any part or parts thereof, can best be done by awarding contracts therefor, the board of supervisors may advertise for bids and make contracts therefor in accordance with the provisions of Section 31-7-13; and the board of supervisors may, in its discretion, use any funds heretofore or hereafter raised by bond issue or otherwise for working, constructing, reconstructing, maintaining and improving the public roads and for building bridges as herein provided. Except for contracts exempt from the provisions of Section 19-11-27, no contract provided above shall be awarded that shall extend beyond thirty (30) days from the termination and end of the term of office of the members of the boards of supervisors awarding same.
     </p>
     <p>
      Before any board of supervisors may hire, lease or rent any heavy road machinery or equipment for use in the construction, reconstruction or maintenance of any county road or bridge, such board of supervisors shall first adopt an order adjudicating the necessity for leasing or renting such machinery or equipment, the purposes for which it is to be used, the type of such machinery or equipment and the reasons why the leasing or renting thereof will promote the public interest of the county. Such order shall also direct the clerk of the board of supervisors to advertise for bids for such machinery or equipment, which bids shall be returnable on a day to be fixed by the board of supervisors, in accordance with Section 31-7-13.
     </p>
     <p>
      All contracts for the leasing or renting of such machinery or equipment shall be awarded to the lowest and best responsible bidder whose bid price or rental consideration is not in excess of the current rates and charges fixed and prescribed by the Nielsen/Data Quest publication, which rates and charges fixed and prescribed by the Nielsen/Data Quest publication shall be on file with the Governor’s Office of General Services at that time.
     </p>
     <p>
      All invoices submitted for the leasing or renting of such machinery or equipment shall identify the equipment by number and name and shall include the number of hours of labor performed and the dates thereof.

       The supervisors had the power to pay for the hire of drag lines, trucks, etc., as shown by the accounts presented by the contractor to the supervisors, although the clerk was mistaken in his request that they be broken down rather than made out for the purchase price of gravel placed on the roads.

       Summary judgment was properly awarded to a county board of supervisors in plaintiffs’ action to recover damages for injuries sustained after their vehicle collided with a mailbox on the shoulder of a road because although the board admittedly failed to personally inspect the road where the accident occurred, the county road management department, as an agent for the board, conducted an inspection of the road and, thus, satisfied the statutory requirements.

   In an action against a county supervisor for personal injuries suffered by plaintiffs when they crashed into a collapsed bridge located in the supervisor’s district, the court held that the supervisor’s negligence was in his failure to inspect the bridge and make his recommendation as to needed repairs to the whole board, and his liability for this omission was indictment and conviction under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t65c07s65-7-119" target="_self">65-7-119</a></cite>; duty of repairing the bridge was within the discretionary functions of the whole board of supervisors, and the individual supervisor’s failure to inspect, though ministerial, was not the proximate cause of the accident for which he would be individually liable.

       Abandonment of a road, when it became effective, abrogated the county’s easement for the road, and thus the property owners had a vested property right at the time of the reconsideration; constructive notice of the hearing to rescind the abandonment of the road was constitutionally insufficient under the peculiar facts of this case, and because the owners were not given adequate notice, the order rescinding the abandonment of the road through their property was void. Tippah Cty. v. LeRose, — So.3d —, 2019 Miss. LEXIS 353 (Miss. Oct. 3, 2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       Statute sets out four independent grounds for abandoning a public road, not four requirements as the residents suggested. Lowndes County v. McClanahan, 161 So.3d 1091, 2014 Miss. App. LEXIS 228 (Miss. Ct. App. 2014), rev'd, 161 So.3d 1052, 2015 Miss. LEXIS 193 (Miss. 2015).
      </p>
      <p>
       The lack of compliance with the statute did not compel a finding that a road still maintained its public character where the public nature of the road ended long before the effective date of the statute. Ann May Enters., Inc. v. Caples, 724 So. 2d 1127, 1998 Miss. App. LEXIS 993 (Miss. Ct. App. 1998).

       If board of supervisors determines that roads in question were effectively abandoned before enactment of Section 65-7-121 in 1986, it may enter order to that effect; if there is any doubt of abandonment prior to 1986, then procedure set forth in statute must be utilized. Trapp, March 23, 1994, A.G. Op. #94-0169.
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   This section did not apply to the abandonment or reconveyance of property to the successor in interest to the person who conveyed the property originally to the county for the construction of a public road; instead, the county was required to use the procedure outlined in §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.19.html#t19c07s19-7-3" target="_blank">19-7-3</a></cite> to dispose of the property.
   Shepard, March 5, 1999, A.G. Op. #99-0092.
      </p>
      <p>
       The statute allows a county to abandon a section of road at the point where the county road intersects with a state highway, thereby effectively creating a dead end road, if it is in the public interest or convenience to do so. Shaw, Dec. 28, 1999, A.G. Op. #99-0677.
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   If a donated right-of-way easement has been entered in the official county road register and map, requirements for abandonment set forth in §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t65c07s65-7-121ol11a" target="_self">65-7-121 (1)(a)</a></cite>-(d) apply; if the easement has not been entered in the county road register, the board of supervisors may find on the minutes that the easement will not be used for road purposes and the board may quitclaim the easement to the owner. Chamberlin, Sept. 6, 2002, A.G. Op. #02-0459.
      </p>
      <p>
       County board of supervisors does not have authority under this section to close a municipal street; further, no authority can be found which empowers a county to abandon a municipal street or to compel a municipality to close a dedicated street within the municipal corporate limits. Palmer, Dec. 20, 2002, A.G. Op. #02-0673.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a board of supervisors finds that a deed constituted a conveyance of only an easement for road purposes, and that such easement will not be used for county purposes, then the board may quitclaim the easement to the owner/grantor. Creekmore, Sept. 24, 2004, A.G. Op. 04-0467.
      </p>
      <p>
       Board of supervisors has the authority to abandon easements which provide the only means of access to otherwise landlocked property unless a specified statutory limitation applies, which is a factual determination for the board to make.. Powell, Mar. 18, 2005, A.G. Op. 05-0137.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a privately constructed road is on the official county map and road system register, it can be abandoned when a county board of supervisors takes action pursuant to the requirements of Section 65-7-121. Powell, Apr. 1, 2005, A.G. Op. 05-0115.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 65-7-121 is not applicable to the situation in which a county ceases to provide discretionary street maintenance within a municipality. Hatcher, Apr. 15, 2005, A.G. Op. 05-0161.
      </p>
      <p>
       A board of supervisors may not lease property from a railroad company for improving, upgrading or building of a proposed road, and such road may only be improved, upgraded or built if the county secures a perpetual easement for road purposes from the company without limitation on the number of years. Carroll, July 1, 2005, A.G. Op. 05-0240.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a road has not been maintained for more than five years prior to July 2000, nor adopted as part of the county road system in accordance with Section 65-7-4, nor added to the county road system by the board of supervisors or maintained by the board in the six years following the establishment of the county road system, then such road was never a part of the county road system, and such road is not required to be abandoned in accordance with the procedures in Section 65-7-121 (2) in order that it not be considered a public road.

      When any person shall desire to have a private road laid out through the land of another, when necessary for ingress and egress, he shall apply by petition, stating the facts and reasons, to the special court of eminent domain created under Section 11-27-3 of the county where the land or part of it is located, and the case shall proceed as nearly as possible as provided in Title 11, Chapter 27 for the condemnation of private property for public use. The court sitting without a jury shall determine the reasonableness of the application. The owner of the property shall be a necessary party to the proceedings. If the court finds in favor of the petitioner, all damages that the jury determines the landowner should be compensated for shall be assessed against and shall be paid by the person applying for the private road, and he shall pay all the costs and expenses incurred in the proceedings.

       Special court of eminent domain erred as a matter of law when it granted a petition for private road access because the Mississippi Constitution provided that such rights-of-way were not permissible in incorporated cities and towns. The right to seek dismissal under the Mississippi Constitution was not waived because the statutory grounds for such were not satisfied where a private road was requested, rather than a public taking; moreover, public necessity or public use did not have to be shown.

      <p>
       Special court of eminent domain erred in denying an owner’s request for attorney’s fees and expenses because the neighbors clearly invoked the statutory procedures of the special court of eminent domain when they petitioned to condemn the owner’s property for a private road and the state constitution clearly prohibited the Legislature from creating the statutory right to condemn for a private road property within an incorporated city or town. High v. Kuhn, 240 So.3d 1198, 2017 Miss. LEXIS 455 (Miss. 2017).

       Trial court properly denied the owners’ action for an easement by necessity across the neighbors’ property because the easement was merely a convenience, not a real necessity, where boat access was suitable for access to the property and, while the property was surrounded on three sides by water and the neighbors’ property on the east, the owners only utilized the property in the summer months for recreational purposes, there was a public boat lunch within 200 yards of a sandbar and dock area, there were no utilities to the site, and it was not a place suitable for building a home. Davidson v. Collins, 195 So.3d 825, 2015 Miss. App. LEXIS 633 (Miss. Ct. App. 2015), cert. denied, 209 So.3d 429, 2016 Miss. LEXIS 300 (Miss. 2016).

   Greene County Board of Education’s decision to grant an easement over leased land was not reviewable in a circuit court by a petition for a writ of certiorari because the board was acting in an administrative capacity in managing its land; the board’s decision was not akin to that of a special court of eminent domain under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t65c07s65-7-201" target="_self">65-7-201</a></cite>. Jones v. Greene County Bd. of Educ., 968 So. 2d 506, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 197 (Miss. Ct.

   County board of supervisors erred when it granted an easement holder access to a private road on property under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t65c07s65-7-201" target="_self">65-7-201</a></cite> because an easement already existed, and since there was nothing to show its exact location, a finding that it was unusable could not have been made; further, even assuming the existing easement ran close to or in a creek bed did not entitle the holder to a private way, and she offered no proof regarding the feasibility or expense of constructing a road using her existing easement. Gibbes v. Hinds County Bd. of Supervisors, 952 So. 2d 1011, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 134 (Miss. Ct. App. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       Board of Supervisors, in its decision, found the landowner failed to prove his proposed private way was reasonably necessary and not merely for convenience. The Board’s reasoning for its unanimous decision was that there were other routes through which the landowner could gain access to a public road but that the landowner failed to present sufficient evidence that his proposed route was the least intrusive to the current owners and the most reasonable to the landowner. Kalom v. Brady, 872 So. 2d 741, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 431 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Landowner was not required to petition the county board of supervisors concerning his action to acquire an easement because Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t65c07s65-7-201" target="_self">65-7-201</a></cite> did not apply to an easement by necessity; by acquiring the dominant estate, one had already paid for and procured the legal right of access to and from that parcel. Fike v. Shelton, 860 So. 2d 1227, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 907 (Miss. Ct. App. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       An easement by necessity was required for land owned by a power company as the property was bounded by no property owner from whom it could seek access other than the defendant and it was unreasonable to require the power company to build a bridge across a creek to obtain access. Mississippi Power Co. v. Fairchild, 791 So. 2d 262, 2001 Miss. App. LEXIS 66 (Miss. Ct. App. 2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section did not provide the sole and exclusive remedy where the dispute was not over the private/public character of the property, but rather a dispute regarding easements and rights of access between the property owners involved. Rogers v. Marlin, 754 So. 2d 1267, 1999 Miss. App. LEXIS 708 (Miss. Ct. App. 1999).

       Property owners made the required showing that they were unable to obtain a reasonable right of way from their surrounding neighbors. Hooks v. George County, 748 So. 2d 678, 1999 Miss. LEXIS 287 (Miss. 1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       An order granting a private way was premature where there was evidence that the property owners who sought the private way had an alternative means of access to their property and the defendant board did not even respond to such evidence and did not make a finding of fact in this regard. Hooks v. George County, 748 So. 2d 678, 1999 Miss. LEXIS 287 (Miss. 1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       A chancellor’s finding that the defendant enjoyed a prescriptive easement over the property in question effectively removed a county board of supervisors from the litigation by rejecting the claim that this section provided the sole and exclusive remedy in the case; thus, the litigation was but a dispute regarding easements and rights of access between the property owners and not a dispute over the private, giving the chancellor jurisdiction to dispose of the matter. Rogers v. Marlin, 1999 Miss. App. LEXIS 459 (Miss. Ct. App. July 20, 1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       The statute does not refer to anything but a “private road” and does not grant the board the right to grant a right of way with, for example, such reasonable conditions as the circumstances require. Bivens v. Mobley, 724 So. 2d 458, 1998 Miss. App. LEXIS 1058 (Miss. Ct. App. 1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       Even though state may be acting in a way so as to benefit only one landlocked property owner by granting him private right of way, state is still exercising its power of eminent domain in such matters. Oughton v. Gaddis, 683 So. 2d 390, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 597 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       When state exercises its power of eminent domain, damage award that beneficiary must pay to duly compensate victim of taking includes fair market value of land actually taken for private easement, and also all damages to remaining land not included in taking; general formula reflecting this principle is to calculate difference between fair market value of entire tract before taking, and fair market value of entire property immediately after taking. Oughton v. Gaddis, 683 So. 2d 390, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 597 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Value of land condemned for easement is fair market value others would pay for entire land without easement or right-of-way outlets across other lands. Oughton v. Gaddis, 683 So. 2d 390, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 597 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   A servient owner’s locked gates across a private way of necessity did not constitute an unreasonable interference with the dominant owner’s use of the private way, which was granted pursuant to §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t65c07s65-7-201" target="_self">65-7-201</a></cite> for ingress and egress purposes, where the dominant owner had a key to the gates and the servient owner had maintained the gates for use in his cattle operation since he acquired the land in 1969. Griffin v. State, 618 So. 2d 81, 1993 Miss. LEXIS 171 (Miss. 1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   A dominant owner could not place utilities on a private way of necessity, which had been granted pursuant to §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t65c07s65-7-201" target="_self">65-7-201</a></cite> for ingress and egress purposes, since a private way for ingress and egress does not carry with it by implication an easement for running utilities across the private way. Griffin v. State, 618 So. 2d 81, 1993 Miss. LEXIS 171 (Miss. 1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Section<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t65c07s65-7-201" target="_self">65-7-201</a></cite>’s procedure for establishing a private right-of-way is not a complete and adequate alternative remedy to the recognition and enforcement of an easement of way by necessity; thus, §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t65c07s65-7-201" target="_self">65-7-201</a></cite> was not a bar to the chancery court’s granting of equitable relief in establishing an easement by necessity. Broadhead v. Terpening, 611 So. 2d 949, 1992 Miss. LEXIS 824 (Miss. 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       Landowners who sought a private way across neighboring land met the required burden of proof that a private way was “reasonably necessary” for ingress and egress to their property where their property was bound on 3 sides by water and on the fourth side by the neighboring land. The landowners would not be required to explore the option of building a bridge to their land due to the unreasonableness inherent in such an undertaking; the landowners’ burden of proof concerning necessity was met by a showing that they had no other dry access to their land. Alpaugh v. Moore, 568 So. 2d 291, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 606 (Miss. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 65-7-57 permits any person to file an application with the board of supervisors requesting the board to lay out a public road, and of necessity the application for the road may describe a right-of-way across the lands of many individual owners, and this section provides that the application of an individual for a private road is subject to the same procedure set forth in Code 1942, § 8314. Rotenberry v. Renfro, 214 So. 2d 275, 1968 Miss. LEXIS 1297 (Miss. 1968).
      </p>
      <p>
       The petitioner for the establishment of a private way must allege and show that he has been unable to obtain a reasonable right of way from all of the surrounding property owners, and must show a real necessity for such a right of way, as distinguished from a mere convenience. Rotenberry v. Renfro, 214 So. 2d 275, 1968 Miss. LEXIS 1297 (Miss. 1968).
      </p>
      <p>
       In condemnation proceedings where the application seeks to condemn the property of more than one defendant interested in different property, a separate trial must be had for each and, in proceedings by an applicant for a right of way for a private road across the lands of several owners a separate trial should be granted in the circuit court to each of the several landowners to determine by damages done to the various parcels of their land. Rotenberry v. Renfro, 214 So. 2d 275, 1968 Miss. LEXIS 1297 (Miss. 1968).
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 110 of the Mississippi Constitution permits the legislature to provide by general vote for condemning rights for a private road and this section was enacted under the power granted by the Constitution. Rotenberry v. Renfro, 214 So. 2d 275, 1968 Miss. LEXIS 1297 (Miss. 1968).

       In a proceeding to have private road laid out through the owner’s land, where the petitioners did not offer to pay the owner proposed easement but merely offered the cost of constructing road and did not sign a petition in a manner as to agree to any offer therein contained as to payment of damages, etc., and did not attempt to acquire easement by contract or purchase, and where some of the petitioners owned lands in the area to be served by the private road had access to their land over other road, the board of supervisors was without authority to sustain their petition.

       An owner of land adjoining the school timberlands could not arbitrarily demand from the purchaser of the timber more for a right of way through his land than the same was reasonably worth since under this section the purchaser of the timberlands could acquire such a right of way.

       Judgment granting a timber company a private road easement over private property was proper because the timber company established that its need for the road to access its landlocked property was more than mere convenience as the private road would provide the only feasible way to get to a public highway. May v. Adirondack Timber I, LLC, 129 So.3d 219, 2013 Miss. App. LEXIS 433 (Miss. Ct. App. 2013).

   County court erred in taking appellants’ property for a private road under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t65c07s65-7-201" target="_self">65-7-201</a></cite>because appellee, who sought the private road to harvest timber on its property, failed to show its lot was physically landlocked and it was unable to secure a reasonable right-of-way to a public road through the properties of surrounding landowners; appellee was not relieved of its obligation to seek a voluntary right-of-way from other surrounding landowners with a simple showing that the alternatives were more expensive or less convenient than its preferred route. Ward v. Trimac Invs., LLC, 78 So.3d 341, 2011 Miss. App. LEXIS 162 (Miss. Ct. App. 2011), cert. denied, 78 So.3d 906, 2012 Miss. LEXIS 41 (Miss. 2012).

      <p>
       In an action for a private right-of-way, the trial court erred in granting a right-of-way along a gravel road across prime farmland owned by the defendants since such a right-of-way would interfere with the business operation of the farm; instead, the court should have awarded a right-of-way in an alternate location, even though the plaintiff would then be required to make substantial improvements to reach his property.

      </h4>
      <p>
       Res judicata did not bar a property owner’s petition for a private road because the petition involved different underlying facts and circumstances than the owner’s prior lawsuits, and so there was no identity of the cause of action; the owner’s prior common-law claims focused on historical ownership of the land, and because a neighbor’s land completely surrounded the owner’s land, the owner’s petition for a private road could be decided based on present property lines and circumstances. McCarty v. Wood, 249 So.3d 425, 2018 Miss. App. LEXIS 34 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 246 So.3d 72, 2018 Miss. LEXIS 333 (Miss. 2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       Res judicata did not bar a property owner’s petition for a private road because a statutory petition for a private road could not have been brought in either of the owner’s prior lawsuits or combined with the common-law claims asserted in those lawsuits; based on the plain language of the statute, the owner could not have brought a petition for a private road in the prior actions in chancery court or circuit court because such petition had to be filed in the special court of eminent domain. McCarty v. Wood, 249 So.3d 425, 2018 Miss. App. LEXIS 34 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 246 So.3d 72, 2018 Miss. LEXIS 333 (Miss. 2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       Res judicata did not bar a property owner’s statutory petition for a private road because the owner could not have combined his prior common-law claims with a statutory petition for a private road in the special court of eminent domain since the special court of eminent domain lacked jurisdiction over such claims. McCarty v. Wood, 249 So.3d 425, 2018 Miss. App. LEXIS 34 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 246 So.3d 72, 2018 Miss. LEXIS 333 (Miss. 2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       Landowner is not required to plead alternative common-law claims in the same proceeding as a statutory claim for a private road under the statute; such claims may be pursued in separate proceedings. McCarty v. Wood, 249 So.3d 425, 2018 Miss. App. LEXIS 34 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 246 So.3d 72, 2018 Miss. LEXIS 333 (Miss. 2018).

       Collateral estoppel did not bar a property owner’s statutory petition for a private road because although the chancery court dismissed owner’s prior complaint for an easement with prejudice, the record did not show that the chancery court actually decided that an easement was not “necessary.” McCarty v. Wood, 249 So.3d 425, 2018 Miss. App. LEXIS 34 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 246 So.3d 72, 2018 Miss. LEXIS 333 (Miss. 2018).

      The board of supervisors of each county, now having full jurisdiction over all roads, ferries, and bridges in its respective county not maintained as state highways, is hereby fully authorized and empowered to construct and maintain the same (including designated state highways not yet taken over by the highway department); and all such roads under the jurisdiction of the several boards of supervisors are hereby designated, defined, and declared to be either (a) “feeder” or “local farm roads” or (b) “state aid roads.”

     <p>
      State aid roads are hereby defined as that group or class of roads composing the main collector and distributor routes feeding into local trade areas or into the state highway network, which are not designated as state highways by the Legislature, and particularly those essential to the conservation and development of natural resources, of economic and social value, and encouraging desirable land utilization, having in addition the following characteristics, to wit: roads (including bridges and ferries) which

        The State Aid Engineer shall see that the criteria imposed herein are explicitly followed in the designation and in the construction of the state aid roads in each county. The State Aid Engineer shall promulgate regulations pursuant to the Administrative Procedures Act to require the development of a network of intercounty roads and to provide for a review process within the state aid division for the designation of said state aid roads. Such regulations shall also establish standards for state aid route designation. The State Aid Engineer is hereby authorized and directed to withhold funds from such counties until the state aid roads therein are designated and constructed according to the characteristics set forth herein.

        All other roads under the jurisdiction of the several boards of supervisors are hereby declared to be “local farm roads” and not affected in anywise by this chapter.

       <p>
        State aid roads in the several counties shall be eligible for state aid in the manner and under the terms and conditions hereinafter set out. Local system roads (as defined in Section 65-18-3) in the several counties shall be eligible for state aid in the manner and under the terms and conditions set out in the Local System Road Program established in Sections 65-18-1 through 65-18-17. State aid, by way of funds to be expended on state aid roads and local system roads (as defined in Section 65-18-3), shall consist of any sum or sums provided by the Legislature to supplement funds furnished by the several counties for the purpose of constructing, improving, widening, straightening, surfacing, or reconstructing roads on the state aid system or for the purpose of the construction, reconstruction and paving of roads on the Local System Road Program, and shall be available to the several counties in such proportion as may be fixed and determined by law.

      <p>
       The Legislature has provided a specific mechanism for allowing counties to receive an advance of the state aid road funds to which they are entitled, and has specifically declared it to be the intent of the statute that state aid road funds be utilized to the greatest extent possible, rather than being held until sufficient amounts to fully fund a project have been accrued in a particular county’s account.

      <li id="t65c09s65-9-3ol11">
       There is hereby set up for designation by cooperative action of the state and counties a state aid system of roads (including bridges and ferries), as classified and defined in Section 65-9-1, which system shall be designated by the several boards of supervisors in their respective counties, with the consent and approval of the State Aid Engineer, to a total mileage not in excess of twenty-five thousand eight hundred fifty-seven and four-hundredths (25,857.04) miles not including any municipal streets, except that a state aid route may be extended into a municipality in order to make a convenient and orderly connection with the nearest paved or surfaced street or highway capable of carrying the traffic originating on or destined for such state aid route and thereby making a systematic connection with the highway and street systems of the state and its political subdivisions. Such system may be modified or revised from time to time by mutual agreement between the said boards of supervisors and the State Aid Engineer. Mileage on the state aid system shall be allocated to the several counties of the state in the following proportions:

    Duties of State Aid Engineer.

     <p>
      It shall be the duty of the State Aid Engineer to advise with the boards of supervisors of the several counties on all matters of policy, use of funds, priority of construction, uniform standards for state aid roads, safeguards in accounting methods, and other related matters and to cooperate with the several boards of supervisors on all matters connected with the laying out and construction of the state aid system of county roads. The State Aid Engineer shall promulgate, as soon as practicable, such uniform and reasonable rules and regulations as he may deem necessary to effectuate a proper designation of state aid roads to be constructed in each county, the methods for determining priority of construction, the making of surveys, and the preparation of plans and specifications for the construction of state aid roads, and to provide a uniform system of accounting in the expenditure of state aid road funds. The State Aid Engineer, after conferring with the Chief Engineer of the State Highway Department, shall prepare and promulgate uniform design standards and specifications for the construction of the state aid road system, which said uniform design standards and specifications may be modified or amended from time to time as the State Aid Engineer may deem necessary. Such standards may be in one or more classifications, according to types and kinds of roads. After such uniform design standards and specifications have been prepared and approved by the State Aid Engineer, the boards of supervisors shall apply the same to all new construction of state aid roads in their counties and, unless not practicable and feasible, to reconstruction of old roads on the state aid road system; but no deviation from such uniform standards and specifications shall be made without the approval of the State Aid Engineer.
     </p>
     <p>
      It shall also be the duty of the State Aid Engineer to advise and cooperate with the boards of supervisors in the selection and designation of the county roads which are to be made a part of the state aid road system, as provided in this chapter, and to approve or disapprove the selection of roads to be made a part of the state aid road system by the boards of supervisors.
     </p>
     <p>
      The State Aid Engineer shall finally approve or disapprove all contracts advertised and let by any board of supervisors for the construction or reconstruction of state aid roads and he shall approve or disapprove any or all force account estimates for such construction. If disapproved, he shall give a notice to said county of his disapproval and state each reason, and he shall give the said county time to cure the defects, or such parts thereof as may be necessary to cure, so that the county may receive its share of state aid.
     </p>
     <p>
      All proposals covering work to be performed by any county with its own forces on state aid roads and all force account estimates submitted for approval shall be on forms prepared for the purpose by the State Aid Engineer. Such forms shall be in such detail and based upon such cost accounting rules and regulations as may be prescribed from time to time by the State Aid Engineer, but in no event shall the purchase of any road machinery or other general equipment out of the state aid road funds be allowed or permitted by such rules and regulations. Force account estimates may include a reasonable rental for machinery or equipment, and the reasonableness of the rental so estimated and as actually paid shall be subject at all times to modification, revision, approval, or disapproval of the State Aid Engineer and under the cost accounting rules and regulations promulgated by him.
     </p>
     <p>
      The State Aid Engineer and such assistants as he may designate shall supervise and inspect all state aid road projects as the work progresses. Upon final completion of any such project, the State Aid Engineer shall cause a final inspection to be made of such project for the purpose of determining whether such project has been completed satisfactorily in accordance with the plans and specifications; and if satisfactorily completed, the State Aid Engineer shall approve payment of the final estimate on such project. No progress or final estimate, either on a contract or a force account project, shall be paid unless approved in such manner by the State Aid Engineer, and on all such contracts or force account projects a percentage of not less than two and one-half percent (21/2%) nor more than ten percent (10%) of each estimate thereon paid shall be retained until final acceptance of such project; provided, however, the amount retained by the prime contractor from each payment due the subcontractor shall not exceed the percentage withheld from the prime contractor.

If a county engineer is engineer for two (2) or more counties, the same bond shall serve as said engineer’s bond in and for each county, respectively, and the premium on said bond and the salary and expenses of such engineer and assistants shall be divided between and paid by the counties for whom he is so employed in such proportions as may be agreed upon by said counties. In the event any county is unable to obtain the services of a competent engineer, the Transportation Commission may loan such county an engineer, if available, for a specified period of time, by granting such engineer a leave of absence for such period without loss of any benefits accruing to him by reason of length of service; and such time so spent on such leave of absence shall be counted as part of such engineer’s length of service with the Department of Transportation. The salary of such engineer so loaned shall be paid by the county or the counties to whom he is loaned.
     </p>
     <p>
      The salary and other expenses, including the premium on all bonds, of the county engineer and his assistants shall be paid by the county or counties employing such county engineer and assistants. Any salary limitations or ceiling heretofore placed by law on the salary of a county engineer is hereby removed as to county engineers employed under the terms of this chapter. In lieu of salary and other expenses, any county may employ a registered civil engineer on a fee basis for furnishing complete engineering services on state aid projects. Engineering costs, including the salaries or fees of the county engineer, incurred on state aid projects may be paid from state aid funds allocated to said county or counties, with the methods of payments to be approved by the State Aid Engineer under regulations promulgated by the State Aid Engineer; however, unless the project is being partially funded with federal funds, no such costs shall be paid to the county from state aid funds prior to the approval for advertisement for bids for a project by the State Aid Engineer. If the project is being partially funded with federal funds, the State Aid Engineer may approve payment of a portion of such costs from state aid funds prior to the approval for advertisement for bids.

       A county engineer, whose employment contract with the county had expired, was entitled to recover his fee for projects begun before the expiration date of his last contract and finished afterward, where the contract provided that he would be paid one fee when each project was finished and accepted, and no provision was made for piecemeal payment as the work progressed.

       Where the contract of a county engineer was extended by action of the board of supervisors, which action was recorded on the Board’s minutes, but after expiration of the extension, no subsequent contract appeared upon the minutes, although the board continued to submit an annual program to the state for projects for which the engineer was required, and continued to record the engineer’s estimate for each project and to record notice to bidders based on such estimate, the county engineer had no legal contract with the county after expiration of the extension and could not recover for projects begun after that date.

    Maintenance of state aid roads.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      It shall be the duty of the several boards of supervisors to properly maintain all state aid roads in their respective counties after construction of any such roads with state aid monies. It shall be the duty of the State Aid Engineer and his assistants to make annual maintenance inspections of completed projects, and such other periodic maintenance inspections as the State Aid Engineer shall deem necessary. If essential maintenance is not properly and regularly carried on, in the opinion of the State Aid Engineer, then notice thereof shall be given in writing to the board in default, and if such maintenance is not done and continued within sixty (60) days from date of such notice, then, and in such event, the State Aid Engineer may proceed to have done the necessary maintenance and repair work on such road and charge the same to any funds in the State Aid Road Fund in the State Treasury allocated to such county. If such failure to maintain continues, then such county shall be no longer eligible for state aid until proper maintenance is resumed by it, and notice of such withdrawal of state aid shall be duly given the State Treasurer; however, such ineligibility shall not affect payment from the State Aid Road Fund of progress or final estimates on contracts awarded prior to notice of such ineligibility, nor shall that ineligibility in any way affect the payment of principal and interest on state aid road bonds issued by any such county.
     </p>
     <p>
      State aid roads which have been hard surfaced through the use of state aid funds or federal aid funds shall be eligible for state aid funds to provide one or more seal courses, as required. State aid roads in which the grading and drainage structures were constructed under state aid projects and which have been subsequently hard surfaced by the county through the use of county funds under the supervision of the county engineer shall likewise be eligible for state aid funds to provide one or more seal courses as required, provided that the hard surfacing and underlying base were constructed in accordance with the then prevailing state aid standards and specifications. The county shall furnish the State Aid Engineer with sufficient engineering data, including borings and tests, if necessary, to substantiate the required thickness and quality of the base and surfacing. The correction of base defects and pavement breaks may be made part of the plans and contract documents for each sealing project.
     </p>
     <p>
      State aid roads which were constructed in accordance with the then prevailing state aid standards and specifications shall be eligible for state aid funds for maintenance, repair and reconstruction, subject to the prior written approval of such work by the State Aid Engineer and subject to the work being completed in accordance with the prior written approval.

       In a family’s suit following a car accident, summary judgment in favor of the department of transportation, the county, and the engineer was proper as the family failed to produce sufficient evidence to establish that the last inspection by the department was negligently performed, or that the county or the engineer negligently inspected and maintained the culvert.

     <p>
      It being recognized that county highways generally have deteriorated to a considerable extent during the past several years, and it being further recognized that the selection, construction, and improvement of a system of all-weather rural secondary, feeder, or farm-to-market roads is a matter of primary state-wide concern, it is hereby declared to be the purpose of Sections 65-11-1 through 65-11-37 to provide for a more comprehensive rural-road program through cooperation between the federal government, the state highway commission of Mississippi, and the county boards of supervisors; and it is further the purpose and intent of said sections to provide a means, manner, and funds whereby the counties of this state will be enabled to participate in the federal aid program, and will be enabled to participate in and avail themselves of the funds apportioned to the State of Mississippi for the construction and improvement of secondary and feeder roads, including farm-to-market roads, rural mail routes, and public school bus routes, under the terms of the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1944 [58 U. S. Stat. 838, ch. 626]. It is hereby declared to be the intent and purpose of the cited sections that, insofar as permissible under federal laws, rules, and regulations, not less than fifty per cent (50%) of the funds apportioned to Mississippi for secondary and feeder roads under the terms of subsection (b), section 3, of the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1944 [58 U. S. Stat. 838, ch. 626] should be expended for the construction and improvement of county highways as defined in said sections.

      The amount of federal funds made available to the State of Mississippi for secondary and feeder roads under the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1944 [58 U. S. Stat. 838, ch. 626] which is allotted to the counties as provided in Section 65-11-9, shall be apportioned among the counties of this state by the State Highway Commission in the following manner: one third in the ratio which the area of each county bears to the total area of the state; one third in the ratio which the rural population of each county bears to the total rural population of the state, as shown by the federal census of 1940; and one third in the ratio which the mileage of rural delivery and star routes in each county bears to the total mileage of rural delivery and star routes in the state. The amount of federal funds so apportioned to each county shall be matched by state funds apportioned to the State Highway Fund to carry out the purposes of Sections 65-11-1 through 65-11-37 as hereinafter provided; in the event the amount so appropriated for such State Highway Fund is insufficient to entirely match the federal funds allotted to county highways, then the amount of such fund shall be apportioned among the counties in the same manner as herein provided. “Rural population” and “rural delivery” routes as used in this section shall have the same meaning ascribed to them in the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1944 [58 U.

    General provisions for bonds.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The bonds of the authority shall not be included in computing any present or future debt limit of the county, supervisors district, municipality, agency, or department under any present or future law.
     </p>
     <p>
      All such bonds provided by this chapter shall be negotiable instruments within the meaning of the Uniform Commercial Code, shall be lithographed or engraved and printed in two (2) or more colors to prevent counterfeiting. They shall be in denominations of not less than One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00), may be registered as issued, and shall be numbered as determined by the authority. Each such bond shall specify on its face the purpose for which it was issued and the total amount authorized to be issued, and the interest to accrue thereon may be evidenced by proper coupons to be attached thereto. Such bonds shall bear interest at such rate or rates as may be determined by the sale of such bonds, provided that the bonds of any issue shall not bear a greater overall maximum interest rate to maturity than that allowed in Section 75-17-103. They shall mature annually in such amounts and at such times as shall be provided by the resolution of the board of trustees. No bond shall have a longer maturity than forty (40) years from date of issuance, and the first maturity date thereof shall be not more than five (5) years from the date of such bonds. The denomination, form, and place or places of payment of such bonds shall be fixed in the resolution of the board of trustees of the authority. Such bonds shall be signed by the president and secretary of such board, with the seal of the authority affixed thereto, but the coupons, if any, may bear only the facsimile signatures of such president and secretary. All interest accruing on such bonds so issued shall be payable semiannually, except that the first interest coupon attached to any such bond may be for any period not exceeding one (1) year. Only one (1) coupon may be attached to a bond for any one (1) specified period of time. No interest coupon can vary more than twenty-five percent (25%) in value from any other coupon on the same bond or another coupon in the same issue.
     </p>
     <p>
      Such bonds may be called in, paid, and redeemed in inverse numerical order on any interest date prior to maturity, upon not less than thirty (30) days’ notice to the paying agent or agents designated in such bonds, and at such premium as may be designated in such bonds. However, in no case shall any premiums exceed six percent (6%) of the face value of such bonds.
     </p>
     <p>
      All such bonds shall contain in substance a statement to the effect that they are secured solely by a pledge of the net revenues of the authority and/or the avails of voluntary assessments of adjacent landowners, and that they do not constitute general obligations of any political subdivision of the State of Mississippi except the authority created by this chapter, and are not secured by a pledge of the full faith, credit, and resources of said state or of such county or counties.
     </p>
     <p>
      All such bonds as provided for herein shall be sold under the sealed bid procedure at public sale as now provided by law except as otherwise provided herein. No such sale shall be at a price so low as to require the payment of interest on money received therefor at more than a greater overall maximum interest rate to maturity than that allowed in Section 75-17-103.
     </p>
     <p>
      This chapter shall be full and complete authority for the issuance of the bonds provided for herein, and no restriction or limitation otherwise prescribed by law shall apply herein.
     </p>
     <p>
      Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section, bonds referred to hereinabove may be issued pursuant to the supplemental powers and authorizations conferred by the provisions of the Registered Bond Act, being Sections 31-21-1 through 31-21-7.

       When a county received a sum of money from the state as a reimbursement for tax loss by reason of its being prevented by the Homestead Exemption Act from collecting ad valorem taxes for road purposes on homestead property in a municipality, the funds so received were in lieu of such ad valorem taxes, and, in view of the statute providing the one-half of all ad valorem taxes collected by or for a county on property within a municipality for road purposes should be paid over to the municipality, one-half of the amount thus received from the state should have been paid over by the county to the municipality.

       The statute providing that one-half of all ad valorem taxes collected for road purposes by or for a county on property within a municipality, the streets of which are worked at the expense of the municipality, shall be paid over to the municipality was neither repealed nor amended by the Homestead Exemption Law, with the provision therein relating to reimbursement of the taxing units by the state for tax loss resulting from being prevented from collecting ad valorem taxes on homestead property for road purposes.

      <p>
       In order for members of the board of supervisors to be personally liable on their bond for failure to make an allowance to a municipality working its own streets of its proportionate share to ad valorem taxes for road purposes, it would have to appear by pleading or proof, that it was a ministerial duty only, and not a judicial power that was being exercised.

       In order for a municipality to be entitled to ad valorem taxes for road purposes, such taxes being collected on property within the municipality, it should have filed with the board of supervisors an ordinance or some other appropriate record, showing that the municipality worked its streets at its own expense, such showing being jurisdictional to the power of the Board to make the allowance.

       There is a distinction between the necessity for notifying the board of supervisors of the fact that the streets of the municipality have been worked at the expense of the municipal treasury, or worked by municipal authority, and the fact that the claim for its share of the ad valorem taxes will be made, in the latter instance no notice of the municipality’s intention to claim its share of the taxes being required, while in the former case it is necessary that the board of supervisors be officially advised of the basis of its authority to make the refund, since it is only where such streets have been worked at the expense of the municipal treasury, or by municipal authority, that the board is required, or given the power and authority, to make the allowance.

       Municipality, before becoming entitled to recover one-half of road taxes collected by county prior to adoption of Code 1930, must have previously passed and served valid resolution declaring desire to claim such taxes, and, as to period previous to April 16, 1928, funds out of which recovery could be had must have remained unexpended and unappropriated, but not as to those subsequent to that date.

The county road manager shall not be a member of the board of supervisors. The county road manager, under the policies determined by the board of supervisors and subject to the board’s general supervision and control, shall administer the county road department, superintend the working, construction and maintaining of the public roads and the building of bridges in such county, and carry out the general policies of the board in conformity with the estimates of expenditures fixed in the annual budget as finally adopted by the board or as thereafter revised by appropriate action of the board.

      </h4>
      <p>
       Court held that a Mississippi county road manager occupied a position where party affiliation was an appropriate requirement for the effective performance of the public office involved because roads in rural Mississippi were the political lifeblood of elected officials, and the public’s view of the elected supervisors depended greatly on the road manager’s performance and supervision of employees. Gentry v. Lowndes County, 337 F.3d 481, 2003 U.S. App. LEXIS 13505 (5th Cir. Miss. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       It is permissible under Code 1942 § 2939, for a county or a supervisor’s district, which owns road machinery and equipment, to have the same repaired by employing labor for that purpose, and the law does not require that the employment of labor for repair work on road machinery shall be on competitive bids, following the usual advertisement of an intention to have such property repaired for use, or forbid a contract with a repairman until the next meeting of the board. Shook v. Carroll County, 210 Miss. 537, 49 So. 2d 897, 1951 Miss. LEXIS 292 (Miss. 1951).
      </p>
      <p>
       Declaration against member of board of supervisors and surety alleging that defendant under whose supervision, no road commissioner having been appointed, the road work of the district had been placed, left bridge which was being repaired in unsafe condition at night without warning signals, causing damage to plaintiff when he drove over bridge in automobile, was sufficient. State use of Russell v. McRae, 169 Miss. 169, 152 So. 826, 1934 Miss. LEXIS 26 (Miss. 1934).

   Summary judgment was properly awarded to a county board of supervisors in plaintiffs’ action to recover damages for injuries sustained after their vehicle collided with a mailbox on the shoulder of a road because although the board admittedly failed to personally inspect the road where the accident occurred, the county road management department, as an agent for the board under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t65c17s65-17-1ol12" target="_self">65-17-1(2)</a></cite>, conducted an inspection of the road and, thus, satisfied the statutory requirements. Bryant v.

        OPINIONS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL
       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       Statute evinces intent that road manager make determinations such as where county workers will appear to sign up for insurance, and what street or culvert workers will be repairing or constructing on any given day; statute also states that individual member may not countermand work orders of road manager. Fortenberry, May 10, 1990, A.G. Op. #90-0318.
      </p>
      <p>
       County board of supervisors may not employ assistant road manager without individual having been recommended to position by county road manager. Colson, Feb. 16, 1994, A.G. Op. #93-1027.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under Section 65-17-1, it is the county road manager who directs the actions of road employees and not the board of supervisors. Bradley, March 15, 1996, A.G. Op. #96-0085.
      </p>
      <p>
       A member of the county board of supervisors may not physically operate county road equipment or personally perform any other work on road construction and maintenance.
   Bryant, November 7, 1998, A.G. Op. #98-0671.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no authority for an individual supervisor to supersede any activities of a county road manager; all statutory authority over a county road manager is reserved to the board of supervisors, and not to any one supervisor. Carter, Dec. 17, 1999, A.G. Op. #99-0681.
      </p>
      <p>
       A board of supervisors, by a simple majority vote, may establish general policies for and exercise general supervision and control over the county road manager, must approve all hiring, firing and wages, and must approve the purchase price or rental amount for purchases and rentals by the county road manager; further, a board of supervisors may, by a majority of all members of the board, supersede, modify, amend, etc., any act of the county road manager unless such action by the board would result in a breach of contract. Carter, Dec. 17, 1999, A.G. Op. #99-0681.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no statutory authority for a road manager to abolish a personnel position that has been designated by the board of supervisors. Brooks, Mar. 26, 2004, A.G. Op. 04-0108.
      </p>
      <p>
       A board of supervisors may require by policy and procedure either prior approval or subsequent approval of all employment decisions by the county road manager. Brooks, Mar. 26, 2004, A.G. Op. 04-0108.
      </p>
      <p>
       A county road manager has the authority to set or change the working hours of the county road department without prior approval of the board of supervisors and to utilize money budgeted for the operation of the department to pay for such notice to be published. However, boards of supervisors are empowered to “supercede any act of the road manager or change, modify or revoke any act which has been completed by the road manager, provided the change, modification or revocation does not constitute a breach of contract.” Hudson, Apr. 16, 2004, A.G. Op. 04-0160.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which county roads require major maintenance is established in a four-year plan built on annual road inspections by the board of supervisors, and such policy is to be implemented by the county road manager. The board of supervisors may change or modify any action of the road manager by an official order approved by a majority vote of the board, reflected in the minutes, but no individual supervisor has the authority to advise or direct the road manager to perform major maintenance. White, March 23, 2007, A.G. Op. #07-00118, 2007 Miss. AG LEXIS 122.

       § 65-17-101.
    Supervisors may elect road accountant.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The board of supervisors may elect a road accountant, whose salary shall be fixed by the board and who shall give bond, with sufficient surety, to be payable, conditioned and approved as provided by law, in a penalty not less than Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000.00). For the purpose of enabling the road accountant, in counties working their roads and building and repairing bridges on the unit system or countywide basis, to meet weekly payrolls and to pay for same each week or biweekly, the board of supervisors may advance to him at each regular monthly meeting, out of the road and bridge fund of the county, a sum not exceeding fifty percent (50%) of the amount of his bond. Said road accountant shall place said funds in the county depository to his credit as road accountant, to be checked on by him to meet weekly payrolls for labor, and said fund shall be a public fund and shall be secured as other public funds are secured. The road accountant shall report to the next meeting of the board his disposition of said money, including an itemized payroll for same, which payroll must be approved by the board of supervisors before another advance to him may be made. In the event the board finds any discrepancies in said payroll account, he shall be liable on his official bond for same; and the board of supervisors, in such event, shall not make further allowances to him until said discrepancies are corrected. It shall be the duty of the road accountant to pay all labor employed on the road and bridge work of the county, to pay transportation charges on supplies and material used in such road and bridge work, and all bills for repairs. Every three (3) months he shall take an inventory of all the personal property of the county used in said road and bridge work.

      It shall be the duty of the several boards of supervisors to properly maintain all local system roads in their respective counties after construction of any such roads under this chapter. It shall be the duty of the State Aid Engineer and his assistants to make annual maintenance inspections of completed projects, and such other periodic maintenance inspections as the State Aid Engineer shall deem necessary. If essential maintenance is not properly and regularly carried on, in the opinion of the State Aid Engineer, then notice thereof shall be given in writing to the board in default, and if such maintenance is not done and continued within sixty (60) days from date of such notice, then, and in such event, the State Aid Engineer may proceed to have done the necessary maintenance and repair work on such road and charge the same to any funds allocated to such county under the provisions of the Local System Road Program. If such failure to maintain continues, then such county shall be no longer eligible for monies under the Local System Road Program until proper maintenance is resumed by it, and notice of such withdrawal of local system road funds shall be duly given the State Treasurer; however, such ineligibility shall not affect payment under the Local System Road Program of progress or final estimates on contracts awarded before notice of such ineligibility.

     <p>
      Local system roads that have been hard surfaced through the use of local system road funds shall be eligible for local system road funds to provide one or more seal courses, as required. Local system roads in which the grading and drainage structures were constructed under the Local System Road Program and which have been subsequently hard surfaced by the county through the use of county funds under the supervision of the county engineer shall likewise be eligible for local system road funds to provide one or more seal courses as required, provided that the hard surfacing and underlying base were constructed in accordance with the then prevailing local system road standards and specifications. The county shall furnish the State Aid Engineer with sufficient engineering data, including borings and tests, if necessary, to substantiate the required thickness and quality of the base and surfacing. The correction of base defects and pavement breaks may be made part of the plans and contract documents for each sealing project.
     </p>
     <p>
      Local system roads that were constructed in accordance with the then prevailing local system road standards and specifications shall be eligible for local system road funds for maintenance, repair and reconstruction, subject to the prior written approval of such work by the State Aid Engineer and subject to the work being completed in accordance with the prior written approval.

      At the time and place named in said notice, or at any other time or place not later than fifteen days thereafter which may be designated by said board, said board of supervisors shall meet and shall hear remonstrances or objections to the creation of said road district or to the bringing of any part of said territory within the district, shall pass upon and determine the sufficiency of the petition, the boundaries of the district to be created, or the territory to be placed therein, and shall make such orders as justice and equity shall require. The board of supervisors upon said hearing is hereby vested with full authority to decline to create the district or to exclude from said district any lands named in its previous order or in said petition which, in the discretion of said board, should not be included in said district. If it be determined to create the district, the order to that effect shall clearly define the territory to be included therein, which territory and district may be described by a reference to supervisors’ districts or to fixed and known boundaries of the county or of any subdivision thereof, or by specifying the lands included by range, township, and section or lot, or by defining the metes and bounds. The said order shall designate said district or territory by some suitable name, or the district or territory may be designated “road district No._______________of_______________county, or road district of_______________county.”

      If at the time of the said hearing twenty-five percent (25%) of the qualified electors of such proposed district petition against its creation or against the amount of the bonds proposed, then the district shall not be created unless at an election, ordered by the board of supervisors for the purpose, a majority of the qualified voters of such district, voting in such election, vote in favor of the creation of the district; the board of its own motion may order an election with like effect as if ordered under the foregoing proviso.

    Extension of road beyond the limits of district.

     </h3>
     <p>
      If the qualified electors petitioning for the creation and organization of a separate road district shall so desire, they may petition, in addition, that the proceeds of the sale of said bonds may be used to extend and build roads beyond the limits of such district and that a tax be levied on such district or districts to pay such bonds and maintain such roads, in which case it shall be the duty of the board, in publishing the notice as hereinbefore provided, to add thereto notice of the further purpose to use part of the proceeds of said bonds in building and maintaining roads in other territory, naming the said other territory; and to levy taxes for that purpose. In any election ordered therein, the further question shall be submitted to the electors, whether such roads are to be so extended or not, which shall be submitted as follows: “For the extension of roads into other districts,” or “against the extension of roads into other districts.” If said election result in favor of such action, determined and adjudicated in like manner by the election commissioners and board of supervisors, as required by law, then the said road commissioners shall, with the approval of the board of supervisors, have the power to extend said roads into other districts and pay for the same out of the proceeds of the sale of said bonds, and levy a tax to maintain the same on such district consenting thereto, as provided for in this chapter.

      Such election shall be held so far as practicable in accordance with the laws regulating general elections in this state; however, in order to authorize the creation of such proposed road district, a majority of the qualified electors residing in such territory shall vote in favor of such creation. When the election commissioners of the county shall have received returns of said election and have declared the result thereof, they shall, after having canvassed the same, forthwith make returns of said election to the board of supervisors by filing with the board of supervisors a certificate stating the number of votes cast in favor of the creation, the number of votes cast against the creation, and the number of qualified electors residing in the territory proposed to be created into a road district. The number of qualified electors residing in said territory shall be determined at the meeting of the election commissioners first preceding said election, as required by Section 23-5-79, Mississippi Code of 1972. At its next meeting after it has received said returns, the board of supervisors shall adjudicate whether or not a majority of the qualified electors of the territory have voted in favor of the creation of said road district, from the findings of the election commissioners as herein required.
     </p>
     <p>
      Should the result of such election show that it has carried in favor of the creation of the district by a majority vote of the qualified electors residing in the proposed district, then it shall be the duty of the board of supervisors to issue the bonds of such district in the necessary amount, not to exceed ten percent (10%) of the assessed value of all taxable property of the district. The amount within this limit shall be fixed by the commissioners hereinafter provided for, subject to the approval of the board of supervisors, such bonds to be issued and sold either all at one time or in installments from time to time as funds are needed for the construction of such highway or highways, in the discretion of the commissioners and the board of supervisors. Any county, supervisor’s district, part of supervisor’s district, or districts which have heretofore issued bonds in said county, supervisor’s district, parts of supervisor’s district, or districts for road purposes may, under the provisions of this chapter and in pursuance thereof, issue bonds in addition to those already issued, provided that the total amount of bonds for road purposes outstanding and to be issued shall not exceed ten percent (10%) of the assessed value of all the taxable property of the district.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The bonds issued under authority hereof shall mature not later than twenty-five (25) years from the date of their issuance; shall bear interest at such rate or rates, provided that the bonds of any issue shall not bear a greater overall maximum interest rate to maturity than that allowed in Section 75-17-101, payable annually or semiannually, as the board of supervisors shall direct; shall be exempt from all taxes, and shall be payable in annual installments, the amount to be paid each year to be fixed by the board of supervisors when the bonds are issued. All such bonds, with interest coupons if any attached, shall be lithographed with suitable devices to prevent counterfeiting; shall be in denominations to be fixed by the board of supervisors; shall be registered by the clerk of the board of supervisors in a book to be kept for that purpose; shall be numbered as provided by the board of supervisors, and shall be signed by the president of the board and countersigned by the clerk, who shall impress the seal of the county upon each bond as it is issued. The coupons, if any, shall be lithographed with the facsimile signatures of the president and clerk of said board, and every such bond shall specify on its face the purpose for which it was authorized and the total amount authorized to be issued. Each bond shall be made payable to a person by name, or may be made payable to bearer without any name, such bonds to be entitled “Road bonds of ,” describing by name or number the territory created and organized into a road district. Such bonds shall not be sold for less than their face value; and the board of supervisors of each county shall levy annually a special tax upon all the taxable property of the district to be used exclusively in paying the interest on the bonds and providing a sinking fund for their redemption.
     </p>
     <p>
      Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section, bonds referred to hereinabove may be issued pursuant to the supplemental powers and authorizations conferred by the provisions of the Registered Bond Act, being Sections 31-21-1 through 31-21-7.

     <p>
      It shall be the duty of the board of supervisors in case the election shall result in favor of the creation of the district, at its next regular meeting or any subsequent meeting, to appoint three commissioners, who shall be qualified electors of the district and real estate owners therein, who shall hold office for a term of four years from the time of their appointment and until their successors are appointed by the board of supervisors, whose duty it shall be to have the management and supervision of the construction and maintenance of the roads built under the provisions hereof, subject to the approval of the board of supervisors, and for their services shall be paid their actual expenses, not exceeding one hundred dollars each per annum. The board of supervisors may remove any commissioner, for cause or at pleasure, at any time and fill the vacancy thereby caused; and the board may, at any time after the roads within a district have been constructed by the proceeds of bonds sold, discontinue the commissioners, proceed to administer the fiscal affairs of the road district in the manner authorized by law, and make tax levies without recommendation of the commissioners on all taxable property in such district or districts. The commissioners may employ an attorney, if necessary, and pay him a reasonable compensation.

       A Board of Supervisors is authorized to levy a tax on the property of a supervisors’ district only and not on the property of the entire county for the special purpose of paying outstanding loan warrants issued by such district, the collective tax becoming part of the district road fund. Yazoo & M. V. R. Co. v. Harvey, 188 Miss. 665, 196 So. 512, 1940 Miss. LEXIS 80 (Miss. 1940).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section seems to require the concurring judgment of the road commissioners and the board of supervisors as to the proprieties and necessities in connection with the issuance of indebtedness against the road districts; so where the consent of both the road commissioners and the board of supervisors is required, the latter alone could not issue tax anticipation notes to raise funds for the construction of a highway in a supervisors’ district. Illinois C. R. Co. v. Carroll County, 189 Miss. 206, 196 So. 242, 1940 Miss. LEXIS 106 (Miss. 1940).
      </p>
      <p>
       Issuance of tax anticipation notes to raise funds to construct a highway in a supervisors’ district of the county under statutory provision applicable only to the issuance of such notes for county wide purposes was not validated by a statutory provision permitting issuance of such notes for an indebtedness against a road district with the concurring judgment of the board of supervisors and the road commissioners, and accordingly taxes collected to pay off such tax anticipation notes should be refunded. Illinois C. R. Co. v. Carroll County, 189 Miss. 206, 196 So. 242, 1940 Miss. LEXIS 106 (Miss. 1940).

      The board, in assessing the benefits derived by any land in such district, shall consider only its proximity to the road and its market terminus. No benefit assessment shall be made on any lands when the distance between it and the nearest point on the road is greater than three tenths of the distance from such point on the road to the market terminus of the road, and no benefit assessment shall be made on any land more than three and one-half miles from the road. Any subdivision of a section of land containing forty acres, more or less, for the purposes of the benefit assessment may be included in such district if one fourth thereof is within the lines of the district. The board may collect from a benefit district an amount equal to One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00) for each lineal mile of road constructed therein, and no more, except interest on the amount that may be expended twelve months or more in advance of the collection of any tax. The board shall not undertake the construction of any road when the estimate indicates that the total cost will exceed Thirty-five Hundred Dollars ($3,500.00) per mile.

       If one person owns five of twenty-two lots, that person gets five votes pursuant to Miss. Code Section 65-19-88. Jones, Jan. 25, 1993, A.G. Op. #92-1017.
      </p>
      <p>
       When second sentence of Miss. Code Section 65-19-88(1) refers to “three-fifths of such landowners”, it means three-fifths of owners of all lots bordering on unpaved street; it does not mean three-fifths of one-half of owners, as referred to in first sentence of Miss. Code Section 65-19-88(1). Jones, Jan. 25, 1993, A.G. Op. #92-1017.
      </p>
      <p>
       Local board has discretion to require greater number of lot owners to sign petitions than is required by Miss. Code Section 65-19-88, since that statute is couched in terms of language, such as“ the board may cause a survey” and “the board of supervisors may proceed”. Jones, Jan. 25, 1993, A.G. Op. #92-1017.
      </p>
      <p>
       Statute provides only that three-fifths of all landowners of lots bordering unpaved street file and sign petition to request board of supervisors to pave road; it does not require that lot owners of all roads in subdivision must agree. Jones, Jan 20, 1994, A.G. Op. #93-0861.
      </p>
      <p>
       The board may not mix the provisions of Section 17-21-51 and 65-19-88 to borrow money to pave the roads or streets within a subdivision under the authority and procedures established by Section 65-19-88. Sherard, May 17, 1995, A.G. Op. #95-0209.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under Section 65-19-88, a board may not increase the percentage of landowners required to sign and file a petition calling for the paving of a public street to one hundred percent. Sherard, May 17, 1995, A.G. Op. #95-0209.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 65-19-88 authorizes a county board of supervisors to borrow money in advance of the collection of taxes for the improvement of a street or road within a subdivision from the land owners bordering such street or road. Lauderdale, June 15, 1995, A.G. Op. #95-0395.
      </p>

       The costs of improvements to unpaved roads within developed subdivisions shall be assessed upon a lineal footage basis and not equally per unit parcel. Lauderdale, March 13, 1998, A.G. Op. #98-0134.

      <p>
       Interest upon obligations of a county incurred pursuant to the statute are exempt from income taxation by the State of Mississippi.

   Mississippi Department of Transportation (MDOT) was not immune in a wrongful death claim alleging that a failure to place warning signs around a highway culvert, as required by
   Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t65c21s65-21-1" target="_self">65-21-1</a></cite>, resulted in an auto accident that caused the decedent’s death because §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t65c21s65-21-1" target="_self">65-21-1</a></cite> imposed a ministerial duty, and, as
   Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.63.html#t63c03s63-3-301" target="_blank">63-3-301</a></cite> and
   Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.63.html#t63c03s63-3-303" target="_blank">63-3-303</a></cite> included no language suggesting abrogation or repeal of § 65-21-1, that section-narrowly, precisely, and specifically requiring warning posts around culverts-remained in effect as an exception to the general rule of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.63.html#t63c03s63-3-303" target="_blank">63-3-303</a></cite> that the MDOT had discretion over such placement;
   Miss. Code Ann. § 65-21-1 controlled the specific issue of guide and warning posts around culverts, and § 63-3-303 controlled the discretionary placement of traffic devices that were not the subject of a specific statutory mandate.
   Miss. DOT v. Nosef, 110 So.3d 317, 2013 Miss. LEXIS 143 (Miss. 2013).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Order granting summary judgment in favor of a county’s board of supervisors with regard to a properly owner’s action for damage to his timberland was affirmed because the board was immune under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.11.html#t11c16s11-16-9ol11d" target="_blank">11-16-9(1)(d)</a></cite>. While Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t65c21s65-21-1" target="_self">65-21-1</a></cite> set the minimum length for a culvert, it did not make the sizing and installation of a culvert ministerial; therefore, such functions were entitled to immunity under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.11.html#t11c46s11-46-9ol11d" target="_blank">11-46-9(1)(d)</a></cite> as a discretionary function. Fisher v. Lauderdale County Bd. of Supervisors, 7 So.3d 968, 2009 Miss. App. LEXIS 175 (Miss. Ct. App. 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence did not establish breach of ministerial duty on part of county supervisors in their individual capacities in connection with replacement of bridge with culvert on county road; while statute required culverts to be not less than full width of crown of roadway and to have guide or warning posts on either side, there was no evidence that such minimum standards were not met. Mohundro v. Alcorn County, 675 So. 2d 848, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 301 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t65c21s65-21-1" target="_self">65-21-1</a></cite> plainly states that certain construction requirements must be met once a governmental entity determines that a culvert is needed; it only sets forth the minimum requirements to be met with regard to the construction of culverts, and any decisions made outside of those minimum requirements are discretionary functions of government. Barr v. Hancock County, 950 So. 2d 254, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 109 (Miss. Ct. App. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Placement of a warning sign at a culvert is considered a ministerial function, as set forth in Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t65c21s65-21-1" target="_self">65-21-1</a></cite>. Barr v. Hancock County, 950 So. 2d 254, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 109 (Miss. Ct. App. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Summary judgment was properly granted to a county based on sovereign immunity under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.11.html#t11c46s11-46-9ol11d" target="_blank">11-46-9(1)(d)</a></cite> because the decision to backfill a road instead of paving it after the upgrade or installation of a culvert was a discretionary function; even though the failure to place a warning sign was a ministerial function, there was no liability for the county because the condition of the roadway, and not the failure to place the sign, was the cause of the accident. Barr v. Hancock County, 950 So. 2d 254, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 109 (Miss. Ct. App. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   The construction of county road bridges in accordance with the specifications mandated by §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t65c21s65-21-1" target="_self">65-21-1</a></cite> is a ministerial function because the statute allows no discretion in meeting the minimum specifications for bridge construction; thus, a county supervisor was not protected by qualified immunity in a wrongful death action arising from an automobile collision which occurred on a bridge that was allegedly negligently constructed. Coplin v. Francis, 631 So. 2d 752, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 40 (Miss. 1994), overruled,
   Little v. Miss. DOT, 129 So.3d 132, 2013 Miss. LEXIS 551 (Miss. 2013).

      In event the board of supervisors and the owners of such bridges cannot agree upon the price to be paid therefor, then the board of supervisors may condemn such bridge as a necessary part of the public road or highway of which said bridge connects and forms a part, and the amount to be paid for such bridge by the county shall be ascertained and determined in the manner now provided by law for the owners of land obtaining compensation for land taken for a public county road. All proceedings of the board of supervisors in assessing the amount to be paid the owners of such bridges may be reviewed by the circuit court; and the owner of such bridge so condemned by the county may appeal from the action of the board to the circuit court, where all questions of damages may be tried anew in the same respect as provided by law for appeals from action of the board of supervisors in assessing damages to the owners of land where land is taken for public county roads.

      For the purpose of carrying out the provisions of Section 65-21-15, the board or boards of supervisors may, in the same manner as set forth in said section, declare it to be their intention to issue bonds not earlier than thirty days and publish the same, stating the amount of contemplated bond issue, in any legal newspaper in the county or counties involved as provided by law. If twenty per cent of the qualified electors petition the board or boards of supervisors for an election to determine said bond issue, the board or boards of supervisors shall order an election not later than thirty days from the date the petition was presented, and a majority of the qualified electors voting shall decide the bond issue. If one or more of the counties voting should, by a majority vote of the qualified electors voting, decide against said bond issue, the part voting against the bond issue shall not issue said bonds; but if one or more of the counties voting at the same time or some other time vote favorably by a majority of the qualified electors voting for a bond issue, as provided in this section, then the board or boards of supervisors of the county or counties so voting may issue the designated bonds for the purpose of purchasing only the designated bridge or bridges.

       § 65-23-3.
    Toll bridge revenue bonds.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      In order to secure funds or a part of the funds for the purpose of acquiring, constructing, owning, operating, improving, extending, and maintaining toll bridges and approaches thereto, all public agencies named in Section 65-23-1 may issue negotiable toll bridge revenue bonds and sell such bonds to the United States government or any authorized agency thereof or other investor or investors. In the event of the issuance and sale of bonds authorized by this article by a public agency, such agency shall charge a reasonable toll for the use of any such toll bridge, the amount of which toll shall be sufficient to pay the reasonable cost of maintaining, repairing, and operating such bridge and to provide a sinking fund sufficient to amortize and repay any such loan, including interest and financing cost, on such terms and within such period of time as may be agreed upon between the borrower and purchaser of such revenue bonds. Such toll shall be used for no other purpose except for the necessary purpose of maintenance and repair of said bridge; and any public body which shall issue bonds under the provisions of this article is hereby authorized and required to fix a toll schedule, alter and change it, and make all necessary provisions for the payment of principal and interest on any such bonds by the fixing, collecting, segregating, and allocating of the tolls and other revenues received from the operation of such bridge or bridges. Such public agencies enumerated above may execute liens, in proper form, and pledge the revenue derived from the toll of such bridges or such bridge and approaches, or both, which are constructed or acquired with funds borrowed as above to the retirement of such bonds. No revenue bonds or no liens securing such bonds shall be repaid in whole or in part from any funds arising from taxation, nor shall any such bonds or liens given under authority of this article constitute a lien on any other property of such public agency, or a pledge of the credit of such agency, unless specifically so voted by a majority of the qualified electors participating in an election held according to law for the purpose of so authorizing. At such time when all moneys borrowed as aforesaid shall have been repaid, together with interest and charges thereon, no further toll shall be charged for the use of such bridges by the traveling public. Bonds shall have semiannual interest coupons attached; such bonds may be made negotiable, may bear interest not to exceed six and one-half percent (61/2%) per annum, may mature annually or semiannually, and may contain a clause giving to the issuing authority the right to redeem any part of said issue of bonds with or without premium, and if with premium then not to exceed two percent (2%). Such bonds may be sold at such time and in such manner as the issuing authority may determine upon. All of such bonds so issued shall mature not more than thirty years after the issuing date thereof. Such bonds shall be payable at such place or places as may be determined upon by the issuing authority, which place of payment shall appear in said bonds. Any provisions of the general laws to the contrary notwithstanding, any bonds or interest coupons issued pursuant to the authorities of this article shall possess all of the qualities of negotiable instruments. The bonds and interest coupons shall be executed in such manner and shall be substantially in the form prescribed in the authorizing ordinance. In case any of the officers whose signature or signatures appear on the bonds or interest coupons shall cease to be such officers before delivery of such bonds, such signatures or counter-signatures shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes, the same as though they had remained in office until such delivery. Such bonds shall be sold in such manner and upon such terms as the governing body of the issuing authority or authorities shall determine; but in no event shall the interest cost to maturity exceed six and one-half percent (61/2%) per annum. If serial bonds, such bonds shall mature annually or semiannually, and the first maturity date thereof shall not be more than five years from the date of such bonds.
     </p>
     <p>
      All bonds, maturing annually or semiannually, with all maturities not longer than twenty-five years, with not less than one-fiftieth of the total issue to mature each year during the first ten years of the life of said bonds, and not less than one-twenty-fifth of said total issue to mature annually during the succeeding ten year period of the life of said bonds, shall have the remainder to be divided into approximately equal payments, one payment to mature during each year, or each half year, for the remaining life of the bonds. The bonds and interest coupons shall be exempt from all state, county, municipal, and other taxation under the laws of the State of Mississippi; and the bridge and approaches shall likewise be exempt from all state, county, municipal, and other taxation under the laws of the State of Mississippi. No bonds issued pursuant to this article shall constitute an indebtedness of a municipality or county or taxing district within the meaning of any statute or charter restriction, limitation, or provision. It shall be plainly stated on the face of each such bond, in substance, that the same has been issued under the provisions of this article, that the taxing power of the municipality issuing the same is not pledged to the payment of such bond or interest thereon, and that such bond and interest thereon are payable solely from the revenues of the system to be acquired or improved, for which such bond is issued, unless, as heretofore set forth, a majority of the qualified electors participating in an election for the purpose of issuing such bonds shall have voted other funds toward payment of such bonds.

      The holders of any bond or interest coupon issued under the provisions of this article may by suit, action, mandamus, or other proceedings at law or in equity enforce or compel performance by the appropriate official or officials of a municipality or public body of any and all acts and duties to be performed by such public body under the provisions of this article and the ordinance authorizing the issuance of such bonds and interest coupons. If there be any default in the payment of the interest and principal of any of said bonds, any court having jurisdiction in the proper action may, upon petition of the holder of any such bond, appoint a receiver to administer and operate the bridge, with power to fix rates and collect charges sufficient to provide for the payment of all bonds outstanding to the payment of which the revenue of such bridge is pledged, to pay the expenses of operating and maintaining such toll bridge, and to apply the revenues of such toll bridge in conformity with the provisions of this article and the ordinance authorizing the issuance of such bonds.

      The powers conferred by this article shall be in addition to the powers conferred by any other law, general, special or local.

Where no funds are pledged as security for bonds to be issued by the municipality or other political subdivision other than the revenues arising from the tolls of the bridge to be purchased, erected, or extended, bonds may be authorized and issued under this article by ordinance incorporating the terms and conditions of said bonds passed by the governing authority of such municipality, county, taxing district, or other political subdivision, which article, resolution, or ordinance shall be spread in full upon the minutes of such political subdivision. It shall not be necessary to submit same to an election of the qualified voters of such political subdivision unless moneys for the payment of such bonds or interest thereon or maintenance of such bridge, or construction thereof, shall be pledged from taxes or other funds other than the revenue alone arising from the tolls collected on such bridge. In such event the proposition for the pledging of such additional funds and the issuance of such bonds shall be submitted for the approval of same to the voters of the municipality or other political subdivision at a special election called therefor according to law, and after a majority of the qualified electors voting at said election have voted in favor of the proposed bond issue. Where bonds have been authorized under this article, it shall not be necessary to make publication of any ordinance, resolution, notice, or proceedings relating thereto.

     <p>
      The Mississippi State Highway Commission may, when in its opinion the best interest of the state requires, contribute such an amount of the cost of the construction of such bridge or bridges as it may determine would be to the best interest of the State of Mississippi when such bridge forms a part of or a continuation of the state highway system, or is so connected with the state highway system through the streets of a municipality leading from the approaches of such bridge to the state highway system, and may incorporate any such toll bridge into the state highway system. Such State Highway Commission may, in whole or in part, maintain such bridge as a part of the state highway system, or may leave the maintenance of such bridge to the municipality or other political body acting jointly with such State Highway Commission in the financing and operation of such bridge. In event that the State Highway Commission shall contribute any sums of money towards the creation or acquisition of such bridge and the approaches thereto, said State Highway Commission may or may not, in its discretion, require the repayment of such funds through tolls collected, together with interest on such moneys so advanced or donated at a rate, to be determined by said State Highway Commission, not to exceed said amount of six and one-half percent (61/2%).

After having filed said petition, said property owners or their representatives shall apply to the chancellor in vacation or term time for an order fixing a day and date for a hearing on said petition to determine whether or not the petition should be granted or denied. The chancery clerk, after having received the order fixing a day and date for such hearing, shall thereupon give notice by publication once each week for three consecutive weeks in some newspaper published and having a general circulation in the county or counties within which the lands of the proposed district are situated, notifying all persons owning property therein to appear before the chancery court on the day and date fixed by said court to show cause in favor of or against the establishment of said district. At the time named in said notice, the chancery court shall meet and hear all property owners within the proposed district who wish to appear for or against the establishment of the district. If it is deemed to the best interest of the owners of real property within said district that the same shall be created under the provisions of this article the court shall enter an order establishing the district as an interstate bridge district, which shall be subject to all of the terms and provisions of this article. Any landowner feeling aggrieved by the order of the court shall have the right of appeal within thirty days from the date the order was entered, and such appeal may be prosecuted in the manner now provided by law.

      When the assessment of benefits is completed the board of commissioners shall subscribe such assessment and file it with the chancery clerk of the county wherein the land is situated, where it may be preserved and kept as a public record. Upon the filing of said assessment of benefits, the chancery clerk of such county shall give notice of such filing by publication once each week for three consecutive weeks in some newspaper having general circulation in the county or counties in which the lands of the district are situated. Said notice shall include a day, not less than thirty days from the date of filing the assessment and not more than forty-five days from the date of filing the assessment, at which time property owners may appear and file objections to such assessment. The board of commissioners shall meet on the date set out in such notice, to hear such objections and to make such corrections and adjustments as may be proper in the case, and shall equalize the assessments according to the benefits to be derived from the special improvement herein provided. After having heard the objections and equalized the assessments, the board of commissioners shall enter its order making such assessments final. Any property owner within the district who feels aggrieved by the order making the assessment final shall have the right, within ten days after said order has been entered, to appeal the assessment to the chancery court of the county in which such property is situated. The appeal from the assessment may be heard by the chancellor in term time or in vacation, and after hearing thereof the chancellor shall enter such order as may be proper in the case. Appeals may be taken from the final order of the chancellor within the time and in the manner now provided by law for appeals from any decree of the court.
     </p>
     <p>
      When the assessment of benefits has been made final and filed as hereinabove provided, the property owner shall have the right to pay such assessment of benefits in full at any time within sixty days after it became final; but if he does not avail himself of this privilege, the assessment of benefits shall bear interest at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum.

     <p>
      After the board of commissioners has completed the assessment as hereinabove provided, it shall have the authority and is hereby directed to levy a tax upon the taxable property of the district, as it may consider necessary to be levied to pay the preliminary expenses of said district. When the rate of taxation is determined by the commissioners, it shall be filed with the tax collector of the county wherein such property is situated, together with a copy of the assessment hereinabove required, which shall be a warrant for the collection of such taxes. The taxes herein levied shall be collected by the tax collector of the county, along with other taxes of the county. For collecting such taxes, the tax collector shall receive the same compensation as is provided by law for the collection of state and county taxes, and the taxes so collected shall be paid over by the tax collector to the board of commissioners of the district at the same time he is required to make settlement with the county for general taxes.
     </p>
     <p>
      All taxes levied under the provisions of this article shall be payable at the same time and in the same manner as state and county taxes and, upon default, the tax collector shall certify such delinquent taxes to the board of commissioners and shall also file a copy of such delinquent taxes with the clerk of the chancery court, as is now required to be filed for other delinquent taxes. The board of commissioners shall have the same authority and it is hereby required to enforce the collection of delinquent taxes, penalties, and costs by proceeding in the chancery court of the county in which the lands are situated, and may have the lands subject to such tax sold by order of the chancery court.

The rates for such tolls may be increased or decreased from time to time by the board of commissioners, subject, however, to the terms and provisions of the above-mentioned act of Congress. The board of commissioners shall make an annual report of all tolls collected to a trustee or trustees representing the bond holders and to the Mississippi State Highway Commission, and one copy of said report shall be filed with the clerk of the chancery court of the county in which the bridge is located. When the bonded indebtedness and all claims and liability have been fully paid and discharged, said bridge shall become a free bridge. The board of commissioners shall thereupon convey all its right, title, and interest in said bridge to the Mississippi State Highway Commission, and said commission shall maintain and operate said bridge as a part of its highway system without cost to the individual user thereof.

    Issuance of bonds authorized.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The governing body of any such county is hereby authorized to provide by resolution, at one time or from time to time, for the issuance of bridge revenue bonds of such county, if acting separately, and of such counties, if acting jointly, for the purpose of paying the cost, as hereinabove defined, of any one or more of such bridges, which resolution shall recite an estimate of such cost. The principal and interest of such bonds shall be payable solely from the special fund herein provided for such payment. The bonds of each issue shall be dated, shall bear interest at such rate or rates not exceeding six percent (6%) per annum, payable semiannually, shall mature at such time or times, not exceeding forty (40) years from their date or dates, as may be determined by the governing body of such county or counties, and may be made redeemable before maturity, at the option of the county or counties, at such price or prices and under such terms and conditions as may be fixed by the governing body of such county or counties prior to the issuance of the bonds. The principal and interest of such bonds may be made payable in any lawful medium. The governing body of such county or counties shall determine the form of the bonds, including any interest coupons to be attached thereto, and shall fix the denomination or denominations of the bonds and the place or places of payment of principal and interest thereof, which may be at any bank or trust company within or without the state. The bonds and any interest coupons attached thereto shall be executed in such manner as shall be determined by the governing body of the county or counties. In case any officer whose signature shall appear on the bonds or coupons shall cease to be such officer before the delivery of such bonds, such signature shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes the same as if he had remained in office until such delivery. All bridge revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this article are hereby declared to have, as between successive holders, all the qualities and incidents of negotiable instruments under the Uniform Commercial Code of the state. Provision may be made for the registration of any of the bonds in the name of the owner as to principal alone, in the manner now provided by law for the registration of bonds issued by a county. The governing body of such county or counties may sell such bonds at public or private sale in such manner and for such price as it or they may determine to be for the best interest of such county or counties, but no such sale shall be made at a price so low as to require the payment of interest on the money received therefor at more than six percent (6%) per annum, computed with relation to the absolute maturity of the bonds in accordance with standard tables of bond values. The proceeds of such bonds shall be used solely for the payment of the cost of the bridge or bridges, and shall be disbursed under such restrictions, if any, as the governing body of such county or counties thereof may provide. If the proceeds of such bonds, by error of calculation or otherwise, shall be less than the cost of the bridge or bridges, additional bonds may in like manner be issued to provide the amount of such deficit, and unless otherwise provided in the trust indenture hereinafter mentioned, shall be deemed to be of the same issue and shall be entitled to payment from the same fund without preference or priority of the bonds first issued for the same bridge or bridges. If the proceeds of bonds issued for any bridge or bridges shall exceed the cost thereof, the surplus shall be paid into the fund hereinafter provided for the payment of principal and interest of such bonds. Prior to the preparation of definitive bonds, such county or counties may, under like restrictions, issue temporary bonds, with or without coupons, exchangeable for definitive bonds upon the issuance of the latter. The governing body of any such county or counties may also provide for the replacement of any bond which shall become mutilated or be destroyed or lost. Such bridge revenue bonds may be issued without any other proceedings or the happening of any other conditions or things than those proceedings, conditions and things which are specified and required by this article. The powers conferred by this article shall be in addition to the power conferred by any other law, general, special, or local, and this article, without reference to any other statute, shall be deemed full authority for the purpose hereof. In the discretion of the governing body of any such county or counties, bridge revenue bonds of a single issue may be issued for the purpose of paying the cost of any one or more bridges.

     <p>
      In the discretion of the governing body of any such county or counties issuing bonds under the provisions of this article, each or any issue of such bonds may be secured by a trust indenture by and between such county or counties and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or outside of the state. Said trust indenture may, in the discretion of the governing body, convey or mortgage the revenues, the bridge, or any part thereof.
     </p>
     <p>
      Either the resolution providing for the issuance of bridge revenue bonds or such trust indenture may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the duties of such county or counties and the governing body thereof in relation to the construction, maintenance, operation, repair, and insurance of the bridges, and the custody, safeguarding, and application of all moneys; and it may also provide that the bridge or bridges shall be constructed and paid for under the supervision and approval of consulting engineers employed or designated by the governing body of such county or counties and satisfactory to the original purchasers of the bonds issued therefor, and may also require that the security given by contractors and by any depository of the proceeds of the bonds or revenues of the bridges or other moneys pertaining thereto be satisfactory to such purchasers. It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of this state to act as such depository and to furnish such indemnifying bonds or to pledge such securities as may be required by the governing body of such county or counties. Such indenture may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee, and may restrict the individual right of action of bondholders as is customary in trust indentures securing bonds and debentures of corporations. Except as in this article otherwise provided, the governing body of such county or counties may provide, by resolution or by such trust indenture, for the payment of the proceeds of the sale of the bonds and the revenues of the bridges to such officer, board, or depository as it may determine for the custody thereof, and for the method of disbursement thereof with such safeguards and restrictions as it may determine. All expenses incurred in carrying out such trust indenture may be treated as a part of the cost of maintenance, operation, and repair of the bridge or bridges affected by such indenture.

     <p>
      The governing body of any such county or counties issuing bonds under the provisions of this article is hereby authorized to fix and to revise from time to time tolls for transit over such bridges, to charge and collect the same, and to contract with any person, partnership, association, or corporation desiring the use of any bridge, its approaches, appurtenances, or any part thereof for placing thereon water, gas, oil pipelines, telephone, telegraph, electric light or power lines, railroad or street railway tracks, or for any other purpose, and to fix the terms, conditions, rates, and charges for such use. Such tolls shall be so fixed and adjusted, in respect of the aggregate of tolls from the bridge or bridges for which a single issue of bonds is issued, as to provide a fund sufficient with other revenues of the bridge or bridges, if any, to pay (a) the cost of maintaining, repairing, operating such bridge or bridges, and collecting tolls, and (b) the bonds and the interest thereon as the same become due. Such tolls shall not be subject to supervision or regulation by any state commission, board, bureau, or agency, except such bureau or agency that might participate in the financing of the cost of any such bridge. The tolls from the bridge or bridges for which a single issue of bonds is issued, except such part thereof as may be required to pay the cost of maintaining, repairing, and operating the bridge or bridges and to provide such reserves therefor as may be provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust indenture, shall be set aside at such regular intervals as may be provided in such resolution or such trust indenture, in a sinking fund which is hereby pledged to, and charged with, the payment of (1) the interest upon such bonds as such interest shall fall due, (2) the principal of the bonds as the same shall fall due, (3) the necessary fiscal agency charges for paying principal and interest, and (4) any premium upon bonds retired by call or purchase as herein provided. The use and disposition of such sinking fund shall be subject to such regulations as may be provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of bonds, or in the trust indenture, but, except as may otherwise be provided in such resolution or trust indenture, such sinking fund shall be a fund for the benefit of all bonds without distinction or priority of one over another. Subject to the provisions of the resolution authorizing the issuance of bonds or of the trust indenture, any moneys in such sinking fund in excess of an amount equal to one year’s interest on all bonds then outstanding may be applied to the purchase or redemption of bonds. All bonds so purchased or redeemed shall forthwith be cancelled and shall not again be issued.

   The traditional view that county boards of supervisors are limited in their authority to that delegated to them by the legislature has been significantly relaxed by the enactment of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.19.html#t19c03s19-3-40" target="_blank">19-3-40</a></cite>.

       Chapter 74, Laws of Extraordinary Session, 1953, only validated all acts and proceedings of the Board of Supervisors of Warren County in relation to the issuance and sale of Vicksburg bridge revenue refunding bonds dated January 1, 1954, and the application of the bridge revenues to the payment thereof as they matured, and did not validate the acts of the board in diverting a part of the tolls received from the operation of the Vicksburg bridge to the use of the county for general county purposes.

     <p>
      Any municipality, whenever a reasonable price cannot be agreed upon, or whenever the owner is legally incapacitated or is absent or is unable to convey valid title or is unknown, is hereby authorized and empowered to acquire by condemnation any such bridge or bridges or interest or interests therein, and any land, rights, easements, franchises, and other property deemed necessary or convenient for the improvement or the efficient operation of any property acquired or constructed under this article, or for the purpose of constructing any bridge or portion thereof hereunder, or for securing right of way leading to any such bridge or its approaches, in the manner hereinafter provided. Such condemnation proceedings shall be instituted by a written application of the governing body of such municipality and shall be conducted, and the compensation to be paid shall be ascertained and paid, in the manner provided by Chapter 33, Title 11, Mississippi Code of 1972, or by the laws of the state where such proceedings may be conducted. And any municipality is further authorized and empowered to exercise in this state and in any adjoining state such powers of eminent domain as may be conferred upon such municipality by any act of the Congress of the United States now in force or which may hereafter be enacted. Title to any property condemned by a municipality shall be taken in its name. No municipality shall be under any obligation to accept and pay for any property condemned or any costs incidental to any condemnation proceedings, and shall, in no event, pay for the same except from the funds provided by this article. In any condemnation proceedings, the court having jurisdiction of the suit, action, or proceedings may make such orders as may be just to such municipality and to the owners of the property to be condemned, and may require an undertaking or other security to secure such owners against any loss or damage to be sustained by reason of the failure of such municipality to accept and pay for the property; but such undertaking or security shall impose no liability upon such municipality, except such as may be paid from the funds provided under the authority of this article.

    Bridge revenue bonds.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The governing body of any municipality is hereby authorized to provide by resolution, at one time or from time to time, for the issuance of bridge revenue bonds of such municipality for the purpose of paying the cost as hereinabove defined of any one or more such bridges, which resolution shall recite an estimate of such cost. The principal and interest of such bonds shall be payable solely from the special fund herein provided for such payment. The bonds of each issue shall be dated, shall bear interest at such rate or rates not exceeding six percent (6%) per annum, payable semiannually, shall mature at such time or times, not exceeding forty years from their date or dates, as may be determined by the governing body of such municipality, and may be made redeemable before maturity, at the option of the municipality, at such price or prices and under such terms and conditions as may be fixed by the governing body of such municipality prior to the issuance of the bonds. The principal and interest of such bonds may be made payable in any lawful medium. The governing body of such municipality shall determine the form of the bonds, including any interest coupons to be attached thereto, and shall fix the denomination or denominations of the bonds and the place or places of payment of principal and interest thereof, which may be at any bank or trust company within or without the state. The bonds and any interest coupons attached thereto shall be executed in such manner as shall be determined by the governing body of the municipality. In case any officer whose signature shall appear on the bonds or coupons shall cease to be such officer before the delivery of such bonds, such signature shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes the same as if he had remained in office until such delivery. All bridge revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this article shall have and are hereby declared to have, as between successive holders, all the qualities and incidents of negotiable instruments under the Uniform Commercial Code of the state. Provision may be made for the registration of any of the bonds in the name of the owner as to principal alone and also as to both principal and interest and for the issuance of new coupon bonds in exchange for bonds registered as to both principal and interest. The governing body of such municipality may sell such bonds in such manner and for such price as it may determine to be for the best interests of such municipality, but no such sale shall be made at a price so low as to require the payment of interest on the money received therefor at more than six per centum per annum, computed with relation to the absolute maturity of the bonds in accordance with standard tables of bond values. The proceeds of such bonds shall be used solely for the payment of the cost of the bridge or bridges, and shall be disbursed under such restrictions, if any, as the governing body thereof may provide. If the proceeds of such bonds, by error of calculation or otherwise, shall be less than the cost of the bridge or bridges, additional bonds may in like manner be issued to provide the amount of such deficit, and unless otherwise provided in the trust indenture hereinafter mentioned, shall be deemed to be of the same issue and shall be entitled to payment from the same fund without preference or priority of the bonds first issued for the same bridge or bridges. If the proceeds of bonds issued for any bridge or bridges shall exceed the cost thereof, the surplus shall be paid into the fund hereinafter provided for the payment of principal and interest of such bonds. Prior to the preparation of definitive bonds, the municipality may, under like restrictions, issue temporary bonds, with or without coupons, exchangeable for definitive bonds upon the issuance of the latter. The governing body of any such municipality may also provide for the replacement of any bond which shall become mutilated or be destroyed or lost. Such bridge revenue bonds may be issued without any other proceedings or the happening of any other conditions or things than those proceedings, conditions, and things which are specified and required by this article. The powers conferred by this article shall be in addition to the power conferred by any other law, general, special or local, and this article, without reference to any other statute or to any charter, shall be deemed full authority for the purpose hereof. In the discretion of the governing body of any municipality, bridge revenue bonds of a single issue may be issued for the purpose of paying the cost of any one or more bridges.

      In the discretion of the governing body of any municipality issuing its bonds under the provisions of this article, each or any issue of such bonds may be secured by a trust indenture by and between such municipality and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or outside of the state, which trust indenture may, in the discretion of the governing body, convey or mortgage the revenues, the bridge, or any part thereof.
     </p>
     <p>
      Either the resolution providing for the issuance of bridge revenue bonds or such trust indenture may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the duties of such municipality and the governing body thereof in relation to the acquisition, construction, improvement, maintenance, operation, repair, and insurance of the bridges, and the custody, safeguarding, and application of all moneys; and may also provide that the bridge or bridges shall be acquired, constructed, or partly acquired and partly constructed, and paid for under the supervision and approval of consulting engineers employed or designated by the governing body of such municipality and satisfactory to the original purchasers of the bonds issued therefor; and may also require that the security given by contractors and by any depository of the proceeds of the bonds or revenues of the bridges or other moneys pertaining thereto be satisfactory to such purchasers. It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of this state to act as such depository and to furnish such indemnifying bonds or to pledge such securities as may be required by the governing body of such municipality. Such indenture may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee, and may restrict the individual right of action of bondholders as is customary in trust indentures securing bonds and debentures of corporations. Except as in this article otherwise provided, the governing body of such municipality may provide, by resolution or by such trust indenture, for the payment of the proceeds of the sale of the bonds and the revenues of the bridges to such officer, board, or depository as it may determine for the custody thereof and for the method of disbursement thereof, with such safeguards and restrictions as it may determine. All expenses incurred in carrying out such trust indenture may be treated as a part of the cost of maintenance, operation, and repair of the bridge or bridges affected by such indenture.

     <p>
      The governing body of any municipality issuing its bonds under the provisions of this article is hereby authorized to fix and to revise from time to time tolls for transit over such bridges, to charge and collect the same, and to contract with any person, partnership, association, or corporation desiring the use of any bridge, its approaches, appurtenances, or any part thereof for placing thereon water, gas, oil pipe lines, telephone, telegraph, electric light or power lines, railroad or street railway tracks, or for any other purpose, and to fix the terms, conditions, rates, and charges for such use. Such tolls shall be so fixed and adjusted, in respect of the aggregate of tolls from the bridge or bridges for which a single issue of bonds is issued, as to provide a fund sufficient, with other revenues of the bridge or bridges, if any, to pay (a) the cost of maintaining, repairing, and operating such bridge or bridges unless such cost shall be otherwise provided for, and (b) the bonds and the interest thereon as the same become due, subject, however, to any applicable law or regulation of the United States of America now in force or hereafter to be enacted or made. Such tolls shall not be subject to supervision or regulation by any state commission, board, bureau, or agency. The tolls from the bridge or bridges for which a single issue of bonds is issued, except such part thereof as may be required to pay the cost of maintaining, repairing, and operating the bridge or bridges and to provide such reserves therefor as may be provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust indenture, shall be set aside at such regular intervals as may be provided in such resolution or such trust indenture, in a sinking fund which is hereby pledged to, and charged with the payment of, (1) the interest upon such bonds as such interest shall fall due, (2) the principal of the bonds as the same shall fall due, (3) the necessary fiscal agency charges for paying principal and interest, and (4) any premium upon bonds retired by call or purchase as herein provided. The use and disposition of such sinking fund shall be subject to such regulations as may be provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of bonds or in the trust indenture, but, except as may otherwise be provided in such resolution or trust indenture, such sinking fund shall be a fund for the benefit of all bonds without distinction or priority of one over another. Subject to the provisions of the resolution authorizing the issuance of bonds or of the trust indenture, any moneys in such sinking fund in excess of an amount equal to one year’s interest on all bonds then outstanding may be applied to the purchase or redemption of bonds. All bonds so purchased or redeemed shall forthwith be cancelled and shall not again be issued.

     <p>
      Notwithstanding any of the foregoing provisions of Section 65-25-21, any municipality other than the state may, by resolution or ordinance passed prior or subsequent to the issuance of its bonds under the provisions of this article, or by such trust indenture, covenant to contribute funds apart from bridge earnings to pay all or any part of the cost of maintaining, repairing, and operating any bridge or bridges acquired, constructed, or improved by it under the provisions of this article, and may likewise covenant to make such contribution to the payment of bonds and the interest thereon issued pursuant to this article, by another municipality. Such covenant, authorized by such resolution, ordinance, or trust indenture, shall have the force of a contract between such municipality and the holders of the bonds issued on account of such bridge or bridges, and shall obligate the municipality to raise such funds. Any municipality in the state may aid any other municipality in the state and contribute funds to pay any part of the cost of acquiring, constructing, maintaining, repairing, and operating any bridge or bridges; and the twenty miles limitation contained in Section 65-25-3 shall have no application and shall not be construed to restrict such municipality from contributing such funds to aid the municipality which issues its revenue bonds as herein provided. But no such contribution shall be made unless authorized by a majority of the qualified electors voting in favor of same in an election held according to law for the purpose of so authorizing.
     </p>
     <p>
      No municipality shall enter into any contract or covenant provided for in the first paragraph of this section without there being first held an election in which a majority of those voting shall authorize said covenant or contract to be entered into by said municipality.

     <p>
      The State of Mississippi, acting by and through the state highway commission as an agency thereof, may receive from the federal government or any agency thereof funds specifically allotted or appropriated by the federal government for constructing, acquiring, maintaining, and repairing bridges across the Mississippi River, which the state highway commission may by resolution allocate to pay the costs or any part thereof of constructing, acquiring, maintaining, repairing, and operating any bridge or bridges acquired, constructed, or improved under this article and to the payment of principal and interest of such bonds.

      When the particular bonds issued for any bridge or bridges and the interest thereon shall have been paid, or a sufficient amount shall have been provided for their payment and shall continue to be held for that purpose, the municipality issuing such bonds shall cease to charge tolls for the use of such bridge or bridges; and thereafter such bridge or bridges shall be free unless tolls are required for maintaining, repairing, and operating such bridge or bridges due to the lack of funds from other sources than tolls. Such provisions shall not apply to common carriers, transportation companies, bus lines, and any one transporting passengers or freight for hire, but shall apply only to the use of highway portion of bridge by traveling public and, as respects any other use, the municipality may continue to fix and collect such tolls and charges as it may deem in the public interest.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The commissioners appointed by such governing body or municipality shall, subject to the approval of such governing body, have the following authority, powers and rights: Said commissioners may adopt reasonable bylaws for the conduct of said commission. Said commissioners shall be governed by and fulfill the terms and provisions of the trust indenture or resolution under which the revenue bonds of such governing body were issued, and in so doing the commission shall manage and control the bridge, the approaches thereto, and all appurtenant and physical properties connected therewith, both real and personal, and shall provide for the regular inspection, repair, maintenance and improvement of said bridge and its approaches. Said commission may make any contract and authorize any purchases from the funds realized from the revenues of said bridge and available under the trust indenture or resolution under which the bridge revenue bonds of the governing body were issued for the purposes of repairs, maintenance and improvements, which said contracts and purchases may, in the sound business judgment of the commission, be made without the necessity of prior advertisement or public bids. Said commissioners may employ a superintendent or manager of the bridge properties, fix the amount of his salary, either employ or delegate to said manager the employment of all subordinate personnel, provide for the wages and compensation of such subordinate employees, and shall require the said manager and such other employees as the commissioners may require to give bond, with sufficient surety, to be payable, conditioned and approved as provided by law, in a penalty equal to Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000.00). The commissioners may place in effect, reclassify, revise and charge a schedule of tolls for transit over said bridge properties, and alter or revise the toll schedule as often as it shall appear necessary or proper; provide for the collection of such tolls and all other revenues and the safe handling and deposit of the funds so received, prepare such budgets and estimates alone or in connection with consulting engineers annually, or for such lesser period of time as may be deemed desirable; provide for an adequate bookkeeping system and regular audits, and keep or cause to be kept full and correct records of finances of said bridge; negotiate for all contracts incidental to or necessary for the proper insurance, maintenance, repair, improvement and operation of said bridge, including employer’s liability insurance with medical benefits for those employed by the commission for the operation and maintenance of said bridge; do and perform all other acts and negotiate for all other contracts which in the sound judgment of the commissioners, meeting with the approval of the governing body issuing the revenue bonds, are desirable or necessary in the interest of the proper, efficient, and economical management and operation of the said bridge and the advancement of the business thereof, all toward the object of fulfilling the obligations in the trust indenture or resolution under which the governing body authorized and issued its revenue bonds, and toward the ultimate freeing of the said bridge from tolls, as to the vehicular portion thereof, at the earliest date possible.

      The commissioners appointed by such governing body or municipality, or the commissioners whose terms are continued in force as above authorized, shall, subject to the approval of such governing body, have the following authority, powers, and rights: Said commission shall manage and control the affairs of the bridge as a separate proprietary venture, apart from other public roads and bridges within the county, and shall provide for the regular inspection, repair, maintenance, and upkeep of said bridge and its approaches, which expenses and all liabilities which may exist or later come into being or be claimed to exist shall be wholly borne from the bridge properties themselves and the revenues received from the lease of such properties to private or public utilities. In connection with operating the affairs of the said bridge and maintaining the same, said commission is vested with the following powers and authority, subject to the veto power or approval of the governing body owning the said bridge, viz: (1) Contracts and purchases shall be made on the same basis and under the same requirements of advertisement for bids as those made by the board of supervisors; (2) the commissioners may employ a superintendent or manager of the bridge properties and fix the amount of his salary, and either employ or delegate to said manager the employment of subordinate personnel and provide for the wages and compensation of such employees, and, should the commission so determine, may require the manager or other employees to post bond in such sum as the commission may designate for the faithful discharge of their duties as such employees; however, the number of persons employed in an election year shall not exceed the average number employed during the preceding three (3) years, except that additional employees may be hired on a temporary basis in cases of emergency when the specific reasons therefor shall be entered on the minutes of the commission; (3) provide for an adequate bookkeeping system pertinent to the affairs of said bridge and for regular audits, with the revenues derived following the freeing of said bridge to vehicular traffic, if any there be over and above cost of operating and maintaining the said bridge, to be kept by the clerk of the said board or treasurer of the said municipality in a separate account and to so remain, properly invested in the same manner as sinking funds of the county or municipality may be invested, said assets to be subject to bear and discharge the liabilities of the said bridge and not to be utilized for any other or different purpose until a period of at least five (5) years following the freeing of the said bridge from tolls (unless sooner there be another free bridge constructed and opened to public travel crossing said Mississippi River located not more than one (1) mile from said bridge, in which event that factor, rather than the five-year time limit, shall be determinative), and then not until a determination is made by the board or governing authority that such funds, to the extent amassed, will not be further needed for operational maintenance purposes; and that said audits thus caused to be made shall be done by a certified public accountant or accountants duly qualified under the laws of this state; (4) that, without in anywise sacrificing or waiving the entire exempt status of the said bridge properties from ad valorem taxation, to pay a sum or sums in lieu of ad valorem taxes which, by agreement with the taxing authorities of this or any neighboring state, will in no event exceed in any year a sum equaling more than one-half (1/2) of the average amount paid per year by way of such taxes or in lieu thereof over the five-year period preceding June 15, 1966; (5) employ nationally recognized engineers and such other professional assistance as may be deemed necessary, and to pay reasonable compensation for such services; (6) to have and exercise any other authority and right conferred by existing laws, state or federal, applicable to the operation of such bridge; and (7) fulfill the requirements of any outstanding lease contracts to the extent that the bridge properties will permit and the revenues to be derived from such leases will allow, but without incurring any pecuniary liability on the part of the governing authorities or taxpayers generally.

Such payment or payments in lieu of taxes as are hereby authorized and as may be determined upon by the board of supervisors of any county owning such bridge, concurred in by any commission appointed under authority of Sections 65-25-43 through 65-25-47, to have control over the affairs of said bridge, shall be made from any fund created by such bond resolution or indenture enabling the caring for of contingencies not otherwise provided for. However, in no event shall such payment or payments impair any debt service fund or debt service reserve fund or lessen the minimum amount by said bond resolution or indenture required to be carried in any debt service fund or debt service reserve fund created by said resolution or indenture.

      <p>
       The right to operate a public ferry within a short distance of the site of a bridge, which, until its recent destruction, had been a part of a public road, under a license authorizing its location at or near such bridge site, is not impaired by want of power in the board of supervisors to authorize its location elsewhere than exactly at the bridge site. McInnis v. Pace, 78 Miss. 550, 29 So. 835, 1900 Miss. LEXIS 179 (Miss. 1900).
      </p>
      <p>
       A ferry located in the vicinity of a public ferry, without authority, for the use of those operating it and such other persons as might see fit to avail of it, and from which tolls are received when voluntarily offered, is not a public ferry. McInnis v. Pace, 78 Miss. 550, 29 So. 835, 1900 Miss. LEXIS 179 (Miss. 1900).

In carrying out the provisions of this chapter, the commission shall have authority to employ such engineers, architects, skilled and unskilled labor as may be determined necessary by the commission, for the preparation of plans for such hospitality stations and their proper location, design, construction, maintenance, and operation. The commission also may employ full-time security officers, as authorized under Section 65-1-131, and/or may contract for the employment of private security officers, as authorized under Section 65-1-136, to patrol and protect the property of hospitality stations and visitors, patrons and other employees of hospitality stations.
     </p>
     <p>
      Prior to the location of such hospitality stations the commission shall afford the opportunity for a public hearing in the county wherein such hospitality station is to be located for the purpose of receiving testimony regarding the most feasible and advantageous location for such hospitality station, at which hearing all interested persons may appear and present testimony in regard thereto. A notice of such proposed location shall be given in some newspaper published or having general circulation in the county wherein such hospitality station is proposed to be located. Should a public hearing be requested thereon, notice by publication shall be given at least ten (10) days prior to the date upon which public hearing is to be held and written notice thereof shall likewise be given, within said time, to the governing authorities of all municipalities within such county and the governing authority of such county.

     <p>
      The State Highway Commission is authorized to contract with the Department of Economic and Community Development, on terms and conditions agreeable between the two (2) state agencies, for the operation of one or more of such hospitality stations constructed under the provisions of this chapter. The commission and the department are further authorized to enter into agreement with an adjoining state for the operation of a hospitality station on an interstate highway where the states’ boundary is the Mississippi River and there is no feasible location for a hospitality station between the bank of the Mississippi River and a national military park in the State of Mississippi, or where the states’ boundary is the Pearl River and there is no feasible location for a hospitality station between the bank of the Pearl River and the buffer zone to a test facility operated by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration in the State of Mississippi. The commission and the department are authorized to pay whatever expenses may be agreed upon between the two (2) states as to the fair share of the operating and maintenance cost of the hospitality station operated primarily for the benefit of the state. Such contracts and agreements shall provide for the furnishing of suitable personnel for the operation of such stations and that such stations shall be kept supplied with such information, pamphlets and other materials as will advertise and publicize the history, commerce, industry, natural resources and tourist attractions of this state. Such information, pamphlets and other materials shall be available to the traveling public and shall be distributed by the personnel employed to operate such stations. The agency operating such hospitality stations shall provide for the free distribution to the traveling public of such literature, pamphlets, refreshments and other items that may be of interest to tourists in such manner as deemed to be in the best interest of promoting the tourist trade in this state. Such agency may sell, or contract for the sale of, merchandise on the premises of any hospitality station, provided such sale or contract for sale is subject to any applicable federal laws and Section 43-3-93. Revenue derived from such sales shall be paid into the special revolving fund established pursuant to Section 57-1-66 and shall be expended to promote and market Mississippi and to maintain and improve hospitality stations.

      Such bonds shall be in the denomination of One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00) each and shall mature annually, with all maturities not longer than twenty-five (25) years, with not less than one-fiftieth (1/50) of the total issue to mature each year during the first five (5) years of the life of such bonds, not less than one-twenty-fifth (1/25) of the total issue to mature each year during the succeeding ten-year period of the life of such bonds, and the remainder to be divided into approximately equal annual payments, one (1) payment to mature each year for the remaining life of such bonds. Such bonds shall not bear a greater rate of interest than the maximum amount specified in Section 75-17-103 per annum, and the denomination, form, and place or places of payment of such bonds shall be fixed in the resolution or order of the board of supervisors issuing such bonds. Such bonds shall be signed by the president of the board of supervisors and countersigned by the clerk thereof, with the official seal of the county affixed thereto, but the coupons may bear only the facsimile signatures of such president and clerk. No bonds shall be issued and sold under the provisions of Sections 65-33-1 through 65-33-15 for less than par and accrued interest, and not more than one (1) series of interest coupons shall be attached to any bonds issued under the provisions of said sections; but all interest accruing on such bonds so issued shall be payable semiannually, except that the first interest coupon attached to any such bond may be for any period not exceeding one (1) year. Such bonds shall be payable at such place or places as may be designated therein by said board, shall be fully negotiable, and shall be sold pursuant to advertised public sale at not less than par and accrued interest. Such bonds shall not be subject to other restrictions, limitations or provisions of the general laws governing the issuance and sale of bonds by the board of supervisors, and the board of supervisors may sell said bonds at any time within three (3) years after the sale has been approved in an election held for that purpose herein required, or three (3) years after the successful termination of any litigation affecting the same, or three (3) years after the acquisition of all lands in the areas to be developed as hereinafter provided, but not later; however, in no event shall the amount borrowed by any such county after May 4, 1954, exceed the amount of Twelve Million Dollars ($12,000,000.00) under the provisions of this section.
     </p>
     <p>
      Before any bonds shall be issued under the cited sections, the board of supervisors shall adopt a resolution reciting its intention to issue such bonds and stating the amount of bonds proposed to be issued, and shall give notice of election, to be published once each week for at least three (3) consecutive weeks in at least one (1) newspaper published in such county, in accordance with the provisions of Section 19-9-13, except that such election shall be mandatory.
     </p>
     <p>
      Such election shall be held, as far as practicable, in the same manner as other elections are held in counties. At such election, all qualified electors of such county may vote, and the ballots used at such election shall have printed thereon a brief statement of the amount and purpose of the proposed bond issue and the words “For the Bond Issue” and “Against the Bond Issue,” and the voter shall vote by placing a cross (X) or check mark (Π) opposite his choice on the proposition.

      When the results of the election on the question of the issuance of such bonds shall have been canvassed by the election commissioners of such county and certified by them to the board of supervisors of such county, it shall be the duty of such board of supervisors to determine and adjudicate whether or not three-fifths (3/5) of the qualified electors who voted in such election voted in favor of the issuance of such bonds; and, unless three-fifths (3/5) of the qualified electors who voted in such election shall have voted in favor of the issuance of such bonds, then such bonds shall not be issued.

    Mortgage indenture for additional bonds.

     <p>
      In addition to the bonds authorized under Section 65-33-7, said board shall have the authority, and it is hereby authorized, to issue and sell callable mortgage and revenue bonds in an amount not exceeding four million dollars ($4,000,000.00) to provide additional funds, if found by the board to be necessary for the purposes of Sections 65-33-1 through 65-33-15, which mortgage and revenue bonds shall be secured by a mortgage indenture on any land acquired by the board under the authority of said sections and, in the discretion of the board, by tolls to be fixed and collected by the board for the use of any such bridge or bridges, causeway or causeways, or other structure, and by any other revenue derived from any source under said sections.
     </p>
     <p>
      Such bonds shall be in the denomination of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) each, all shall mature within twenty-five years from the date of issuance, with such dates of maturity not to exceed twenty-five years as may be fixed in the resolution authorizing their issuance, shall bear interest not to exceed six per cent (6%) per annum to accrue and be payable semiannually, and shall be executed and sold in the manner authorized for the execution and sale of bonds, as provided in Section 65-33-7.
     </p>
     <p>
      To secure the payment of such mortgage and revenue bonds and to fix the rights of the holders thereof, said board may execute a trust indenture constituting a mortgage lien upon any of the lands acquired under the provisions of Sections 65-33-1 through 65-33-15, and which indenture may, in the discretion of the board, pledge and assign any revenues and tolls which the board may fix and collect for the use of any bridge or bridges, causeway or causeways, or other structure financed under the provisions of said sections. Said indenture shall contain such provisions and conditions as the board may find necessary or proper, shall include provisions for insurance of such bridges or causeways against such hazards as the board may deem proper and necessary, and shall fix the terms and conditions for calling said mortgage and revenue bonds for prepayment before their maturities.

When any owner of land or other person shall claim compensation for land taken for such purpose, or for damage sustained by the construction, widening, improvement, or protection of such road or highway, he shall petition the board of supervisors in writing within thirty days after the expiration of the time provided for such publication, setting forth the nature and character of the damages claimed. Thereupon the board shall, on five days’ notice to petitioner, go on the premises and assess the damages sustained by him. The finding of the board shall be in writing, signed by the members agreeing to it, and must be entered on the minutes at the next meeting; but if the damages sustained and claimed be less than the cost of assessing, the board may allow the same without inquiry.

The said county may borrow said funds either upon certificates of indebtedness, notes, or bonds, as in its judgment it may see fit. Said obligation or bonds shall not be for a period longer than ten years and at a rate of interest not exceeding six per cent.

      Where any county issues or has heretofore issued its bonds under this chapter or any previous statutes of a similar character for protection of any highway, there shall be paid into the treasury of such county fifty per cent (50%) of any license taxes which would otherwise be paid into the state highway fund collected by the state in such county on motor vehicles or drivers thereof, and fifty per cent (50%) of any excise taxes levied and collected in such county by the state on gasoline which would otherwise be paid into the state treasury to the credit of the state highway fund, to meet the interest and annual sinking fund on such bonds. Such funds shall be applied toward the liquidation of the interest and sinking fund accruing annually on such bonds, the other fifty per cent (50%) to go into the state treasury to the credit of the state highway commission, and, if such taxes in any year should be insufficient to cover such interest and sinking fund, the deficiency therein shall be supplied out of any other such funds collected by the state in such county and allotted by law to such county for road purposes. Nothing herein shall be construed as a guarantee on the part of the state to pay the interest or principal on any bonds issued hereunder.

      For the purpose of this section, such “surplus funds of Harrison County” shall be construed to be the amount paid to Harrison County under this section not pledged to the payment of principal and interest of bonds issued under this chapter, or any previous statutes of a similar character for the protection of any highway, and presently outstanding. “Surplus funds of Jackson County” shall be construed to be the amount paid to Jackson County under this section not pledged to the payment of principal and interest of bonds issued under this chapter, or any previous statutes of a similar character for the protection of any highway, and presently outstanding, and remaining after payment of principal and interest on bonds now issued or authorized by an election by Jackson County in connection with its Bayou Casotte development project under the authority of Senate Bill No. 1265, Extraordinary Session of 1954, as amended by Senate Bill No. 1624 enacted at the Regular 1958 Session of the Mississippi Legislature.
     </p>
     <p>
      Annually, to the extent necessary to meet the annual requirements for the payment of principal of and interest on said bonds, Harrison County shall pay to the state highway commission not exceeding two thirds of its aforesaid annual surplus, as hereinabove defined; and, to the extent necessary and available, Jackson County shall annually pay to the state highway commission from such surplus funds an amount not exceeding one third of the annual requirements for bonds issued by the state bond commission, and such amounts as may be necessary to satisfy any deficiency in preceding annual payments required to be made under the provisions hereof.

       An order of the board of supervisors of a tidewater county directing the clerk to withdraw from the seawall fund and to deposit in the county road and bridge fund, a specified sum, representing proceeds of collections of automobile privilege license taxes and from truck and bus privilege taxes, was proper, where the county had, and would have, ample available resources for the payment of all maturing bonds and for the upkeep and maintenance of all foreseeable seawall functions after the transfer.

      Where any county issues or has heretofore issued the bonds of the county under this chapter or any previous statutes of a similar character, an excise tax of not exceeding three cents per gallon, in addition to any such tax levied and collected by the state in such counties, for the distribution of gasoline, may be collected by such counties. Such collection shall be made at the time and in the manner provided for the collection of the gasoline tax generally and shall be remitted by the auditor of the county at the same time as is remitted the amount due to the county out of the regular gasoline tax. The additional funds so derived shall be applied first towards any deficiency in the amount collected by the state and paid to such county which may be necessary for the liquidation of the interest accruing on, and to provide a sinking fund for the retirement of, such bonds issued by municipalities for road protection and refunds as hereinbefore provided. Any overplus or parts thereof may be used in the construction of road protection pavements or hard surfaced aprons to any existing road protection heretofore constructed, or to increase the strength or stability of any such existing road protection, or in the construction of additional road protection, or in the repair and maintenance of existing road protection, or road protection hereafter constructed, as the board of supervisors may elect. The taxes hereinabove provided for, upon the faith of which bonds may be issued, shall be levied and collected annually in an amount estimated to be equal to the interest and sinking fund on said bonds and shall not, until said bonds with interest thereon shall have been paid, be lowered beyond that amount which is estimated to be necessary to produce annually a sum sufficient to pay interest and provide a sinking fund, requirements on such bond issue or issues, provided such tax shall not exceed such reasonable sum as may be legally levied and collected; said tax and sinking fund may be used by the board of supervisors to retire bonds issued by municipalities for road protection purposes and refunds as hereinbefore provided.

      Any such county may exempt from the payment of the additional tax levied on the distribution of gasoline, any and all gasoline which may be consumed by boats engaged in fishing, by boats in commerce between the states or in necessary duties as instrumentalities of the United States government, gasoline purchased for agricultural purposes or domestic purposes, as was defined by Section 12, Chapter 264, Laws of 1946. Such exemption shall be contained in the order of such board of supervisors levying the tax on such gasoline and, when such exemption is granted in such order, then no additional tax shall be required from the person distributing gasoline direct to consumers using same in operating boats for fishing, in commerce, or as instrumentalities of the United States government. When a distributor is entitled to the said exemption, he shall, when reporting and remitting to the auditor for the regular gasoline tax, report also in detail with respect to the distributions exempted from said additional tax in the same manner as is required in the section on exemptions and allowances in the chapter on gasoline taxes.

      In those counties operating under this chapter, the board of supervisors may borrow funds not in excess of three hundred fifty thousand dollars ($350,000.00) at a rate of interest not exceeding six per cent. per annum, in addition to such sums as may have heretofore been borrowed, for the purpose of extending, constructing, repairing, or maintaining the road protection of the county or to protect by sea wall or road protection any street, highway, road, or avenue connected therewith extending to or along the side of a harbor or to a boat landing or dock, which, in the judgment of the board of supervisors of such county, should be so protected either for an existing or a contemplated road, street, highway, or avenue. Such board of supervisors shall have authority to acquire by purchase or otherwise a dredge boat and use and operate the same for the purpose of pumping a sand beach adjacent to such sea wall or road protection structure, and to pay for same out of any funds provided under this section or any funds collected under Section 65-33-47. The funds or amount borrowed for the purpose provided for in this section shall be paid within a period of ten years from the date borrowed, and shall be paid out of the funds collected under this chapter. All bonds, notes, or certificates of indebtedness maturing each year and the interest thereon, however, shall be first provided for and paid out of said funds. The loans authorized herein shall not be subject to other limitations, restrictions, or provisions of the general laws governing the borrowing of money, amounts of indebtedness, budget, and election; and said loans may be made by the board of supervisors of such county either by issuance of county bonds, notes, or certificates of indebtedness which shall be full faith and credit obligations of the county issuing the same and shall be payable, both as to principal and interest, from the same sources of revenue and taxes made available for the payment of road protection bonds under the provisions of this chapter. The money herein authorized to be borrowed may be borrowed by such board of supervisors from any person, firm, corporation, governmental lending agency, or from any sinking funds of such county, provided that if the money be borrowed from any sinking fund, it shall be repaid before the sinking fund from which it is borrowed, when supplemented by funds paid into same, is needed. Before the board of supervisors shall borrow money under this section, it shall spread on its minutes an order reciting such intention and shall thereafter publish a copy of such order, in two weekly issues of some newspaper having a general circulation in the county. If, within fifteen days after the first publication of a copy of such order, twenty-five per cent of the qualified electors of the county petition the board of supervisors for an election to determine whether or not the adoption of such order should be annulled, such election shall be ordered by such board of supervisors. If at such election a majority of those voting vote in favor of the adoption of such order, the same shall be valid and effective; but if a majority shall vote against such order, it shall be annulled and shall be ineffective, and no further effort shall be made to borrow funds under this section by such board for a period of six months from the date of such election. If no such petition be presented within fifteen days after the first publication of a copy of such order, such order shall be valid and effective. The amount authorized to be borrowed under this section may be borrowed at any time and in any amount, but the total borrowed shall not exceed three hundred fifty thousand dollars ($350,000.00) in addition to such sums as may heretofore have been borrowed for the purposes herein enumerated, or either of them.

   Under authority of Code 1942, § 8516.3(1)(e), and as a condition precedent to receipt of federal funds for the repair and reconstruction of a sea wall and the construction of an artificial beach 17 miles in length extending seaward therefrom, the Board of Supervisors of Harrison County entered into a contract with the United States wherein the board agreed to assure perpetual public use of the beach. The Mississippi Supreme Court in Harrison County v. Guice (1962) 244 Miss 95, 140 So. 2d 838, declared that the beach became the property of the abutting owners by artificial accretion, subject only to the county’s right of ingress and egress for the purpose of maintaining the sea wall and other structures. Thereafter, following allegations that certain members of the general public were systematically excluded from the beach, the United States brought suit against the county to enforce its contract. On appeal, following dismissal of the action by the District Court, the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the contract of the United States with Harrison County requiring the maintenance of the beach perpetually for public use was valid and enforceable. United States v. Harrison County, 399 F.2d 485, 1968 U.S. App. LEXIS 5773 (5th Cir. Miss. 1968), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">397 U.S. 918</cite>, <cite class="s_court">90 S.

   The provision of § 95 of the Constitution prohibiting the donation of lands belonging to the state to private corporations or individuals (which prohibition applies to the beds of its shores, arms, and inlets) prevented the owners abutting upon a 17-mile artificial beach constructed upon submerged land in Mississippi Sound from acquiring title thereto under the doctrine of “artificial accretion”.

      <p>
       Harrison County acquired only an easement to replace, repair, and maintain the sea wall and the road, and the sea wall protection structure in the form of a sand fill, and reasonable rights of ingress and egress over the landowner’s lands for the purpose of replacing, repairing and maintaining said structures.

       Under Chapter 319, Laws of 1924, the board of supervisors of Harrison County was clothed with a power of eminent domain to condemn the right of way for the construction of a sea wall, including the protection of the road and sea wall by a sloping beach, and the landowner had waived any damages arising from the fact that the county had exceeded its previously acquired right in making improvements in 1951.

Such board of supervisors shall have the authority to acquire by purchase or otherwise a dredge boat and to use and operate it for the purpose of pumping a sand beach adjacent to such sea wall or road protection structure or for the maintenance thereof; however, said board of supervisors shall not pay for same out of any funds provided under this section. The funds or amount borrowed for the purposes provided in this section shall be repaid within a period of fifteen years from the date borrowed, and shall be paid out of the funds collected under this chapter. All bonds, notes, or certificates of indebtedness maturing each year and the interest thereon, however, shall be first provided for and paid out of said funds. The loans authorized herein shall not be subject to other limitations, restrictions, or provisions of the general laws governing the borrowing of money, amounts of indebtedness, budget, and election, and said loans may be made by the board of supervisors of such county either by issuance of county bonds, notes, or certificates of indebtedness which shall be full faith and credit obligations of the county issuing same and shall be payable, both as to principal and interest, from the same sources of revenue and taxes made available for the payment of road protection bonds under the provisions of this chapter, which sources of revenue and taxes are irrevocably pledged toward the repayment of any monies borrowed or any bonds issued under the provisions of this section. The money herein authorized to be borrowed by such board of supervisors may be borrowed from any person, firm, corporation, governmental lending agency, or from any sinking funds of such county; if the money be borrowed from any sinking fund, it shall be repaid before the sinking fund from which it is borrowed, when supplemented by funds paid into same, is needed. Before the board of supervisors shall borrow money under this section, it shall spread on its minutes an order reciting such intention and shall thereafter publish a copy of such order in three weekly issues of some newspaper having a general circulation in the county. If, within fifteen days after the first publication of a copy of such order, fifteen per cent of the qualified electors of the county shall file with such board of supervisors a petition in writing requesting an election on the question of borrowing money in the amount and for the purpose as set forth in such order, then such money shall not be borrowed unless authorized by a majority of the qualified voters of such county voting in an election to be ordered by such board of supervisors for that purpose. Notice of such election shall be given and such election shall be held and conducted as provided by law in connection with elections for the submission of bond issues in such county. If such proposition shall fail to receive such majority vote at such election, then no further proceedings for the borrowing of such money shall be had or taken within a period of six months from and after the date of such election. If, however, no such petition shall be so filed, or if at such election such petition shall be assented to by a majority vote, then such board of supervisors shall be authorized to borrow such money in the amount and for the purpose as set forth in such order as published. The amount authorized to be borrowed under this section may be borrowed at any time and in any amount, but the total borrowed shall not exceed five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000.00) in addition to such sums as may heretofore have been borrowed for the purposes herein enumerated, or either of them, and especially in addition to any sums that may have heretofore been borrowed or in addition to any bonds that may have heretofore been issued under authority of Section 65-33-51. Any attorneys’ fees paid for the issuance of said bonds shall be paid out of the general fund of said county.

      The board of supervisors of any county operating under the provisions of this chapter is hereby authorized to refund any bonded indebtedness of such county now outstanding, payable from the sources of revenue provided by this chapter, and to issue refunding bonds of such county, which shall be secured by and payable from the same sources of revenue as the bonds refunded thereby. The said refunding bonds may be issued by the board of supervisors of such county only after the question of the issue of said refunding bonds shall have been submitted to the qualified electors of such county at an election to be held for that purpose in said county, and only after the said issue has been authorized by a vote of three fifths of the qualified electors voting in an election to be ordered by the board of supervisors for that purpose, whenever any such board of supervisors shall find it necessary or advisable or in the best interest of such county so to do. Such refunding bonds may be issued only to redeem outstanding bonds at maturity, or on any date upon which outstanding bonds may be redeemable, or upon the voluntary surrender of outstanding bonds by the owners thereof. Such refunding bonds may be sold for not less than par and accrued interest, or may be exchanged for bonds to be refunded thereby; however, the issue of such refunding bonds shall be accomplished in such manner as to avoid payment by the county of interest on the refunding bonds and on the bonds refunded thereby for the same period of time.

In the event that less than all of outstanding bonds payable under the provisions of this chapter shall be refunded as herein provided, then and in that event there shall be paid into the state treasury, for the credit of the aforesaid interest and sinking fund, only the proportion of the revenues and taxes as the amount of refunding bonds issued and outstanding bears to the total amount of outstanding bonds payable from the revenues herein referred to.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The board of supervisors of any county issuing refunding bonds under the provisions of Sections 65-33-61 through 65-33-65, shall levy an annual tax of not less than five mills on each dollar of the assessed valuation of taxable property within such county for the purpose of providing funds sufficient to pay such bonds at maturity and interest thereon as it accrues. The said tax shall be levied and collected as other county taxes are levied and collected, and the proceeds thereof shall be remitted by the county tax collector to the State Treasury at the time when state taxes are required by law to be so remitted. The State Treasurer shall credit the amount to the interest and sinking fund referred to in Section 65-33-65. On or before October 1st in each year, the State Treasurer shall certify to the board of supervisors of each such county the amount standing to the credit of such interest and sinking fund as of September 15th, of that year, and if such amount shall be sufficient (1) to pay all principal of and interest on such bonds then due and owing and (2) all principal of and interest on such refunding bonds maturing and accruing during the period of twelve months running from said September 15th, then and in that event such board of supervisors may reduce the aforesaid taxes or omit the same for the ensuing year, as such board may determine. All funds paid into the State Treasury hereunder shall remain in the State Treasury for the payment of principal and interest on such refunding bonds until all the principal and interest on such refunding bonds shall have been fully paid.

      The board of supervisors shall pay all lawful fees of the chancery clerk and its attorney now prescribed by law, which fees are incidental to the execution of said refunding bonds, and may also pay all expenses in connection with the validation of said refunding bonds and procuring the opinion as to the validity thereof from some expert bond attorney, other than the state bond attorney, of national reputation. However, in cases where the bonds to be refunded are not due or redeemable prior to maturity, such board in procuring the surrender of such outstanding bonds may expend not exceeding an additional two and one-half percent (2 1/2%) of the principal amount of refunding bonds actually issued and delivered, but in no event shall any part of the said two and one-half percent (2 1/2%) be used in the payment of attorney’s fees. All such fees and compensation shall be paid out of the interest and sinking fund applicable to the bonds to be refunded, if the amount credited to such fund be adequate therefor.

      The State Bond Commission shall act as the issuing agent for the bonds authorized under Sections 65-39-5 through 65-39-33, prescribe the form of the bonds, advertise for and accept bids, issue and sell the bonds so authorized to be sold, pay all fees and costs incurred in such issuance and sale, and do all other things necessary and advisable in connection with the issuance and sale of the bonds. The State Bond Commission may pay the costs that are incident to the sale, issuance and delivery of the bonds authorized under Sections 65-39-5 through 65-39-33 from the proceeds derived from the sale of the bonds. The State Bond Commission shall sell such bonds on sealed bids at public sale, and for such price as it may determine to be for the best interest of the State of Mississippi, but no such sale may be made at a price less than par plus accrued interest to the date of delivery of the bonds to the purchaser. All interest accruing on such bonds so issued shall be payable semiannually or annually; however, the first interest payment may be for any period of not more than one (1) year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Notice of the sale of any such bond shall be published at least one (1) time, not less than ten (10) days before the date of sale, and shall be so published in one or more newspapers published or having a general circulation in the City of Jackson, Mississippi, and in one or more other newspapers or financial journals with a national circulation, to be selected by the State Bond Commission.

       The corridor management plan adopted under this chapter shall establish criteria, policies and procedures that will permit county boards of supervisors, municipal governing authorities and the Mississippi Department of Transportation to submit to the advisory committee applications for highways, roads and streets under the governmental entity’s respective jurisdiction for nomination as a scenic byway. Nothing in the corridor management plan shall be interpreted as amending or limiting any county or municipal zoning or land use ordinances unless the county or municipality has authorized the amendment according to the procedure provided for in its ordinance. The corridor management plan shall authorize county boards of supervisors and municipal governing authorities to submit one or more plans for one or more highways, roads or streets to be designated a scenic byway that may have management requirements that are more strict than the department’s corridor management plan. Such plans for a scenic byway submitted by a county or municipality shall describe the additional management requirements proposed for application to the scenic byway and, if approved by the department, shall apply only to the approved scenic byway. In carrying out the purposes of this chapter and the specific plans for scenic byways, counties and municipalities may include in such specific plans for the corridor (including, but not limited to, medians) provisions for planting and replanting of trees, shrubs and flowers; vegetative buffers, design guidelines and limitations for landscaping, signage and lighting; and noise guidelines and limitations.

Notice of the meeting, along with a description of the highway, road or street proposed as a scenic byway shall be given once each week for at least three (3) consecutive weeks by publication in some newspaper having a general circulation in the county where the proposed scenic byway is located. Following the public meeting, the committee may nominate the highway, road or street as a scenic byway if it is eligible and meets the guidelines established under the program. A highway, road or street that has been nominated by the committee as a scenic byway shall be submitted by the advisory committee to the Legislature at the next regular session of the Legislature following its nomination. A highway, road or street that has been nominated as a scenic byway may be designated as an official Mississippi Scenic Byway only by its introduction and passage as a legislative bill.

       The advisory committee shall review each designated scenic byway not less often than once each two (2) years to make sure that the program participants are meeting their obligations under the plan and that the byway continues to possess the intrinsic qualities and meet the criteria which supported its initial designation. If the committee finds that a designated byway is not being maintained according to established standards or that it has lost its necessary intrinsic qualities, the committee shall report its findings to the Legislature and the Legislature, by legislation, may de-designate the byway.

       For the purpose of providing funds to defray the expenses of projects authorized pursuant to Sections 65-43-1 and 65-43-3, the board of supervisors of a county or the governing authorities of a municipality shall have the right to borrow money for the project, and to issue revenue bonds therefor in such principal amounts as the board of supervisors or governing authorities may determine to be necessary to provide sufficient funds to defray the expenses of projects authorized pursuant to Sections 65-43-1 and 65-43-3. The bonds shall be payable out of any revenues derived from the project, including grants or contributions from the federal government or other sources. Such bonds may be sold at public or private sale at not less than par and shall bear interest at a rate or rates not exceeding that allowed in Section 75-17-103. Any such bonds so issued shall not constitute a debt of the county, the municipality or any political subdivision of the county or the city within the meaning of any constitutional, statutory or charter restriction, limitation or provision. It shall be plainly stated on the face of each bond in substance that the bond has been issued pursuant to the authority granted in this section and that the taxing power of the county or municipality issuing the bond is not pledged to the payment of the bond or the interest on it and that the bond and the interest on it are payable solely from the revenues of the project for which the bond is issued.

       All bonds issued under the authority of this section shall bear such date or dates, shall be in such form or denomination, shall bear such rate of interest, and shall mature at such times as the county or municipality shall determine, but no bonds issued under the authority of this section shall mature more than thirty (30) years from the date of the issuance thereof and none of the bonds shall be sold for less than par and accrued interest. All bonds shall be sold in the manner now provided by law for the sale of bonds without any restrictions, limitations, requirements or conditions applicable to the borrowing of such money and the issuance of such bonds which are not herein contained. The denomination, form, place of payment and other details of such bonds may be determined by resolution or order of the board of supervisors of a county or the governing authorities of a municipality, and shall be executed on behalf of the county or municipality as is now provided by law.

       Before issuing any bonds under the provisions of this section, the board of supervisors of the county or the governing authorities of the municipality shall, by resolution spread upon the minutes, declare its intention to issue such bonds for the purposes authorized by this section and shall state in the resolution the amount of bonds proposed to be issued and shall likewise fix in the resolution the date upon which the board of supervisors of the county or the governing authorities of the municipality proposes to direct the issuance of the bonds. Notice of such intention shall be published once a week for at least three (3) consecutive weeks in a newspaper published or having a general circulation in the county or the municipality, with the first publication of the notice to be made not less than twenty-one (21) days prior to the date fixed in the resolution for the issuance of the bonds and the last publication to be made not more than seven (7) days prior to such date. If, on or before the date specified in the resolution, twenty percent (20%) or fifteen hundred (1500), whichever is less, of the qualified electors of the county or municipality shall file a written protest against the issuance of the bonds, then an election upon the issuance of the bonds shall be called, and held, as provided in this section. If no such protest shall be filed, then the board of supervisors of the county or the governing authorities of the municipality may issue such bonds without an election on the question of the issuance of the bonds at any time within a period of two (2) years after the date specified in the resolution.

       If an election is called under the provisions of this section on the question of the issuance of bonds, the election shall be held, insofar as practicable, in the same manner as other elections are held in the county or municipality. At the election, all qualified electors of the county or municipality may vote and the ballots used in the election shall have printed thereon a brief statement of the amount and purposes of the proposed bond issue and the words “FOR THE BOND ISSUE” and the words “AGAINST THE BOND ISSUE,” and the voters shall vote by placing a cross (X) or check mark (Π) opposite their choice on the proposition.

       When the results of any election provided for in this section shall have been canvassed by the election commissioners of the county or municipality and certified by them to the proper authorities, it shall be the duty of the board of supervisors of the county or the governing authorities of the municipality to determine and adjudicate whether or not a majority of the qualified electors who voted in the election voted in favor of the issuance of the bonds and unless a majority of the qualified electors who voted in the election voted in favor of the issuance of the bonds, then the bonds shall not be issued. Should a majority of the qualified electors who vote in the election vote in favor of the bonds, the board of supervisors of the county or the governing authorities of the municipality may issue the bonds, either in whole or in part, within two (2) years from the date of such election, or within two (2) years after final favorable determination of any litigation affecting the issuance of such bonds at such time or times, and in such amount or amounts, not exceeding that specified in the notice of the election, as shall be deemed proper.
