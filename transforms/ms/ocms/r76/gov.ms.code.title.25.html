       Position is “public office” when created by law with duties cast upon incumbent involving exercise of some portion of sovereign power in performance of which public is concerned and which are continuing in their nature, “continuing” meaning enduring and permanent, whereas “public employment” is position lacking one or more of foregoing elements.

       Under this section, [§ 4026], and § 136 of the Constitution of 1890, a member of the board of county supervisors, who was reelected during 1940 for such office but failed to provide bond and take the oath of office, had a right to hold over during the year 1940 until his successor should be elected and make the required bond and take the oath of office. O'Neal v. Fairley, 190 Miss. 650, 200 So. 722, 1941 Miss. LEXIS 70 (Miss. 1941).

       Newly elected member of board of supervisors did not waive claim to office, as against incumbent holding over on ground that newly elected member was ineligible, by accepting appointment from Governor after injunctive writ had been served.

       The dismissal by a former sheriff and tax collector of his action against the county for compensation for alleged services did not destroy the right of his assignee, who was to obtain a portion of any recovery, and since the assignee’s right was dependent upon the right of his assignor, assignee’s action should have been brought within six years from the date of the expiration of the term of office of the former sheriff and tax collector, and, where it was not, the claim was barred. Smith v. Copiah County, 232 Miss. 838, 100 So. 2d 614, 1958 Miss. LEXIS 337 (Miss. 1958).

     </h3>
     <p>
      If any person elected or appointed to any state, state district, levee board, county, county district, or municipal office shall fail to qualify as required by law on or before the day of the commencement of his term of office, or for any cause any such officer shall hold over after his regular term of office expires under the authority given him to hold over until his successor is appointed or elected and qualified, a vacancy in such office shall occur thereby and it shall be filled in the manner prescribed by law, as provided by Section 103 of the Constitution for filling vacancies in such offices, unless the failure to qualify arises from there being no officer to approve the bond of such officer-elect, and except the Governor-elect when the Legislature fixes by resolution the time of his installation. This section shall not be applicable to any coroner who fails to qualify as provided in Section 19-21-105.

      </p>
      <p>
       In view of the return of the election commissioners that he had been elected to the office of mayor, though wrongful, it was unnecessary for a relator to have taken oath and executed bond, or have offered to do so, on or before the beginning of the term in order to maintain by quo warranto a contest for a municipal office with one usurping the same. State ex rel. Bourgeois v. Laizer, 77 Miss. 146, 25 So. 153, 1899 Miss. LEXIS 44 (Miss. 1899).

       Where duly elected justice of peace failed to qualify, incumbent was authorized to hold over until election and qualification of successor. Berry v. Berry, 165 Miss. 472, 144 So. 695, 1932 Miss. LEXIS 292 (Miss. 1932).
      </p>
      <p>
       Failure of commissioner of levee board, on reappointment, to file bond under belief old bond would suffice to disqualify him. State ex rel. Jones v. Lyon, 145 Miss. 163, 110 So. 243, 1926 Miss. LEXIS 6 (Miss. 1926).
      </p>
      <p>
       Commission of levee district is not authorized to continue in office because of failure of appointee to qualify, when prevented from filing bond for approval. State ex rel. Hairston v. Baggett, 145 Miss. 142, 110 So. 240, 1926 Miss. LEXIS 5 (Miss. 1926).

       Marshal failing to qualify for office of tax collector was not entitled to recover fees of one illegally elected to office. Coker v. Wilkinson, 142 Miss. 1, 106 So. 886, 1926 Miss. LEXIS 52 (Miss. 1926).
      </p>
      <p>
       The execution and approval by the designated officers of the bond required by law of a county officer is a condition precedent to the right to enter upon the office; tender to the proper officers of a bond, although ample and solvent, is not a compliance with such a condition if the bond be rejected. Andrews v. State, 69 Miss. 740, 13 So. 853, 1892 Miss. LEXIS 50 (Miss. 1892).

      <p>
       Fact that office incumbent holds over under statutory authority until successor has qualified does not preclude “vacancy” as basis for selecting successor. Berry v. Berry, 165 Miss. 472, 144 So. 695, 1932 Miss. LEXIS 292 (Miss. 1932).
      </p>
      <p>
       Laws, 1908, ch. 190, providing manner in which vacancies in offices shall be filled did not repeal Code 1906, § 3435. State ex rel. Booze v. Cresswell, 117 Miss. 795, 78 So. 770, 1918 Miss. LEXIS 223 (Miss. 1918).
      </p>
      <p>
       The mode of filling vacancies in the office of justice of the peace is, by Const. 1890, § 103, committed entirely to the legislature. State ex rel. Booze v. Cresswell, 117 Miss. 795, 78 So. 770, 1918 Miss. LEXIS 223 (Miss. 1918).
      </p>
      <p>
       When to fill a vacancy an election is held which is irregular, but commission is issued to the successful candidate, who qualifies and enters upon the duties of the office, and litigation afterward arises involving the validity of the election, whereupon, anticipating an adverse decision, he is appointed by the governor as if there had been no election, the fact that this is done pending the controversy does not affect the validity of his appointment. State v. Lovell, 70 Miss. 309, 12 So. 341, 1892 Miss. LEXIS 122 (Miss. 1892).

       Appointed municipal election commissioners are entitled to serve and perform statutory duties of commissioners until their successors are appointed and qualified. Schissel Oct. 22, 1993, A.G. Op. #93-0752.

      <p>
       Based on Section 25-1-7, individuals who are serving in the positions of city attorney, municipal judge, municipal prosecutor, public defender and dilapidated housing prosecutor from a previous term and, who were not confirmed by the city council prior to serving that term, are holdover employees until either they or their successors are appointed by the mayor and confirmed by the city council.

       There is no authority for three members of the Mississippi State Board of Medical Licensure whose terms expire on June 30, 2000 to continue to serve after that date if they have not been reappointed at that time by the Governor, and no other individuals have been appointed to fill their seats.

       If a town forgoes holding a general election in the event no person qualifies to run in that election, the incumbent officials would hold over after the expiration of their regular terms of office until such time as new officers are elected; further, any action taken by those officers during this hold-over period would be valid and binding as official acts.

      The state officials hereinafter named shall give bond in the penalty specified for each, with surety by one or more guaranty or surety companies authorized to do business in the state. Said bonds shall be approved by the Governor and commissioner of insurance and, when so approved, shall be filed and recorded in the office of the secretary of state.

     </p>
     <p>
      The official bonds of all other state officers shall continue and remain as to amounts thereof as now fixed elsewhere by law, but said bonds shall be subject to the provisions stated herein for sureties, approval, filing, and premium payment unless otherwise specifically provided.
     </p>
     <p>
      Premiums paid on all bonds under the provisions of this section shall be paid out of the state treasury upon warrant of the auditor, which shall be issued upon the approval of the bonds as herein provided; provided, however, that the said premiums shall be at the lowest rate obtainable. If from any cause such guaranty or surety bond or bonds cannot be obtained in whole or in part because of refusal of said guaranty or surety companies, at a reasonable rate in the judgment of the insurance commissioner or for other cause, to make such bond or bonds, upon certificate of the commissioner of insurance to that effect, the officer or officers having thus been unable to make a bond or bonds may make such bond with personal or individual surety in the required penalty, to be approved by the Governor and filed and recorded as directed herein, together with the certificate of the commissioner of insurance attached to the bond.

       Although a supervisor’s official bond specified a penalty in a sum less than that required by the provisions of Code 1942, § 2872, both the supervisor and his surety were actually bound to the full amount of the statutorily fixed penalty.

      <p>
       Where the municipal authorities fix the amount of the bond of the town treasurer and approve and accept as his official bond one not signed by him, but signed by certain persons as his sureties who signed without his request, it is valid under this section.

       Where a notary is required by statute to give a bond with sureties for the performance of his official duties, he and his sureties will be liable in an action for any breach of conditions of the bond, provided such breach is a proximate cause of a loss or injury, although it need not be the sole loss.

       Under the statute any person injured by the breach of bond of a notary can recover, and there are no limitations or restrictions in so far as the liability of the officer and his surety are concerned so long as the damage is the result of the breach and the statute does not require that there be reliance by the injured party.

       In a suit on a bond where a defendant pleads a former recovery, it is not a good replication to aver that the breaches which had occured before the former suit are different from those in said suit, and were unknown to plaintiff when that suit was brought, without an averment of a fraudulent concealment thereof by the defendant; and the statute does not affect this.

       The Supreme Court was without authority to review judicially the action of the president of a board of supervisors and the clerk of the chancery court in disproving the bond offered by a county supervisor, or to require them to approve the same, even though they failed to interpret Code 1930, § 2892 as being in pari materia with Code 1930, §§ 2891 and 2893, and also to construe it in connection with § 112 of the State Constitution, since such officials, even though acting judicially when passing upon the sufficiency of the bonds of other county officials, did not constitute a court of record or a tribunal required to keep a record of their findings.

       Even if certiorari would lie to the supreme court to a refusal of the president of a board of supervisors and the clerk of the chancery court to approve the tendered bond of another county official, the supreme court would be limited in reviewing the record to a consideration of the bond, affidavits of financial worth and the other security offered, and would be without the right to consider the evidence upon which such officials made their findings or the facts set forth therein.

       § 25-1-23.
    Procedure for determining sufficiency of doubtful bond.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The officers by whom official bonds of public officials and employees are to be approved shall have the right to inspect the land described in the affidavit made by a surety on any such bond, and shall have the right to orally examine the surety and others touching the description and value of such land. If the approving officers shall fail or refuse to approve any such official bond within fifteen (15) days after it is presented to them by any duly elected or appointed officer or employee and such officer or employee is debarred of his office or position by reason of such failure or refusal, the officer or employee thus debarred may, within ten (10) days after the expiration of the said fifteen-day period, appeal to the chancery court of the county, upon giving bond with sufficient sureties in a penalty of One Hundred Dollars ($100.00), payable to the state and conditioned that he will perform the decree of the chancery court. The appeal bond, if sufficient, shall be approved by the clerk of the chancery court and forthwith delivered to the officers who have failed or refused to approve the official bond.
     </p>
     <p>
      When the appeal bond has been approved and delivered to the approving officers, they shall immediately file it, together with the official bond and the affidavits by the sureties that are annexed to it, in the office of the clerk of the chancery court; and the cause shall be immediately entered on the issue docket of the chancery court as a suit in equity in the name of the aggrieved officer or employee, as complainant, and in the names of the approving officers, as defendants, which cause shall then be at issue and shall be a preference case. The controversy shall be tried de novo, either in term or in vacation, at a time to be fixed by an order made by the chancellor, and no other or further notice of the trial shall be necessary. The issue shall be the sufficiency vel non of the official bond, and the burden of proof shall be upon the appealing officer or employee.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the bond be adjudged to be sufficient and the approving officers are still unwilling to approve it, the appealing officer or employee may deliver to the approving officers certified copies of the bond, the affidavits of the sureties annexed to it, and the decree of the chancery court; and he shall thereupon be entitled to have the oath of office administered to him and to occupy the office to which he was theretofore elected or appointed.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the bond be adjudged to be insufficient, a decree shall be rendered against the appealing officer or employee and the sureties on the appeal bond, requiring them to pay the costs of the proceeding in the chancery court; but such adjudication shall not preclude the appealing officer or employee from furnishing a sufficient bond, and the approval thereof by the approving officers, at any time before another person has been duly elected or appointed to the office or position.

      In case the sureties or any of them, of any public officer or employee shall permanently remove out of the state or become insolvent, or if from any cause an official bond shall be found insufficient, the Governor in the case of a state officer or employee, and the appropriate governing authority in the case of a local officer or employee, shall notify such officer or employee to appear at a day and place to be named within ten (10) days thereafter, to give a new bond with other sufficient sureties in a penalty equal to that of the former bond and with the like condition, or to show cause why the same should not be required. If such officer or employee shall fail or neglect so to do within a time to be designated, his office or position shall thereby become vacant and he shall cease to discharge any of the duties thereof. If a state officer or employee, the Governor shall cause the vacancy to be filled as in other cases; and, if a local office or employee, the vacancy shall be filled as in other cases of vacancy in local offices. From proceedings under this section there shall be no appeal; and if the officer or employee to be notified be without the state or abscond, he may be notified by publication as defendants in chancery are so notified.

       § 25-1-27.
    Release of surety on bond of local officer or employee.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      In case a surety on any bond of any local officer or employee shall conceive himself to be in danger of suffering by being such surety and shall desire to be relieved therefrom, he may petition the board of supervisors or the municipal governing authority, as the case may be, for relief in the premises. The appropriate local governing authority shall thereupon order that the officer or employee give a new bond with sufficient sureties in a penalty not less than the first bond and conditioned according to law, and notice of such order shall forthwith be given to such officer or employee. Said new bond shall be furnished within such reasonable time as the governing authority may direct, not exceeding thirty (30) days from the date of said order; and on the giving of such bond and the approval thereof by the governing authority, the petitioner shall be discharged from further liability on the bond as to the performances of all official duties after the giving of such new bond. If such officer or employee shall fail or refuse to comply with the order to give a new bond, his office or position shall thereby become vacant and the vacancy shall be filled as in other cases of vacancies in local offices or positions.

       A petition by a surety company to a board of supervisors couched in the language of this section in order to be relieved from the obligation of surety to a justice of the peace did not give rise to a cause of action against it for libel, both because the surety was thereby exercising a legal right and because the words themselves were not libelous.

       A failure to give a new bond, when ordered to do so under the section ipso facto vacates the office, and the petitioning sureties are no longer liable. Bennett v. State, 58 Miss. 556, 1880 Miss. LEXIS 158 (Miss. 1880); State v. Morgan, 59 Miss. 349, 1881 Miss. LEXIS 132 (Miss. 1881).

      In case a surety on any bond of any state officer shall desire to be relieved therefrom, he may petition to the Governor to that purpose and give notice thereof to the officer from whose bond he wishes to be relieved; and the Governor shall also communicate and give notice to such officer. If said officer shall not within such reasonable time as the Governor shall direct, not exceeding thirty (30) days, present a new bond in a penalty not less than the first and conditioned according to law, such office shall be declared vacant by the Governor. On the giving of such new bond and the approval as required by law, the petitioner shall be discharged from further liability on the bond as to the performance of all official duties after the giving of such new bond. In the event such surety shall be relieved, he shall refund to the state the unearned premium on such bond.

      If any state or county officer shall die having a deputy, the deputy may continue to discharge the duties of the office in the name of the deceased officer as if he had not died, until the vacancy in the office shall be filled according to law. The official bond of the deceased officer and his estate shall be a security for the faithful performance of the duties of the office by the deputy, who shall be subject to all the provisions of law applicable to his principal in his lifetime; and the personal representative of the decedent shall have like remedy against the deputy as the decedent would have if living. Where there are two judicial districts in a county and there be a deputy in each, the deputy of the first district shall discharge the duties of the office under the provisions of this section.

       The surety under a “blanket” public employees performance bond covering the administrator, trustees, librarian, dietitian, superintendent of nurses, and bookkeeper of a county hospital, was not entitled to recover from the administrator any part of a $6,000 shortage which occurred during the administrator’s tenure at the hospital, where the administrator had inherited from his predecessor the mode of operation and continued it without objection by the trustees or by the State Auditing Department, and where the State Auditor’s report as to the shortage made no attempt to fix responsibility for the shortage.

       Neither county superintendent of education, nor sureties on his official bond, are liable for erroneously, but in good faith, issuing certificates against school funds under Code 1942, § 6349, for the purchase of fire extinguishers for use in school busses and payment of premiums on bonds executed by school-bus drivers.

      <p>
       Theory of liability under Code 1942, § 2944, respecting appropriation of money to “any object, not authorized by law,” is inapplicable with respect to liability of county superintendent of education for wrongfully issuing certificates against school funds.

      <p>
       Matters of defense, such as honest mistake and good faith, in action against county superintendent of education and sureties on his official bond for wrongly issuing certificates under Code 1942, § 6349, must be pleaded and proved by the defendants, and need not be negatived in the complaint.

       Expenditure of public funds by a county officer, even though within the general field of his jurisdiction, may be so clearly and distinctly unlawful as to preclude the defense that he so acted in good faith and honest error.

      <p>
       Common-law rule, that a public officer is not liable for errors or mistakes made by him in good faith when acting judicially or quasi judicially within the scope and subject matter over which he has been given jurisdiction, applies in respect to liability under this section.

       Members of a county board of supervisors are empowered to employ counsel and defend themselves when sued in causes arising out of their official position where they have a colorable defense and present the defense in good faith; however, where there is no reasonable basis for a defense and/or where the board members proceed in bad faith, they act ultra vires and have no power to expend public funds for defense, and, in such cases, the court should order that any such defense be at their own expense and that any public funds expended be reimbursed.

The published notice shall contain a description of the property and other pertinent data which the sheriff may deem necessary and proper in compliance with this section. The cost of public notice shall be charged against and added to the cost of the property advertised and sold by virtue of said notice.

   The statute which governs nepotism, §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t25c01s25-1-53" target="_self">25-1-53</a></cite>, did not pre-empt the application of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t25c04s25-4-105" target="_self">25-4-105</a></cite> to a situation in which the president of a community college employed his wife as a teacher since the former statute does apply to the employment of teachers.

       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       Facts showed that husband was not appointing authority at time his wife was hired and simultaneous employment of husband and wife by city did not constitute nepotism; except for purposes of inquiring or receiving information or advice, council deals with municipal departments and personnel solely through mayor. Norman, Jan. 25, 1990, A.G. Op. #90-0051.
      </p>
      <p>
       Position of road hand/machine operator/heavy equipment operator/road maintenance individual does not fall within class of employment enumerated or contemplated by statute (officer, clerk, stenographer, deputy or assistant); accordingly, employment of brother of member of board of supervisors would not constitute violation of nepotism statute. Lamar, Feb. 22, 1990, A.G. Op. #90-0094.
      </p>
      <p>

Hefner, Feb. 23, 1990, A.G. Op. #90-0111.
      </p>

      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
       Appointed municipal clerk is subject to same employment provisions as are regular municipal employees and therefore, insofar as nepotism statute is concerned would be in same situation as “employee” and is eligible to remain in office subsequent to time her kinsman was elected to board of aldermen. Fortner, August 22, 1990, A.G. Op. #90-0627.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hiring of sister of member of board of supervisors by tax assessor and collector to be deputy assessor would not violate nepotism statute; Since tax assessor and collector is hiring authority, not board of supervisors, employee would not be related to hiring authority within third degree according to civil law. McGregor, August 29, 1990, A.G. Op. #90-0651.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where sole authority for employment and discharge of employees expressly rests with commission, not executive director, commission may not hire as clerk, stenographer, officer, deputy or assistant, son or daughter of one of members of Board of Commissioners of Mississippi Coast Transportation Authority. Ward, Oct. 25, 1990, A.G. Op. #90-0784.
      </p>
      <p>
       Three-part analysis should be employed to determine whether employment relationship violates nepotism statute: (1) Are parties related within third degree? (2) Is relative who is public official “appointing authority”? (3) Is job included in list of prohibited positions? Harrington, May 30, 1991, A.G. Op. #91-0404.
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
       As a deputy who is to be paid out of the public funds, a deputy medical examiner or medical examiner investigator is subject to the nepotism statute, regardless of whether he actually receives the compensation to which he is entitled. Sims, June 17, 1992, A.G. Op. #92-0423.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because the sheriff, not the board of supervisors, is responsible for the actual employment of deputies, the employment by a sheriff of a deputy who is the son of a supervisor does not present a violation of the nepotism statute. Hatcher, June 17, 1992, A.G. Op. #92-0433.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nepotism statute prohibits city council from appointing to Municipal Elections Commission uncle by marriage of one of council members. Hicks, Sept. 16, 1992, A.G. Op. #92-0677.

Breland, Jan. 6, 1993, A.G. Op. #92-0983.
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Consistent with strict interpretation of Miss. Code Section<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t25c01s25-1-53" target="_self">25-1-53</a></cite>, dispatcher is not “officer, clerk, stenographer, deputy, or assistant” such as is contemplated by nepotism statute; accordingly, Miss. Code §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t25c01s25-1-53" target="_self">25-1-53</a></cite> does not prohibit board of supervisors from employing sister-in-law of one of board’s members as dispatcher. Hathorn, Apr. 28, 1993, A.G. Op. #93-0271.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mississippi’s nepotism statute, Miss. Code Section 25-1-53, does not apply to employment of physicians, nurses or medical technicians by governing boards of community hospitals; however, statute does apply to employment of officers, clerks, stenographers, deputies or assistants; statute does not apply to employee who was in department or institution before kinsman became hiring authority. Hollimon, May 12, 1993, A.G. Op. #93-0274.
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
       Board of supervisors is ultimately appointing authority of assistant purchasing clerk in all counties, regardless of whether they operate under beat system or unit system and therefore county administrator was prohibited from appointing nephew of county supervisor as assistant purchasing clerk. Trapp, July 14, 1993, A.G. Op. #93-0482.
      </p>
      <p>
       Administrator who implements federal law such as Americans with Disabilities Act is not one of five listed positions in statute and therefore board of supervisors or county administrator could appoint nephew of board member as administrator in county charged with responsibility of implementing Americans with Disabilities Act. Trapp, July 14, 1993, A.G. Op. #93-0482.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because mayor is appointing authority and city council has no confirmation authority, there would be no violation of nepotism statute for husband of council member to serve as public defender. Perkins, July 14, 1993, A.G. Op. #93-0494.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nepotism only applies to specific jobs mentioned in statute, namely “officer, clerk, stenographer, deputy or assistant”; therefore, it would not appear that employment by mayor and aldermen of mayor’s nephew as “staffing specialist” comes within prohibition of statute. Ellis Aug. 18, 1993, A.G. Op. #93-0583.
      </p>

Gilfoy Aug. 26, 1993, A.G. Op. #93-0613.
      </p>
      <p>
       There does not appear to be prohibition against board of aldermen employing son of alderman as laborer, as that is not one of five specified positions in nepotism statute; however, as niece is within third degree of kinship prohibited by statute, and clerk is one of enunciated positions set out in nepotism statute, it would be in violation of Section 25-1-53 for niece of alderman to be employed in that capacity unless she was serving as city clerk at time her uncle or aunt became alderman. Gilfoy Aug. 26, 1993, A.G. Op. #93-0613.

      </p>
      <p>

      </p>

      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
       If a person was recently elected to serve as County Supervisor and the Supervisor’s son has been an employee of the district for six years prior to the election, it would appear to be acceptable for the son to continue to work in his present position under Section 25-1-53.

      </p>
      <p>
       The County Board of Supervisors may employ the brother-in-law of one of its members as a full time mechanic to service and/or repair all county vehicles and equipment since, Section 25-1-53 only prohibits an official from employing or appointing a relative within the third degree to the following positions: “officer, clerk, stenographer, deputy, or assistant”.

      </p>
      <p>
       Miss. Code Section 25-1-53 would not restrict the employment of a public relations assistant, notwithstanding the fact that the assistant is related within the third degree to a member of the appointing authority, because a public relations assistant is not one of the five positions to which Section 25-1-53 applies.

   Upon a determination by the board of aldermen that one of its members has moved outside the corporate limits of the municipality he or she was elected to serve as opposed to temporarily living outside the municipality, the office becomes vacant by operation of law and the vacancy must be filled in accordance with the provisions of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.23.html#t23c15s23-15-857" target="_blank">23-15-857</a></cite>.

      <p>
       The question of whether an official has “removed” out of the jurisdiction for which he was elected or appointed is one of fact.
   The municipal governing board has the responsibility to make the factual determination as to whether an officer has abandoned the municipality as his place of residence or whether he is only temporarily away from his residence. Tanner, Aug. 20, 2003, A.G. Op. 03-0441.

       Whether a municipal officer has “removed” out of the jurisdiction he was elected to serve is a question of fact to be determined by the municipal governing authorities, subject to judicial review. Carouthers, Jan. 6, 2005, A.G. Op. 05-0633.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a board of aldermen determines, consistent with the facts, that a member is no longer a resident of the ward he was elected to serve and is not merely temporarily residing outside his ward but has abandoned same, a vacancy would have to be declared and a special election set in accordance with Section 23-15-857. Skellie, Aug. 18, 2006, A.G. Op. 06-0377.

       This statute does not in effect prohibit and make unlawful deposits of sheriffs and tax collectors in current accounts in banks, so as to render the trust fund doctrine inapplicable upon the bank’s insolvency, but merely undertakes to, and does, as to state banks, effect a preference for this kind of public deposits in liquidation proceedings by charging all the assets of the bank with a general preferential lien.

       Municipalities may mark vehicles which are leased with permanent decal or design in lieu of paint; however, decal must be permanent and may not be decal which may be easily removed on temporary basis. Denton Oct. 6, 1993, A.G. Op. #93-0590.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under Section 25-1-87, if the governing authorities of a municipality find and spread on the minutes that identifying marks on a particular police vehicle would hinder official criminal investigations by the police, then they may authorize that vehicle to be unmarked, subject to review by the State Auditor. However, this statute does not contemplate an unmarked vehicle being used for other than police purposes. Jones, June 28, 1995, A.G. Op. #95-0351.

       Municipal governing authorities do not have authority to assign an unmarked police car to a mayor for use in performing duties for the municipality, as this section makes apparent that unmarked police cars must be used for police purposes. Gregory, Oct. 18, 2002, A.G. Op. #02-0575.

   Where the Harrison County Development Commission (HCDC), a political subdivision of the State of Mississippi, willfully and knowingly denied a county citizen access to certain records related to a planned development (in part, by unilaterally requiring fees that were not part of its policy), and which were not exempt under the Mississippi Public Records Act of 1983, Miss.

Pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t25c61s25-61-9ol12" target="_self">25-61-9(2)</a></cite>, HCDC should have separated information on its director’s salary and leave time (subject to disclosure), from his personnel file and disclosed any non exempt material; further, the information on its business partners or prospects were not confidential and were subject to disclosure, and therefore, it was not entitled to a protective order per Miss.

       The effective date of Chapter 391, Laws of 2013, which added this section, is “from and after the date it is effectuated under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, as amended and extended.” However, after the bill was approved, the United States Supreme Court, in the case of
       <i>
        Shelby County v. Holder
       </i>
       (June 25, 2013), struck down the coverage formula that determined what jurisdictions are subject to Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, so the coverage formula can no longer be used as a basis for subjecting jurisdictions to preclearance under Section 5.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because of the
       <i>
        Shelby County
       </i>
       decision, the United States Attorney General is not making any determinations under Section 5 on voting or election changes made by states.
   The Supreme Court did not strike down Section 5, so it is still in effect.
   For that reason, the Mississippi Attorney General’s Office submitted Chapter 391, Laws of 2013, to the United States Attorney General, in order to technically meet the requirements of Section 5 and fulfill the condition in the effective date of the bill, which will allow the bill to take effect.
      </p>
      <p>
       By letter dated August 1, 2013, the United States Attorney General responded that he is not making determinations on the merits of any bill that is submitted under Section 5. The submission of Chapter 391 and the response from the United States Attorney General technically met the requirements of Section 5 and fulfilled the condition in the effective date of Chapter 391, so Chapter 391 became effective from and after August 1, 2013, the date of the United States Attorney General’s response letter.

       § 25-3-1.
    Classifications of counties.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      For the purposes of this chapter the counties are divided into eight (8) classes, numbered from One to Eight, according to the 1930 total assessed valuation of the real, personal, and public service corporation property of each county, as follows:
     </p>
     <p>
      Class Number One. — Shall be composed of all counties in which the assessed valuation equals and exceeds Twenty-five Million Dollars ($25,000,000.00).
     </p>
     <p>
      Class Number Two. — Shall be composed of all counties in which the assessed valuation equals and exceeds Twenty Million Dollars ($20,000,000.00) and is less than Twenty-five Million Dollars ($25,000,000.00).
     </p>
     <p>
      Class Number Three. — Shall be composed of all counties in which the assessed valuation equals and exceeds Fifteen Million Dollars ($15,000,000.00) and is less than Twenty Million Dollars ($20,000,000.00).
     </p>
     <p>
      Class Number Four. — Shall be composed of all counties in which the assessed valuation equals and exceeds Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000.00) and is less than Fifteen Million Dollars ($15,000,000.00).
     </p>
     <p>
      Class Number Five. — Shall be composed of all counties in which the assessed valuation equals and exceeds Eight Million Dollars ($8,000,000.00) and is less than Ten Million Dollars ($10,000.000.00).
     </p>
     <p>
      Class Number Six. — Shall be composed of all counties in which the assessed valuation equals and exceeds Six Million Dollars ($6,000,000.00) and is less than Eight Million Dollars ($8,000,000.00).
     </p>
     <p>
      Class Number Seven. — Shall be composed of all counties in which the assessed valuation equals and exceeds Three Million Dollars ($3,000,000.00) and is less than Six Million Dollars ($6,000,000.00).
     </p>
     <p>
      Class Number Eight. — Shall be composed of all counties in which the assessed valuation is less than Three Million Dollars ($3,000,000.00).
     </p>
     <p>
      The assessed value of each county shall be determined by the amounts certified to the State Tax Commission by the clerk of the board of supervisors, the assessed value of all public service corporations as certified by the State Tax Commission, and, in counties where oil or gas is produced, the actual value of such oil at the point of production as certified to the counties by the State Tax Commission under the provisions of Sections 27-25-501 through 27-25-525, and the actual value of such gas at the point of production as certified by the State Tax Commission under the provisions of Sections 27-25-701 through 27-25-723; provided, however, that the actual value of oil or gas at the point of production in counties where oil or gas is produced shall not be included in the assessed value of such county in determining the classification of such county in the fixing of fees to tax collectors under Section 25-7-21.
     </p>
     <p>
      In any year the assessed value of a county shows that its class has changed to a higher class, such county shall remain in its original class until the succeeding January first and then be classed according to such assessed value.
     </p>
     <p>
      Nothing in this section shall be construed to lower the classification of any county from its classification under the assessment of 1930.

       Laws of 1997, ch. 570, § 14, provides as follows:

      <p>
       “SECTION 14. This act shall take effect and be in force from and after the date it is effectuated under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, as amended and extended, or October 1, 1997, whichever occurs later.”
      </p>
      <p>
       The United States Attorney General, by letter dated September 5, 1997, interposed no objection, under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, to the amendment of this section by
   Laws of 1997, ch. 570, § 11.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 27-3-4 provides that the terms “'Mississippi State Tax Commission,' 'State Tax Commission,' 'Tax Commission' and 'commission' appearing in the laws of this state in connection with the performance of the duties and functions by the Mississippi State Tax Commission, the State Tax Commission or Tax Commission shall mean the Department of Revenue.”
      </p>
      <p>
       At the direction of the co-counsel for the Joint Legislative Committee on Compilation, Revision and Publication of Legislation, a typographical error in the “Class Number Three” paragraph was corrected by substituting “…assessed valuation equals and exceeds…” for “…assessed valuation equals and exceed…”

       Assuming that board of supervisors of county which was one of the fourth class in 1930 and had an assessed valuation of a county of the third class in 1942, made unauthorized and excessive allowance as to county auditor’s salary for the year 1942 in basing it on classification as a third class county, neither members of the board, nor their bondsmen, could be held personally liable for the reason that the allowance was to an object authorized by law.

       If county supervisors are entitled to increase in salary as result of increase in assessed valuation of oil and gas in county which has been reported by tax commission, supervisors may pass a resolution increasing their salaries and may collect amount of increase in salary beginning in January of calendar year following that in which total assessed valuation is determined. Ruffin, Oct. 12, 1992, A.G. Op. #92-0781.
      </p>
      <p>
       “Total assessed valuation” refers to total assessed value of county as shown on land rolls, personal property rolls, including assessment of automobiles, and assessed value of all properties in county which are assessed by state tax commission and certified to counties in addition to foregoing; “ad valorem assessment” refers to assessment of property which would be subject to taxation. Davis, Oct. 21, 1992, A.G. Op. #92-0761.
      </p>
      <p>
       Due to the language in this section which establishes supervisor salaries at “fixed” amounts, the Legislature must clarify the language in the section in order for salaries to be increased in phases over a period of years. Chaney, June 11, 2004, A.G. Op. 04-0237.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once the board of supervisors passes a resolution putting salaries established under Section 25-3-13 into effect, said salaries are thereafter “fixed” pursuant to statute. Roberts, Nov. 23, 2005, A.G. Op. 05-0555.

       Although the Commissioner of Public Safety is not entitled to supplemental compensation for any employment duties connected with his position, the duties of Commissioner of Public Safety do not include being a member of the Mississippi Ethics Commission, therefore any per diem the Commissioner would be entitled to as a member of the Ethics Commission can be accepted.

       Limitation provided in section 25-3-37 applies to compensation paid to State Treasurer for performing all public duties and responsibilities relating to office of State Treasurer and limitation was not intended to apply to compensation paid to public officers for performing duties and responsibilities of separate office not enumerated in sections 25-3-31 through 25-3-35, such as trustee of Public Employees’ Retirement System.

       While Sections 25-3-37 and 25-3-38 are no longer directly applicable to the state forester, those statutes set forth a sound public policy that must be adhered to, that is that Mississippi public officials whose salaries were previously set by former Section 25-3-33 should not be receiving supplemental compensation from private or federal funds regardless of the manner in which their salaries are set.

     </h3>
     <p>
      In case a public service commissioner shall fail to attend at any meeting or session of the public service commission appointed for the transaction of business, he shall be subject to a pro rata deduction from his salary; and the executive secretary of said commission or, in his absence, the commissioner or commissioners present shall certify to the auditor of public accounts the number of days such commissioner was absent at each meeting or session. The auditor shall deduct twice the number of days so certified from the time for which the salary of such commissioner may be estimated, unless such commissioner shall make and file an affidavit in the auditor’s office that his absence was occasioned by sickness of himself or a member of his family, or by the prevalence of an epidemic or a contagious disease, or by means not within his control.

      The Governor may grant leave of absence for a time not to exceed three (3) months in the year to any officer at a time when the duties of his office will admit of the absence without injury to the public service; but a judge, district attorney, and the attorney general shall not have a leave of absence which will interfere with his presence at any term of court at which he should be present. Nor shall a public service commissioner have a leave of absence which will interfere with his presence at any session or meeting of the public service commission.

      <p>
       A judge should order, pursuant to Section 25-3-69, each county to pay the bailiff's wages for the day or days that he serves in that county. Barlow, March 10, 1995, A.G. Op. #95-0054.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hospital trustees are entitled to receive a per diem of forty dollars authorized by Section 25-3-69 for no more than thirty-six meetings for any one calendar year. Thomas, September 27, 1995, A.G. Op. #95-0469.
      </p>
      <p>
       Based on Sections 25-7-27(e) and 19-19-7, a constable has a duty to attend both the criminal and civil cases in justice court in his district. However, a constable may be compensated with a per diem as provided under Section 25-3-69 when such constable serves as a bailiff in civil cases only. No similar provision exists that would provide compensation to the constable for serving as bailiff in a criminal case. Thompson, September 6, 1996, A.G. Op. #96-0606.
      </p>
      <p>
       A county board of supervisors may choose to compensate its census committee pursuant to the standard per diem rate authorized by the statute, but as there may be some overlap between the duties and responsibilities of the census committee and that of the election commission, careful records must be maintained by the two committees to avoid duplicative payments.
   Gore, August 14, 1998, A.G. Op. #98-0473.
      </p>
      <p>
       A commissioner who is entitled to receive per diem compensation under this section and who arrives at an airport authority commission meeting after the commissioners transact the business on the agenda but before they vote to adjourn the meeting is technically entitled to receive per diem compensation for that day.
   Yancey, August 13, 1999, A.G. Op. #99-0374.
      </p>
      <p>
       The statute permits the payment of per diem compensation to members of the Mississippi State Board of Medical Licensure for attending ad hoc committee meetings that are held at a time other than regular board meetings when such attendance is for the discharge of official duties of such members. Burnett, Dec. 3, 1999, A.G. Op. #99-0646.

      “Catastrophic injury or illness” means a life-threatening injury or illness of an employee or a member of an employee’s immediate family which totally incapacitates the employee from work, as verified by a licensed physician, and forces the employee to exhaust all leave time earned by that employee, resulting in the loss of compensation from the state for the employee. Conditions that are short-term in nature, including, but not limited to, common illnesses such as influenza and the measles, and common injuries, are not catastrophic. Chronic illnesses or injuries, such as cancer or major surgery, which result in intermittent absences from work and which are long-term in nature and require long recuperation periods may be considered catastrophic.

     <p>
      “Employee” means a person appointed to a position in the state service or nonstate service as defined in Section 25-9-107, for which he is compensated on a full-time permanent or provisional basis, a temporary basis, or a part-time basis. However, in order for an employee to be eligible to receive donated leave, the employee must meet the requirements provided in Section 25-3-95(8).

      <p>
       For purposes of determining creditable service and calculating average compensation for retirement benefits, leave accrued at rates in excess of that provided in Section 25-3-91 et seq. and the lump sum payment of personal leave in excess of thirty days would not be included. Artigues, November 8, 1996, A.G. Op. #96-0797.

       Although Miss. Code Sections 25-3-91 and 25-3-95, which permit state employees to donate a certain portion of their earned personal leave or major medical leave to another employee under some circumstances, do not apply to municipal employees, municipalities may adopt ordinances or resolutions providing for a similar program in a municipality in the absence of a state statute governing a similar municipal employee leave program. Stark, July 18, 1997, A.G. Op. #97-0361.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even when a state agency has a policy of granting administrative leave for court services or appearances, the agency may require an employee serving as a witness or juror or party litigant to take personal leave, compensatory leave, or leave without pay (where personal leave and compensatory leave have been exhausted) if the employee's court service or appearance is not verified by the clerk of the court.

Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t25c03s25-3-93ol12" target="_self">25-3-93(2)</a></cite> was not supported by substantial evidence; moreover, an employer provided no written policy relating to terminating employees who had been absent for more than one year.

       </p>
       <p>
        Part-time employees shall accrue major medical leave on a pro rata basis. There shall be no maximum limit to major medical leave accumulation. All unused major medical leave shall be counted as creditable service for the purposes of the retirement system as provided in Sections 25-11-103 and 25-13-5.

       <ol type="a">
        <li id="t25c03s25-3-95ol12a">
         Major medical leave may be used for the illness or injury of an employee or member of the employee’s immediate family as defined in subsection (3) of this section, only after the employee has used one (1) day of accrued personal or compensatory leave for each absence due to illness, or leave without pay if the employee has no accrued personal or compensatory leave; provided that faculty members employed by the eight (8) public universities on a nine-month basis may use major medical leave for the first day of absence due to illness. However, major medical leave may be used, without prior use of personal leave, to cover regularly scheduled visits to a doctor’s office or a hospital for the continuing treatment of a chronic disease, as certified in advance by a physician. For the purposes of this section, “physician” means a doctor of medicine, osteopathy, dental medicine, podiatry or chiropractic. For each absence due to illness of thirty-two (32) consecutive working hours (combined personal leave and major medical leave) major medical leave shall be authorized only when certified by their attending physician.

        <li id="t25c03s25-3-95ol12b">
         When an employee’s absence is due to a work-related injury for which the employee is receiving temporary disability benefits under Section 71-3-17(b) or 71-3-21, the injured employee shall not use accrued personal and/or medical leave and receive workers’ compensation benefits simultaneously if the combined receipt of both benefits results in the employee being paid, while absent due to the work-related injury, a total amount that exceeds one hundred percent (100%) of his wages earned in state employment at the time of injury. In such cases, the injured employee may use only as much of his accrued personal and/or medical leave as necessary, which may be fewer than eight (8) hours of accrued personal and/or major medical leave in a day, to constitute the difference between the amount of temporary disability workers’ compensation benefits received and one hundred percent (100%) of his wages earned at the time of injury in state employment. It is the intent of the Legislature that no state employee who is absent and disabled from work due to a work-related injury shall receive more than one hundred percent (100%) of his wages earned in state employment at the time of injury through the use of accrued personal and/or medical leave combined with temporary disability benefits under the Workers’ Compensation Law. The procedure for implementing this paragraph (b) shall be as directed by the applicable appointing authority. The receipt or payment of benefits in compliance with this paragraph (b) shall be considered the employee’s exclusive remedy against the employer in accordance with Section 71-3-9.

       An employee may use up to three (3) days of earned major medical leave for each occurrence of death in the immediate family requiring the employee’s absence from work. No qualifying time or use of personal leave will be required prior to use of major medical leave for this purpose. For the purpose of this subsection (3), the immediate family is defined as spouse, parent, stepparent, sibling, child, stepchild, grandchild, grandparent, son- or daughter-in-law, mother- or father-in-law or brother- or sister-in-law. Child means a biological, adopted or foster child, or a child for whom the individual stands or stood in loco parentis.

       Although Miss. Code Sections 25-3-91 and 25-3-95, which permit state employees to donate a certain portion of their earned personal leave or major medical leave to another employee under some circumstances, do not apply to municipal employees, municipalities may adopt ordinances or resolutions providing for a similar program in a municipality in the absence of a state statute governing a similar municipal employee leave program.

       An agent of the Bureau of Narcotics, though classified as an enforcement officer after training by the Mississippi Highway Safety Patrol, is not the equivalent of an officer of the Highway Patrol and, except for certain described individuals, is not an officer of the Highway Patrol and, unlike the latter, must use earned major medical leave or personal leave during the period of recovery from injury, wound or accident sustained in the line of duty.

       Provided a leave policy has been lawfully adopted, and if such policy tracks the language as found in the statute, the medical evidence required must be such as to support the employer's finding that the employee's physical or mental condition is such that the employee can no longer work in such a capacity for state government or its equivalent under the adopted policy; such evidence may include certification by a medical doctor of such in capacity.

       Pursuant to Section 25-3-93(4) and 25-3-97(5) if the district attorneys have adopted leave policies identical to the state and those policies authorize the transfer of accumulated leave from one district attorney's office to another, similar to a transfer between state agencies, then all such accumulated leave would be transferable. There would be no authority for the former employer to make a lump sum payment under these circumstances. Ranck, April 9, 1996, A.G. Op. #96-0170.

       An employee who transferred between community colleges prior to July 1, 1998, is not entitled to leave that accumulated at the first community college; further, the employee could not have transferred leave under the pre-1998 statutory language, which allowed transfer of accumulated leave between state agencies.

         The trustee is prohibited from disclosing to the filer any information concerning the replacement holdings except for information required under this subsection or the minimum tax information which lists only the totals of taxable items from the trust and does not describe the source of individual items of income.

     <p>
      The Legislature declares that elective and public office and employment is a public trust and any effort to realize personal gain through official conduct, other than as provided by law, or as a natural consequence of the employment or position, is a violation of that trust. Therefore, public servants shall endeavor to pursue a course of conduct which will not raise suspicion among the public that they are likely to be engaged in acts that are in violation of this trust and which will not reflect unfavorably upon the state and local governments.

       On August 5, 2008, the United States Attorney General interposed no objection under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to the amendment of this section by
   Laws of 2008, ch. 562, § 12.

      <p>
       <p>
   Section 2 of Chapter 482, Laws of 1984, proposed to amend
   §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t25c04s25-4-103" target="_self">25-4-103</a></cite>, effective from and after the date Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 548 of the 1984 Regular Session of the Mississippi Legislature (Chapter 655, Laws, 1984) was ratified by the electorate in November 1984. Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 548 (Chapter 655, Laws, 1984) proposed to amend § 109 of the Mississippi Constitution, and to repeal §§ 107 and 210 of the Mississippi Constitution. The Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 548 was submitted to the electorate for ratification in November 1984, but was rejected; thus the proposed amendment to
   §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t25c04s25-4-103" target="_self">25-4-103</a></cite> never became effective.

       As to whether it is conflict of interest for member of Legislature to own more than 10 percent of corporation which operates as subcontractor on sanitary water and sewer projects for counties, districts, cities, or towns within state, each separate subcontract would have to be analyzed to determine under what specific legal authority their prime contracts were let and how each would be funded. Should any of potential subcontract emanate from general legislation or from general legislative funding during legislator’s term or one year thereafter, there would be conflict violation. Whether legislator votes or does not vote is not controlling; Section 109 of Constitution prohibits interest in certain contracts, and voting on matter does not bring section into application, nor does refraining from voting prevent its application.

       Ethics in Government law may be violated should supervisor and his immediate family serve as teachers in same county. If supervisor or “relative”, meaning spouse, child, or parent, became teacher in city school system, no per se violation of ethics law would occur; city school system is separate authority from that of county. Should supervisor or “relative” become employed by county school system, where all of local funding portion or of salaries under teaching contract comes from mandatory local tax levies, again no violation would occur. Where portion of salary derived by public school teacher under teaching contract or that of a “relative” comes from discretionary local tax levies, such teaching contract would violate Section 109 of state Constitution and Code Section 24-4-105, subsection (2), while teacher is member of board of governing authority which makes such tax levies or within one year after term on governing board expires.

   Member of county board of supervisors simultaneously employed by county hospital of same county would have prohibited interest in contract authorized by the board of which he is a member. Provisions would be violated should described circumstances exist subsequent to start of new budget cycle, whereas prior to such start of budget cycle no violation would occur since employment in question had been authorized prior to the supervisor’s taking office. Same principles would apply to any new contracts authorized between hospital and board of supervisors or as to any such items requiring action on part of board, such as hospital’s budget, contracts which include payment to hospital for services or of interest to all employees of hospital, as their sustenance is in part derived from such contract. Only complete recusal on part of supervisor in all board deliberations and voting as to matters involving hospital, including appointment of its trustees, will avoid violation as to code subsection (1), but recusal removes only the vote, and not the prohibited interest subject to constitutional Section 109 and code §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t25c04s25-4-105ol12" target="_self">25-4-105(2)</a></cite>.

       Constitutional Section 109 and Code Section 25-4-105 subsections (2) and (3)(a) would not prohibit casino from contracting with bank depository where vice president and member of board of directors of bank depository served as commissioner of Port Authority. Authority’s lease with casino does not in and of itself create interest in lease on part of commissioner, merely because his bank holds contract with casino, where there is no evidence that bank would not contract with casino if casino had not held lease with commission. Also, commissioner does not have material financial interest in casino as he does not receive any income or benefit from it. Nevertheless, commissioner-banker should not vote on matters affecting casino since his bank could be indirectly affected which in turn could cause commissioner to violate subsection (1), thus commissioner ought to recuse self from casino matters coming before Authority.

       No violation exists where members of community hospital board of trustees and its administrative employees serve as members, board members or officers of non-profit corporation organized by hospital to provide patient health care services. As long as trustees and employees are compensated by hospital according to state law rather than non-profit corporation, they would have no prohibited interest in any contracts between hospital and non-private corporation nor any material financial interest in such non-profit corporation, and their interest in corporation would be to represent hospital’s interest and concerns. However, once partnership is formed, contracts between hospital and partnership would effectively preclude any hospital trustee, employee or agent from becoming investor, whether directly or indirectly, in partnership. Also, public servants of hospital would not be allowed to become employees of partnership or of any facility owned by partnership. Moreover, any doctor who is classified as independent contractor with hospital should analyze his or her contract prior to becoming associated with partnership to ensure that he or she is not public servant of hospital; nature and scope of each contract would determine whether given doctor is independent contractor or public servant.

   Member of county board of supervisors simultaneously employed by county hospital of same county would have prohibited interest in contract authorized by the board of which he is a member. Provisions would be violated should described circumstances exist subsequent to start of new budget cycle, whereas prior to such start of budget cycle no violation would occur since employment in question had been authorized prior to the supervisor’s taking office. Same principles would apply to any new contracts authorized between hospital and board of supervisors or as to any such items requiring action on part of board, such as hospital’s budget, contracts which include payment to hospital for services or of interest to all employees of hospital, as their sustenance is in part derived from such contract. Only complete recusal on part of supervisor in all board deliberations and voting as to matters involving hospital, including appointment of its trustees, will avoid violation as to code subsection (1), but recusal removes only the vote, and not the prohibited interest subject to constitutional Section 109 and code §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t25c04s25-4-105ol12" target="_self">25-4-105(2)</a></cite>.

     <p>
      If any public officer, state, district, county or municipal, shall be convicted or enter a plea of guilty or nolo contendere in any court of this state or any other state or in any federal court of any felony other than manslaughter or any violation of the United States Internal Revenue Code, of corruption in office or peculation therein, or of gambling or dealing in futures with money coming to his hands by virtue of his office, any court of this state, in addition to such other punishment as may be prescribed, shall adjudge the defendant removed from office; and the office of the defendant shall thereby become vacant. If any such officer be found by inquest to be of unsound mind during the term for which he was elected or appointed, or shall be removed from office by the judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction or otherwise lawfully, his office shall thereby be vacated; and in any such case the vacancy shall be filled as provided by law.
     </p>
     <p>
      When any such officer is found guilty of a crime which is a felony under the laws of this state or which is punishable by imprisonment for one (1) year or more, other than manslaughter or any violation of the United States Internal Revenue Code, in a federal court or a court of competent jurisdiction of any other state, the Attorney General of the State of Mississippi shall promptly enter a motion for removal from office in the Circuit Court of Hinds County in the case of a state officer, and in the circuit court of the county of residence in the case of a district, county or municipal officer. The court, or the judge in vacation, shall, upon notice and a proper hearing, issue an order removing such person from office and the vacancy shall be filled as provided by law.

       When the Attorney General sought an alderman’s removal based on a prior conviction, sufficient evidence showed the conviction because the alderman could not withdraw an admission to the conviction on the grounds statements of counsel were not evidence, as the alderman made the same statements as a witness.

      <p>
       Petitioner, having been removed from the office of supervisor of a county district upon his conviction of fraud in public office, lacked standing to interfere with a special election to fill the vacancy. Furthermore, petitioner forfeited all of his rights to the public office, regardless of what might transpire on appeal, and his right to such office for the remainder of the term to which he was elected was extinguished by reason of his conviction.

       The mere fact that a person who has been convicted may, by means of an appeal, ultimately succeed in establishing his innocence does not necessarily entitle him in the meantime to hold public office. Bucklew v. State, 192 So. 2d 275, 1966 Miss. LEXIS 1243 (Miss. 1966).

      Such certificate by the county registrar shall be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein and of the qualification of the electors whose signatures are thus certified. The Governor shall consider and count only those signatures on such petition as shall be so certified by the registrar; provided, however, that any officer sought to be removed or any citizen of the county shall have the privilege of submitting evidence in writing, under oath, to the Governor as to the question of whether or not any signator to the petition was in fact a qualified elector at the time of the signing of the petition, or has since died. The decision of the governor as to whether or not any particular person was or was not a qualified elector at the time of the signing of the petition, or whether or not any particular person has since died, shall be final and shall not be subject to review. The status of the signator as to whether or not he or she was a qualified elector at the time of signing the petition shall be determined as of the date of the petition and not by any other date.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The county registrar shall not retain in his possession any such petition or any section thereof for a longer period than two (2) days for the first two hundred (200) signatures thereon and one (1) additional day for each two hundred (200) additional signatures or fraction thereof, and the time consumed in the examination of such petitions shall not be counted in determining the time between the signing and the filing of the petitions. At the expiration of the examination, the registrar shall forthwith file the same with the governor, with his certificate attached, and shall obtain a written receipt for the same. The forms herein are not mandatory, but directory, and if substantially followed in any petition it shall be sufficient, disregarding clerical and technical errors. If the registrar be unable to examine the petition, he shall so certify the fact to the county election commissioners, who shall in the same manner and time perform all the functions herein required of the registrar. In the event the county registrar is the officer whose removal is sought by said petition, then said petition shall be delivered to one (1) of the county election commissioners of the county in which the petition has been circulated, and the county election commissioners of such county shall in the same manner and within the same time perform all functions herein required of the registrar. A fee of Five Cents (5¢) per signature shall be allowed for the aforesaid examination of said petitions, to be paid out of the general funds of the county upon due proof of said examination. Any registrar or any board of county election commissioners or member thereof who wilfully fails or refuses to perform the duty or duties herein required of him or them shall be subject to a civil penalty of One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00), to be recovered in the chancery court of the county by suit which may be filed by any qualified elector who signed said petition or any section thereof.

     <p>
      At the time and place designated in said notice, the Governor shall cause to be convened a removal council to be composed of three chancery judges appointed by the Governor, none of whom shall reside in the district in which the officer under question resides, to hear and determine whether there is substantial basis for a removal election consistently with the provisions of Sections 25-5-3 through 25-5-37. The senior chancellor shall serve as the presiding judge of the council. The hearing herein provided may continue from day to day and be recessed from time to time, as in the discretion of the council may be ordered. The qualified electors of the county shall likewise be given notice by proclamation of the Governor of the time and place of such hearing. Any interested citizen or citizens may likewise appear at said time and place and make such representations to the council as, in the discretion of the council, may be material to the issues involved. The council shall promulgate rules for such hearings, which shall be in writing, but all representations shall be made under oath, to be administered by some member of the council. It shall not be necessary that a stenographic record be kept of such representations, either for or against removal, but the testimony taken shall be heard as nearly as practicable in compliance with the usually applicable rules of evidence. All decisions of the council on any question, preliminary or final, including the question of whether just cause for an election has been shown, shall be final and not subject to review.
     </p>
     <p>
      The elective officer concerned shall be entitled to be represented by counsel of his choice at said hearing.

      The election commissioners of the county, or a quorum thereof, shall meet at the office of the county registrar at 9:00 A. M. of the day following the special removal election, and shall then proceed to canvass, tabulate, and certify the results of the election as now provided by the general election laws of the State of Mississippi. The certificate of said results, showing the total votes cast for the removal of the officer, the total votes cast against the removal of the officer, and the total number of qualified electors in the county or supervisors district in which said election was held, shall be forwarded to the Governor. If a majority of all qualified electors of said county or supervisors district in which said election shall have been held shall not have voted in said election, either for or against the removal, or if a majority of the qualified electors voting in the election shall oppose removal, the officer shall not be removed and shall not thereafter during his term of office be subject to another removal election. If a majority of all qualified electors of said county or supervisors district in which said election shall have been held have voted either for or against removal, and if a majority of the qualified electors voting in said election shall vote for the removal of the officer, then the Governor shall issue his proclamation declaring the office vacant, removing said officer, and appointing a suitable person to fill the vacancy until the same can be filled in a special election to be held not more than sixty (60) days after the aforesaid proclamation of the Governor. No officer shall be subject to a removal petition until he shall have served at least one (1) year of his term.

    Appeals.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      A person desiring to contest the proclaimed results of a special removal election may, within twenty (20) days after said proclamation, file a petition in the office of the clerk of the chancery court of the county, setting forth the grounds upon which the election is contested. The chancellor shall forthwith be notified in writing of the filing of such petition and shall forthwith fix a day, not less than ten (10) nor more than twenty (20) days distant, for hearing the contest. If the contest shall be filed by a citizen who voted in the removal election, process according to law for hearings in vacation shall be served on the officer sought to be removed. If the petition be filed by the officer sought to be removed, process in like manner and form shall be had on any one of the citizens shown to have circulated the removal petition or any section thereof. On the day fixed, at the county courthouse, beginning at 9:00 A. M. central standard time, some chancellor of a district other than that of the county of the contest, to be designated in writing by the chief justice of the Supreme Court, shall proceed to hear and determine the contest under the laws applicable to general elections. No question shall be considered or adjudicated by the chancellor on such appeal except that of whether the election was lawfully held in compliance with the general election laws of the State of Mississippi, and mere irregularities not affecting the final result shall not serve to invalidate the election. In those cases where the chancellor adjudicates that the election was not lawfully held within the requirements of the general election laws of the state, then, subject to the right of appeal herein prescribed, he shall fix the date of another election on the same question and shall direct the county election commissioners to proceed accordingly. Appeals from the decree of the chancery court may be taken to the Supreme Court, but such appeal shall be perfected within fifteen (15) days from the date of the decree sought to be appealed. The Supreme Court shall treat the same as a preference case to be determined with all reasonable expedition. Upon order of the chief justice, such appeals may be heard and determined at a time when the court otherwise would be in recess. Pending final determination of the contest, no appeal to the chancery court or to the Supreme Court shall supersede the proclaimed results of a special removal election.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The clerk of the Supreme Court shall make out a separate, detailed account of fees adjudged against the state, in cases where the state fails in the prosecution or suit or in case of felony where the defendant appeals on pauper oath and the costs cannot be made out of his estate, or against any county, and due him in civil or criminal cases, keeping the fees in each case separate, and shall present it to the attorney general, who shall examine the fee bill in each case and approve it if found to be correct. The fee bill thus approved shall be presented to the supreme court for allowance. If the court allow the same, it shall direct in criminal cases that it be paid out of the county treasury of the county where the prosecution was begun, on the order of the board of supervisors thereof; and in civil cases, that it be paid out of the state or county treasury, as the case may be. The board of supervisors shall allow said claim for fees against the county on presentation of a duly certified copy of the judgment of the supreme court ordering the same to be paid; and the auditor shall issue a warrant, on the order of the supreme court, for such costs against the state in civil cases to be paid by the state treasurer out of the proper appropriation.

       The 1950 Amendment establishing a fee for all officers, including Chancery clerks, of 25 cents per hundred words for furnishing transcripts of records, the phrase “all officers” expresses a legislative intent to make the provision applicable to all court clerks who perform the stated functions. Superior Oil Co. v. Foote, 216 Miss. 728, 65 So. 2d 453, 1953 Miss. LEXIS 687 (Miss. 1953).
      </p>
      <p>
       Supreme Court was required to accept construction of provision of Code 1880 governing fees, where construction was brought forward in subsequent Codes. Hooker v. Gully, 182 Miss. 36, 180 So. 65, 1938 Miss. LEXIS 140 (Miss. 1938).
      </p>
      <p>
       Supreme Court clerk in taxing costs on appeal can only allow to lower court clerk, who sent up record, fees based on number of words appearing in copies thereof made by him. Austin v. Von Seutter, 170 Miss. 467, 151 So. 563, 1934 Miss. LEXIS 87 (Miss. 1934).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancery court lacked power to make allowance to chancery clerk for services rendered, such power resting solely within discretion of supervisors. Tunica County v. Shannon, 160 Miss. 197, 132 So. 533, 1931 Miss. LEXIS 123 (Miss. 1931).

       <p>
   Trial court did not abuse its discretion when it ordered a former spouse to pay the statutorily authorized fee of two dollars per page for the transcript of records; though the only specific statute relating to making copies of final records and transcripts is
   Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t25c07s25-7-13ol16" target="_self">25-7-13(6)</a></cite> and generally relates to circuit clerks, the statute specifically provides that all other officers can similarly be charged, and therefore §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t25c07s25-7-13ol16" target="_self">25-7-13(6)</a></cite> was the appropriate statute for the chancery clerk to utilize in such matters rather than
   Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t25c07s25-7-9" target="_self">25-7-9</a></cite>, which permitted a chancery clerk to charge 50 cents when the clerk made “uncertified copies.”
   Cook v. Whiddon, 866 So. 2d 494, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 130 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancery court was without power to adjudicate the amount of fees to which chancery clerk was entitled to receive for services rendered in a B.A.W.I. bond issue where the fees for the clerk’s services had been allowed and paid by the board of supervisors in an amount erroneously fixed under repealed former subsection (t) of this section. McQuay, Inc. v. Hunter, 234 Miss. 84, 105 So. 2d 476, 1958 Miss. LEXIS 466 (Miss. 1958).
      </p>
      <p>
       Lower court clerk having acted on agreement of counsel that original exhibits should be certified to Supreme Court in lieu of transcript thereof after clerk had made copies of exhibits, though he was not required to act on such agreement, was not entitled to fees he would have earned by filing transcript of exhibits in Supreme Court. Austin v. Von Seutter, 170 Miss. 467, 151 So. 563, 1934 Miss. LEXIS 87 (Miss. 1934).
      </p>
      <p>
       Board of supervisors is authorized to provide an abstract of title to lands in the county and cause it to be kept up to date at all times, and in such case chancery clerk may charge abstract fees. Yazoo & M. V. R. Co. v. Edwards, 78 Miss. 950, 29 So. 770, 1901 Miss. LEXIS 140 (Miss. 1901).

       Chancery court clerks are entitled to receive fee of $30.00 for each day’s attendance on chancery court when chancellor is hearing cases in term time or vacation or hearing ex parte matters; clerks are not entitled to receive fee when chancellor does not hold court or transact business of court. Barlow, March 16, 1990, A.G. Op. #90-0169.
      </p>
      <p>
       Statute which allows chancery court clerks to charge set fees for “recording deeds, deeds of trust, wills, leases, amendments, subordinations, liens, orders, decrees, oaths, etc., including indexing,” does not encompass recording of minutes of Board of Supervisors; allowance which authorizes up to $1,500 annually for “other services as clerk of board of supervisors” encompasses those duties relating to maintenance of board minutes. Hallum, May 22, 1990, A.G. Op. #90-0308.
      </p>
      <p>
       Payment as set forth in statute is not contingent upon whether deputy is paid by county or paid by chancery clerk. Gex, August 29, 1990, A.G. Op. #90-0599.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was question of fact as to whether or not someone not physically present was “in attendance” upon court and statute does not mention physical presence; for such claims made upon board of supervisors, board would have to make factual determination that deputy or clerk was in attendance upon board. Yeager, Sept. 20, 1990, A.G. Op. #90-0701.
      </p>
      <p>
       Had legislature intended to authorize $2.00 per page fee for recording minutes, service so important and so commonly performed for boards of supervisors by chancery clerk’s office, such would have been stated specifically in (1)(f) and not placed in general “etc.” category. Brooks, Nov. 2, 1990, A.G. Op. #90-0742.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Family Master is sitting, rather than chancellor, Chancery Clerk may be authorized to be paid fees for himself and his deputies as if first chancellor were sitting; fee for each day’s attendance may not be reduced below $30.00, but it is up to chancellor to determine whether attendance is necessary. Adkins, July 22, 1992, A.G. Op. #92-0491.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fee paid under Section 25-7-9(2) covers general services in connection with case; that fee does not cover ancillary matters such as filing land records or certifications that arise from case and separate fees for such services under Section 25-7-9(1) should be charged. Jones Nov. 10, 1993, A.G. Op. #93-0514.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is $1.00 fee in addition to general $6.00 fee for sectional entries within one section or subdivision. If deed requires entry in two sections then $2.00 would be charged; if deed requires one entry or six in one section then charge is $1.00; same is true of subdivisions. Jones Nov. 10, 1993, A.G. Op. #93-0514.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under Section 25-7-9, a chancery clerk may not require the payment of a fee for the filing of a Motion to Set Aside Judgment in a case that has already been filed. Reeves, April 6, 1995, A.G. Op. #95-0125.
      </p>
      <p>
       Based on Section 25-7-9, a $30.00 court cost deposit is all that can be charged upon the filing of an uncontested divorce, unless the clerk makes a motion to the court for additional security and the court so orders. Sollie, August 14, 1995, A.G. Op.
   #95-0502.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 25-7-9(1)(b) does not apply to recording redemptions since Sections 25-7-21(4)(d) & (e) specifically provide fees for the recording and abstracting of redemptions from tax sales. The chancery clerk should not collect two fees for the performance of the same service. James, August 31, 1995, A.G. Op. #95-0459.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under Section 25-7-9(1)(f) the proper fee for filing additional pages for UCC filings is $1.00. Jones, June 14, 1996, A.G. Op. #96-0348.
      </p>
      <p>
       Assessments are not clerk’s fees and therefore are not included in Section 25-7-9. Springer, November 22, 1996, A.G. Op. #96-0804.

       A chancery clerk is no longer entitled to charge per page for the filing of a guardianship, even if the case was originally filed with the clerk’s office prior to the change in the fee schedule. See Section 25-7-9. Springer, December 13, 1996, A.G. Op. #96-0857.
      </p>
      <p>
       The $75 fee received by chancery clerks in lunacy cases covers all of the normal services that a court clerk would perform with regard to any petition or complaint before the court, but would not include administrative services which seem to be more like services that would be performed by a social worker, such as consultations with family or friends, scheduling physicians, providing insurance information to hospitals, and making arrangements for prescreening and follow-ups, etc.; thus, if the chancery court clerk performs such administrative services, the court may allow a reasonable fee therefor over and above the clerk’s statutory filing fee.
   Britt, November 25, 1998, A.G. Op. #98-0689.
      </p>
      <p>
       The chancery clerk may only charge the fee set out in subsection (1)(b) for each assignment filed, not for each document to which the assignment is applicable; thus, if there is only one assignment even though it may apply to multiple deeds of trust, only one document has been filed, and the filing fee is $6.00; for each document to which the assignment applies, and for which a marginal notation of the assignment must be made, the clerk may charge $0.50. McLeod, Mar. 29, 2002, A.G. Op. #02-0132.
      </p>
      <p>
       A chancery clerk is not required to charge other county departments. Crook, June 14, 2002, A.G. Op. #02-0304.
      </p>
      <p>
       The appellant must pay the appropriate filing fee to the chancery court to perfect an appeal from a decision of the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality, subject to a pauper’s right of appeal. Chisolm, July 10, 2002, A.G. Op. #02-0378.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no statutory authority for chancery clerks to charge flat monthly fees to abstractors for use of the fax machine in the office of the clerk or to charge fees for sending faxes to members of the public. Crook, Sept. 13, 2002, A.G. Op. #02-0334.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a board of supervisors failed to budget enough money to cover the number of meetings actually held and attended by a chancery clerk that he attends and should be paid for, the department should petition the board for any budget revision needed to fulfill the statutory mandates of this section. Crook, Jan. 17, 2003, A.G. Op. #02-0667.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the chancery judge orders an amount paid by the county for “public service not otherwise specifically provided for” and a board of supervisors has not budgeted any amount of the sum, this section allows, but does not require, a board of supervisors to make the payment. Crook, Jan. 17, 2003, A.G. Op. #02-0667.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no requirement in Section 9-5-131 et seq., which would require a chancery clerk to post foreclosure notices and execute an affidavit stating that the same was posted, nor is there such requirement or authority in Sections 25-7-9, 25-7-11, and 89-1-53 et. seq., however, pursuant to Sections 25-7-33 and 25-7-45, if a clerk chooses to post such notices, he may assess a fee of $ .25 for executing an affidavit stating that the same was posted. Gex, Mar. 14, 2003, A.G. Op. #03-0112.

      <p>
       This section, prior to the 2004 amendment, authorized the charging of a $ 1.00 fee for each sectional index entry per section or subdivision necessary to properly reflect the recording of the warranty deed, deed of trust and subordination affecting all of the lots in question. O’Donnell, Feb. 4, 2005, A.G. Op. 04-0638.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 25-7-9
   must be read along with Uniform Chancery Court Rule 9.01. Reeves, Apr. 21, 2006, A.G. Op. 06-0129.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the plaintiff files a complaint against the defendant, and the defendant files an answer containing one or more counterclaims, there is no basis to charge the $25.00 fee. But when one of the defendants of the original cause of action files a complaint against another of the original defendants, then the clerk may charge the original defendant filing this new complaint with a co-defendant in the original cause of action the $25.00 fee. Likewise, where one of the plaintiffs in the original cause of action files a complaint against another of the original plaintiffs,
   then the Clerk may charge the original plaintiffs filing this new complaint against a co-plaintiff in the original cause of action the $25.00 fee. Reeves, Apr. 21, 2006, A.G. Op. 06-0129.

       In a consolidation action where the plaintiffs paid a total of $67,450.00 in filing fees to the circuit clerk, the plaintiffs were entitled to a refund of all filing fees and administrative costs in excess of the statutorily established amounts.

   Trial court did not abuse its discretion when it ordered a former spouse to pay the statutorily authorized fee of two dollars per page for the transcript of records; though the only specific statute relating to making copies of final records and transcripts is
   Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t25c07s25-7-13ol16" target="_self">25-7-13(6)</a></cite> and generally relates to circuit clerks, the statute specifically provides that all other officers can similarly be charged, and therefore §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t25c07s25-7-13ol16" target="_self">25-7-13(6)</a></cite> was the appropriate statute for the chancery clerk to utilize in such matters rather than
   Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t25c07s25-7-9" target="_self">25-7-9</a></cite>, which permitted a chancery clerk to charge 50 cents when the clerk made “uncertified copies.”

   Although a county circuit court clerk had no authority under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t25c07s25-7-13" target="_self">25-7-13</a></cite> to require a $100 filing fee for an appeal from the municipal court, the fee could be recast as the bond required by URCCC 12.02(B); however, it was nevertheless improper for the circuit clerk to set $100 as the unchanging estimate of court costs and it was improper for payment to be demanded in cash. Mitchell v. Parker, 2001 Miss. App. LEXIS 161 (Miss. Ct. App. Apr. 24, 2001), op. withdrawn, sub. op., 804 So. 2d 1066, 2001 Miss. App. LEXIS 369 (Miss. Ct. App. 2001).

   The fee schedule in §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t25c07s25-7-13" target="_self">25-7-13</a></cite> applies to actions in eminent domain, and funds handled by the clerk in such actions are monies subject to the commission as authorized under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t25c07s25-7-13" target="_self">25-7-13</a></cite>(5). Pursuant to this section, the commission awarded to the clerk may not exceed 1/2 of one percent; however, the amount of the commission is to be determined by the court. In fixing the clerk’s commission, the court should exercise its discretion in light of the responsibility assumed and services rendered by the clerk. The commission paid to the clerk should be paid by the condemning authority since assessment of a fee or commission may not be used to diminish the compensation received by the landowner.

       The 1950 Amendment establishing a fee for all officers, including Chancery clerks, of 25 cents per hundred words for furnishing transcripts of records, the phrase “all officers” expresses a legislative intent to make the provision applicable to all court clerks who perform the stated functions.

      <p>
       County court clerk, who by law is the same person as the circuit court clerk, and who, as circuit clerk, received an allowance for public service not particularly provided for under subsection (c) of this section, was not entitled to an additional allowance, as county clerk, for public service not particularly provided for, since by statute the compensation of the county clerk is expressly confined to the fees allowed by law for like duties in the circuit and chancery courts, which means that the county clerk must look to the fixed schedule of the fees specifically allowed by law for services in the circuit and chancery courts, and there is no authority to make allowance to the county clerk as such for public service not particularly provided for.

       Minutes of courts are undoubtedly final records required by law, and Attorney General’s office is therefore unable to say that statute does not allow circuit clerks up to $2.00/page for preparation and recording of minutes of courts. Parker, March 6, 1990, A.G. Op. #90-0092.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether the attendance of a deputy is necessary is a question of fact for the judge to determine; if the judge believes the attendance of a deputy or deputies was necessary on any particular day then the court should allow the additional fees for attendance by the deputy or deputies. Thomas, Nov. 6, 1991, A.G. Op. #91-0765.
      </p>
      <p>
       A deputy who substitutes for a clerk, when the clerk is supposed to attend, is necessary. If the business of the court requires the clerk and one or more deputies then the deputies are necessary. Thomas, Nov. 6, 1991, A.G. Op. #91-0765.
      </p>
      <p>
       If so ordered by the court, an outgoing circuit clerk may be entitled to his commission on fees for work performed during his term, even though the case may not be concluded until after his term has ended. Ferguson, June 24, 1992, A.G. Op. #92-0447.

      <p>
       Circuit clerk’s fee for taking pauper affidavits in criminal cases is not under Section 25-7-13(1) but rather compensation is provided for under subsection (2)(k) which allows per annum amount of $5,000. Ferguson, March 9, 1994, A.G. Op. #93-1016.
      </p>
      <p>
       Based on Section 25-7-13, the clerk would not be entitled to additional fees for more than one writ, capias or subpoena associated with a single case. Pryor, April 12, 1996, A.G. Op. #96-0185.
      </p>
      <p>
       Applying Section 25-7-13(1)(a) a clerk would not be entitled to collect a docketing fee when a case is remanded to the file and later reinstated or when a case is removed to Federal Court and later returned to the court since the clerk would have already collected a fee for the original complaint. Carpenter, November 1, 1996, A.G. Op. #96-0743.
      </p>
      <p>
       Applying Section 25-7-13(1)(a) a clerk is entitled to collect a docketing fee for a case that has been transferred from another court or when a case is received on a change of venue since the clerk would be performing a service for the first time with regard to that complaint. Carpenter, November 1, 1996, A.G. Op. #96-0743.
      </p>
      <p>
       A clerk is limited to the fee provided for under subsection (1) of this section, and to additional fees provided for under subsection (2) that are not included in subsection (1). Services charged for under paragraphs 2(a) to 2(c) are provided for in subsection (1) as “service performed by the clerk with respect to each complaint, petition or indictment”. Bryant, Aug. 22, 1997, A.G. Op. #97-0487.
      </p>
      <p>
       A circuit clerk may be entitled to a commission to be determined by the court of up to one-half of one percent on eminent domain cases. Parker, February 4, 1998, A.G. Op. #97-0775.
      </p>
      <p>
       A circuit court judge may exercise his discretion to allow the circuit clerk to retain up to 1/2 of 1 percent of fines that are paid through the circuit clerk’s office.
   Johnson, February 26, 1999, A.G. Op. #99-0061.
      </p>
      <p>
       The phrase “attending to the court,” for purposes of subsection (2)(m), includes working on the court’s business in the clerk’s office, as well as actually being inside the courtroom or the judges’ chambers. Evans, Jan. 25, 2002, A.G. Op. #02-0023.
      </p>
      <p>
       A county circuit clerk is entitled to be paid once for himself or a deputy for each day of the term then in session and the court may authorize additional deputies for the term then in session, and the court may allow up to five additional days for the clerk and deputies when the court is not in session to get up records. Osborne, Mar. 1, 2002, A.G. Op. #02-0045.

       Similar previous statute (Laws 1928, chap. 87), providing for a graduated schedule of fees for collection of ad valorem taxes and changing the collection period from one based on a fiscal year to that based on the calendar year, so that a sheriff taking office at the beginning of the calendar year would be entitled to the higher percentage of commissions notwithstanding that his predecessor had also received the higher percentage of commissions on the same year’s taxes, was unconstitutional in so far as its operation was retroactive.

       Statute providing for fees of sheriff does not limit compensation of commissioners making sales to a percentum of actual money paid into sheriff’s hands, but to the amount realized under the sale. Powell v. Davis, 119 Miss. 175, 80 So. 556, 1918 Miss. LEXIS 27 (Miss. 1918).
      </p>

       Sheriffs who deliver to road overseer a copy of their appointment are not entitled to fees for entering and returning such copies, since a copy of appointment is not a “writ” within the meaning of the statute.

       In county of more than thirty-three thousand inhabitants not having two judicial districts, this section, and not § 3952, Code 1942, is statute applicable to sheriff’s fees for summoning jurors in circuit court and for other services rendered and not otherwise provided for in connection with said court, and sheriff is entitled to maximum of $300.00 per year for such services. Forrest County v. Thompson, 204 Miss. 628, 37 So. 2d 787, 1948 Miss. LEXIS 395 (Miss. 1948).
      </p>
      <p>
       Sheriff is not entitled to collect additional fees in the amount of $300 annually for executing judgments and decrees of circuit court as statute includes additional fees for this service only in supreme court, chancery court, and board of supervisors, the only allowance for additional fees to sheriff under subsection b of this section for service in circuit court being for summoning juries, impanelling grand juries, and for other services not otherwise provided for. Forrest County v. Thompson, 204 Miss. 628, 37 So. 2d 787, 1948 Miss. LEXIS 395 (Miss. 1948).
      </p>
      <p>
       Ex-sheriff is entitled to recover additional compensation for services rendered to board of supervisors during his term of office when population of county is greater than that on basis of which compensation had been allowed, and allowances previously made for these services are not res judicata of claim for additional allowances.

       Ex-sheriff’s claim for additional fees for summoning jurors in circuit court and for other services rendered and not otherwise provided for in connection with said court during year 1940 is barred by six-year statute of limitations when his declaration is filed on August 18, 1947.

      </p>
      <p>
       In absence of cross-appeal and appellee’s declaration failing to demand full amount sheriff could have successfully sued for as fees for serving overseers’ commissions, Supreme Court cannot increase judgment, but will affirm judgment recovered. Forrest County v. Thompson, 204 Miss. 628, 37 So. 2d 787, 1948 Miss. LEXIS 395 (Miss. 1948).
      </p>

       Allowances under this section to former sheriff for attendance on sessions of the circuit court and board of supervisors were not res judicata to claim of sheriff, after expiration of his office, to be paid additional allowances under Code 1942, § 3952, where population of the county was in excess of 32,000.

       As regards allowances to sheriff by board of supervisors for gasoline and oil, set up as a setoff to former sheriff’s claim to additional allowances for services rendered, four of the judges of the supreme court were of the opinion that the allowances for gas and oil were illegal and should not have been made but three of them were of the opinion that having been allowed and paid him, he could not be charged back therewith.

       When state agency seeks to have process served sheriff should serve all process and perform other services for state agency without prepayment of costs; state agency is exempted from prepayment of costs, but not from payment if court assesses costs against agency at conclusion of case. Lambert Sept. 1, 1993, A.G. Op. #93-0561.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fee set forth in Section 25-7-19(1)(d) of $25.00 is fee to be paid to sheriff for approving bond; if sheriff approves bond, sheriff is entitled to fee; if person other than sheriff, i.e., municipal police officer, approves bond, sheriff is not entitled to fee.

       Generally, justice court should direct process service to constable; however, when process is required to be directed to sheriff because constable is unqualified or unavailable, sheriff should charge fees as prescribed by 25-7-19 for “papers” to be served issued by justice court. Glennis, Jan. 20, 1994, A.G. Op. #93-0785.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once sheriff brings to attention of court that criminal fee is owed to county, this being done by making return on process, sheriff would not be liable under Subsection (3) of Section 25-7-19; sheriff must keep prisoner under terms set out in order of commitment issued by court and can not require that prisoner serve additional time or work additional days in order to pay off court cost and jail fees not included in the court’s order of commitment. Price, March 31, 1994, A.G. Op. #93-0795.
      </p>
      <p>
       The officer conducting the sale, under Section 25-7-19(1)(f), does hold out of the proceeds the fees and costs of the sale. The remaining proceeds, unless contested or when liability is in doubt, are applied to judgment liens in order of priority until satisfied. Any overage is returned to the judgment debtor. The return made to the court sets out the property levied on, proceeds of the sale and application of the proceeds and requests the court to award any costs and fees not set by law. Hooks, April 5, 1996, A.G. Op. #96-0163.
      </p>
      <p>
       The sheriff’s commission is computed on all money made by virtue of the execution and sale as provided by Section 25-7-19(1)(f), however Section 27-41-107 states that the minimum total of all fees shall be ten dollars. Hollimon, July 12, 1996, A.G. Op. #96-0400.
      </p>
      <p>
       The $25.00 service of process fee is a statutorily imposed court cost only if the process is served by certain law enforcement officials; there are no provisions for a private citizen (off-duty law enforcement officer) to serve a criminal warrant or to be paid for such service.
   Carter, Dec. 17, 1999, A.G. Op. #99-0668.

       A board of supervisors could adopt a resolution for the county sheriff’s department to charge a fee for performing criminal background checks, fingerprinting, etc., and the funds generated thereby should be paid into the general fund on a monthly basis.

       Unless it is unavoidable and clearly manifested, court must not impute inadvertence to the legislature in enacting this section, especially where such inadvertence would have to be inferred in the face of repeated enactment of this section.

       Similar previous statute (Laws 1928, chap. 87), providing for a graduated schedule of fees for collection of ad valorem taxes and changing the collection period from one based on a fiscal year to that based on the calendar year, so that a sheriff taking office at the beginning of the calendar year would be entitled to the higher percentage of commissions notwithstanding that his predecessor had also received the higher percentage of commissions on the same year’s taxes, was unconstitutional in so far as its operation was retroactive.

       The proviso in the Act of 1944, ch. 179, increasing the fees to tax collectors in respect to ad valorem taxes, that “nothing herein shall permit a tax collector to collect such excess commission (over one per cent) more than once during any year beginning on the date aforesaid (the first Monday in January),” expresses both a limitation and a privilege, and such privilege is not to be diminished by reviving the provisions of the pre-existing act. § 3938, Code 1942, so as to create an inconsistency. Brame v. Wyatt, 197 Miss. 679, 20 So. 2d 667, 1945 Miss. LEXIS 321 (Miss. 1945).

       It will be assumed that the expressed views of the attorney general, as embodied in his opinion construing the effect of a similar amendment to that amending statute fixing fees of tax collector (construing the effect of the 1938 Act upon the prior Act of 1932), were known to the Legislature, and that such views were consulted in the drafting of legislation of so great importance to the state. Brame v. Wyatt, 197 Miss. 679, 20 So. 2d 667, 1945 Miss. LEXIS 321 (Miss. 1945).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where ad valorem tax collections during the first three months of 1944 were $38,126.91 to which sum the collector applied the fee schedule then applicable under Code 1942, § 3936, of five per cent on the first $10,000 and two per cent on the next $30,000, and during the month of April, 1944, the collector collected $1,366.49, upon which he deducted fees of five per cent pursuant to the fee schedule of Laws, 1944, ch. 179, which as an amendment of Code 1942, § 3936 became effective April 1, 1944, tax collector was entitled to continue the application of five per cent to collections thereafter not exceeding an additional $15,000. Brame v. Wyatt, 197 Miss. 679, 20 So. 2d 667, 1945 Miss. LEXIS 321 (Miss. 1945).
      </p>
      <p>
       Purpose of Laws, 1944, ch. 179, was to provide increased compensation to tax collectors, and, in effecting this purpose, it sought to amend the existing law so as to increase the existing basis and to make it presently effective. Brame v. Wyatt, 197 Miss. 679, 20 So. 2d 667, 1945 Miss. LEXIS 321 (Miss. 1945).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Act of 1944, increasing compensation to tax collectors, must be construed prospectively, since to increase compensation for services theretofore performed would violate § 96 of the Constitution. Brame v. Wyatt, 197 Miss. 679, 20 So. 2d 667, 1945 Miss. LEXIS 321 (Miss. 1945).

       Similar previous statute (Laws 1928, chap. 87) had no application to the question of liability of the county for commissions at 5 per cent for the collection of poll taxes and commutation road taxes by the sheriff as tax collector, since the schedule of fees was fixed by chapter 206, of the Laws of 1924 and in force at the time of the collection, and such schedule was in no manner changed by this statute in so far as the percentage due for the collection of poll taxes and commutation taxes was concerned.

       Inadvertence cannot be ascribed to the Legislature in retaining provision allowing tax collector $1 for each conveyance of land sold to individuals for taxes, in amending Code 1942, § 3936(D) by Laws, 1944, ch. 179, § 1(D), subsection (d), in view of the fact that Code 1942, §§ 3936 and 9958 were enacted together in the Codes of 1930 and 1942, especially in view of the fact that § 9936 of 1942 Code re-enacted § 3256, Code of 1930, and enlarged rather than diminished the effect of lists of lands sold for taxes by providing that it should have the same effect of notice as a deed filed for record. Seward v. Dogan, 198 Miss. 419, 21 So. 2d 292, 1945 Miss. LEXIS 212 (Miss. 1945).
      </p>
      <p>
       Fact that, although the legislature, in revamping the system from tax sales, has made many substantial and material alterations and readjustments, including changes in respect to procedure and compensation for sheriffs and tax collectors, and provision allowing fee of § 1 to tax collector for each conveyance to individual purchasers of lands at tax sales has been retained, indicates intention on part of the legislature to leave untouched this compensation to the tax collector for equal labor, tending to the same effect, although involved in different form. Seward v. Dogan, 198 Miss. 419, 21 So. 2d 292, 1945 Miss. LEXIS 212 (Miss. 1945).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section, allowing tax collector fee of $1 for each conveyance of land sold to individuals for taxes, was not impliedly repealed by § 3273, Code 1930 (§ 9958, Code 1942), directing chancery clerk to execute deeds of conveyance to individuals purchasing lands at tax sales, in view of the fact that both sections were readopted in the 1942 Code, and especially in view of the fact that the provision pertaining to the tax collector’s fee was re-enacted by Laws, 1944, ch. 179, § 1(D), subsection (d).

       Under statutes pertaining to tax collector’s list of tax sales and requiring tax collector to deliver receipt to purchaser, a definite right or interest in the land sold at the tax sale is conveyed by the tax collector, which, when he performs his duty, constitutes a “conveyance” within the purview of Code 1942, § 3936(D), as amended by Laws, 1944, ch. 179, § 1(D), subsection (d), allowing tax collector fee of $1 for each conveyance of land sold to individuals for taxes.

       Statute providing that State Auditor should issue warrants for fees of county officers in connection with lands sold to State for taxes after receiving land commissioner’s calculations as to fees, if auditor should find fees correct, conferred upon auditor exercise of discretion and judgment in passing on fees, so that sheriff as tax collector seeking payment of fees growing out of the sale of delinquent tax lands to the state was not entitled to mandamus to compel auditor to issue warrants for such fees without first bringing suit.

       Under statute providing that State Auditor should issue warrants for fees of county officers in connection with lands sold to state for taxes if auditor found fees as calculated by land commissioner correct, “correct” referred to both facts and law, and auditor was required to refuse to issue warrants both if calculation was wrong and if calculation was correct but claim was unauthorized by law.

       In declining to follow Melikian v. Avent (ND Miss. 1969) 300 F Supp 516, the reviewing court held that the civil side of the Mississippi fee system did not comport with due process, in light of the record which supported the inference that creditors would file more frequently in the courts of the judges who tended to favor the plaintiffs, and where there was testimony to this effect, and further testimony to the effect that judges knew and understood this to be the case, and where the undisputed evidence showed that cases were unevenly distributed throughout the judges in the various counties.

      <p>
       Mississippi criminal statutory fees systems for compensating justices of the peace in Hinds and DeSoto Counties are violative of defendant’s due process rights to trial before impartial tribunal under the Tumey-Ward test, where the possibility existed that judges in the aforementioned counties would compete for business by currying favor with arresting officers or taking biased actions to increase their case load, and where a judge might minimize the burden of proof required to convict the defendant or might be less than diligent in protecting the defendant’s constitutional rights.

       Fee for transporting prisoner from point of arrest to jail is fee that is paid by county where state fails in prosecution or person is unable to pay cost, and is paid in addition to state fail fee. Redden, March 28, 1990, A.G. Op. #90-0200.
      </p>
      <p>
       $15.00 fee represents total compensation allowed constable for both his original service and his subsequent contempt process service; in event constable was not involved in original criminal trial, service of contempt process would generate fee of $15.00; however, in no event would constable be entitled to receive additional $10.00 fee for serving contempt process, as this fee represents additional compensation constable receives for serving executions, attachments and garnishments. Bridges, June 13, 1990, A.G. Op. #90-0394.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because a constable is not involved in service of process on nonresident defendants by certified mail, a fee may not be charged by him for such service. Lamar, Jan. 8, 1992, A.G. Op. #91-0963.
      </p>
      <p>
       Constable is entitled to fee allowed for service of writs of replevin and warrants of removal. Shuffield, July 22, 1992, A.G. Op. #92-0500.
      </p>
      <p>
       Miss. Code Section 25-7-27 provides for fees to be collected by constables; if constable has not completed required training, justice court clerk should not collect constable fee; however, even though constable who has not completed his training may not receive fees for serving justice court process, he must still faithfully serve and return any assigned papers. Aldridge, Feb. 3, 1993, A.G. Op. #93-0001.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although duly elected constable may not receive compensation for service of process in Justice Courts other than fee provided for in statute, with respect to other courts, under Rule 4 of MRCP, constable, like any other individual above age of 18 who is not party to lawsuit, may receive compensation for service of process as private process server. Walters, August 11, 1993, A.G. Op. #93-0483.
      </p>

       A Justice Court Judge cannot by court order increase the fee a Constable can receive for service process. Younger, January 11, 1995, A.G. Op. #95-0003.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a constable has been in office more than twenty-four months, as provided in Section 45-6-11, the statute would preclude a county from compensating a constable for fees generated under Section 25-7-27(1)(e), for serving warrants and other process, attending all trials in state cases in which the state fails in the prosecution, prior to satisfying the training requirement of Section 19-19-5(2), as amended. Carroll, February 16, 1995, A.G. Op. #95-0072.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 25-7-27(3) provides that constables shall be paid all uncollected fees from the first proceeds received by the court from the guilty party or from any other source of payment in connection with the case. Farmer, June 22, 1995, A.G. Op. #95-0367.
      </p>

       Under Section 25-7-27(1)(a), only one fee can be collected by a constable for all process served in each one case. Shuffield, June 22, 1995, A.G. Op. #95-0361.
      </p>
      <p>
       In regards to serving warrants for contempt of court, when a constable has already been paid a fee for services as allowed by Section 25-7-27(1)(a), for the underlying case, that constable would not be entitled to an additional fee for service of a contempt warrant. Funchess, June 22, 1995, A.G. Op. #95-0356.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a constable has no participation in the initial court action, but then serves a contempt warrant, he would be entitled to a fee pursuant to Section 25-7-27(1)(a). Funchess, June 22, 1995, A.G. Op. #95-0356.
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
       Under Section 25-7-27(1)(c) a constable is entitled to receive $.20 a mile for transporting a prisoner from the point he takes custody to the point of incarceration. This mileage fee is considered court costs and should be paid by the defendant upon conviction. West, April 12, 1996, A.G. Op. #96-0203.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under Section 25-7-27, a constable is not entitled to receive an additional fee for arresting a subject on a contempt warrant if the constable is the officer that arrested the subject for the simple assault. Humphrey, July 19, 1996, A.G. Op. #96-0477.
      </p>
      <p>
       Based on Sections 25-7-27(1)(e) and 19-19-7, a constable has a duty to attend both the criminal and civil cases in justice court in his district. However, a constable may be compensated with a per diem as provided under Section 25-3-69 when such constable serves as a bailiff in civil cases only. No similar provision exists that would provide compensation to the constable for serving as bailiff in a criminal case. Thompson, September 6, 1996, A.G. Op. #96-0606.
      </p>
      <p>
       Based on Section 25-7-27, a constable is entitled to one fee for all process served in one case. If a constable serves warrants from three different cases, he is entitled to three separate fees. However, a constable is not entitled to an additional fee for serving a contempt warrant for failure to appear if he also served the warrant in the underlying case in which the defendant failed to appear. Humphrey, November 8, 1996, A.G. Op. #96-0762.
      </p>
      <p>
       Constables may serve as bailiffs in civil cases in districts where they are not elected and receive compensation for such services. Humphrey, July 25, 1997, A.G. Op. #97-0427.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where defendant is convicted in multiple cases, is allowed to pay fees over time, and the court order is silent concerning the matter, the defendant may specify how the fees should be credited, or, in the absence of such a specification, the clerk may use discretion in determining how the fees should be credited. Humphrey, July 25, 1997, A.G. Op. #97-0427.

       Constables are entitled to receive service of process fees only if process is actually served, and are not entitled to such fees when unsuccessful attempts are made to serve the defendant, and the defendant’s girlfriend subsequently comes to court and pays the necessary fine. Humphrey, Aug. 15, 1997, A.G. Op. #97-0501.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (1)(f) applies only to criminal cases in which the prosecution fails to secure a conviction; however, whether any amount is paid under the section is purely discretionary with the board.
   Carter, September 4, 1998, A.G. Op. #98-0536.

      <p>
       The clerk of the court collects the $25.00 fee for services in connection with the issuance of a peace bond as allowed by the statute; the clerk also collects $25.00 in order to pay a constable for service of the warrant as allowed by the statute, although the constable’s fee is collected only after the court has conducted a hearing on the matter and determined, consistent with fact, that grounds exist for the issuance of a warrant.
   Vaughn, September 25, 1998, A.G. Op. #98-0588.
      </p>
      <p>
       A written order from the court would be sufficient to appoint an individual to serve as justice court bailiff; however, there is no statute that would require the county board of supervisors to pay the individual who is serving as bailiff unless that person is a constable.
   Aldridge, December 18, 1998, A.G. Op. #98-0738.
      </p>
      <p>
       A constable is not entitled to a fee for a diligent attempt to serve process if the constable is unable to serve the process even where the information provided to the constable is erroneous; if the plaintiff provides additional correct information for the process to be served and the constable successfully serves the process, an additional $15.00 should be collected from the plaintiff for the service of the process; the constable would then be entitled to $40.00 ($25.00 original fee plus $15.00 additional fee) for service of the process.
   Aldridge, May 26, 2000, A.G. Op. #2000-0219.
      </p>
      <p>
       A constable may claim mileage for the actual mileage incurred when transporting a prisoner to the jail; the only mileage that may be claimed by the constable is the distance from the location of the arrest to the jail when the constable actually transports the prisoner to the jail, and a constable may not claim mileage if he “field releases” a prisoner and does not convey that prisoner to jail. Shirley, Apr. 13, 2001, A.G. Op. #01-0143.
      </p>
      <p>
       A constable is not entitled to collect a fee unless the process is actually served; therefore, if a constable tries to serve a summons for unpaid taxes on a mobile home but the mobile home or trailer has been moved and the process cannot be served, the constable has not earned a fee. Young, Sept. 13, 2002, A.G. Op. #02-0531.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a civil plaintiff supplies an address for a defendant that turns out to be incorrect, and the constable returns the process marked “not found” or “wrong address”, the constable has not earned a fee. Young, Sept. 13, 2002, A.G. Op. #02-0531.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 1999 amendment to subsection (1)(a) of this section supplements MS AG Op., Hairston (March 24, 1987) and MS AG Op., Gex (July 16, 1992) to provide that a constable may earn an additional $ 15.00 when a plaintiff provides erroneous information for service of process and the constable makes a diligent search but is unable to serve the process at the original address provided, but actually does serve the process at a correct address that is later provided by the plaintiff; the service of process fees (the original $ 25.00 fee plus the additional $ 15.00 fee) should only be paid to the constable upon a successful service of process by the constable. Young, Sept. 13, 2002, A.G. Op. #02-0531.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a justice court judge issues a warrant to the county to pay a constable for service as a bailiff as provided for by Section 25-7-27(1)(e), the county is obligated to pay it. Erby, Nov. 1, 2002, A.G. Op. #02-0635.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a justice court judge issues a warrant to the county to pay a constable for service as a bailiff as provided by subdivision (1)(e) of this section, the county is obligated to pay it. Erby, May 7, 2004, A.G. Op. 04-0169.
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   This section allows a constable to be paid by the county for serving as a bailiff in civil cases if the judge issues a pay warrant for such service. The judge should issue the warrant for the county to pay the constable for service as a bailiff. The warrant should be presented to the county to be put on the claims docket to be approved by the board of supervisors. The per diem set forth in §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t25c03s25-3-69" target="_self">25-3-69</a></cite> is $ 40.00. Busby, July 23, 2004, A.G. Op. 04-0316.
      </p>
      <p>
       If multiple charges in an arrest warrant are treated as one case, then the constable would be entitled to one fee for the execution thereof.. However, if the charges are treated as separate cases, then the constable would be entitled to a separate fee for each case even if he only served one warrant. Busby, July 23, 2004, A.G. Op. 04-0316.
      </p>
      <p>
       A constable is entitled to his fees from the first proceeds received by the court on each case. If the court applies the payments to one case until it is fully paid prior to crediting payments toward
   the second case, the constable would not be entitled to receive his fee on the second case until all fees have been collected on the first case. However, a court has the authority to apply the payments received from the defendant toward both cases in equal amounts. In such a case, the constable would be entitled to receive his fees for both cases first. Busby, July 23, 2004, A.G. Op. 04-0316.
      </p>
      <p>
       A constable is entitled to his fee if he serves process in a civil case filed by the county to collect a delinquent payment even if the defendant is unable to pay the delinquent bill. Busby, July 23, 2004, A.G. Op. 04-0316.
      </p>
      <p>
       A constable is not entitled to receive an additional fee for arresting a subject on a contempt warrant if the constable is the officer that arrested the subject for the underlying offense. Busby, July 23, 2004, A.G. Op. 04-0316.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no provision that allows a constable to collect expenses associated with returning a defendant to jail after the constable previously arrested the defendant and released him on a recognizance bond. Busby, July 23, 2004, A.G. Op. 04-0316.
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   If a defendant fails to appear for his court date after being released on his own recognizance by the constable who arrested him, the court may issue a warrant for failure to appear. The constable may then arrest the defendant and bring him to the jail and he would then be entitled to a mileage reimbursement as established under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t25c03s25-3-41ol12" target="_self">25-3-41(2)</a></cite>. Busby, July 23, 2004, A.G. Op. 04-0316.
      </p>
      <p>
       In order to collect the annual state fail case fee the constable must serve or diligently attempt to serve all warrants and other process presented to him for service in state cases in which the state fails in the prosecution. He must attend all trials in state cases in which the state fails in the prosecution, unless lawfully excused or otherwise unavailable for a legitimate reason. Finally, he must not have overcharged in the collection of fees for costs. Enlow, Feb. 4, 2005, A.G. Op. 05-0004.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the constable performs all the requirements for collection of the annual state fail case fee, the board of supervisors has no discretion, and must pay the fee. Enlow, Feb. 4, 2005, A.G. Op. 05-0004.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the annual state fail case fee is $ 1,800.00 or nothing, a breakdown or “itemization” is not required. Enlow, Feb. 4, 2005, A.G. Op. 05-0004.
      </p>
      <p>
       A constable should receive his fee before restitution is paid to the victim. Aldridge, Apr. 26, 2005, A.G. Op. 05-0063.

       Funds generated from assessment of traffic fines can be expended only for the DARE program or a similar program. Tolar, Apr. 14, 2006, A.G. Op. 06-0072.

      The fees to which a witness may be entitled in a civil case shall be allowed on the affidavit of the witness, stating the number of days he has attended and the amount of mileage, toll, and ferriage to which he is entitled, to be taken and preserved by the clerk of the court, master, or other officer before whom the witness was called to testify; and a certificate of the allowance shall be given to the witness. A witness shall be entitled to demand, at the expiration of each day, his compensation for attending on that day; and if the same be not paid, the witness shall not be obliged to attend further until the compensation for his previous attendance shall be paid, unless the party liable make and file an affidavit of his inability to pay. The party paying a witness attending on his behalf may file the certificate of the witness among the papers in the cause and, if he recover costs therein, the amount shall be taxed in the bill of costs. Any witness may sue for and recover from the party on whose behalf he was summoned the amount specified in his certificate. Where a witness holds a certificate and the same has been duly entered on the witness docket, it may be taxed and collected as other costs.

     <p>
      The amount of compensation due to each grand juror, petit juror, and juror summoned on a special venire and regularly discharged by the court shall, after the discharge of such juror, be determined on the oath of the juror, allowed in open court, and entered on the minutes thereof. The clerk shall thereupon give a certificate of the same to the juror, and said certificate shall be negotiable and shall be paid by the county treasurer upon presentation by the payee or the holder in due course. In all other cases the court or officer before whom the juror serves shall determine the sum due and give certificate accordingly.

     </p>
     <p>
      For publishing in a newspaper any summons, order, citation, advertisement or notice required by law to be published in a newspaper, Twelve Cents (12¢) for each word it contains for the first insertion, and Ten Cents (10¢) for each of the words for each subsequent insertion required by law; however, as an alternative, such printers and publishers may charge such fees per line which are acceptable to the party placing the publication not to exceed the Twelve Cents (12¢) and Ten Cents (10¢) per word as set out in this subsection.

      When four (4) or more numerals appear consecutively in any such legal publication, four (4) numerals shall be considered as one (1) word, and if there remains a fractional portion of such unit of four (4) numerals therein such fraction shall also be counted as one (1) word. In the case of numbers containing less than four (4) numerals which are isolated from other numerals by words in such publication, the same shall be counted as one (1) word. When tables or tabular matter are included, each line of the standard newspaper column shall be considered as containing at least six (6) words.
     </p>
     <p>
      The fees authorized in this paragraph (a) shall not be chargeable for any erroneous publication of a summons, order, citation, advertisement or notice required by law to be published in a newspaper, if such error is not attributable to the person or entity requesting the publication.

       Where two newspapers submitted bids of $15 and $25 per month, respectively, for the publication of the proceedings of a board of supervisors, the board could not award the contract to the newspaper making the $25 bid, on the theory that a stipulation in its bid that it would charge the legal rate for the publication in case the minutes of the board did not amount to $25 as computed by the legal rate might render the amount to be paid less than that stipulated in the other bid, since the law inserted a stipulation to the same effect in the bid of the other newspaper.

       Governor’s agent who, pursuant to his appointment, returned fugitives charged with kidnapping, could not recover from the county either for expenses of the victim, who went along with him, or those of himself personally in addition to the mileage allowed him.

       Code 1942, § 3965 is inapplicable as to a petition in circuit court against the county by Governor’s agent for allowance of mileage and other expenses, under this section and Code 1942, § 3984, for returning fugitives.

       Code 1942, § 3965 does not supersede this section or Code 1942, § 3984, but supplements them by providing, on a proper showing in advance for the necessity thereof, an allowance in addition to the expenses of the executive agents, extra guards, and expenses in maintenance of the guard and prisoners, and other incidental expenses inherent in such sections.

      <p>
       The only matters into which the circuit court may inquire on petition for mileage and other expenses incurred by Governor’s agent in returning fugitives from another state, are whether the requisition was issued and the fugitives returned, the actual mileage from the place of arrest in the other state to the point of delivery, the reasonable expenses of feeding and lodging the fugitives, the reasonable expenses of the guard along by the executive agent, and other reasonably essential expenses incidentally necessary to executing the warrant of requisition. Kitchens v. Union County, 198 Miss. 403, 22 So. 2d 356, 1945 Miss. LEXIS 211 (Miss. 1945).
      </p>
      <p>
       On petition filed in circuit court for an order directing county board of supervisors to issue warrant based on mileage claim for returning fugitives from another state under Governor’s requisition, it is not necessary that the supervisors be summoned and consequently a defect in the summons, as well as the failure of the supervisors to appear and contest on behalf of the county, were immaterial. Kitchens v. Union County, 198 Miss. 403, 22 So. 2d 356, 1945 Miss. LEXIS 211 (Miss. 1945).
      </p>
      <p>
       One petitioning circuit court for allowance of mileage for returning fugitives under Governor’s requisition, is not required by virtue of Code 1942, § 3922 to first file his petition or claim with the district attorney, but such section does require that the judge must ask the advice of the district attorney before allowing the claim or petition, and, until the court does so, the court has no authority to allow or disallow the claim, so that a judgment denying the petition is tantamount merely to an erroneous dismissal of the claim and not a final judgment on its merits. Kitchens v. Union County, 198 Miss. 403, 22 So. 2d 356, 1945 Miss. LEXIS 211 (Miss. 1945).
      </p>
      <p>
       While under Code 1942, § 3922, a circuit court has no authority to allow or disallow a claim until it has first sought the advice of the district attorney, the latter’s approval or disapproval is not binding upon the court and the allowance or disallowance of the claim is ultimately committed to the judgment of the court, although in respect to a claim against the county, such as mileage for returning fugitives under Governor’s requisition, the claim may be contested by the district attorney in the circuit court on behalf of the county. Kitchens v. Union County, 198 Miss. 403, 22 So. 2d 356, 1945 Miss. LEXIS 211 (Miss. 1945).
      </p>
      <p>
       Judgment of circuit court in allowing or disallowing claim for mileage is an adjudication, and from an adverse adjudication an appeal will lie to the supreme court. Kitchens v. Union County, 198 Miss. 403, 22 So. 2d 356, 1945 Miss. LEXIS 211 (Miss. 1945).

      The circuit court or the judge thereof in vacation is hereby authorized and empowered to allow all necessary and proper expenses to any person or persons acting under a requisition of the Governor, or acting without a requisition in cases where the person to be returned has waived extradition in writing, who may travel out of this state for the purpose of identifying or assisting in any proper and necessary manner in the return to this state of a person charged with felony.
     </p>
     <p>
      Such expenses may be allowed only upon a petition to said court or judge filed by the district attorney, setting out the necessity for the expenditure, an estimate of the probable amount to be spent, the name of the person charged with felony, the crime with which such person is charged, and the place to which the proposed trip will be made. If, upon the hearing of said petition, the circuit court or judge is satisfied of the necessity of the expenditure, an order authorizing the same may be entered to that effect; and thereafter, upon sworn itemized statement of such expenses, the court or judge shall, if such expenses are reasonable and proper, enter an order allowing the same, which order, upon presentation to the board of supervisors of the county in which such person is charged with felony, shall be allowed by said board.

       This section is inapplicable as to a petition in circuit court against the county by Governor’s agent for allowance of mileage, etc., under Code 1942, §§ 3964 and 3984, for returning fugitives. Kitchens v. Union County, 198 Miss. 403, 22 So. 2d 356, 1945 Miss. LEXIS 211 (Miss. 1945).
      </p>
      <p>
       Code 1942, § 3965 does not supersede this section or Code 1942, § 3984, but supplements them by providing, on a proper showing in advance for the necessity thereof, an allowance in addition to the expenses of the executive agents, extra guards, and expenses in maintenance of the guard and prisoners, and other incidental expenses inherent in such sections. Kitchens v. Union County, 198 Miss. 403, 22 So. 2d 356, 1945 Miss. LEXIS 211 (Miss. 1945).
      </p>
      <p>
       In respect to mileage allowances and other expenses incurred by a person appointed as agent of the Governor to return fugitives from another state, such person is not acting as an officer of the court even though he is a sheriff or deputy sheriff. Kitchens v. Union County, 198 Miss. 403, 22 So. 2d 356, 1945 Miss. LEXIS 211 (Miss. 1945).
      </p>
      <p>
       The only matters into which the circuit court may inquire on petition for mileage and other expenses, under this section and Code 1942, § 3984, incur red by Governor’s agent in returning fugitives from another state, are whether the requisition was issued and the fugitives returned, the actual mileage from the place of arrest in the other state to the point of delivery, the reasonable expenses of feeding and lodging the fugitives, the reasonable expenses of the guard along by the executive agent, and other reasonably essential expenses incidentally necessary to executing the warrant of requisition. Kitchens v. Union County, 198 Miss. 403, 22 So. 2d 356, 1945 Miss. LEXIS 211 (Miss. 1945).

      When it is desired to have returned to this state a person charged in this state with a crime, and such person is imprisoned or is held under criminal proceedings then pending against him in another state or territory or the District of Columbia, the Governor of this state may agree with the executive authority of such other state or territory for the extradition of such person before the conclusion of such proceedings or his term of sentence in such other state or territory or the District of Columbia, upon condition that such person be returned to such other state or territory at the expense of this state as soon as the prosecution in this state is terminated. The expenses of returning such prisoners to other states shall be paid out of an appropriation to be made for that purpose known as “the prisoner extradition fund.”

      It is the purpose of this chapter to establish in the State of Mississippi a system of personnel administration based on sound methods of personnel administration governing the establishment of employment positions, classification of positions and the employment conduct, movement and separation of state employees; to build a career service in government which will attract, select and retain the best persons, with incentives in the form of equal opportunities for initial appointment and promotions in the state service; to establish a system of personnel management that will ensure the effective and efficient use of employees in the state service; and to perform such other duties as may be specified in this chapter or any other law.

   A probationary employee of the Department of Wildlife Conservation (DWC) had the right to fair treatment without regard to creed, political opinion or affiliation, and to be secure in his employment from partisan or political interference; he enjoyed a procedural right to appeal to the Employee Appeals Board (EAB) a DWC action terminating his employment, insofar as that action may have been based upon political opinions, affiliations or interference. Although a probationary employee enjoys no protection via the “inefficiency or other good cause” standard pursuant to §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t25c09s25-9-127ol11b" target="_self">25-9-127(1)(b)</a></cite>, he or she may not be “adversely affected” for other unlawful reasons.

      It is the intent of this chapter to consolidate into one (1) state personnel system all agencies and employees now administered by the Mississippi Classification Commission, agencies and employees now administered by the Mississippi Coordinated Merit System Council, and such other agencies and employees except as excluded by this chapter. The State Personnel Board established herein shall assume the total functions of personnel administration services (a) for those agencies and positions now required and operating under merit system rules due to federal statutory and regulatory provisions or state law, and (b) for all state agencies, departments and institutions except as excluded by this chapter. However, state agencies which are not required by law to operate under merit system rules may request an exemption from the applicant selection process by specific job class or on an agency-wide basis when such exemption is justifiable.

       In order to give meaning to the conflicting statutory provisions, the nursing board and the state personnel board have roles in setting the salary of the executive director. Since Section 73-15-17(m) is specific to the nursing board and Section 25-9-107(c) is a general statute,
   the nursing board sets the salary of its executive director within a salary range established by the state personnel board in accordance with the variable compensation plan. Owens, Aug. 11, 2006, A.G. Op. 06-0361.

       After accepting hearing officer’s findings of fact, Employee Appeals Board (EAB) improperly set aside termination of Department of Corrections (DOC) employee who had received package from penitentiary post office which contained items normally sent to prisoners and then failed to report package to security or internal affairs as required by DOC policy; such employee was unfit to work for DOC in that she had demonstrated propensity to smuggle packages to criminals, given hearing officer’s findings that employee knew package was not hers in that it was of type sent to inmates and that employee asked co-worker to deliver package to housing unit for inmates, rather than turn it in to her supervisors.

       State Personnel Board (SPB) rule providing that Employee Appeals Board (EAB) may not alter action of agency if agency acted in accordance with SPB published policies, rules and regulations does not conflict with statute providing EAB with authority to modify decision of state agency; statute does not provide any guidance as to under what circumstances EAB may modify agency’s action, and SPB has statutory authority to make rules and regulations.

   A probationary employee of the Department of Wildlife Conservation (DWC) had the right to fair treatment without regard to creed, political opinion or affiliation, and to be secure in his employment from partisan or political interference; he enjoyed a procedural right to appeal to the Employee Appeals Board (EAB) a DWC action terminating his employment, insofar as that action may have been based upon political opinions, affiliations or interference. Although a probationary employee enjoys no protection via the “inefficiency or other good cause” standard pursuant to §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t25c09s25-9-127ol11b" target="_self">25-9-127(1)(b)</a></cite>, he or she may not be “adversely affected” for other unlawful reasons.

       Based upon Section 25-9-115[Repealed], the Department of Finance and Administration is only required to verify the existence of a funds shortage based upon the facts submitted by the agency and such independent findings as are reasonably practicable. Such verification would not require the Department of Finance and Administration to review or evaluate agency management decisions. Ranck, May 31, 1996, A.G. Op. #96-0352.

       Employee was not denied due process because the employer, an agency, dismissed him for violation of a different offense than listed in the notice, because the offense he was dismissed for was nearly identical, the appellate court not being able to discern any substantive difference between the two, and the employee’s notice provided him with ample notice of the conduct and nature of the charge for which he faced discipline. Miss. Dep't of Wildlife, Fisheries & Parks v. Bradshaw, 196 So.3d 1075, 2016 Miss. App. LEXIS 430 (Miss. Ct. App. 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   While Laws of 2004, ch. 595, § 13 (Section 13) had an indirect effect on Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t25c09s25-9-127ol11" target="_self">25-9-127(1)</a></cite> by suspending it for a specified period of time, it required no reference to §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t25c09s25-9-127ol11" target="_self">25-9-127(1)</a></cite> for an understanding of its meaning and scope; thus, it qualified as an amendment by implication, which was complete in itself and was not violative of Miss. Const. Art. 4, § 61, and the employee’s argument that Section 13 was unconstitutional was not persuasive. Hemba v. Miss. Dep't of Corr., 998 So. 2d 1003, 2009 Miss. LEXIS 1 (Miss. 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       Statute contemplated an inquiry into whether the alleged offense, even if it took place, was of sufficient gravity to warrant the imposition of the discipline imposed. Miss. State Dep't of Health v. Hogue, 801 So. 2d 794, 2001 Miss. App. LEXIS 511 (Miss. Ct. App. 2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a proceeding to suspend a police officer, the burden of proof was properly placed on the police officer to establish that the reasons for his suspension were either not true or were not sufficient grounds for suspension. Department of Fin. & Admin. v. Reese, 751 So. 2d 1189, 1999 Miss. App. LEXIS 608 (Miss. Ct. App. 1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       After accepting hearing officer’s findings of fact, Employee Appeals Board (EAB) improperly set aside termination of Department of Corrections (DOC) employee who had received package from penitentiary post office which contained items normally sent to prisoners and then failed to report package to security or internal affairs as required by DOC policy; such employee was unfit to work for DOC in that she had demonstrated propensity to smuggle packages to criminals, given hearing officer’s findings that employee knew package was not hers in that it was of type sent to inmates and that employee asked co-worker to deliver package to housing unit for inmates, rather than turn it in to her supervisors. Johnson v. Mississippi Dep't of Corrections, 682 So. 2d 367, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 531 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Neither hearing officer nor Employee Appeals Board (EAB), which accepted hearing officer’s findings, properly allocated burden of proof in employee disciplinary proceeding, where hearing officer required state employer, rather than employee, show that reason for discharge of employee was true. Mississippi Dep't of Corrections v. McClee, 677 So. 2d 732, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 286 (Miss. 1996).

       <p>
   A probationary employee of the Department of Wildlife Conservation (DWC) had the right to fair treatment without regard to creed, political opinion or affiliation, and to be secure in his employment from partisan or political interference; he enjoyed a procedural right to appeal to the Employee Appeals Board (EAB) a DWC action terminating his employment, insofar as that action may have been based upon political opinions, affiliations or interference. Although a probationary employee enjoys no protection via the “inefficiency or other good cause” standard pursuant to §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t25c09s25-9-127ol11b" target="_self">25-9-127(1)(b)</a></cite>, he or she may not be “adversely affected” for other unlawful reasons.

   Even though a legislative amendment extinguished the employee’s property rights as to his job, he was not denied due process where the Mississippi Department of Corrections terminated more than 160 employees; Laws of 2004, ch. 595, § 13 (Section 13) affected a general class of people due to a mandated reorganization of the department, Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t25c09s25-9-127ol11" target="_self">25-9-127(1)</a></cite>, and thus, the employee was entitled to due process only as provided under Section 13. Hemba v.

       State employee’s termination was reversed because the employee’s due process rights were violated when (1) no facts in evidence supported the misconduct charged, (2) the termination was based on the employee’s statements indicating possible misconduct on other occasions, and (3) there was no other direct proof of the charged misconduct.

   Mississippi Employee Appeals Board’s (EAB) reinstatement of a Mississippi Department of Corrections employee was affirmed as the employee met his burden under Miss. Code Ann. §§<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t25c09s25-9-127ol11" target="_self">25-9-127(1)</a></cite> (Rev. 2010) and<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t25c09s25-9-131ol11" target="_self">25-9-131(1)</a></cite> (Rev. 2010) of proving that the alleged acts leading to his termination did not occur. Thus, the EAB’s decision was supported by substantial evidence. Miss. Dep't of Corr. v. Pennington, 59 So.3d 636, 2011 Miss. App. LEXIS 206 (Miss. Ct. App. 2011).

       Where there was overwhelming evidence that appellant, while employed by appellee Mississippi Department of Education, copied software promotional materials to craft what were supposed to be generic software specifications and that increased the likelihood that a particular software would be selected, in violation of employee policy, and there was evidence that appellant was seen at a vocational conference in a booth for that software wearing one of the software company’s name tags, the Mississippi Employee Appeals Board erred in reinstating appellant. Bynum v. Miss. Dep't of Educ., 906 So. 2d 81, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 1130 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004), cert. denied, 904 So. 2d 184, 2005 Miss. LEXIS 398 (Miss. 2005).

Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t25c09s25-9-107" target="_self">25-9-107</a></cite>, the employee was properly reinstated because deference was given to the Employee Appeals Board sitting en banc and substantial evidence, pursuant to the standard of review of Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t25c09s25-9-132" target="_self">25-9-132</a></cite>, showed that the employee’s termination was politically motivated in violation of Miss.

      <p>
       Mississippi Employee Appeals Board (EAB) hearing officer acted outside the power afforded to the EAB by finding defendant Mississippi Department of Education restricted from reclassifying an employee’s past conduct as terminable in light of new evidence and then terminating the employee because the EAB must affirm a termination unless the employee has shown that the reasons for the termination were not true or were insufficient to merit the termination. Bynum v. Miss. Dep't of Educ., 906 So. 2d 81, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 1130 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004), cert. denied, 904 So. 2d 184, 2005 Miss. LEXIS 398 (Miss. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Court erred in upholding a state employee’s reinstatement with a department of corrections on the ground that improper political influence caused the employee to be terminated; no evidence supported the charge that the employee was fired because of political pressure due to the employee’s work for a defeated sheriff. Reviewing court could not find any evidence on which the Employee Appeals Board could have relied to conclude that the employee was terminated because of the employee’s political work. Miss. Dep't of Corr. v. Smith, 883 So. 2d 124, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 449 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 882 So. 2d 772, 2004 Miss. LEXIS 1208 (Miss. 2004).

       Where an employee of the Mississippi State Department of Health (MSDH), allegedly made sexual advances upon a 16-year-old patient, the patient’s statement was the basis for the employee’s termination. MSDH’s failure to reinterview the patient constituted insufficient agency fact-finding prior to the termination decision, and once the Mississippi Employee Appeals Board (EAB) hearing officer rejected the patient’s statement, it was reasonable for the hearing officer to infer that the reasons given for the employee’s termination were not true; the EABs reversal of the employee’s termination was was not arbitrary and capricious. Davis v. Miss. State Dep't of Health, 856 So. 2d 485, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 286 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 860 So. 2d 315, 2003 Miss. LEXIS 674 (Miss. 2003).

       The Employee Appeals Board properly set aside the suspension of a capitol police officer for his failure to patrol the interior of the Old Capitol Building on the night of an attempted burglary where there was evidence that the officer was unaware that it was standard operating procedure to patrol the interior of the Old Capitol Building. Department of Fin. & Admin. v. Reese, 751 So. 2d 1189, 1999 Miss. App. LEXIS 608 (Miss. Ct. App. 1999).

       Where the plaintiffs demonstrated that they had been adversely affected as to compensation or employment status within the meaning of subsection (1), the remedy granted by the Employee Appeals Board, which included the prospective removal of unauthorized job requirements and an order that they receive consideration for reclassification (or, arguably, for any posted Psychologist I positions) based strictly on their own merits and on the fact that they both met the minimum requirements to fill such a position, was sufficient; the board was not required to order that the plaintiffs automatically be advanced to the next available Psychologist I slots.

Although a probationary employee enjoys no protection via the “inefficiency or other good cause” standard pursuant to §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t25c09s25-9-127ol11b" target="_self">25-9-127(1)(b)</a></cite>, he or she may not be “adversely affected” for other unlawful reasons. Although §§<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t25c09s25-9-103" target="_self">25-9-103</a></cite> and<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t25c09s25-9-145ol11" target="_self">25-9-145(1)</a></cite>, standing alone, confer upon state employees no express right to be secure in their employment from political interference, the legal existence of the legislative language in those statutes makes no sense absent such rights. Under §§<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t25c09s25-9-129" target="_self">25-9-129</a></cite> and<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t25c09s25-9-131" target="_self">25-9-131</a></cite>, the employee had the right to appeal the DWC’s decision to the EAB.

   The statutory civil service appeals process was adequate to enable a discharged employee to assert claims that he was denied state and federal constitutional rights. The employee could have presented before the Employee Appeals Board (EAB) every ground for relief that he asserted, including his federal claims under 42 USC § 1983. The more relaxed administrative appellate process before the EAB is quite conducive to a full airing of an employee’s constitutional claim. On judicial review, the circuit court is specifically charged, pursuant to §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t25c09s25-9-132" target="_self">25-9-132</a></cite>, to consider whether the EAB’s action abridged “some . . . constitutional right of the employee.” On final review, the employee’s administrative remedies thus exhausted, he or she may pursue before the circuit court all avenues of relief that § 1983 makes available. If an aggrieved state employee were allowed to bring a § 1983 claim in chancery court after exhausting the administrative remedies and judicial review thereof, there would be a duplication of process. Hood v. Mississippi Dep't of Wildlife Conservation, 571 So. 2d 263, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 702 (Miss. 1990), overruled in part, E. Miss. State Hosp. v. Callens, 892 So. 2d 800, 2004 Miss.

Subpoenas so issued shall be delivered to the sheriff of the county where they are to be executed, and the sheriff shall cause them to be served. In case of the failure of any person to comply with any subpoena issued by the board, the board or its authorized representative may invoke the aid of any court of this state of general jurisdiction. The court may thereupon order such person to comply with the requirements of the subpoena. Failure to obey the order of the court may be punished by the court as a contempt thereof.

       State employee’s termination was reversed because the employee’s due process rights were violated when (1) no facts in evidence supported the misconduct charged, (2) the termination was based on the employee’s statements indicating possible misconduct on other occasions, and (3) there was no other direct proof of the charged misconduct.

       Where the Mississippi Employee Appeals Board reversed the Mississippi Department of Corrections’s decision to suspend its employee after a full evidentiary hearing, the circuit court erred by reversing that decision; credibility of the testimony was for the Board to judge and was a factor in its decision, and the circuit court had no right to re-evaluate credibility.

       Where an employee of the Mississippi State Department of Health (MSDH), allegedly made sexual advances upon a 16-year-old patient, the patient’s statement was the basis for the employee’s termination. MSDH’s failure to reinterview the patient constituted insufficient agency fact-finding prior to the termination decision, and once the Mississippi Employee Appeals Board (EAB) hearing officer rejected the patient’s statement, it was reasonable for the hearing officer to infer that the reasons given for the employee’s termination were not true; the EABs reversal of the employee’s termination was was not arbitrary and capricious.

       Employee Appeals Board (EAB) lacked statutory authority to transfer pending state civil service employment matter to circuit court; statutes creating EAB indicated that EAB’s ultimate authority was limited to issuing final decision in which case appellate, as compared to original, jurisdiction of circuit court could be invoked by aggrieved employee to review EAB’s decision.

       An appeal may be taken by such employee to the circuit court of the principal county of the employee’s employment or the Circuit Court of the First Judicial District of Hinds County, by filing a petition with the clerk of such court and executing and filing bond payable to the State of Mississippi with sufficient sureties to be approved by the clerk of the court, in the penalty of Five Hundred Dollars ($500.00), conditioned upon the payment of all costs of appeal, including the cost of preparing the transcript of the hearing before the employee appeals board. The petition and bond shall be filed within thirty (30) days of the receipt of the final decision of the employee appeals board. Upon approval of the bond, the clerk of the court shall notify the employee appeals board, which shall prepare its record in the matter and transmit it to the circuit court.
      </li>
      <li id="t25c09s25-9-132ol12">
       The scope of review of the circuit court in such cases shall be limited to a review of the record made before the employee appeals board or hearing officer to determine if the action of the employee appeals board is unlawful for the reason that it was:

      <p>
       Substantial evidence supported a decision from the Mississippi Employee Appeal Board that affirmed a state employee’s termination after he was convicted of stalking and simple assault as a conviction was A sufficient basis for discharge. Terry v. Miss. Div. of Medicaid, 75 So.3d 1100, 2011 Miss. App. LEXIS 295 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 76 So.3d 169, 2011 Miss. LEXIS 564 (Miss. 2011).
      </p>
      <p>
       Mississippi Employee Appeals Board did not err in denying the employee’s request for travel reimbursement and personal-leave credit, continuing professional education expenses, reimbursement of legal fees, reimbursement for additional income taxation, and an independent calculation of the monies owed; the EAB could reimburse the employee for personal funds expended on medical insurance during the period of her wrongful termination. Miss. Dep't of Human Servs. v. McNeel, 10 So.3d 444, 2009 Miss. LEXIS 274 (Miss. 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       Decision of the Mississippi employee appeals board upholding the employee’s termination was supported by substantial evidence and was not arbitrary and capricious where the testimony supported the finding that the employee attempted to restrain a mentally retarded client who was in a wheelchair by placing unauthorized force on the back of the client’s neck and arm. Payne v. Miss. Dep't of Mental Health, 964 So. 2d 582, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 581 (Miss. Ct. App. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       Mississippi Department of Corrections (MDOC) did not act in an arbitrary or capricious manner in dismissing a prison counselor where she wrote a letter to an inmate with a smiley face, signed off as “your mom,” and made other statements that seemed to evince an improper personal relationship. Counselor failed to demonstrate that the reasons given for her termination were not true, and the decision of the employee appeals board and the circuit court, that said conduct did not warrant dismissal, was reversed. Miss. Dep't of Corr. v. Maxwell, 913 So. 2d 1013, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 315 (Miss. Ct. App. 2005).

   Even though a terminated employer was a nonstate service employee under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t25c09s25-9-107" target="_self">25-9-107</a></cite>, the employee was properly reinstated because deference was given to the Employee Appeals Board sitting en banc and substantial evidence, pursuant to the standard of review of Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t25c09s25-9-132" target="_self">25-9-132</a></cite>, showed that the employee’s termination was politically motivated in violation of Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t25c09s25-9-127" target="_self">25-9-127</a></cite> and Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t25c09s25-9-103" target="_self">25-9-103</a></cite>.

      <p>
       Substantial evidence, in the form of testimony from supervisor’s and coworkers, existed of improper actions by an employee in the operation of a dragline crane so that the Mississippi Employee Appeals Board acted arbitrarily and capriciously in ordering the employee to be reinstated. Pannell v. Tombigbee River Valley Water Mgmt. Dist., 909 So. 2d 1115, 2005 Miss. LEXIS 373 (Miss. 2005).

      <p>
       <p>
   Termination of the employee’s employment was proper where the decision was supported by substantial evidence and it was neither arbitrary or capricious, Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t25c09s25-9-132ol12" target="_self">25-9-132(2)</a></cite>. There was sufficient evidence of the employee’s threatening or coercing employees and engaging in acts of conduct plainly related to job performance of such nature that to continue the employee in the assigned position could constitute negligence of the agency’s duties to other state employees such as to warrant dismissal. Miss. Transp. Comm'n v. Anson, 879 So. 2d 958, 2004 Miss. LEXIS 621 (Miss. 2004).

   State employee could bring suit under 42 U.S.C.S. § 1983 alleging that he was terminated in retaliation for exercising his freedom of speech, although he did not exhaust administrative remedies as contemplated by Miss. Code Ann. §§<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t25c09s25-9-131" target="_self">25-9-131</a></cite>,<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t25c09s25-9-132" target="_self">25-9-132</a></cite>; he was not restricted to the grievance procedure on federal constitutional claims.

      </p>
      <p>
       Hearing officer for the Mississippi Employees Appeals Board (EAB) observed the testimony of witnesses and their demeanor and found that the employee (a social worker) was not professionally involved with the subject child at the time the employee’s husband was appointed guardian of that child, and that adopting the child was never discussed; substantial evidence supported the decision of the EAB, and the employee was entitled to reinstatement with back pay. Miss. Dep't of Human Servs. v. McNeel, 869 So. 2d 1013, 2004 Miss. LEXIS 340 (Miss. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where an employee of the Mississippi State Department of Health (MSDH), allegedly made sexual advances upon a 16-year-old patient, the patient’s statement was the basis for the employee’s termination. MSDH’s failure to reinterview the patient constituted insufficient agency fact-finding prior to the termination decision, and once the Mississippi Employee Appeals Board (EAB) hearing officer rejected the patient’s statement, it was reasonable for the hearing officer to infer that the reasons given for the employee’s termination were not true; the EABs reversal of the employee’s termination was supported by substantial evidence. Davis v. Miss. State Dep't of Health, 856 So. 2d 485, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 286 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 860 So. 2d 315, 2003 Miss. LEXIS 674 (Miss. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       The circuit court improperly reversed a decision of a hearing officer and the full board of the Employee Appeals Board, which had terminated the appellee’s employment based on his drug test results, where the court relied on evidence not found in the record made before the Employee Appeals Board. Mississippi Dep't of Corrections v. Gooden, 766 So. 2d 783, 2000 Miss. App. LEXIS 344 (Miss. Ct. App. 2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       The court did not abuse its discretion in denying a corrections officer’s request for additional time to file a brief due to financial constraints and the fact that his attorney was murdered. Holly v. Mississippi Dep't of Corrections, 722 So. 2d 632, 1998 Miss. LEXIS 527 (Miss. 1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       Employee Appeals Board (EAB) lacked statutory authority to transfer pending state civil service employment matter to circuit court; statutes creating EAB indicated that EAB’s ultimate authority was limited to issuing final decision in which case appellate, as compared to original, jurisdiction of circuit court could be invoked by aggrieved employee to review EAB’s decision. Wright v. White, 693 So. 2d 898, 1997 Miss. LEXIS 160 (Miss. 1997), overruled in part, E. Miss. State Hosp. v. Callens, 892 So. 2d 800, 2004 Miss. LEXIS 361 (Miss. 2004).
      </p>

       <p>
   An appeal from a circuit court order reversing an order of the Employee Appeals Board, which granted a state service employee’s motion to collaterally estop her employer-the Mississippi Department of Corrections (MDOC)-from relitigating factual issues decided in the employee’s unemployment claim, would be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction since no appeal to the circuit court by an administrative agency is authorized by §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t25c09s25-9-132" target="_self">25-9-132</a></cite>, and the MDOC did not comply with the statutory requisites for certiorari pursuant to §§<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.11.html#t11c51s11-51-93" target="_blank">11-51-93</a></cite> and<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.11.html#t11c51s11-51-95" target="_blank">11-51-95</a></cite> where the MDOC filed only a brief in support of review and failed to file a petition supported by affidavit.

   Although the circuit court did not have the authority, under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t25c09s25-9-132" target="_self">25-9-132</a></cite>, to hear the Department of Wildlife Conservation’s (DWC) appeal of a final decision of the Employee Appeals Board (EAB), limited judicial review via writ of certiorari was available to the DWC under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.11.html#t11c51s11-51-93" target="_blank">11-51-93</a></cite>, since the EAB is a “tribunal inferior” within the meaning of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.11.html#t11c51s11-51-95" target="_blank">11-51-95</a></cite>. Gill v. Mississippi Dep't of Wildlife Conservation, 574 So. 2d 586, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 789 (Miss. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   The statutory civil service appeals process was adequate to enable a discharged employee to assert claims that he was denied state and federal constitutional rights. The employee could have presented before the Employee Appeals Board (EAB) every ground for relief that he asserted, including his federal claims under 42 USCS § 1983. The more relaxed administrative appellate process before the EAB is quite conducive to a full airing of an employee’s constitutional claim. On judicial review, the circuit court is specifically charged, pursuant to §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t25c09s25-9-132" target="_self">25-9-132</a></cite>, to consider whether the EAB’s action abridged “some . . . constitutional right of the employee.” On final review, the employee’s administrative remedies thus exhausted, he or she may pursue before the circuit court all avenues of relief that § 1983 makes available. If an aggrieved state employee were allowed to bring a § 1983 claim in chancery court after exhausting the administrative remedies and judicial review thereof, there would be a duplication of process. Hood v. Mississippi Dep't of Wildlife Conservation, 571 So. 2d 263, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 702 (Miss. 1990), overruled in part, E. Miss. State Hosp. v. Callens, 892 So. 2d 800, 2004 Miss. LEXIS 361 (Miss. 2004).

       State employee, by not appealing to Circuit Court decision of hearing officer’s dismissal of employee’s case for lack of jurisdiction, specifically agreed with hearing officer that his was non-grievable matter.

      <p>
       The court properly rejected the contention that the 30 day period to appeal did not begin to run because the plaintiff was never given access to his appropriate administrative remedy; although the plaintiff argued that the Appeals Board misconstrued his status and that, therefore, his administrative remedies were never exhausted, his appeal period began to run when the Appeals Board affirmed his termination.

All nominations shall be submitted by the State Personnel Director to the Governor for review, comments and recommendation at least sixty (60) days prior to final evaluation by the State Personnel Board.

       Substantial evidence supported the decision of the Mississippi Employee Appeals Board that an employee was not “clearly” more qualified for a promotion than a master sergeant because the sergeant scored higher than the employee on the interview since he provided superior answers to the interview questions.

       Relative quality of candidates’ answers to interview questions designed to test their knowledge relevant to the open position is a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for an employer’s decision Kirk v. Miss. Dep't of Pub. Safety, 235 So.3d 144, 2017 Miss. App. LEXIS 324 (Miss. Ct. App. 2017), cert. denied, — So.3d —, 2018 Miss. LEXIS 44 (Miss. 2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       Circuit court properly affirmed the decision of the Mississippi Employee Appeals Board, which upheld a hearing officer’s order denying an employee’s gender discrimination claim because the employer articulated a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its decision to promote master sergeant rather than the employee; the employer’s stated reason for promoting the sergeant rather than the employee was that the sergeant scored higher on his interview. Kirk v. Miss. Dep't of Pub. Safety, 235 So.3d 144, 2017 Miss. App. LEXIS 324 (Miss. Ct. App. 2017), cert. denied, — So.3d —, 2018 Miss. LEXIS 44 (Miss. 2018).

     <p>
      Any agency which violates the provisions of Section 25-9-173 shall be liable to the public employee for back pay and reinstatement. In addition, an employee whose employment is suspended or terminated or who is subjected to adverse personnel action in violation of Section 25-9-173 is entitled to sue for injunctive relief, compensatory damages, court costs and reasonable attorney’s fees; provided, however, that an employee may not recover an amount that exceeds the limitations provided in Section 11-46-15. Additionally, each member of any agency’s governing board or authority may be found individually liable for a civil fine of up to Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000.00) for each violation of Section 25-9-173. In any instance where the agency in violation of Section 25-9-173 has no governing board or authority, the agency’s executive director may be found individually liable for a civil fine not to exceed Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000.00). If the court determines that any action filed under this section by an employee is frivolous and unwarrantable, the court may award to the employer court costs and reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred in defense of actions brought by the employee under this section.

       Dismissal, for failure to state a claim, of a retired state employee’s equal protection challenge to the Legislature’s establishment of a supplemental retirement plan for legislators was proper; since the different treatment of retired legislators had a rational basis in the financial uncertainties they risked, the proper course in seeking a remedy was political, not judicial.

     <p>
      In order to extend to employees of the state and its political subdivisions and of the instrumentalities of either, and to the dependents and survivors of such employees, the basic protection accorded to others by the old-age and survivors insurance system embodied in the Social Security Act, it is hereby declared to be the policy of this state, subject to the limitations of Articles 1 and 3, that such steps be taken, and they are hereby expressly authorized, as to provide such protection to employees of the state and its political subdivisions and of the instrumentalities of either on as broad a basis as is permitted under applicable federal law. It is also the policy of the Legislature that the protection afforded employees in positions covered by a retirement system on the date an agreement under this article is made applicable to service performed in such positions, or receiving periodic benefits under such retirement system at such time, will not be impaired as a result of making the agreement so applicable or as a result of legislative enactment in anticipation thereof.

The amount by which an eligible employee’s salary is reduced pursuant to a salary reduction agreement authorized under Section 25-17-5 shall be excluded from the term “wages”, provided such exclusion does not conflict with federal law, including federal regulations and federal administrative interpretations thereunder, pertaining to the Federal Insurance Contributions Act or to Internal Revenue Code Section 125 cafeteria plans. If any salary reduction amounts excluded from “wages” under the prior sentence are determined to be “wages” by the Social Security Administration or the Internal Revenue Service and payroll tax deficiencies are assessed, the deficiencies shall be borne by the eligible employee and the adopting state agency or local governmental entity and not by the Public Employees’ Retirement System of Mississippi as state administrator.

Service which under the Social Security Act may be included in an agreement only upon certification by the Governor in accordance with Section 218(d)(3) of that act shall be included in the term “employment” if and when the Governor issues, with respect to such service, a certificate to the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare pursuant to Section 25-11-11(5) of this article.
     </p>
     <p>
      Services, the compensation for which is on a fee basis, may, to the extent permitted by applicable federal law, be excluded in any plan or agreement approved under or authorized by this article.
     </p>

     </p>
     <p>
      The term “political subdivision” includes any county, municipality, or other political subdivision within the State of Mississippi to which has been delegated certain functions of local government, and employees thereof who are eligible to become a coverage group under the terms of the Social Security Act.
     </p>
     <p>
      The term “instrumentality,” when referring to an instrumentality of the state or political subdivision, includes only a juristic entity which is legally separate and distinct from the state or such subdivision and whose employees are not by virtue of their relation to such entity employees of the state or such subdivision.
     </p>
     <p>
      The term “applicable federal law” refers to such provisions of federal law (including federal regulations and requirements issued pursuant thereto), as provide for extending the benefits of Title II of the Social Security Act to employees of states, political subdivisions, and their instrumentalities.
     </p>
     <p>
      The term “Social Security Act” means the Act of Congress approved August 14, 1935, Chapter 531, 49 Stat 620, officially cited as “The Social Security Act,” as such act has been and may from time to time be amended.

       In the case of the election of the Board of Trustees of the Public Employees’ Retirement System, the electorate should be limited to those employees who are members of the System, and should exclude those employees who are covered for Social Security purposes only.

      <p>
       Board of Trustees of the System may employ mathematical formula based on compensation paid to create presumption that employment contract for legal school term was completed in order to support finding that service for legal school term was rendered, absent any information to the contrary being reported by employer; awarding of creditable service on this basis is conditional and if, at later date, it is determined that underlying facts are not consistent with presumption, then service credit would be recalculated and awarded in accordance with the statutory schedule.

       While specific employment and membership in retirement system is required for appointment or election of certain members of Board of Trustees of PERS, service on Board of Trustees is not part of duties of employment and employees may not be compensated for work as employees while performing duties as Board members; such employees would be required to take annual leave from their regular employment duties while performing duties of PERS trustees and being compensated therefor in accordance with section 25-11-15(10).

     <p>
      A retirement system is hereby established and placed under the management of the board of trustees for the purpose of providing retirement allowances and other benefits under the provisions of this article for officers and employees in the state service and their beneficiaries. The retirement system provided by this article shall go into operation as of the first day of the month following the effective date thereof, when contributions by members shall begin and benefits shall become payable.
     </p>
     <p>
      This system shall be an agency of the State of Mississippi having all the powers and privileges of a public corporation and shall be known as the “Public Employees’ Retirement System of Mississippi.” By such name all of its business shall be transacted, all of its funds invested, and all of its cash and securities and other property held; but in ordinary correspondence the word “system” may be used instead of the full title. After appropriation for administrative expenses and after payment of investment management fees and costs, all funds of the system shall be held in trust in the custody of the board of trustees as funds of the beneficiaries of the trust. The Joint Legislative Committee on Performance Evaluation and Expenditure Review is hereby authorized and directed to have performed random actuarial evaluations, as necessary, of the funds and expenses of the Public Employees’ Retirement System and to make annual reports to the Legislature on the financial soundness of the system.

   There was no dispute that the former employee suffered from various ailments such as Chron’s disease, sarcoidosis and sarcoiliitis, but most of her medical records primarily dealt with various check-ups with notations such as “unremarkable.” The pertinent question the employee was required to address was whether her ailments rendered her disabled as defined by Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t25c11s25-11-113" target="_self">25-11-113</a></cite>; the Public Employees’ Retirement System of Mississippi (PERS) presented sufficient evidence to support its finding that she was not disabled where the only proof submitted by the former employee that she could no longer perform the usual duties of her employment was her own testimony at the hearing, which centered on neck and back pain, in other words, ailments different from what she had asserted in her claim, and where she claimed that she had resigned from her job per doctor’s order, but she failed to produce documentation thereon. Public Emples. Ret. Sys. v. Burt, 919 So. 2d 1150, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 975 (Miss. Ct. App. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court erred in reversing administrative board’s decision denying disability benefits which was based on the determination that it was not supported by substantial evidence; however, the board’s decision was supported by substantial evidence, was not arbitrary and capricious, was made within the board’s scope or power, and did not violate the employee’s constitutional rights – the employee failed to meet her burden of proving she was in fact disabled – though she may have needed her surgery, she was clearly able but unwilling to return to her job; the record clearly supported the board’s order, which took into consideration all of the medical evidence, which did not establish that the employee’s ailments were disabling. Public Emples. Ret. Sys. v. Stamps, 2005 Miss. LEXIS 37 (Miss. Jan. 20, 2005), op. withdrawn, sub. op., 898 So. 2d 664, 2005 Miss. LEXIS 255 (Miss. 2005).

       The Public Employees’ Retirement System more nearly resembles a “domestic corporation” for purposes of service of process pursuant to Rule 4(d), Miss. R. Civ. P. and, therefore, service by mail upon an agent for the System was sufficient. Public Emples. Retirement System v. Dillon, 538 So. 2d 327, 1988 Miss. LEXIS 357, 1988 Miss. LEXIS 641 (Miss. 1988).

         “Actuarial tables” mean such tables of mortality and rates of interest as adopted by the board in accordance with the recommendation of the actuary.

         “Average compensation” means the average of the four (4) highest years of earned compensation reported for an employee in a fiscal or calendar year period, or combination thereof that do not overlap, or the last forty-eight (48) consecutive months of earned compensation reported for an employee. The four (4) years need not be successive or joined years of service. In computing the average compensation for retirement, disability or survivor benefits, any amount lawfully paid in a lump sum for personal leave or major medical leave shall be included in the calculation to the extent that the amount does not exceed an amount that is equal to thirty (30) days of earned compensation and to the extent that it does not cause the employee’s earned compensation to exceed the maximum reportable amount specified in paragraph (k) of this section; however, this thirty-day limitation shall not prevent the inclusion in the calculation of leave earned under federal regulations before July 1, 1976, and frozen as of that date as referred to in Section 25-3-99. In computing the average compensation, no amounts shall be used that are in excess of the amount on which contributions were required and paid, and no nontaxable amounts paid by the employer for health or life insurance premiums for the employee shall be used. If any member who is or has been granted any increase in annual salary or compensation of more than eight percent (8%) retires within twenty-four (24) months from the date that the increase becomes effective, then the board shall exclude that part of the increase in salary or compensation that exceeds eight percent (8%) in calculating that member’s average compensation for retirement purposes. The board may enforce this provision by rule or regulation. However, increases in compensation in excess of eight percent (8%) per year granted within twenty-four (24) months of the date of retirement may be included in the calculation of average compensation if satisfactory proof is presented to the board showing that the increase in compensation was the result of an actual change in the position held or services rendered, or that the compensation increase was authorized by the State Personnel Board or was increased as a result of statutory enactment, and the employer furnishes an affidavit stating that the increase granted within the last twenty-four (24) months was not contingent on a promise or agreement of the employee to retire. Nothing in Section 25-3-31 shall affect the calculation of the average compensation of any member for the purposes of this article. The average compensation of any member who retires before July 1, 1992, shall not exceed the annual salary of the Governor.

In the event of the death before retirement of any member who became a member of the system before July 1, 2007, and whose spouse and/or children are not entitled to a retirement allowance on the basis that the member has less than four (4) years of membership service credit, or who became a member of the system on or after July 1, 2007, and whose spouse and/or children are not entitled to a retirement allowance on the basis that the member has less than eight (8) years of membership service credit, and/or has not been married for a minimum of one (1) year or the spouse has waived his or her entitlement to a retirement allowance under Section 25-11-114, the lawful spouse of a member at the time of the death of the member shall be the beneficiary of the member unless the member has designated another beneficiary after the date of marriage in writing, and filed that writing in the office of the executive director of the board of trustees.

       Section 25-11-103(g), which provides that the spouse of a member of the Public Employees’ Retirement System shall be the member’s beneficiary unless the member has designated another beneficiary subsequent to the date of marriage, does not constitute an unreasonable impairment of an employee’s contractual right contrary to the United States and Mississippi Constitutions because it provides protection to those whose spouse fails to redesignate due to “inadvertence” while allowing an employee to make a “conscious decision” to redesignate if he or she does not want his or her spouse to receive the death benefits.

      I. THOSE WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR MEMBERSHIP
     </p>
     <p>
      The membership of this retirement system shall be composed as follows:
     </p>
     <p>
      (i) All persons who become employees in the state service after January 31, 1953, and whose wages are subject to payroll taxes and are lawfully reported on IRS Form W-2, except those specifically excluded, or as to whom election is provided in Articles 1 and 3, shall become members of the retirement system as a condition of their employment.
     </p>
     <p>
      From and after July 1, 2002, any individual who is employed by a governmental entity to perform professional services shall become a member of the system if the individual is paid regular periodic compensation for those services that is subject to payroll taxes, is provided all other employee benefits and meets the membership criteria established by the regulations adopted by the board of trustees that apply to all other members of the system; however, any active member employed in such a position on July 1, 2002, will continue to be an active member for as long as they are employed in any such position.
     </p>
     <p>
      All persons who become employees in the state service after January 31, 1953, except those specifically excluded or as to whom election is provided in Articles 1 and 3, unless they file with the board before the lapse of sixty (60) days of employment or sixty (60) days after the effective date of the cited articles, whichever is later, on a form prescribed by the board, a notice of election not to be covered by the membership of the retirement system and a duly executed waiver of all present and prospective benefits that would otherwise inure to them on account of their participation in the system, shall become members of the retirement system; however, no credit for prior service will be granted to members who became members of the system before July 1, 2007, until they have contributed to Article 3 of the retirement system for a minimum period of at least four (4) years, or to members who became members of the system on or after July 1, 2007, until they have contributed to Article 3 of the retirement system for a minimum period of at least eight (8) years. Those members shall receive credit for services performed before January 1, 1953, in employment now covered by Article 3, but no credit shall be granted for retroactive services between January 1, 1953, and the date of their entry into the retirement system, unless the employee pays into the retirement system both the employer’s and the employee’s contributions on wages paid him during the period from January 31, 1953, to the date of his becoming a contributing member, together with interest at the rate determined by the board of trustees. Members reentering after withdrawal from service shall qualify for prior service under the provisions of Section 25-11-117. From and after July 1, 1998, upon eligibility as noted above, the member may receive credit for such retroactive service provided:
     </p>
     <p>
      The member shall furnish proof satisfactory to the board of trustees of certification of that service from the covered employer where the services were performed; and
     </p>
     <p>
      The member shall pay to the retirement system on the date he or she is eligible for that credit or at any time thereafter before the date of retirement the actuarial cost for each year of that creditable service. The provisions of this subparagraph (ii) shall be subject to the limitations of Section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code and regulations promulgated under Section 415.
     </p>
     <p>
      Nothing contained in this paragraph (b) shall be construed to limit the authority of the board to allow the correction of reporting errors or omissions based on the payment of the employee and employer contributions plus applicable interest.
     </p>
     <p>
      All persons who become employees in the state service after January 31, 1953, and who are eligible for membership in any other retirement system shall become members of this retirement system as a condition of their employment, unless they elect at the time of their employment to become a member of that other system.
     </p>
     <p>
      All persons who are employees in the state service on January 31, 1953, and who are members of any nonfunded retirement system operated by the State of Mississippi, or any of its departments or agencies, shall become members of this system with prior service credit unless, before February 1, 1953, they file a written notice with the board of trustees that they do not elect to become members.
     </p>
     <p>
      All persons who are employees in the state service on January 31, 1953, and who under existing laws are members of any fund operated for the retirement of employees by the State of Mississippi, or any of its departments or agencies, shall not be entitled to membership in this retirement system unless, before February 1, 1953, any such person indicates by a notice filed with the board, on a form prescribed by the board, his individual election and choice to participate in this system, but no such person shall receive prior service credit unless he becomes a member on or before February 1, 1953.
     </p>
     <p>
      Each political subdivision of the state and each instrumentality of the state or a political subdivision, or both, is authorized to submit, for approval by the board of trustees, a plan for extending the benefits of this article to employees of any such political subdivision or instrumentality. Each such plan or any amendment to the plan for extending benefits thereof shall be approved by the board of trustees if it finds that the plan, or the plan as amended, is in conformity with such requirements as are provided in Articles 1 and 3; however, upon approval of the plan or any such plan previously approved by the board of trustees, the approved plan shall not be subject to cancellation or termination by the political subdivision or instrumentality. No such plan shall be approved unless:
     </p>
     <p>
      It provides that all services that constitute employment as defined in Section 25-11-5 and are performed in the employ of the political subdivision or instrumentality, by any employees thereof, shall be covered by the plan, with the exception of municipal employees who are already covered by existing retirement plans; however, those employees in this class may elect to come under the provisions of this article;
     </p>
     <p>
      It specifies the source or sources from which the funds necessary to make the payments required by paragraph (d) of Section 25-11-123 and of paragraph (f)(v)2 and 3 of this section are expected to be derived and contains reasonable assurance that those sources will be adequate for that purpose;
     </p>
     <p>
      It provides for such methods of administration of the plan by the political subdivision or instrumentality as are found by the board of trustees to be necessary for the proper and efficient administration thereof;
     </p>
     <p>
      It provides that the political subdivision or instrumentality will make such reports, in such form and containing such information, as the board of trustees may from time to time require;
     </p>
     <p>
      It authorizes the board of trustees to terminate the plan in its entirety in the discretion of the board if it finds that there has been a failure to comply substantially with any provision contained in the plan, the termination to take effect at the expiration of such notice and on such conditions as may be provided by regulations of the board and as may be consistent with applicable federal law.
     </p>
     <p>
      1. The board of trustees shall not finally refuse to approve a plan submitted under paragraph (f), and shall not terminate an approved plan without reasonable notice and opportunity for hearing to each political subdivision or instrumentality affected by the board’s decision. The board’s decision in any such case shall be final, conclusive and binding unless an appeal is taken by the political subdivision or instrumentality aggrieved by the decision to the Circuit Court of the First Judicial District of Hinds County, Mississippi, in accordance with the provisions of law with respect to civil causes by certiorari.
     </p>
     <p>
      2. Each political subdivision or instrumentality as to which a plan has been approved under this section shall pay into the contribution fund, with respect to wages (as defined in Section 25-11-5), at such time or times as the board of trustees may by regulation prescribe, contributions in the amounts and at the rates specified in the applicable agreement entered into by the board.
     </p>
     <p>
      3. Every political subdivision or instrumentality required to make payments under paragraph (f)(v)2 of this section is authorized, in consideration of the employees’ retention in or entry upon employment after enactment of Articles 1 and 3, to impose upon its employees, as to services that are covered by an approved plan, a contribution with respect to wages (as defined in Section 25-11-5) not exceeding the amount provided in Section 25-11-123(d) if those services constituted employment within the meaning of Articles 1 and 3, and to deduct the amount of the contribution from the wages as and when paid. Contributions so collected shall be paid into the contribution fund as partial discharge of the liability of the political subdivisions or instrumentalities under paragraph (f)(v)2 of this section. Failure to deduct the contribution shall not relieve the employee or employer of liability for the contribution.
     </p>
     <p>
      4. Any state agency, school, political subdivision, instrumentality or any employer that is required to submit contribution payments or wage reports under any section of this chapter shall be assessed interest on delinquent payments or wage reports as determined by the board of trustees in accordance with rules and regulations adopted by the board and delinquent payments, assessed interest and any other amount certified by the board as owed by an employer, may be recovered by action in a court of competent jurisdiction against the reporting agency liable therefor or may, upon due certification of delinquency and at the request of the board of trustees, be deducted from any other monies payable to the reporting agency by any department or agency of the state.
     </p>
     <p>
      5. Each political subdivision of the state and each instrumentality of the state or a political subdivision or subdivisions that submit a plan for approval of the board, as provided in this section, shall reimburse the board for coverage into the expense account, its pro rata share of the total expense of administering Articles 1 and 3 as provided by regulations of the board.
     </p>
     <p>
      The board may, in its discretion, deny the right of membership in this system to any class of employees whose compensation is only partly paid by the state or who are occupying positions on a part-time or intermittent basis. The board may, in its discretion, make optional with employees in any such classes their individual entrance into this system.
     </p>
     <p>
      An employee whose membership in this system is contingent on his own election, and who elects not to become a member, may thereafter apply for and be admitted to membership; but no such employee shall receive prior service credit unless he becomes a member before July 1, 1953, except as provided in paragraph (b).
     </p>
     <p>
      If any member of this system changes his employment to any agency of the state having an actuarially funded retirement system, the board of trustees may authorize the transfer of the member’s creditable service and of the present value of the member’s employer’s accumulation account and of the present value of the member’s accumulated membership contributions to that other system, provided that the employee agrees to the transfer of his accumulated membership contributions and provided that the other system is authorized to receive and agrees to make the transfer.
     </p>
     <p>
      If any member of any other actuarially funded system maintained by an agency of the state changes his employment to an agency covered by this system, the board of trustees may authorize the receipt of the transfer of the member’s creditable service and of the present value of the member’s employer’s accumulation account and of the present value of the member’s accumulated membership contributions from the other system, provided that the employee agrees to the transfer of his accumulated membership contributions to this system and provided that the other system is authorized and agrees to make the transfer.
     </p>
     <p>
      Wherever state employment is referred to in this section, it includes joint employment by state and federal agencies of all kinds.
     </p>
     <p>
      Employees of a political subdivision or instrumentality who were employed by the political subdivision or instrumentality before an agreement between the entity and the Public Employees’ Retirement System to extend the benefits of this article to its employees, and which agreement provides for the establishment of retroactive service credit, and who became members of the retirement system before July 1, 2007, and have remained contributors to the retirement system for four (4) years, or who became members of the retirement system on or after July 1, 2007, and have remained contributors to the retirement system for eight (8) years, may receive credit for that retroactive service with the political subdivision or instrumentality, provided that the employee and/or employer, as provided under the terms of the modification of the joinder agreement in allowing that coverage, pay into the retirement system the employer’s and employee’s contributions on wages paid the member during the previous employment, together with interest or actuarial cost as determined by the board covering the period from the date the service was rendered until the payment for the credit for the service was made. Those wages shall be verified by the Social Security Administration or employer payroll records. Effective July 1, 1998, upon eligibility as noted above, a member may receive credit for that retroactive service with the political subdivision or instrumentality provided:
     </p>
     <p>
      The member shall furnish proof satisfactory to the board of trustees of certification of those services from the political subdivision or instrumentality where the services were rendered or verification by the Social Security Administration; and
     </p>
     <p>
      The member shall pay to the retirement system on the date he or she is eligible for that credit or at any time thereafter before the date of retirement the actuarial cost for each year of that creditable service. The provisions of this subparagraph (ii) shall be subject to the limitations of Section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code and regulations promulgated under Section 415.
     </p>
     <p>
      Nothing contained in this paragraph (k) shall be construed to limit the authority of the board to allow the correction of reporting errors or omissions based on the payment of employee and employer contributions plus applicable interest. Payment for that time shall be made beginning with the most recent service. Upon the payment of all or part of the required contributions, plus interest or the actuarial cost as provided above, the member shall receive credit for the period of creditable service for which full payment has been made to the retirement system.
     </p>
     <p>
      Through June 30, 1998, any state service eligible for retroactive service credit, no part of which has ever been reported, and requiring the payment of employee and employer contributions plus interest, or, from and after July 1, 1998, any state service eligible for retroactive service credit, no part of which has ever been reported to the retirement system, and requiring the payment of the actuarial cost for that creditable service, may, at the member’s option, be purchased in quarterly increments as provided above at the time that its purchase is otherwise allowed.
     </p>
     <p>
      All rights to purchase retroactive service credit or repay a refund as provided in Section 25-11-101 et seq. shall terminate upon retirement.
     </p>
     <p>
      II. THOSE WHO ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR MEMBERSHIP

     <p>
      III. TERMINATION OF MEMBERSHIP

       Pursuant to
   Section 1-1-109, the Joint Legislative Committee on Compilation, Revision and Publication of Legislation corrected a typographical error in (6), as amended by
   Laws of 2002, ch. 627. A comma was inserted after the word “Forces” so that the phrase reads “service on active duty in the Armed Forces, in the Commissioned Corps of the United States Public Health Service prior to 1972 or in such maritime service, . . . .” The Joint Committee ratified the correction at its May 16, 2002, meeting.

      <p>
       Municipal judges may be eligible for membership in the PERS system as municipal employees pursuant to the above statute. Taylor, Nov. 6, 1991, A.G. Op. #91-0734.
      </p>
      <p>
       No state employee may be granted Retirement System credit for more than one day of creditable service for each calendar day, regardless of number of hours worked or number of positions held. Walker, Dec. 28, 1992, A.G. Op. #92-1004.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reading Miss. Code Sections 25-11-103 and 25-11-109 in pari materia, any member of retirement system who terminated during year should be allowed to report no more than amount equal to maximum monthly amount of $10,416.66 (based on maximum annual amount of $125,000) times number of months worked during fiscal year; thus, upon termination, if member has not been reported on maximum monthly amount for each month of service during fiscal year, then part or all of lump-sum payment for unused leave could be reported to system up to allowable proportionate part of maximum for service performed during fiscal year. Walker, Feb. 24, 1993, A.G. Op. #93-0109.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where legal school term is from August 15 through May 25 and employee terminates on January 31, employee would receive credit for months of August through January or total of 6 months, and would receive creditable service for one-half year in accordance with Miss. Code Section 25-11-109(2); this individual would receive credit for month of August based on being employed for fifteen days as required by statute. Walker, May 22, 1993, A.G. Op. #93-0350.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where legal school term is from August 25 through June 2 and employee terminates effective May 31, employee would receive credit for months of September through May or nine months, and would receive three-quarters of year of creditable service in accordance with Miss. Code Section 25-11-109(2). Walker, May 22, 1993, A.G. Op. #93-0350.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where nine-month school employee is unable to fulfill contract for legal school term, and is docked for one week’s pay, but later signs summer school contract and works fifteen days in month of June, employee would receive credit for nine months for school term (working for three weeks during month would still entitle employee to credit for month), and then would receive credit for month during month of June for total of ten months; under Miss. Code Section 25-11-109(2), employee would receive credit for year for ten months service during fiscal year; in other words, employee will be entitled to one year of service credit where such employee has been employed and rendered service for full school term. Walker, May 22, 1993, A.G. Op. #93-0350.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 37-19-1(k) [repealed] governs teaching experience for pay purposes on incremental pay scale set out at Section 37-19-7 and 37-19-17 [repealed]; retirement credit is separate question and is governed by Section 25-11-109(2); where school employee does not render services for full, legal term, then 25-11-109(2) provides that credit for partial years of service may be acquired for retirement purposes in one-quarter year increments. Chaney Oct. 29, 1993, A.G. Op. #93-0798.
      </p>
      <p>
       Determination of whether school employee rendered service for legal school term to extent necessary to qualify for year of service credit must be made by System based on information reported by employer consistent with underlying facts; if employment contract for legal school term has been terminated or abandoned prior to completion, or if services required under contract have not actually been performed, then school employee would not be entitled to creditable service of one year and creditable service would be calculated in accordance with schedule provided within section 25-11-109(2). Walker, Jan. 18, 1994, A.G. Op. #94-0020.
      </p>
      <p>
       Board of Trustees of the System may employ mathematical formula based on compensation paid to create presumption that employment contract for legal school term was completed in order to support finding that service for legal school term was rendered, absent any information to the contrary being reported by employer; awarding of creditable service on this basis is conditional and if, at later date, it is determined that underlying facts are not consistent with presumption, then service credit would be recalculated and awarded in accordance with statutory schedule. Walker, Jan. 18, 1994, A.G. Op. #94-0020.
      </p>
      <p>
       There appears to be no statutory provision which provides for the granting and accumulation of leave for elected officials, except for retirement purposes under section 25-11-109. Truly, March 10, 1995, A.G. Op. #95-0057.
      </p>
      <p>
       Absent an express statutory provision otherwise, under Section 25-11-109(2) an individual serving as an appointed or elected official during a period in which no compensation was paid would not be eligible for creditable service in the Public Employees’ Retirement System. Ready, September 20, 1996, A.G. Op. #96-0472.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pursuant to Section 25-11-109(2), elected officials in the town of Itta Bena, who are not paid on a per diem basis, are covered under the Public Employees’ Retirement System. Irving, October 24, 1996, A.G. Op. #96-0540.
      </p>
      <p>
       School attendance officers, as covered employees, also are allowed to count unused sick leave toward creditable service for purposes of the retirement system pursuant to the provisions Sections 25-11-103 and 25-11-109. Leggett, October 25, 1996, A.G. Op. #96-0505.
      </p>
      <p>
       Upon termination of employment, each school attendance officer’s unused personal leave in excess of thirty days shall be counted as creditable service for the purposes of the retirement system. See Sections 25-11-103 and 25-11-109. Leggett, October 25, 1996, A.G. Op. #96-0505.
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   After compulsory school attendance officers were deemed to be state employees, any accrued leave in excess of 30 days could be transferred to the Public Employees’ Retirement System as service credit, provided a valid leave policy had been adopted and that said policy was identical to the provisions of §§<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t25c11s25-11-103" target="_self">25-11-103</a></cite> and<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t25c11s25-11-109" target="_self">25-11-109</a></cite>.
   Ranck, August 18, 1998, A.G. Op. #98-0314.
      </p>
      <p>
       Elected officials are not covered under a separate leave policy established for their employees.
   Ready, Feb. 16, 2001, A.G. Op. #2001-0046.

    Payment of retirement benefits by the most appropriate means as determined by the board.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The Public Employees’ Retirement System shall make payments of retirement benefits under this chapter to members and to the beneficiaries of those members, by whatever means the board prescribes by regulation to be the most appropriate for the proper and efficient payment of benefits, including, but not limited to, direct deposit to an account with a financial institution that is a participant of the Automated Clearing House designated by the member or beneficiary. The board may provide for alternative means of payment if the member or beneficiary can demonstrate that payment by the prescribed means will cause the member or beneficiary undue hardship.

If a member who has been approved for a disability retirement allowance does not terminate state service within ninety (90) days after approval, the disability retirement and the application for disability retirement shall be void. For the purposes of disability determination, the medical board shall apply the following definition of disability: the inability to perform the usual duties of employment or the incapacity to perform such lesser duties, if any, as the employer, in its discretion, may assign without material reduction in compensation, or the incapacity to perform the duties of any employment covered by the Public Employees’ Retirement System (Section 25-11-101 et seq.) that is actually offered and is within the same general territorial work area, without material reduction in compensation.

Application for a disability retirement allowance must be filed within one (1) year of termination from active service.

       Claimant was not entitled to duty-related disability benefits from the Public Employees’ Retirement System of Mississippi, when the claimant alleged to have been injured from an electrical shock while working as a teacher at a high school, because, given the conflicting medical evidence, there was insufficient objective medical evidence to support the claim that the claimant’s medical condition prevented the claimant from performing the duties of a teacher. Ulrich v. Public Emples. Ret. Sys., — So.3d —, 2019 Miss. App. LEXIS 132 (Miss. Ct. App. Apr. 2, 2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       Denial of a correctional supervisor’s disability benefits on the ground that he failed to provide sufficient evidence to support that he was disabled was supported by substantial evidence because one physician released the supervisor to return to work, and another physician also concluded that he was capable of returning to work; the supervisor was never deemed permanently disabled, and there was never a medical opinion that he was incapacitated from performing his duties.Bradley v. Public Employees' Ret. Sys. of Miss., — So.3d —, 2019 Miss. App. LEXIS 407 (Miss. Ct. App. Aug. 20, 2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       One physician’s opinion is not rendered incompetent or invalid just because another physician later offers different or additional opinions; the persuasiveness of the doctors’ respective opinions is a matter for the Public Employees’ Retirement System to determine, not a reviewing court. Davidson v. Public Emples. Ret. Sys. of Miss., 219 So.3d 577, 2017 Miss. App. LEXIS 277 (Miss. Ct. App. 2017).
      </p>
      <p>
       Circuit court did not err in affirming the decision of the Public Employees’ Retirement System (PERS) to deny a state employee’s request for continued non-duty-related disability benefits because substantial evidence supported PERS’s finding that the employee was capable of returning to work and was no longer disabled; a psychiatrist found no compelling clinical evidence that the employee would be unable to handle the stresses and demands of appropriate employment.
   Davidson v. Public Emples. Ret. Sys. of Miss., 219 So.3d 577, 2017 Miss. App. LEXIS 277 (Miss. Ct. App. 2017).
      </p>
      <p>
       Decision to deny a guidance counselor Public Employees’ Retirement System non-duty related disability benefits was supported by substantial evidence because the counselor failed to present any medical evidence showing she likely suffered a permanent disability; a doctor opined that the counselor’s joint pain, depression, and anxiety could be managed with appropriate treatment, and she did not believe the counselor’s medical problems met the criteria for permanent disability. Dearman v. Public Emples. Ret. Sys. of Miss., 205 So.3d 1100, 2016 Miss. App. LEXIS 798 (Miss. Ct. App. 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       Decision of the Public Employees’ Retirement System of Mississippi to deny an employee duty-related retirement benefits was based on substantial evidence and was not arbitrary of capricious because its conclusion that the employee was not permanently disabled was consistent with testimony from multiple healthcare providers; the employee’s doctors failed to establish that her complaints were supported by medical findings, and she continued to work for five years after she twisted her ankle. Public Emples. Ret. Sys. of Miss. v. Comardelle, 210 So.3d 984, 2015 Miss. App. LEXIS 143 (Miss. Ct. App. 2015).

Moreover, the applicant’s principal certified that she was unable to perform her job duties, which frequently required standing and writing. Public Emples. Ret. Sys. v.

   Decision of the Public Employees’ Retirement System of Mississippi (PERS) denying non-duty related disability benefits to a claimant as PERS’s decision was not supported by substantial evidence and, thus, was properly reversed.

Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t25c11s25-11-113ol11a" target="_self">25-11-113(1)(a)</a></cite> because a doctor had made his diagnosis of degenerative arthritis prior to the employee filing her claim in 1997. The Public Employees’ Retirement System Disability Appeals Committee’s rejection of the diagnosis was without support in the record based on the doctor’s findings. Public Emples. Ret. Sys. v.

      <p>
       Substantial evidence, including that no doctor in an employee’s case concluded that the pain that she alleged to experience prevented her from returning to work and that no doctor offered an opinion with regard to her disability, existed to affirmed the denial of the employee’s request for disability benefits.

   Trial court properly overturned the Mississippi Public Employees’ Retirement System’s denial of disability and retirement benefits to an employee, a teacher and a bus driver, because the decision to deny benefits under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t25c11s25-11-113ol11a" target="_self">25-11-113(1)(a)</a></cite> was not supported by substantial evidence; an internist evaluated the employee and diagnosed the employee with diabetes, cellulitis of the abdomen, and uncontrollable hypertension.

       Circuit court erred when it improperly reweighed the medical evidence in a case in which a public employee sought disability benefits, and the circuit court relied on the impairment rating to find that the employee was disabled.

Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t25c11s25-11-114ol16" target="_self">25-11-114(6)</a></cite> by the Public Employees’ Retirement System of Mississippi because the evidence was sufficient to show that he was not disabled under Miss.

      </p>
      <p>
       <p>

       Trial court erred in reversing administrative board’s decision denying disability benefits which was based on the determination that it was not supported by substantial evidence; however, the board’s decision was supported by substantial evidence, was not arbitrary and capricious, was made within the board’s scope or power, and did not violate the employee’s constitutional rights – the employee failed to meet her burden of proving she was in fact disabled – though she may have needed her surgery, she was clearly able but unwilling to return to her job; the record clearly supported the board’s order, which took into consideration all of the medical evidence, which did not establish that the employee’s ailments were disabling.

       While the appellate court determined that medical evidence suggested a 55-year-old state university employee at times did suffer from physical and mental difficulties (primarily depression that was aggravated by a transfer to a more demanding position), substantial evidence also suggested that there was no clear reason explaining a connection between her lower extremity pain and her depression, and no showing that these illnesses were permanent. Substantial evidence supported the agency ruling that the employee was ineligible for disability benefits. Purnell v. Public Emples. Ret. Sys., 894 So. 2d 597, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 877 (Miss. Ct.

       Where a teacher presented substantial medical evidence that she suffered from chronic fatigue syndrome and that the effects rendered her unable to perform her duties, the Public Employees’ Retirement System (PERS) denial of disability benefits was arbitrary and capricious as not being supported by substantial evidence in the record where there was no evidence on the record to contradict the teacher’s evidence, where PERS failed to conduct an independent medical examination of the teacher though it had the right to do so, and where it relied on its own evaluation and the opinions of its own reviewing physicians in reaching its decision.

       Mississippi Public Employees’ Retirement System’s (PERS) decision denying the claimant disability benefits was arbitrary and capricious and had to be reversed because (1) the claimant’s supervisor certified that the claimant was no longer able to function in the claimant’s job as a result of the claimant’s medical problems; (2) all of the claimant’s duties would be affected as the claimant was an equipment mechanic, which position required that the claimant do stringent work; (3) three doctors stated that the claimant was permanently disabled; and (4) the PERS had no controverting evidence in the face of medical diagnoses made by credible doctors.

       As the overwhelming and undisputed evidence showed that the claimant was disabled from work due to diabetes, and the Public Employees’ Retirement System’s disability appeals committee made no findings in support of its denial of benefits, its decision was reversed as arbitrary and capricious and unsupported by substantial evidence.

       A denial of benefits was not based on substantial evidence where the claimant was denied benefits because her medical evidence was characterized as subjective, because she stopped working soon after receiving a threatening phone call at school, and because she was able to continue working for many years despite her medical problems.

   Administrative finding that an employee was not disabled was held to be proper because whether the employee was “disabled” was for the Board of Trustees of the Public Employees’ Retirement System of Mississippi to determine and not for her employer. Furthermore, the statutory definition for “disability” was applied, as required by Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t25c11s25-11-113ol11a" target="_self">25-11-113(1)(a)</a></cite>.

       Disability Appeals Committee failed to point to any objective evidence in the record to indicate the nurse’s fibromyalgia did not exist and did not contribute to her disabling condition. Wright v. Public Employees' Ret. Sys., 24 So.3d 382, 2009 Miss. App. LEXIS 942 (Miss. Ct. App. 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       Court could not see how the Disability Appeals Committee (DAC) could base its 2003 denial on its conclusion that the nurse was treated optimally, and turn around in 2007 and claim the same report from the psychiatrist illustrated the nurse did not receive adequate treatment for her illness and needed to be optimized; the psychiatrist offered no new findings to the DAC in 2007 and it reviewed the same report as it had earlier in 2003. Furthermore, these inconsistent findings did not concern mere collateral matters, but instead, these contradictory conclusions formed the main bases the DAC relied upon in 2003 and on remand in 2007 to deny the nurse’s claim; the DAC’s puzzling contradictory analysis left the impression that its decision was indeed arbitrary and without support of substantial, objective evidence. Wright v. Public Employees' Ret. Sys., 24 So.3d 382, 2009 Miss. App. LEXIS 942 (Miss. Ct. App. 2009).

      <p>
       Acting de novo is not the appellate court’s role on review, and if the court upheld the decision that the employee was not disabled as a result of depression for disability retirement benefits purposes, the court would have been acting de novo. Case v. Pub. Emples. Ret. Sys., 973 So. 2d 301, 2008 Miss. App. LEXIS 52 (Miss. Ct. App. 2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Primary issue before the court was not whether there was evidence to support the employee’s disability, but whether there was substantial evidence to support the finding that she was not disabled for disability retirement benefit determination under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t25c11s25-11-113ol11a" target="_self">25-11-113(1)(a)</a></cite>. Case v. Pub. Emples. Ret. Sys., 973 So. 2d 301, 2008 Miss. App. LEXIS 52 (Miss. Ct.

Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t25c11s25-11-113ol11a" target="_self">25-11-113(1)(a)</a></cite> regarding an employee’s physical condition was supported by substantial evidence, the court was unable to do so with regard to her mental condition for purposes of Miss.

   There was no dispute that the former employee suffered from various ailments such as Chron’s disease, sarcoidosis and sarcoiliitis, but most of her medical records primarily dealt with various check-ups with notations such as “unremarkable.” The pertinent question the employee was required to address was whether her ailments rendered her disabled as defined by Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t25c11s25-11-113" target="_self">25-11-113</a></cite>; the Public Employees’ Retirement System of Mississippi (PERS) presented sufficient evidence to support its finding that she was not disabled where the only proof submitted by the former employee that she could no longer perform the usual duties of her employment was her own testimony at the hearing, which centered on neck and back pain, in other words, ailments different from what she had asserted in her claim, and where she claimed that she had resigned from her job per doctor’s order, but she failed to produce documentation thereon. Public Emples. Ret. Sys. v. Burt, 919 So. 2d 1150, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 975 (Miss. Ct. App. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       First doctor diagnosed the claimant a former carpenter with a state university, with diffuse myofascial disease, chronic depression, and chronic fibromyalgia and stated that the claimant’s disability was permanent and he would require an indefinite amount of treatment, and the second doctor determined that the claimant was permanently disabled due to fibromyalgia and depression; in light of the objective diagnoses made by the treating doctors, the Mississippi Public Employees’ Retirement System’s conclusion that the claimant was not disabled and not entitled to benefits was not substantiated by the record. Public Emples. Ret. Sys. v. Bishop, 942 So. 2d 259, 2006 Miss. App. LEXIS 826 (Miss. Ct. App. 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       Circuit court’s overruling of the Mississippi Public Employees’ Retirement System’s denial of disability benefits to a teacher was reversed, as substantial evidence supported the agency’s decision. However, the teacher was to submit to an evaluation by a physician of the agency’s choice, as well as an updated exam by her physician if she so chose. Public Emples. Ret. Sys. v. Howard, 905 So. 2d 1279, 2005 Miss. LEXIS 387 (Miss. 2005).

       Section 3 of ch. 389, Laws of 2010, effective July 1, 2010 (approved March 17, 2010), amended this section. Section 2 of ch. 528, Laws of 2010, effective July 1, 2010 (approved April 14, 2010), also amended this section. The amendments to this section do not conform and do not meet the Joint Committee’s criteria for integration. As set out above, this section reflects the language of Section 2 of ch. 528, Laws of 2010, pursuant to
   Section 1-3-79, which provides that whenever the same section of law is amended by different bills during the same legislative session, and the effective dates of the amendments are the same, the amendment with the latest approval date shall supersede all other amendments to the same section approved on an earlier date.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pursuant to
   Section 1-1-109, the Joint Legislative Committee on Compilation, Revision and Publication of Legislation corrected errors in statutory references in paragraph (e) of subsection (2) by substituting “paragraph (d)(i) of this subsection” for “paragraph (d)(i) of this section” both times it appears in the first sentence and “paragraph (d)(i) of this subsection” for “(d)(i) of this subsection” in the last sentence. The Joint Committee ratified the correction at its July 22, 2010, meeting.

       There was no violation of due process where a physician examined the claimant and provided a diagnosis and recommendation, and then voted with his fellow members of the medical board in the initial administrative determination to deny the claimant’s application for disability retirement benefits as such procedure was justifiable by weighing the importance of the claimant’s interests against the risk of an erroneous decision and the costs of alternative procedures.

       Claimant was not entitled to duty-related disability benefits from the Public Employees’ Retirement System of Mississippi, when the claimant alleged to have been injured from an electrical shock while working as a teacher at a high school, because the claimant failed to prove that the claimant’s disability was related to a traumatic event that occurred while teaching.

       Substantial evidence supported a decision of a Board of Trustees of the Public Employees’ Retirement System because an employee had the burden of persuading the Disability Appeals Committee, and the employee failed to show that her problems associated with carpal tunnel syndrome were the result of an accident or trauma.

Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t25c11s25-11-114ol16" target="_self">25-11-114(6)</a></cite> was improper where there was not one accident or traumatic event that caused his disability; the employee had a significant history of multiple back injuries, accidents, and medical treatment, both prior and subsequent to the current incident.

      <p>
       Finding of Board of Trustees of Public Employees’ Retirement System (PERS), that employee’s disability was not result of work-related accident in which she was shoved against wall and fell against her shoulder, was supported by substantial evidence, including evidence that employee was diagnosed with carpal tunnel syndrome over one year prior to accident, and physician’s testimony that she had no trauma other than contusion on shoulder after accident. Brinston v. Public Emples. Retirement Sys., 706 So. 2d 258, 1998 Miss. App. LEXIS 61 (Miss. Ct. App. 1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       Board of Trustees of Public Employees’ Retirement System (PERS) did not act arbitrarily and capriciously in declining to employ rationale of workers’ compensation law in determining whether employee’s work-related accident was direct cause of her disability so as to entitle her to PERS benefits; statutory requirements for workers’ compensation and PERS benefits were separate and distinct. Brinston v. Public Emples. Retirement Sys., 706 So. 2d 258, 1998 Miss. App. LEXIS 61 (Miss. Ct. App. 1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       Employee’s carpal tunnel syndrome evolved over a period of time, rather than resulting from single work-related accident in which she was shoved against wall, and denial of benefits by Board of Trustees of Public Employees’ Retirement System (PERS) thus did not violate statute providing that person who has been employee for less than four years is entitled to retirement allowance only upon becoming disabled as direct result of accident incurred in line of duty.

       Circuit court erred by substituting its judgment in place of a public employees’ retirement system’s decision to deny a teacher line of duty disability benefits based on contradictory evidence as to whether or not the teacher was unable to perform the duties of the job; it was within the province of the system to decide which evidence was believable.

       Evidence was sufficient to support a finding that the claimant was not permanently disabled where one physician felt that the claimant’s chances of returning to work were poor regardless of what treatment she received for her back condition, but, to the contrary, another physician felt that if the claimant had surgery, her chances for a full recovery were good and the latter physician, as well as the therapist who administered the claimant’s functional capacity evaluation, were of the opinion that she was ready to return to work without further medical treatment.

       Denial of a correctional supervisor’s disability benefits on the ground that he failed to provide sufficient evidence to support that he was disabled was supported by substantial evidence because one physician released the supervisor to return to work, and another physician also concluded that he was capable of returning to work; the supervisor was never deemed permanently disabled, and there was never a medical opinion that he was incapacitated from performing his duties.

       Public Employees’ Retirement System (PERS) Board of Trustees did not err in denying the claim a deceased PERS member’s sister because the member’s husband was entitled to lifetime spousal survivor benefits, notwithstanding the fact he was convicted of aggravated driving under the influence in connection with the member’s death; the husband did not willfully cause the member’s death under the slayer statutes, and he had been married to the member for over one year.

       Decision of the Public Employees’ Retirement System of Mississippi to deny an employee duty-related retirement benefits was based on substantial evidence and was not arbitrary of capricious because ample evidence supported its findings that the employee’s condition was not disabling; the examining physicians, as well as an occupational therapist, did not believe that the employee’s diagnosis was supported by medical findings.

       In light of the physician’s findings which were part of the record, the appellate court could not agree with the Disability Appeals Committee that the only record documenting an alleged accident was one by the physician reporting that the employee got injured by lifting a heavy patient, and the record contained an incident report completed by the employee; the neck and shoulder injuries which resulted from the 1995 car accident were duty-related in that a vehicle struck the employee’s vehicle as the employee was traveling to a home visit pursuant to duties as a visiting home health nurse, and by providing the committee with the employee’s medical records and the incident report, the employee satisfied the employee’s burden of establishing that the employee was disabled as a result of an on-the-job injury.

Any member who became a member of the system on or after July 1, 2007, but before July 1, 2011, and who has at least twenty-eight (28) years of creditable service at the time of retirement may select the maximum retirement benefit or any optional benefit as provided in this subsection together with a partial lump-sum distribution. Any member who became a member of the system on or after July 1, 2011, and who has at least thirty-three (33) years of creditable service at the time of retirement may select the maximum retirement benefit or any optional benefit as provided in this subsection together with a partial lump-sum distribution. The amount of the lump-sum distribution under this option shall be equal to the maximum monthly benefit multiplied by twelve (12), twenty-four (24) or thirty-six (36) as selected by the member. The maximum retirement benefit shall be actuarially reduced to reflect the amount of the lump-sum distribution selected and further reduced for any other optional benefit selected. The annuity and lump-sum distribution shall be computed to result in no actuarial loss to the system. The lump-sum distribution shall be made as a single payment payable at the time the first monthly annuity payment is paid to the retiree. The amount of the lump-sum distribution shall be deducted from the member’s annuity savings account in computing what contributions remain at the death of the retiree and/or a beneficiary. The lump-sum distribution option may be elected only once by a member upon initial retirement, and may not be elected by a retiree, by members applying for a disability retirement annuity, or by survivors.

Members who are pursuing a disability retirement allowance and simultaneously or later elect to begin to receive a service retirement allowance while continuing to pursue a disability retirement allowance, shall not be eligible to select Option 6 and that option may not be selected at a later time if the application for a disability retirement allowance is voided or denied. However, any retired member who is receiving a retirement allowance under Option 2 or Option 4-A upon July 1, 1992, and whose designated beneficiary predeceased him or her or whose marriage to a spouse who is his or her designated beneficiary is terminated by divorce or other dissolution, upon written notification to the retirement system of the death of the designated beneficiary or of the termination of the retired member’s marriage to the designated beneficiary, the retirement allowance payable to the member after receipt of that notification by the retirement system shall be equal to the retirement allowance that would have been payable if the member had not elected the option. In addition, any retired member who is receiving the maximum retirement allowance for life, a retirement allowance under Option 1 or who is receiving a retirement allowance under Option 2 or Option 4-A on July 1, 1992, may elect to provide survivor benefits under Option 2 or Option 4-A to a spouse who was not previously the member’s beneficiary and whom the member married before July 1, 1992.

That election must be made in writing to the office of the executive director of the system on a form prescribed by the board.

       The 2007 amendment deleted former Option 4-C, which read: “Such retirement allowance otherwise payable may be converted into a retirement allowance of equivalent actuarial value in such an amount that, with the member's benefit under Title II of the federal Social Security Act, the member will receive, so far as possible, approximately the same amount annually before and after the earliest age at which the member becomes eligible to receive a social security benefit. This option shall not be available to retirees whose retirement is effective on or after July 1, 2004”; in Option 6, inserted “became a member of the system before July 1, 2007 and who” in the first sentence, added the second sentence, and deleted “or by a member selecting Option 4-C” from the end; deleted “Option 4-C or” preceding “Option 6” in the second sentence of (2); and made minor stylistic changes.

       While it was error for the Public Employees’ Retirement System (PERS) and the lower courts to use the current statutes to determine who received a retiree’s benefits after her death and the death of her named beneficiary, where all involved should have looked to the former statute as part and parcel of the contract between the retiree and PERS, the error was harmless where the end result was substantially similar to that for which the retiree contracted.

       It is the intent of the Public Employees’ Retirement System to provide benefit payments in an efficient manner consistent with the member’s best interest. The system shall not knowingly allow payments to be made directly to persons who are determined legally incompetent or incapable of managing or directing the management of benefits. Any person applying for or receiving benefits who comes to be known as incapable of applying for, managing or directing the management of benefits by reason of mental or physical impairment, as certified by a medical doctor, shall be directed to obtain a conservator or legal guardian for purposes of applying for, receiving, managing and/or directing benefit payments. In the absence of a conservator or legal guardian or valid durable power of attorney, the Public Employees’ Retirement System may designate a representative payee for such purposes. The benefit recipient may nominate a representative payee for consideration by the system in selecting a payee, and the system is responsible for selecting a payee, including an agency, organization, or institution, that will serve the interest of the benefit recipient. The system may also accept the Social Security Administration’s designation of a representative payee to manage and direct funds paid by the system.

In the event of death before retirement of any member whose spouse and/or children are not entitled to a retirement allowance, the accumulated contributions to the credit of the deceased member in the annuity savings account shall be paid to the designated beneficiary on file in writing in the office of the executive director of the board of trustees within ninety (90) days from receipt of a properly completed form requesting the payment.

The payment of the refund shall discharge all obligations of the retirement system to the member on account of any creditable service rendered by the member before the receipt of the refund. By the acceptance of the refund, the member shall waive and relinquish all accrued rights in the system.

       Under the Unemployment Compensation Amendments of 1992 (Public Law 102-318 (UCA)), a member or the spouse of a member who is an eligible beneficiary entitled to a refund under this section may elect, on a form prescribed by the board under rules and regulations established by the board, to have an eligible rollover distribution of accumulated contributions payable under this section paid directly to an eligible retirement plan, as defined under applicable federal law, or an individual retirement account. If the member or the spouse of a member who is an eligible beneficiary makes that election and specifies the eligible retirement plan or individual retirement account to which the distribution is to be paid, the distribution will be made in the form of a direct trustee-to-trustee transfer to the specified eligible retirement plan. A nonspouse beneficiary may elect to have an eligible rollover distribution paid in the form of a direct trustee-to-trustee transfer to an individual retirement account established to receive the distribution on behalf of the nonspouse beneficiary. Flexible rollovers under this subsection shall not be considered assignments under Section 25-11-129.

       Public Employees’ Retirement System (PERS) Board of Trustees did not err in denying the claim a deceased PERS member’s sister because the member’s husband was entitled to lifetime spousal survivor benefits, notwithstanding the fact he was convicted of aggravated driving under the influence in connection with the member’s death; the husband did not willfully cause the member’s death under the slayer statutes, and he had been married to the member for over one year.

       Mississippi Supreme Court has applied the same statutory principles of the “slayer statutes” where the property at issue was life insurance proceeds rather than an inheritance; the same principles would apply to Public Employees’ Retirement System benefits for the strong public policy against allowing someone to profit from involvement in the death of another.

       While it was error for the Public Employees’ Retirement System (PERS) and the lower courts to use the current statutes determine who received a retiree’s benefits after her death and the death of her named beneficiary, where all involved should have looked to the former statute as part and parcel of the contract between the retiree and PERS, the error was harmless where the end result was substantially similar to that for which the retiree contracted.

       Retiree’s family gets the actuarial equivalent of the remaining guaranteed payments when both the retiree and her designated beneficiary (or beneficiaries) are dead; the limited exception is that any monthly check already written but not cashed by the deceased beneficiary (plus any cost-of-living adjustment for payments already made) shall be paid to that beneficiary’s surviving family members. Therefore, in a case where both a retiree and her beneficiary were deceased, the retiree’s family, rather than the beneficiary’s family, received the rest of the guaranteed payments. Vaughn v.

       Circuit court’s decision to affirm the Public Employees’ Retirement System of Mississippi Board of Trustees was not arbitrary and capricious because neither one of the supervisor’s treating physicians ever stated that he was disabled at the time of his resignation; medical records indicated that the supervisor suffered only a contusion and strain, not an acute injury. Bradley v. Public Employees' Ret. Sys. of Miss., — So.3d —, 2019 Miss. App. LEXIS 407 (Miss. Ct. App. Aug. 20, 2019).

      <p>
       Decision of the Public Employees’ Retirement System of Mississippi to deny an employee duty-related retirement benefits was based on substantial evidence and was not arbitrary of capricious because ample evidence supported its findings that the employee’s condition was not disabling; the examining physicians, as well as an occupational therapist, did not believe that the employee’s diagnosis was supported by medical findings. Public Emples. Ret. Sys. of Miss. v. Comardelle, 210 So.3d 984, 2015 Miss. App. LEXIS 143 (Miss. Ct. App. 2015).

      <p>
       Decision of the Public Employees’ Retirement System of Mississippi to deny an employee duty-related retirement benefits was based on substantial evidence and was not arbitrary of capricious because its conclusion that the employee was not permanently disabled was consistent with testimony from multiple healthcare providers; the employee’s doctors failed to establish that her complaints were supported by medical findings, and she continued to work for five years after she twisted her ankle.

       Public Employees’ Retirement System of Mississippi Board of Trustees did not violate a former state employee’s due process rights to a fair hearing by not obtaining additional medical records because the employee could not claim the employee’s due process rights were violated by the employee’s own failure to present a full set of medical records. Furthermore, the Board determined that sufficient evidence had been presented and that no additional evidence was needed to reach its decision to deny disability benefits. Richardson v. Public Emples. Ret. Sys. of Miss., — So.3d —, 2019 Miss. App. LEXIS 456 (Miss. Ct. App. Sept. 17, 2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       Public Employees’ Retirement System did not err in failing to request additional medical records because a guidance counselor produced almost no objective medical evidence regarding her physical and or psychological condition, and what she did produce did not support a finding of permanent disability; also, doctors’ letters did not conclude the counselor was permanently disabled.

       Although appellant claimed that the Public Employees’ Retirement System’s medical board’s decision, which adopted the recommendation of the disability appeals committee, should be reversed because the board failed to obtain a doctor’s medical records, appellant only raised this issue for the first time when she appealed the board’s decision to the circuit court, and appellant did not list the doctor on her medical information form as one of the physicians who had treated her within the last five years. Thus, the issue was without merit. Roberts v. Public Emples. Ret. Sys. of Miss., 198 So.3d 463, 2016 Miss. App. LEXIS 494 (Miss. Ct. App. 2016).

       A claimant’s statutory guarantees of due process were violated when a physician sat in judgment of his own conclusion that the claimant was not entitled to disability benefits; the physician was a member of the Medical Review Board that originally denied the claim, and he also sat on the Disability Appeals Committee.

   Public Employees’ Retirement System’s (PERS) denial of disability benefits to the employee was improper because the record contained uncontradicted medical diagnoses of fibromyalgia, piriformis syndrome, Sjogren’s syndrome, and depression, along with a doctor’s uncontradicted opinion that the employee was disabled as a result of those four conditions. PERS never exercised its option to order an independent medical evaluation of the employee and PERS was required to base its decision upon evidence in the record before the agency pursuant to Miss.

      All of the assets of the system shall be credited according to the purpose for which they are held to one (1) of four (4) reserves; namely, the annuity savings account, the annuity reserve, the employer’s accumulation account, and the expense account.
     </p>

Future contributions shall be fixed biennially by the board on the basis of the liabilities of the retirement system for the various allowances and benefits as shown by actuarial valuation; however, any member earning at a rate less than Sixteen Dollars and Sixty-seven Cents ($16.67) per month, or Two Hundred Dollars ($200.00) per year, shall contribute not less than One Dollar ($1.00) per month, or Twelve Dollars ($12.00) per year.

       The deductions provided in paragraph (1) of this subsection shall be made notwithstanding that the minimum compensation provided by law for any member is reduced by the deduction. Every member shall be deemed to consent and agree to the deductions made and provided for in paragraph (1) of this subsection and shall receipt for his full salary or compensation, and payment of salary or compensation less the deduction shall be a full and complete discharge and acquittance of all claims and demands whatsoever for the services rendered by the person during the period covered by the payment, except as to the benefits provided under Articles 1 and 3. The board shall provide by rules for the methods of collection of contributions from members and the employer.

        The employer shall make deductions from salaries of employees as provided in Articles 1 and 3 and shall transmit monthly, or at such time as the board of trustees designates, the amount specified to be deducted to the Executive Director of the Public Employees’ Retirement System. The executive director, after making a record of all those receipts, shall deposit such amounts as provided by law.
       </p>
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      Annuity reserve.The annuity reserve shall be the account representing the actuarial value of all annuities in force, and to it shall be charged all annuities and all benefits in lieu of annuities, payable as provided in this article. If a beneficiary retired on account of disability is restored to active service with a compensation not less than his average final compensation at the time of his last retirement, the remainder of his contributions shall be transferred from the annuity reserve to the annuity savings account and credited to his individual account therein, and the balance of his annuity reserve shall be transferred to the employer’s accumulation account.
     </p>
     <p>
      Employer’s accumulation account.The employer’s accumulation account shall represent the accumulation of all reserves for the payment of all retirement allowances and other benefits payable from contributions made by the employer, and against this account shall be charged all retirement allowances and other benefits on account of members. Credits to and charges against the employer’s accumulation account shall be made as follows:
     </p>
     <p>
      On account of each member there shall be paid monthly into the employer’s accumulation account by the employers for the preceding fiscal year an amount equal to a certain percentage of the total earned compensation, as defined in Section 25-11-103, of each member. The percentage rate of those contributions shall be fixed biennially by the board on the basis of the liabilities of the retirement system for the various allowances and benefits as shown by actuarial valuation. Beginning January 1, 1990, the rate shall be fixed at nine and three-fourths percent (9-3/4%). The board shall reduce the employer’s contribution rate by one percent (1%) from and after July 1 of the year following the year in which the board determines and the board’s actuary certifies that the employer’s contribution rate can be reduced by that amount without causing the unfunded accrued actuarial liability amortization period for the retirement system to exceed twenty (20) years. Political subdivisions joining Article 3 of the Public Employees’ Retirement System after July 1, 1968, may adjust the employer’s contributions by agreement with the Board of Trustees of the Public Employees’ Retirement System to provide service credits for any period before execution of the agreement based upon an actuarial determination of employer’s contribution rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      On the basis of regular interest and of such mortality and other tables as are adopted by the board of trustees, the actuary engaged by the board to make each valuation required by this article during the period over which the accrued liability contribution is payable, immediately after making that valuation, shall determine the uniform and constant percentage of the earnable compensation of each member which, if contributed by the employer on the basis of compensation of the member throughout his entire period of membership service, would be sufficient to provide for the payment of any retirement allowance payable on his account for that service. The percentage rate so determined shall be known as the “normal contribution rate.” After the accrued liability contribution has ceased to be payable, the normal contribution rate shall be the percentage rate of the salary of all members obtained by deducting from the total liabilities on account of membership service the amount in the employer’s accumulation account, and dividing the remainder by one percent (1%) of the present value of the prospective future salaries of all members as computed on the basis of the mortality and service tables adopted by the board of trustees and regular interest. The normal rate of contributions shall be determined by the actuary after each valuation.
     </p>
     <p>
      Expense account.The expense account shall be the account to which the expenses of the administration of the system shall be charged, exclusive of amounts payable as retirement allowances and as other benefits provided herein. The Legislature shall make annual appropriations in amounts sufficient to administer the system, which shall be credited to this account. There shall be transferred to the State Treasury from this account, not less than once per month, an amount sufficient for payment of the estimated expenses of the system for the succeeding thirty (30) days. Any interest earned on the expense account shall accrue to the benefit of the system. However, notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 25-11-15(10) and 25-11-105(f)(v)5, all expenses of the administration of the system shall be paid from the interest earnings, provided the interest earnings are in excess of the actuarial interest assumption as determined by the board, and provided the present cost of the administrative expense fee of two percent (2%) of the contributions reported by the political subdivisions and instrumentalities shall be reduced to one percent (1%) from and after July 1, 1983, through June 30, 1984, and shall be eliminated thereafter.
     </p>
     <p>
      Collection of contributions.The employer shall cause to be deducted on each and every payroll of a member for each and every payroll period, beginning subsequent to January 31, 1953, the contributions payable by the member as provided in Articles 1 and 3.
     </p>
     <p>
      (1) Upon the basis of each actuarial valuation provided herein, the board of trustees shall biennially determine the normal contribution rate and the accrued liability contribution rate as provided in this section. The sum of these two (2) rates shall be known as the “employer’s contribution rate.” Beginning on earned compensation effective January 1, 1990, the rate computed as provided in this section shall be nine and three-fourths percent (9-3/4%). The board shall reduce the employer’s contribution rate by one percent (1%) from and after July 1 of the year following the year in which the board determines and the board’s actuary certifies that the employer’s contribution rate can be reduced by that amount without causing the unfunded accrued actuarial liability amortization period for the retirement system to exceed twenty (20) years. The percentage rate of those contributions shall be fixed biennially by the board on the basis of the liabilities of the retirement system for the various allowances and benefits as shown by actuarial valuation.
     </p>
     <p>
      The amount payable by the employer on account of normal and accrued liability contributions shall be determined by applying the employer’s contribution rate to the amount of compensation earned by employees who are members of the system. Monthly, or at such time as the board of trustees designates, each department or agency shall compute the amount of the employer’s contribution payable, with respect to the salaries of its employees who are members of the system, and shall cause that amount to be paid to the board of trustees from the personal service allotment of the amount appropriated for the operation of the department or agency, or from funds otherwise available to the agency, for the payment of salaries to its employees.
     </p>
     <p>
      Except as otherwise provided in Section 25-11-106:
     </p>
     <p>
      Constables shall pay employer and employee contributions on their net fee income as well as the employee contributions on all direct treasury or county payroll income.
     </p>
     <p>
      The county shall be responsible for the employer contribution on all direct treasury or county payroll income of constables.
     </p>
     <p>
      Except as otherwise provided in Section 25-11-106.1, chancery and circuit clerks shall be responsible for both the employer and employee share of contributions on the proportionate share of net income attributable to fees, as well as the employee share of net income attributable to direct treasury or county payroll income, and the employing county shall be responsible for the employer contributions on the net income attributable to direct treasury or county payroll income.
     </p>
     <p>
      Once each year, under procedures established by the system, each employer shall submit to the Public Employees’ Retirement System a copy of their report to Social Security of all employees’ earnings.
     </p>
     <p>
      The board shall provide by rules for the methods of collection of contributions of employers and members. The amounts determined due by an agency to the various funds as specified in Articles 1 and 3 are made obligations of the agency to the board and shall be paid as provided herein. Failure to deduct those contributions shall not relieve the employee and employer from liability thereof. Delinquent employee contributions and any accrued interest shall be the obligation of the employee and delinquent employer contributions and any accrued interest shall be the obligation of the employer. The employer may, in its discretion, elect to pay any or all of the interest on delinquent employee contributions. From and after July 1, 1996, under rules and regulations established by the board, all employers are authorized and shall transfer all funds due to the Public Employees’ Retirement System electronically and shall transmit any wage or other reports by computerized reporting systems.

       The use of the actuarial cost of benefits to establish previous service credit is not authorized under Sections 25-11-105 and 25-11-123. However, these provisions authorize the Board of Trustees to determine the rate of interest that will be applied under section 25-11-105(k) and as part of the calculation to determine the adjusted employer's contribution rate under section 25-11-123(c)(1).

The county is not obligated to pay matching contributions for such fees as those earned in serving process. Moore, May 14, 2004, A.G. Op. 03-0315.

     <p>
      Each employer shall pick up the member contributions required by Section 25-11-123, Mississippi Code of 1972, for all compensation earned after June 30, 1982, and the contributions so picked up shall be treated as employer contributions in determining tax treatment under the United States Internal Revenue Code and the Mississippi Income Tax Code; however, each employer shall continue to withhold federal and state income taxes based upon such contributions until the internal revenue service or the federal courts rule that, pursuant to Section 414(h) of the United States Internal Revenue Code, these contributions shall not be included as gross income of the member until such time as they are distributed or made available. The employer shall pay these member contributions from the same source of funds which is used in paying earnings to the member. The employer may pick up these contributions by a reduction in the cash salary of the member, or by an offset against a future salary increase, or by a combination of a reduction in salary and offset against a future salary increase. If member contributions are picked up they shall be treated for all purposes of the Public Employees’ Retirement System in the same manner and to the same extent as member contributions made prior to the date picked up.

       As a retiree continuing in office, the wages of a county judge can not be more than 25% of his final average compensation paid on a prorated basis as earned, that is, each month the retiree would be entitled to receive 1/12th of the 25% of final average compensation. Webster, Sept. 20, 2002, A.G. Op. #02-0455.

       A state retiree who is elected to a municipal or county office, after making the required filings, is authorized to receive compensation for serving in that elective office an amount not to exceed twenty-five of said retiree’s average compensation, to be paid on a pro-rata basis.

       Even if the position of warden for a correctional facility is classified as a contract position, an individual would not be able to draw a retirement benefit while employed as the warden. Palmer, July 25, 2003, A.G. Op. 03-0240.

       Employees covered by the State and School Employees Health Insurance Plan who elect to retire and are re-employed under the limited conditions allowed by this section do not relinquish their status of “retiree” for the purposes of the retirement statutes or the state insurance statutes. Therefore, the state cannot pay the insurance premiums for retirees who are covered under the Plan who return to work under the limited conditions allowed by this section. Hill, Nov. 7, 2003, A.G. Op. 03-0591.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where there is authority for the employer to pay non-taxable life and health insurance premiums, the payment of such premiums is not to be used in the calculation of the 25% income limitation or in calculating the limited compensation under the half-time/half-pay option. Ross, Sept. 24, 2004, A.G. Op. 04-0400.

       The salary of a family member would not count as part of the twenty-five percent compensation of a retired circuit or chancery clerk. McLeod, Mar. 11, 2005, A.G. Op. 05-0056.

       Trial court properly upheld an order from the Mississippi Public Employees’ Retirement System concluding that a city employee was not eligible for disability retirement benefits until February 1, 2001, where the employee’s employment with the city was not severed until the employee resigned on January 30, 2001; the employee was not entitled to back benefits.

The board of trustees of the Teachers’ Retirement System shall at that time make a full and complete report and accounting as to all funds and securities in its possession and under its control, and shall transfer all books, records, papers, and equipment under its control to the board of trustees of the Public Employees’ Retirement System.

Where necessary, an additional retirement benefit shall be made to any retired teacher under this section in order to provide a minimum retirement benefit of Forty Dollars ($40.00) per month. From and after July 1, 1968, each and every benefit payment outlined above shall be increased by twenty-five percent (25%), making the minimum payment Fifty Dollars ($50.00) per month and the maximum payment Seventy-five Dollars ($75.00) per month.

The payment of these benefits is hereby made an obligation of the State of Mississippi. The Legislature shall annually appropriate an amount sufficient to pay these benefits which shall be credited to a trust fund to be designated as “Fund B.” Payment of benefits to members of the Teachers’ Retirement System retired prior to July 1, 1952, shall be paid from said “Fund B” and from no other source, except that any public school district or public junior college, by action of the board of trustees thereof, with funds derived locally, may provide additional supplementary benefits for teachers retired on or before July 1, 1952, but not to exceed one percent of the instructional budget in any fiscal year shall be so used.

     </h3>
     <p>
      There is hereby established and placed under the management of the Board of Trustees of the Public Employees’ Retirement System of Mississippi a supplemental legislative retirement plan for the purpose of providing supplemental retirement allowances and other benefits under the provisions of this article for elected members of the State Legislature and the President of the Senate and their beneficiaries. The retirement plan provided by this article shall go into operation on July 1, 1989, when contributions by members shall begin and benefits shall become payable. This retirement plan is designed to supplement and is in addition to the provisions of Section 25-11-1 et seq. Under the terms of this article, the members of the State Legislature and the President of the Senate shall retain all social security benefits under Article 1 and additional state retirement and disability benefits under Article 3 of the Public Employees’ Retirement Law of 1952, as amended. This article is a supplement to those sections, and is designed to provide more benefits for members of the State Legislature and the President of the Senate by reason of their service to the state.

       Dismissal for failure to state a claim of a retired state employee’s equal protection challenge to the Legislature’s establishment of a supplemental retirement plan for legislators was proper; since the different treatment of retired legislators had a rational basis in the financial uncertainties they risked, the proper course in seeking a remedy was political, not judicial.

The refund of the contributions to the credit of the member in the annuity savings account shall be paid within ninety (90) days from receipt in the office of the retirement system of the properly completed form requesting that payment.

If the member or the spouse of a member who is an eligible beneficiary makes that election and specifies the eligible retirement plan or individual retirement account to which the distribution is to be paid, the distribution will be made in the form of a direct trustee-to-trustee transfer to the specified eligible retirement plan. A nonspouse beneficiary may elect to have an eligible rollover distribution of accumulated contributions paid in the form of a direct trustee-to-trustee transfer to an individual retirement account established to receive the distribution on behalf of the nonspouse beneficiary.

      Each participant shall contribute monthly to the optional retirement program the same amount that he or she would be required to contribute to the Public Employees’ Retirement System of Mississippi if he or she were a member of that retirement system. Participant contributions may be made by a reduction in salary in accordance with the provisions of Section 403(b) of the United States Internal Revenue Code or any amendment thereto, or in accordance with Section 25-11-124, as may be appropriate under the determination made in accordance with Section 25-11-421. The entirety of each participant’s contribution shall be remitted to the appropriate company or companies for application to the participant’s contracts or accounts, or both. Each employer of a participant in the optional retirement program shall contribute on behalf of each participant in the optional retirement program the same amount the employer would be required to contribute to the Public Employees’ Retirement System of Mississippi if the participant were a member of the retirement system. The employer’s contribution shall be remitted as follows:
     </p>
     <p>
      An amount equal to seven and one-fourth percent (7-1/4%) of the participant’s total earned compensation as defined in Section 25-11-103 shall be remitted to the appropriate company or companies for application to the participant’s contracts or accounts, or both;
     </p>
     <p>

     </p>
     <p>
      The remainder, if any, shall be remitted to the appropriate company or companies for application to the participant’s contracts or accounts, or both.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the employer’s contribution level is decreased below nine and three-fourths percent (9-3/4%) of the employee’s total earned compensation, the remittance provided by paragraph (b) of this section shall be reduced accordingly. There shall be no reduction in the remittance provided by paragraph (a) of this section until such time, if any, that the employer’s contribution level is less than seven and one-fourth percent (7-1/4%) of the participant’s total earned compensation. If the accrued liability contribution is reduced or discontinued under Section 25-11-123, the amount of the reduction, or the entirety of the employer’s contribution, in case of discontinuance, shall be remitted to the appropriate company or companies for application to the participant’s contracts or accounts, or both. Any remittance required to be made by the employer to the Public Employees’ Retirement System of Mississippi shall be made at the times the employer remits contributions for members of the retirement system.

     <p>
      There is hereby established a retirement system for the Mississippi Highway Safety Patrol, as defined in this chapter, effective July 1, 1958, under which members of the Mississippi Highway Safety Patrol may retire for superannuation or may retire for reason of disability, and providing benefits to widows and orphans of such patrolmen. This retirement system is designed to supplement and is in addition to the provisions of Sections 25-11-1 through 25-11-21. Under the terms of this chapter, the highway safety patrolmen, as defined herein, retain all the benefits of old age and survivors insurance under the federal laws administered by the department of public health, education and welfare, or its successor, as provided in the federal and state agreement executed on July 2, 1952, but shall not be eligible for benefits under Sections 25-11-101 through 25-11-139, which is the state retirement annuity plan for state employees. This chapter is a substitute for and in lieu of said sections, and is designed to provide more liberal benefits for the highway safety patrolmen by reason of the dangerous nature of their employment.

     <p>
      As used in this chapter, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise, the term “Highway Patrol or Highway Safety Patrol” for the purpose of establishing membership in this system for persons presently employed by the Highway Safety Patrol shall mean and include all the officers of the Mississippi Highway Safety Patrol who have completed a course of instruction in an authorized highway patrol training school on general law enforcement, and who have served for a period of at least five (5) years prior to July 1, 1958, as a uniformed officer of the Highway Safety Patrol in the enforcement of the traffic laws of the State of Mississippi, or in the driver’s license division, or who are now engaged in such service. New members shall include all the officers of the Mississippi Highway Safety Patrol who have completed a course of instruction in an authorized highway patrol training school on general law enforcement, and who serve as sworn officers of the Highway Patrol in the enforcement of the laws of the State of Mississippi.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any former sworn officer of the Highway Safety Patrol who returns to service with the Highway Safety Patrol in any capacity, and who has had not less than two (2) years of prior service as a sworn officer of the Highway Safety Patrol, and who was disabled by wounds or accident in line of duty, may become a member of the Highway Safety Patrol Retirement System even though his present duties would not otherwise qualify him for membership, and he may continue membership so long as he remains in the employ of the Highway Safety Patrol.
     </p>
     <p>
      Membership in the Highway Safety Patrol Retirement System shall be retroactive to the date of such patrolman’s return to employment with the Highway Safety Patrol, and any funds contributed by him, previous to July 1, 1958, to the Public Employees’ Retirement System shall be transferred to his credit in the Highway Safety Patrol Retirement System, and the employer’s contributions made to the Public Employees’ Retirement System for the patrolman shall also be transferred to the employer’s credit in the Highway Safety Patrol Retirement System; and the difference between the contributions for both the employer and the employee made to the Public Employees’ Retirement System, and those which should have been made to the Highway Safety Patrol Retirement System by both employer and employee for the patrolman since the date of his return to the Highway Safety Patrol shall be paid into the Highway Safety Patrol Retirement System.
     </p>
     <p>
      In order to be eligible for service retirement benefits under this retirement system any member must have served at least five (5) years as a sworn officer of the Highway Patrol engaged in the enforcement of the laws of the State of Mississippi, or at least five (5) years as a sworn agent of the Mississippi Bureau of Narcotics, or a combination of at least five (5) years as a sworn agent of the Mississippi Bureau of Narcotics and as a sworn officer of the Highway Patrol. If the officer is transferred from duty making him eligible for membership in this retirement system to other duties for which credit is not allowed by this system, and he has not been credited with a minimum of five (5) years in this system as a sworn officer of the Highway Patrol engaged in the enforcement of the laws of this state, then an amount as determined by the Public Employees’ Retirement System shall be transferred from this system to his account in the Public Employees’ Retirement System of Mississippi to make him a member of that system with full credit for his years of service with the Mississippi Highway Safety Patrol, and he shall become a member of the Public Employees’ Retirement System of Mississippi with prior service credits. The amount that is determined to be necessary to be transferred shall be paid first from the member’s total contributions in the Highway Safety Patrol System, plus interest, so that all of those funds are transferred, and any remainder shall be paid from the employer’s accumulation account.

      Creditable service on which a member’s service or disability retirement benefit is based shall consist of “prior service” and membership service. Prior service shall mean service performed for the Highway Safety Patrol as defined in Section 25-13-3 before July 1, 1958 and service performed as a sworn agent for the Mississippi Bureau of Narcotics prior to March 29, 1991. No prior service credits shall be granted any person who re-enters the employment of the Highway Safety Patrol after July 1, 1958, except that any former sworn officer of the Highway Safety Patrol who returns to the Highway Safety Patrol in any capacity, and who has had not less than two (2) years of prior service as a sworn officer of the Highway Safety Patrol, and who was disabled by wounds or accident in line of duty, may become a member of the Highway Safety Patrol Retirement System with full credit for any previous service as set forth in Section 25-13-3 with the Highway Safety Patrol. Membership service shall mean all services for which credit may be allowed under this chapter subsequent to July 1, 1958, and all lawfully credited unused leave as of the date of withdrawal from service, as certified by the appointing authority.

      The Board of Trustees of the Public Employees’ Retirement System, as created by Sections 25-11-1 through 25-11-139, shall act as custodian of this Disability and Relief Fund for members of the Mississippi Highway Safety Patrol; shall receive to the credit of such fund all appropriations and other funds available as an employer’s contribution thereto from any source whatsoever; and the Highway Safety Patrol shall each month deduct from the salary of each member, as defined in Section 25-13-3, five percent (5%) thereof, and shall pay the amount so deducted to the Board of Trustees of the Public Employees’ Retirement System to be credited to the Disability and Relief Fund for the members of the Mississippi Highway Safety Patrol. Provided, however, that the said board of trustees may, biennially, following March 18, 1977, vary the percentage of employee contribution on the basis of the liabilities of the retirement system for the various allowances and benefits as shown by actuarial valuation. From the funds credited to this account, the Board of Trustees of the Public Employees’ Retirement System shall pay retirements, disability benefits, survivors benefits, expenses and shall refund contributions as provided in this chapter. The said “Disability and Relief Fund for the Mississippi Highway Safety Patrol” shall be maintained as a separate fund, separate from all other funds held by the Board of Trustees of the Public Employees’ Retirement System of Mississippi and shall be used only for the payment of benefits provided for by this chapter, or amendments thereto.

       Upon application of a member or his employer, but in no event before termination of state service, any member who has not attained the age of fifty-five (55) years may be retired by the administrative board created by this chapter, not less than thirty (30) and not more than ninety (90) days next following the date of filing the application, on a disability retirement allowance, provided that the Medical Board of the Public Employees’ Retirement System of Mississippi, after an evaluation of medical evidence, which may include a physical examination by the medical board, certifies that he is mentally or physically incapacitated for the performance of duty, that the incapacity is likely to be permanent, and that the sickness or injury was caused or sustained as a direct result of duty in the Highway Safety Patrol after July 1, 1958.
       <p>
        Any former uniformed highway safety patrolman who has had not less than two (2) years of prior service with the Highway Safety Patrol and who was disabled by wounds or accident in line of duty, and who has returned to duty with the Highway Safety Patrol, and who becomes a member of the Highway Safety Patrol Retirement System with prior years’ service credits as provided in this chapter, may, if his disability from his previous wounds or accident received in line of duty returns and he again becomes totally and permanently disabled, receive full benefits as a disability retirant for service-connected disability.
       </p>
       <p>
        Upon the application of a member or his employer, any member who is not yet eligible for service retirement benefits and who has had at least five (5) years of creditable service may be retired by the administrative board, not less than thirty (30) and not more than ninety (90) days next following the date of filing the application, on disability retirement allowance, provided that the Medical Board of the Public Employees’ Retirement System of Mississippi, after an evaluation of medical evidence, which may include a physical examination by the medical board, certifies that he is mentally or physically incapacitated for the further performance of duty, that the incapacity is likely to be permanent, and that he should be retired. This disability need not be service-connected.

       Upon retirement for disability, a member shall receive a disability benefit equal to fifty percent (50%) of his average salary for the two (2) years immediately preceding his retirement, but not less than any retirement benefits for which he may be eligible at the date he is granted disability.

If any disability beneficiary who has not yet attained the age of fifty-five (55) years refuses to submit to any medical examination provided for in this subsection, his allowance may be discontinued until his withdrawal of that refusal, and if his refusal continues for one (1) year, all his rights in that part of the disability benefit provided by employer contributions shall be revoked by the administrative board.

If his earning capacity is later changed, the amount of the benefit may be further modified; however, the revised benefit shall not exceed the amount originally granted or an amount that, when added to the amount earnable by the beneficiary, equals the amount of his average compensation.

Any such prior service certificate on the basis of which his service was computed at the time of retirement shall be restored to full force and effect. In addition, upon his subsequent retirement he shall be credited with all creditable service as a member, including the period for which he was paid disability benefits.

       The 2016 amendment divided the former section into two sentences by substituting “beneficiary. The board may provide for alternative means of payment if the member” for “beneficiary, unless the member”; in the first sentence, deleted “who retire effective on or after January 1, 2003” following “this chapter to members,” inserted “whatever” preceding “means” and “the board…efficient payment” thereafter, and inserted “benefits, including, but not limited to”; and in the second sentence, substituted “payment by the prescribed means will cause” for “payment by means of direct deposit will cause.”

       Upon application for superannuation or disability retirement, any member who retires after July 1, 1990, may elect to receive his benefit pursuant to the provisions of Sections 25-13-11 and 25-13-13. Or he may elect upon retirement, or upon becoming eligible for retirement, to receive the actuarial equivalent, subject to the provisions of subsection (3) of this section, of his retirement allowance in a reduced retirement allowance payable throughout life with the provision that:
       <p>
        Option 1.If he dies before he has received in annuity payment the value of the member’s annuity savings account as it was at the time of his retirement, the balance shall be paid to his legal representative or to such person as he shall nominate by written designation duly acknowledged and filed with the board; or
       </p>
       <p>
        Option 2.Upon his death, his reduced retirement allowance shall be continued throughout the life of, and paid to, such person as he has nominated by written designation duly acknowledged and filed with the board of trustees at the time of his retirement;
       </p>
       <p>
        Option 3.Upon his death, one-half (1/2) of his reduced retirement allowance shall be continued throughout the life of, and paid to, such person as he shall have nominated by written designation duly acknowledged and filed with the board of trustees at the time of his retirement, and the other one-half (1/2) of his reduced retirement allowance to some other designated beneficiary;
       </p>
       <p>
        Option 4.Upon his death, three-fourths (3/4) of his reduced retirement allowance, or such other specified amount, shall be continued throughout the life of, and paid to, such person he shall have nominated by written designation duly acknowledged and filed with the board of trustees at the time of his retirement;
       </p>
       <p>
        Option 4-A.Upon his death, one-half (1/2) of his reduced retirement allowance, or such other specified amount, shall be continued throughout the life of, and paid to, such person as he shall have nominated by written designation duly acknowledged and filed with the board of trustees at the time of his retirement; or
       </p>
       <p>
        Option 4-B.A reduced retirement allowance shall be continued throughout the life of the retirant, but with the further guarantee of payments to the named beneficiary or beneficiaries for a specified number of years certain. If the retired member or the last designated beneficiary both die prior to receiving all guaranteed payments due, the actuarial equivalent of the remaining payments shall be paid to the successors of the retired member under Section 25-13-21.1(1);
       </p>
       <p>
        Option 4-C.Such retirement allowance otherwise payable may be converted into a retirement allowance of equivalent actuarial value in such an amount that, with the member’s benefit under Title II of the federal Social Security Act, the member will receive, so far as possible, approximately the same amount annually before and after the earliest age at which the member becomes eligible to receive a social security benefit. This option shall not be available to retirees whose retirement is effective on or after July 1, 2004;
       </p>
       <p>
        Option 6.Any member who is eligible to retire with an unreduced benefit may select the maximum retirement benefit or an optional benefit as provided in this subsection together with a partial lump-sum distribution. The amount of the lump-sum distribution under this option shall be equal to the maximum monthly benefit multiplied by twelve (12), twenty-four (24) or thirty-six (36) as selected by the member. The maximum retirement benefit shall be actuarially reduced to reflect the amount of the lump-sum distribution selected and further reduced for any other optional benefit selected. The annuity and lump-sum distribution shall be computed to result in no actuarial loss to the system. The lump-sum distribution shall be made as a single payment payable at the time the first monthly annuity payment is paid to the retiree. The amount of the lump-sum distribution shall be deducted from the member’s annuity savings account in computing what contributions remain at the death of the retiree and/or a beneficiary. The lump-sum distribution option may be elected only once by a member upon initial retirement, and may not be elected by a retiree, by members applying for a disability retirement annuity, by survivors or by a member selecting Option 4-C.
       </p>
      </li>
      <li id="t25c13s25-13-16ol12">
       No change in the option selected shall be permitted after the member’s death or after the member has received his first retirement check, except as provided in subsections (3) and (4) of this section. However, any retired member who is receiving a retirement allowance under Option 2 or Option 4-A upon July 1, 1999, and whose designated beneficiary predeceased him or whose marriage to a spouse who is his designated beneficiary is terminated by divorce or other dissolution, upon written notification to the retirement system of the death of the designated beneficiary or of the termination of his marriage to his designated beneficiary, the retirement allowance payable to the member after receipt of such notification by the retirement system shall be equal to the retirement allowance that would have been payable if the member had not elected the option. In addition, any retired member who is receiving the maximum retirement allowance for life, a retirement allowance under Option 1 or who is receiving a retirement allowance under Option 2 or Option 4-A on July 1, 1999, may elect to provide survivor benefits under Option 2 or Option 4-A to a spouse who was not previously the member’s beneficiary and who the member married before July 1, 1999. Should a member retired on disability be returned to active service, the option previously selected shall be null and void. Upon subsequent retirement a new option may be selected.

       Any retired member who is receiving a reduced retirement allowance under Option 2, Option 4 or Option 4-A whose designated beneficiary predeceases him, or whose marriage to a spouse who is his designated beneficiary is terminated by divorce or other dissolution, may elect to cancel his reduced retirement allowance and receive the maximum retirement allowance for life in an amount equal to the amount that would have been payable if the member had not elected Option 2, Option 4 or Option 4-A. Such election must be made in writing to the office of the executive director of the system on a form prescribed by the board. Any such election shall be effective the first of the month following the date the election is received by the system; however, the election may be applied retroactively for not more than three (3) months but no earlier than the first of the month following the date of the death of the beneficiary.

       Any retired member who is receiving the maximum retirement allowance for life, or a retirement allowance under Option 1, and who marries after his retirement may elect to cancel his maximum retirement allowance and receive a reduced retirement allowance under Option 2, Option 4 or Option 4-A to provide continuing lifetime benefits to his spouse. Such election must be made in writing to the office of the executive director of the system on a form prescribed by the board not earlier than the date of the marriage. Any such election shall be effective the first of the month following the date the election is received by the system. However, if a retiree marries or remarries after retirement and elects either Option 2, Option 4 or Option 4-A as provided in subsection (2) or (4) of this section, the actuarial equivalent factor used to compute the reduced retirement allowance shall be the factor for the age of the retiree and his or her beneficiary at the time such election for recalculation of benefits is made.
      </li>
      <li id="t25c13s25-13-16ol15">
       Any member in service who has qualified for retirement benefits may select any optional method of settlement of retirement benefits by notifying the Executive Director of the Board of Trustees of the Public Employees’ Retirement System in writing, on a form prescribed by the board, of the option he has selected and by naming the beneficiary of such option and furnishing necessary proof of age. Such option, once selected, may be changed at any time prior to actual retirement or death, but upon the death or retirement of the member, the optional settlement shall be placed in effect upon proper notification to the executive director.

      <li id="t25c13s25-13-16ol16">
       Notwithstanding any provision of Section 25-13-1 et seq., no payments may be made for a retirement allowance on a monthly basis for a period of time in excess of that allowed by federal law.

       If a retirant and his eligible beneficiary, if any, both die before they have received in annuity payments a total amount equal to the accumulated contributions standing to the retirant’s credit in the annuity savings account at the time of his retirement, the difference between the accumulated contributions and the total amount of annuities received by them shall be paid to such persons as the retirant has nominated by written designation duly executed and filed in the office of the executive director. If no designated person survives the retirant and his beneficiary, the difference, if any, shall be paid pursuant to Section 25-13-21.1(1).

       Any retired member who retired on Option 2(5) or 4-A(5) before July 1, 1999, who is still receiving a retirement allowance as of July 1, 1999, shall receive an increase in the annual retirement allowance effective July 1, 1999, equal to the amount they would have received under Option 2 or Option 4-A without a reduction for Option 5 based on the ages at retirement of the retiree and beneficiary and option factors in effect on July 1, 1999.

    Refund of contributions; rollover distribution to retirement plan or account; repayment of refund upon subsequent reentry into service.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      In the event a highway patrolman ceases to work for the Highway Safety Patrol for any reason other than occupational disease contracted or for any accident sustained by the patrolman by reason of his service or discharge of his duty in the Highway Patrol, and if the highway patrolman is not eligible for retirement either for service or disability, he shall be refunded the amount of his total contribution under the provisions of this chapter, including any credit transferred to his account in this system from any other system, at his request; and should he die before retirement, his total contribution is to be refunded to any beneficiary he may name. If there is no surviving designated beneficiary, the contributions to the credit of the deceased member shall be refunded pursuant to Section 25-13-21.1(1).
     </p>
     <p>
      Pursuant to the Unemployment Compensation Amendments of 1992 (Public Law 102-318 (UCA)), a member or the spouse of a member who is an eligible beneficiary entitled to a refund under this section may elect, on a form prescribed by the board under rules and regulations established by the board, to have an eligible rollover distribution of accumulated contributions payable under this section paid directly to an eligible retirement plan, as defined under applicable federal law, or an individual retirement account. If the member or the spouse of a member who is an eligible beneficiary makes that election and specifies the eligible retirement plan or individual retirement account to which the distribution is to be paid, the distribution will be made in the form of a direct trustee-to-trustee transfer to the specified eligible retirement plan. A nonspouse beneficiary may elect to have an eligible rollover distribution paid in the form of a direct trustee-to-trustee transfer to an individual retirement account established to receive the distribution on behalf of the nonspouse beneficiary. Flexible rollovers under this subsection shall not be considered assignments under Section 25-13-31.
     </p>
     <p>
      If any highway patrolman who receives a refund reenters the service of the Highway Safety Patrol and again becomes a member of the system, he may repay all amounts previously received by him as a refund, together with regular interest covering the period from the date of refund to the date of repayment; however, the amounts that are repaid by the member and the creditable service related thereto shall not be used in any benefit calculation or determination until the member has remained a contributor to the system for a period of at least five (5) years after the member’s reentry into state service. Repayment for such time shall be made beginning with the most recent service for which refund has been made. Upon the repayment of all or part of the refund and interest, the highway patrolman shall again receive credit for the period of creditable service for which full repayment has been made to the system.

    Deferred compensation program authorized; investment; deferred compensation exempt from tax and execution.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The State of Mississippi, or any state agency, county, municipality or other political subdivision may, by contract, agree with any employee to defer, in whole or in part, any portion of that employee’s income, and a county, municipality or other political subdivision, except community and junior college districts, may make contributions to the plan on behalf of actively participating members on a uniform basis through an employer contribution agreement as provided for in the Mississippi Deferred Compensation Plan and Trust Plan Document if making the contribution does not conflict with any other state law. Those funds may subsequently be used to purchase a fixed or variable life insurance or annuity contract authorized for purchase by the Public Employees’ Retirement System of Mississippi for the purpose of protecting its obligation to the deferred compensation program for the employee from any life underwriter duly licensed by this state who represents an insurance company licensed to contract fixed and variable annuities and fixed or variable life insurance business in this state and authorized by the Public Employees’ Retirement System of Mississippi to offer their products in the plan, or to purchase any investments authorized for purchase by the Public Employees’ Retirement System of Mississippi under Section 25-11-121, or to invest those monies in a fund or funds maintained by a corporate trustee, which fund or funds are used as an investment media for retirement, pension or profit sharing plans that are tax qualified for that purpose. However, in the administration of this plan, the Public Employees’ Retirement System of Mississippi may adopt such regulations as are reasonable and necessary to assure the orderly functioning of the plan, but those regulations shall not unreasonably restrict all licensed life underwriters and insurance companies described in this section from concurrently participating in providing contracts authorized under this section. Anything in any other law to the contrary notwithstanding, the deferred portion of the employee’s compensation, the plan and the monies in the plan created by this chapter are exempt from any state, county or municipal ad valorem taxes, income taxes, premium taxes, privilege taxes, property taxes, sales and use taxes and any other taxes not so named, until the deferred compensation is paid to the employee or beneficiary and exempt from levy, garnishment, attachment or any other process whatsoever.

      <p>
       All full-time employees of MPIA, Inc. are, for purposes of eligibility for state group health and life insurance benefits, considered to be state employees, and therefore entitled to participate in such group insurance plans. Ranck, May 24, 1991, A.G. Op. #91-0331.
      </p>
      <p>
       MPIA employees receive their compensation from a department, agency or institution of state government, and as such, MPIA is responsible for all employer contributions required under the law to be made on behalf and for the benefit of state employees. Ranck, Oct. 28, 1991, A.G. Op. #91-0697.
      </p>
      <p>
       If individual is employee, individual is eligible for health insurance benefits assuming that requirements relating to full-time employment and direct payment of compensation from an agency of state government are also met. Ranck, Jan. 10, 1994, A.G. Op. #93-0949.
      </p>
      <p>
       Self-insured health plans of state of Mississippi are responsibility of state and such liability cannot be transferred to provider organizations. Ranck, Jan. 24, 1994, A.G. Op. #93-0921.
      </p>
      <p>
       An employee of an economic development district is not a state employee pursuant to Section 25-15-3(a), regardless of the employee’s contributions to the state retirement plan. Therefore, the employees of MMDD are not eligible to participate in the State Employees Life and Health Insurance Plan. McMillan, August 23, 1995, A.G. Op. #95-0597.
      </p>
      <p>
       If an individual is not working full time and is not making contributions to the State of Mississippi retirement plan, then that individual cannot be considered to be an employee as defined in Section 25-15-3. The employing department, agency, institution, etc., could not in this situation pay the individual’s health insurance premium or the state’s share of the employee’s life insurance premium for the time he or she was not working. Tucker, April 15, 1996, A.G. Op. #96-0220.
      </p>
      <p>
       If governing authorities fail to elect officers such as a police chief and clerk, the incumbent officers may serve until their successors are appointed. Hill, Aug. 8, 1997, A.G. Op. #97-0401.
      </p>
      <p>
       For purposes of Section 25-15-3, an employee is considered full time so long as he is receiving compensation from his employer in the form of payment for work performed, medical or personal (vacation) leave, thus, if the employee is not receiving compensation from one of these sources and is not making contributions to the state retirement plan, then the district would have no authority to continue to pay the health insurance premiums for the employee. Mayfield, Sept. 13, 2002, A.G. Op. #02-0417.
      </p>
      <p>
       The provisions of Title 83, including Sections 83-9-5 and 83-9-32, which are placed squarely within the jurisdiction of the Department of Insurance, are not applicable to the State and School Employees Health Insurance Plan, which is clearly under the administration of the State and School Employees Health Insurance Management Board under the umbrella of the Department of Finance and Administration. Martinson, Dec. 6, 2002, A.G. Op. #02-0668.
      </p>
      <p>
       The State and School Employees Health Insurance Plan is not governed by ERISA. Martinson, Dec. 6, 2002, A.G. Op. #02-0668.

   The article governing group insurance for employees of local governments and their institutions and agencies, §§<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t25c15s25-15-101" target="_self">25-15-101</a></cite> through<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t25c15s25-15-105" target="_self">25-15-105</a></cite>, are not governed by the definition of “employee” as found in subsection (a) of this section. Such local employers may adopt their own leave policies and contract for group insurance, through which they may provide for payment of health insurance premiums for employees who are off work due to a work-related injury.

       Administration of public purchasing, administration of state employee’s group insurance program, and authority to approve rules adopted by the State Auditor for establishing a merit system for his employees, are administrative functions within the prerogative of the executive department, and thus, named legislators could not constitutionally perform any of those functions because they properly belonged to the executive department; moreover, the statutes vesting those powers in members of the legislature are unconstitutional.

The board is also authorized to accept bids for such alternate coverage and optional benefits as the board deems proper. The board is authorized to accept bids for surgical services that include assistance in locating a surgeon, setting up initial consultation, travel, a negotiated single case rate bundle and payment for orthopedic, spine, bariatric, cardiovascular and general surgeries.

This statement shall include the amount of compensation paid by the bidder to any such employee during the previous fiscal year. The board shall make all such information available to the members of the advisory council and those legislators, or their designees, who may attend meetings of the advisory council before any action is taken by the board on the bids submitted. The failure of any bidder to fully and accurately comply with this paragraph shall result in the rejection of any bid submitted by that bidder or the cancellation of any contract executed when the failure is discovered after the acceptance of that bid. The board is authorized to promulgate rules and regulations to implement the provisions of this subsection.

Each employee who is covered under any such contract or contracts shall receive a certificate setting forth the benefits to which the employee is entitled thereunder, to whom such benefits shall be payable, to whom claims should be submitted, and summarizing the provisions of the contract principally affecting the employee.

       Pursuant to Section 1-1-109, the Joint Legislative Committee on Compilation, Revision and Publication of Legislation corrected an error in a statutory reference in the second and sixth paragraphs of this section. The reference to "Sections 25-15-101 and 25-15-103” was changed to "this section and Section 25-15-103." The Joint Committee ratified the correction at its August 14, 2018, meeting.

       The 2009 amendment rewrote the fourth paragraph, and deleted the former next-to-last paragraph, which read: “The restrictions in this section on the amount which employers may pay for group insurance and other coverage for their employees shall not be applicable to municipalities.”

       The 2015 amendment substituted “community/junior” for “junior” preceding “college district” throughout; and deleted “however, in order to qualify as a self-insurer, a group, whether consisting of one or more employers, shall consist of not less than one hundred twenty-five (125) employees” at the end of the fourth paragraph.

      In addition to the salaries, expenses and fringe benefits of district attorneys and legal assistants authorized by Section 25-3-35(5) and (6) and criminal investigators authorized by Section 25-31-10(5), the salary of a district attorney may be supplemented in an amount not to exceed Eight Thousand Three Hundred Dollars ($8,300.00) per year; the salary of a legal assistant may be supplemented in an amount not to exceed Six Thousand Dollars ($6,000.00) per year; and the salary of a criminal investigator may be supplemented in an amount not to exceed Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000.00) per year, payable monthly. The supplemental salary, expenses and fringe benefits authorized herein may be paid from office-generated funds, funds from a county, a combination of counties, a municipality, a combination of municipalities, a county and a municipality, a combination of counties and municipalities, federal funds, grants from private foundations, or by means of an Interlocal Cooperative Agreement authorized by Section 17-13-1. The district attorney shall report to the board of supervisors of each county comprising the circuit court district the amount and source of the supplemental salary, expenses and fringe benefits, and the board in each county shall spread the same on its minutes. The district attorney shall also report such information to the Department of Finance and Administration who shall make such information available to the Legislative Budget Office. The supplemental salary, expenses and fringe benefits may either be paid from district attorney accounts, transferred by the district attorney to the Department of Finance and Administration or to one or more of the separate counties comprising the circuit court district, and such funds shall be disbursed to the employees in the same manner as state-funded criminal investigators and full-time legal assistants.

      </h4>
      <p>
       District attorney is not prohibited from bringing civil tax matters before a grand jury, and arguably has a duty to do so, particularly in light of the fact that the legislature has vested district attorneys and grand juries with authority to investigate a variety of civil matters. Entergy Miss., Inc. v. State, 132 So.3d 568, 2014 Miss. LEXIS 120 (Miss. 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       The prosecuting attorney, as a representative of the state, has an obligation to be fair in his prosecution of a case. This is an obligation that can be fulfilled without relaxing the solemn duty to vigorously prosecute. Hosford v. State, 525 So. 2d 789, 1988 Miss. LEXIS 217 (Miss. 1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       Mere change of venue does not terminate the duty of a prosecutor; thus in a prosecution for murder, the trial court properly overruled defendants’ objection to the participation of a district attorney from the Ninth Judicial District, where the indictment was returned against defendants in the Ninth District but where venue was changed to the Fourteenth District on defendants’ motion. Daumer v. State, 381 So. 2d 1014, 1980 Miss. LEXIS 1872 (Miss. 1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       A district attorney has no authority to represent the state in litigation outside his district, or to represent the state in litigation in his district where the subject matter is of statewide interest, as distinguished from local interest, and the fact that a district attorney may, with the consent of the Attorney General, bring suit to recover misappropriated county funds, does not limit or exclude the Attorney General’s authority. State ex rel. Patterson v. Warren, 254 Miss. 293, 180 So. 2d 293, 1966 Miss. LEXIS 1592 (Miss. 1966).
      </p>
      <p>
       The district attorney under the authority of this section has the right to maintain a suit to abate an alleged public nuisance involving a purely local public interest. State ex rel. Maples v. Quinn, 217 Miss. 567, 64 So. 2d 711, 1953 Miss. LEXIS 464 (Miss. 1953).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where district attorney was serving three counties, he was not precluded from maintaining mandamus proceedings on behalf of one of such counties to compel motor vehicle comptroller to pay over certain funds to county out of gasoline tax collections in excess of the share which comptroller was willing to concede. McCullen v. State, 217 Miss. 256, 63 So. 2d 856, 1953 Miss. LEXIS 429 (Miss. 1953).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the statute provides that it shall be the duty of district attorney to appear in Circuit Court and prosecute for the state in his district all criminal prosecutions and civil cases in which the state or any county within his district may be interested and where it also provides that if two or more counties are adversely interested, district attorney should not represent either, the statute is general and covers civil cases as a general class, whereas, a statute authorizing district attorney to petition for mandamus in any matter affecting public interest is specific and constitutes exception to the general provision. McCullen v. State, 217 Miss. 256, 63 So. 2d 856, 1953 Miss. LEXIS 429 (Miss. 1953).
      </p>
      <p>
       District attorney, without Attorney General’s approval, held unauthorized to sue county supervisors to recover for county allegedly excessive salaries. Greaves v. Hinds County, 166 Miss. 89, 145 So. 900, 1933 Miss. LEXIS 331 (Miss. 1933).

       A district attorney has no authority to represent the state in litigation outside his district, or to represent the state in litigation in his district where the subject matter is of statewide interest, as distinguished from local interest, and the fact that a district attorney may, with the consent of the Attorney General, bring suit to recover misappropriated county funds, does not limit or exclude the Attorney General’s authority.

       Although wide latitude should be given in the cross-examination of witnesses, basic fairness requires that, before the state questions the accused as to whether he or she is guilty of a series of crimes unrelated to the charges being prosecuted, it have some basis in fact for such questioning. This would be the case even if the commission of such crimes were admissible evidence. Thus, where the record did not show any evidentiary basis to ask such questions, the state’s conduct in cross-examining the defendant in a sexual battery prosecution about unrelated acts of deviant, sexual conduct with his stepchildren constituted reversible error even though the defense objection was sustained. Hosford v. State, 525 So. 2d 789, 1988 Miss. LEXIS 217 (Miss. 1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although a prosecuting attorney is competent to testify, his testifying is not approved by the courts except where it is made necessary by the circumstances of the case, and, if he knows before the trial that he will be a necessary witness, he should withdraw and have other counsel prosecute the case; the propriety of allowing a prosecutor to testify is a matter largely within the trial court’s discretion. Adams v. State, 202 Miss. 68, 30 So. 2d 593, 1947 Miss. LEXIS 243 (Miss. 1947).

       Method used by district attorney in interrogating witnesses, appealing to the prejudices and impulses of the jurors by reliance for conviction upon the honor of Masonry and the dishonor of a bank failure was improper.

       In a homicide case it is error to allow a district attorney who has been improperly allowed to introduce the direct testimony of a witness offered in rebuttal to fortify the testimony of such witness by that of himself in relation to and explanatory of previous statements made by the witness, and such error is not cured by the subsequent exclusion of the district attorney’s testimony.

       The remark of a district attorney, on application for a continuance, that he would “admit the affidavit of the counsel as to what he expected to prove by an absent witness, but knew the witness would not swear to it,” is reversible error, when made in the hearing of the jury.

       The State must present all relevant evidence bearing on the defendant’s guilt as part of its case-in-chief, not initially through cross-examination of the defendant and his or her witnesses, and then offering evidence of such conduct in rebuttal. No party should be permitted as a deliberate trial tactic to decide in advance of trial to withhold a part of his or her evidence case-in-chief, but to attempt to suggest such evidence in cross-examination of the witnesses for the opposing side, and then to offer the evidence in rebuttal.

       One petitioning circuit court for allowance of mileage for returning fugitives under governor’s requisition, is not required by virtue of this section to first file his claim with the district attorney, but such section does require that the judge must ask the advice of the district attorney before allowing the claim, and, until the court does so, the court has no authority to allow or disallow the claim, so that a judgment denying the petition is tantamount merely to an erroneous dismissal of the claim and not a final judgment on its merits.

       While circuit court has no authority to allow or disallow a claim until it has first sought the advice of the district attorney, the latter’s approval or disapproval is not binding upon the court and the allowance or disallowance of the claim is ultimately committed to the judgment of the court, although in respect to a claim against the county, such as mileage for returning fugitives under governor’s requisition, the claim may be contested by the district attorney in the circuit court on behalf of the county.

       District attorney is not prohibited from bringing civil tax matters before a grand jury, and arguably has a duty to do so, particularly in light of the fact that the legislature has vested district attorneys and grand juries with authority to investigate a variety of civil matters.

       The attorney general is a constitutional officer possessed of all the power and authority vested in such an official at common law, and, in addition, such as have been conferred upon him by statute, including the right to institute, conduct, and maintain all suits necessary for the enforcement of the laws of the state, the preservation of order, and protection of public rights, which right is not confined to enforcement of the criminal laws but applies also to all matters of state-wide public interest in any of the courts of the state.

       Trial court did not err by appointing the attorney general as special prosecutor in defendant’s case because it articulated its reasons for disqualifying the district attorney, the charges against him for allegedly violating this section by improperly consulting, advising, counseling and defending defendant, the record reflected no evidence that defendant ever objected to the attorney general’s appointment, and the trial court found not merit to the district attorney’s objection based on a conflict of interest.

      <p>
       A trial court should have disqualified the district attorney’s office from prosecuting the defendant and appointed a district attorney pro tempore, where an assistant district attorney had previously been a public defender and had represented the defendant for approximately 11 months, the assistant district attorney discussed the case with the defendant’s new appointed counsel, the assistant district attorney made no attempt to indicate to the defendant’s attorney that he would not be participating in the case, at no time thereafter until the day of trial did the district attorney’s office notify the defendant’s attorney that the assistant district attorney had not breached any confidences and would not participate in the case, and the prosecuting district attorney’s statements for the record asserting that he had not acquired any knowledge or information concerning the case from the assistant district attorney had no legal effect because it was not made under oath.

       When any person shall be arrested and charged with a felony, a misdemeanor or an act of delinquency, then the arresting authority shall afford such person an opportunity to sign an affidavit stating that such person is an indigent and unable to employ counsel. Upon the signing of such affidavit by such person, the public defender shall represent said person unless the right to counsel be waived by such person. Provided further, a statement shall be executed by the alleged indigent, under oath, listing all assets available to the indigent for the payment of attorney’s fees, including the ownership of any property, real or personal, and setting out therein the alleged indigent’s employment status, number of dependents, income from any source, the ability of his parents or spouse to provide an attorney’s fee, and any other information which might prove or disprove a finding of indigency. The affidavit and statement shall be a part of the record in the case and shall be subject to review by the appropriate court. Based on review of the affidavit, statement or other appropriate evidence, if the appropriate court finds that the defendant is not indigent, said court shall terminate the representation of the defendant by the public defender.
       <p>
        When any person shall be arrested and charged with a misdemeanor, the presiding judge or justice, upon determination that the person is indigent as provided in this section, and that representation of the indigent is required, shall appoint the public defender whose duty it shall be to provide such representation. No person determined to be an indigent as provided in this section shall be imprisoned as a result of a misdemeanor conviction unless he was represented by the public defender or waived the right to counsel.

       When indigent defendant charged with felony appears for preliminary hearing before municipal judge, it is case ’originating in state and county courts’ thereby requiring county public defender to appear and represent defendant. Brown, Jan. 20, 1994, A.G. Op. #93-0896.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since county public defenders are required to represent indigent defendants charged with felonies at preliminary hearings in municipal court, city is under no obligation to compensate public defender; county that appointed public defender would be responsible for such compensation. Brown, Jan. 20, 1994, A.G. Op. #93-0896.

       Section 25-32-11 provides that it is the duty of the county public defender to represent an indigent defendant at a preliminary hearing before a municipal judge. Thompson, October 11, 1996, A.G. Op. #96-0678.
      </p>
      <p>
       When a county public defender is appointed to represent a defendant on felony charges in a municipal court preliminary hearing, the court should allow the public defender to withdraw if the felony charges are reduced to misdemeanors, the court should then determine if a court appointed attorney is appropriate on the misdemeanor charges, and if the public defender is appointed to represent the defendant on the misdemeanor charges, then the public defender is entitled to additional compensation from the municipality under Miss. Code Section 99-15-17. Tucker, Aug. 15, 1997, A.G. Op. #97-0500.

      <p>
       The Governor may appoint notaries public who may serve in any or all counties of this state. A notary public shall hold office for a term of four (4) years. Notaries public who are appointed and commissioned after July 1, 1988, shall give bond, with sufficient sureties, licensed by the Department of Insurance, in the penalty sum of Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000.00). All such bonds shall be conditioned and approved by the Secretary of State. Notaries public shall not otherwise be considered as state officers. Each notary public shall take the oath of office prescribed by Section 268 of the Constitution. A notary public shall qualify by filing the oath and bond in the Office of the Secretary of State.
      </p>
      <p>
       The bond requirements, unexpired appointments and commissions of notaries public issued prior to July 1, 1988, shall be sufficient, regardless of any jurisdictional limitations, to authorize notaries public appointed and commissioned prior to July 1, 1988, to serve any or all counties of this state. Any notary public commission containing language limiting the jurisdiction of a notary public may be returned to the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State shall then issue a new certificate indicating that such notary public may serve in any and all counties of this state.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Secretary of State shall issue notary public commissions on behalf of the Governor to all qualified applicants. A notary public shall be at least eighteen (18) years of age, a citizen or legal resident of the United States, shall have resided in this state for a period of not less than thirty (30) days immediately preceding the date of the application, and shall meet such other requirements as the Secretary of State may establish by rule.

      <p>
       In addition to the acknowledgment of instruments and the performance of other notarial acts in the manner and form and as otherwise authorized by law, instruments may be acknowledged, documents attested, oaths and affirmations administered, depositions and affidavits executed, and other notarial acts performed before or by any commissioned officer in active service of the armed forces of the United States with the rank of second lieutenant or higher in the army or marine corps, or with the rank of ensign or higher in the navy or coast guard, or with equivalent rank in any other component part of the armed forces of the United States, by any person who either (a) is a member of the armed forces of the United States or the husband or wife of a member of the armed forces of the United States; or (b) is serving as a merchant seaman outside the limits of the United States included within the 48 states and the District of Columbia; or (c) is outside said limits by permission, assignment, or direction of any department or official of the United States government, in connection with any activity pertaining to the prosecution of any war in which the United States is then engaged.

       Such acknowledgments of instruments, attestation of documents, administration of oaths and affirmations, executions of depositions and affidavits, and performance of other notarial acts, heretofore or hereafter made or taken, are hereby declared legal, valid, and binding, and instruments and documents so acknowledged, authenticated, or sworn to shall be admissible in evidence and eligible to record in this state under the same circumstances and with the same force and effect as if such acknowledgment, attestation, oath, affirmation, deposition, affidavit, or other notarial act had been made or taken within this state before or by a duly qualified officer or official as otherwise provided by law.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the taking of acknowledgments and the performing of other notarial acts requiring certification, a certificate endorsed upon or attached to the instrument or documents, which shows the date of the notarial act and which states, in substance, that the person appearing before the officer acknowledged the instrument as his act or made or signed the instrument or document under oath, shall be sufficient for all intents and purposes. The instrument or document shall not be rendered invalid by the failure to state the place of execution or acknowledgment.

       County Council of Governments was merely voluntary association of local governments and did not appear to have any corporate existence; thus, it did not appear to fall within purview of Open Meetings Act. Cochran, Feb. 24, 1994, A.G. Op. #94-0049.

       A school district may not develop a policy that bans recording devices or tape recorders from school board meetings, as such policy would be in violation of the state open meetings laws. However, the board may promulgate reasonable rules and policies concerning the recording of meetings. Smith,

       A school board may employ legal counsel other than the Board Attorney only by a majority vote of a quorum present in a properly noticed and open meeting of the board, and must officially hire an attorney before sharing any confidential personnel records. Reasons for non-renewal of a superintendent’s contract and any settlement offers must be approved and recorded in the minutes at an official meeting of the board. All policies, actions, and decisions of the school board must be reasonable and necessary to meet the educational needs of the district’s children. Foreman, March 30, 2007, A.G.

       Factors to be considered in determining whether an activity is business or social within the context of the open meetings requirement include the activity that takes place at the function, the advance call or notice given to the members of the public body, an agenda, the claim for per diem and travel expenses by the members, and other pertinent factors.

   Trial court erred in ruling that an event attended by city employees and officials was not a “meeting” but a purely social gathering not governed by Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t25c41s25-41-1" target="_self">25-41-1</a></cite> because (1) city council members were given advance notice of the event; (2) the facilitator had an agenda for the event, which was held to improve the participants’ ability to work together; (3) some council members thought the city would fund the gathering, and one councilman apparently paid the entire bill only because of a newspaper’s pending lawsuit; and (4) no spouses, family members, or friends of the participants were present or invited.

       The attendance by members of a County Board of Supervisors individually or in a body at social functions or at charities, or with industry or business representatives when their only purpose and function is to listen, and to take no official action at the time, are not public meetings within the Open Meetings Act.

       Meeting is within Open Meeting Act when there is assemblage of members of public body at which official acts, including actions relating to formation and determination of public policy, may be taken; although purely social functions are not covered, factors to consider in making determination of whether activity is business or social include activity that takes place at function, advance call or notice given members, agenda, claim for per diem and travel expenses by members, and other pertinent factors.

       Even though there was nothing to show that notice was given of a teleconference of a scheduled meeting, no prejudice was established because several citizens had an opportunity to participate in the process. They attended the meeting in question, objected to a city’s actions at the meeting, filed a notice of appeal and a bill of exceptions concerning the actions of the city at the meeting, argued their case before the circuit court, and appealed the circuit court’s decision to the Mississippi Supreme Court. Ball v. Mayor & Bd. of Aldermen, 983 So. 2d 295, 2008 Miss. LEXIS 184 (Miss. 2008).

       Several aldermen may attend social or civic gatherings without being in contravention of the Open Meetings Act if no official business is discussed and no official actions are taken. Ladner, May 24, 2002, A.G. Op. #02-0249.

      <p>
       The attendance of more than one supervisor at a meeting organized and called by a state or federal economic development agencies whose sole purpose is to disseminate information of available grants and favorable loans for public projects, is not in violation of the Open Meetings Act; however, this only remains true if the members of Board of Supervisors refrain from discussing official business and no official actions are taken. Clanton, Apr. 4, 2003, A.G. Op. 03-0139.

       More specific procedures for conducting meetings via electronic means are within the discretion of the governing body to establish, provided those procedures are not inconsistent with the statute. Neville, Dec. 30, 2003, A.G. Op. 03-0702.

       While a board may promulgate reasonable rules concerning taping of public meetings, the flat prohibition of taping meetings is unreasonable. Unless the board finds, consistent with fact, that the presence and use of a camera, or several cameras, would be disruptive, then the board cannot prohibit cameras. Brown, July 7, 2004, A.G.

       As a gathering of city employees and officials, conducted by a communications consultant and designed to improve the participants’ ability to work together, was a “public meeting,” not a purely social gathering, the city council should have held the meeting in public; if the public needed to be excluded for a legislatively approved reason, the council could have then voted to go into executive session after stating a specific reason.

       The attendance by members of a County Board of Supervisors individually or in a body at social functions or at charities, or with industry or business representatives when their only purpose and function is to listen, and to take no official action at the time, are not public meetings within the Open Meetings Act. Hinds County Bd. of Supervisors v. Common Cause of Mississippi, 551 So. 2d 107, 1989 Miss. LEXIS 719 (Miss. 1989).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Within the framework of the statutory language of the Open Meetings Act itself, all statutory exceptions must, under the spirit and philosophy of the Act, be strictly construed against executive sessions. Even though an executive session might come under “personnel matters,” or another of the subjects listed under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t25c41s25-41-7ol14" target="_self">25-41-7(4)</a></cite>, this in and of itself is insufficient in the absence of at least a reasonably arguable basis of an actual, present need for a closed meeting on the subject. Hinds County Bd. of Supervisors v. Common Cause of Mississippi, 551 So. 2d 107, 1989 Miss. LEXIS 719 (Miss. 1989).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t25c41s25-41-7ol14" target="_self">25-41-7(4)</a></cite>, “personnel matters” were restricted to matters dealing with employees hired and supervised by a County Board of Supervisors, not those employees of some other county officials, and not other county officials themselves. Nor, would a member of the Board of Supervisors be classified “personnel.” Moreover, an independent contractor such as an accountant, lawyer, or architect is not an employee of the Board, and would not come under “personnel.” Thus, the Board was not entitled to go into executive session under the “personnel matters” exception to consider appointments to fill a vacancy on the Board, to discuss employees of some other county official, or to consider the employment of, or discussions with, an architect concerning his employment. Hinds County Bd. of Supervisors v. Common Cause of Mississippi, 551 So. 2d 107, 1989 Miss. LEXIS 719 (Miss. 1989).

   Under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t25c41s25-41-7" target="_self">25-41-7</a></cite>, the reason given for going into executive session must be meaningful. The reason stated must be of sufficient specificity to inform those present that there is in reality a specific, discrete matter or area which the public body had determined should be discussed in executive session. The public body may then go into executive session to discuss this one matter, and, when concluded, must re-open the meeting. No matter may be discussed at the executive session other than the announced subject. Hinds County Bd. of Supervisors v. Common Cause of Mississippi, 551 So. 2d 107, 1989 Miss. LEXIS 719 (Miss. 1989).

   As term “personnel” used in §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t25c41s25-41-7" target="_self">25-41-7</a></cite> is not defined within Open Meetings Act, its use is of common and ordinary meaning and any further definition must be addressed by court on case-by-case development guided by general rules of statutory definition together with legislative intent of act and its declared policy.

   The meeting of a city planning commission, which was a “public body” within the meaning of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t25c41s25-41-3ol1a" target="_self">25-41-3(a)</a></cite>, with two professional city planners, each of whom had provided expert testimony in prior annexation trials, to consider possible expansion of the city through annexation of additional lands, came within the litigation exception to the statute, even though no attorneys were present, since annexation confirmation proceedings are “litigation” within the meaning of the section, since opposition to the proposed annexation was reasonably expected by the commission, since the minutes of the meeting clearly indicated it was a strategy session with respect to the prospective litigation, and since the annexation confirmation proceedings were “prospective litigation” within the meaning of the section, that is, litigation reasonably likely to occur in the reasonably foreseeable future; and thus, the planning commission had the lawful power to hold an executive session and exclude from it members of the press and public.

       Requiring release of transcripts or recordings of lawfully conducted executive sessions would entirely frustrate purposes for allowing such sessions to be held; Open Meetings Act and Public Records Act are construed to be in pari materia, and recordings or transcripts of lawfully called and conducted executive sessions are not subject to public disclosure; fact that meeting occurs in executive session does not alter either necessity for keeping accurate minutes, or right of public access to those minutes.

       Board of trustees of community hospital may go into executive session without attorney present; however, board must have matter for discussion which is exempt from Open Meetings Act as set forth in Miss.

      </p>
      <p>
       A board cannot achieve a quorum through participation over the telephone; a quorum must be physically present; however, as long as all deliberations and votes are conducted in a manner that provides access to the public and are properly recorded, and the meeting is properly noticed and at all times open to the public at the place normally set aside for board meetings, participation of a member in a regular meeting via telephone conference call satisfies the requirements of the Open Meetings Act.

      <p>
       If a public body determines, as reflected in the minutes, that the salary or compensation of a particular official or employee includes discussion of their job performance, character or professional competence, then the declaration of an executive session to discuss these issues would be proper; however, once decided upon, the amount of the salary would be public record.

   There is nothing that prohibits members of the board of aldermen from disclosing information discussed during the executive session.
   However, a violation of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t25c04s25-4-105ol1a" target="_self">25-4-105(a)</a></cite> may result if a member of a municipal board uses information learned during an executive session for his or her personal pecuniary benefit. Thomas, Sept. 10, 2004, A.G. Op. 04-0439.

      <p>
       The 2008 amendment rewrote the section to authorize the Mississippi Ethics Commission to enforce the provisions of this chapter.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 2011 amendment in the second sentence of the second paragraph, inserted “member or members of a,” “individual members of the,” and “found to be in violation of the provision of this chapter” and substituted “Five Hundred Dollars ($500.00) for a first offense and One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00) for a second or subsequent offense” for “One Hundred Dollars ($100.00).”

      <p>
       With respect to the property owner’s claims that the minutes did not properly support the reason for entering into executive session, the court found that the one-page exhibit that called an executive session and gave the reason merely as “ to discuss personnel and pending litigation” was an insufficient explanation for calling an executive session. Therefore, the appellate court reversed the grant of summary judgment on the claim and remanded for further proceedings in the chancery court. LaCroix v.

      </li>
      <li id="t25c43s25-43-1.101ol12">
       This chapter is intended to provide a minimum procedural code for the operation of all state agencies when they take action affecting the rights and duties of the public. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as invalidating any rule or regulation adopted before July 1, 2005, if such rule or regulation was properly adopted in accordance with the law as it existed at the time of adoption. Nothing in this chapter is meant to discourage agencies from adopting procedures providing greater protections to the public or conferring additional rights upon the public; and save for express provisions of this chapter to the contrary, nothing in this chapter is meant to abrogate in whole or in part any statute prescribing procedural duties for an agency which are greater than or in addition to those provided here. This chapter is meant to apply to all rule-making that is not specifically excluded from this chapter or some portion thereof by its express terms or by the express terms of another chapter.
       <p>
        The purposes of the Mississippi Administrative Procedures Law are: to provide legislative oversight of powers and duties delegated to administrative agencies; to increase public accountability of administrative agencies; to simplify government by assuring a uniform minimum procedure to which all agencies will be held in the conduct of their most important functions; to increase public access to governmental information; and to increase public participation in the formulation of administrative rules. In accomplishing its objectives, the intention of this chapter is to strike a fair balance between these purposes and the need for efficient, economical and effective government administration. This chapter is not meant to alter the substantive rights of any person or agency. Its impact is limited to procedural rights with the expectation that better substantive results will be achieved in the everyday conduct of state government by improving the process by which those results are attained.

       Mississippi Department of Corrections (MDOC) execution protocol is a “regulation or statement” related only to inmates of the MDOC and is therefore exempt from the provisions of the Mississippi Administrative Procedures Law (MAPL); the protocol is an internal policy concerning lethal injections and the manner in which executions are carried out and is therefore not subject to the notice and comment requirements of the MAPL.

       A proposed regulation of the Mississippi Wireless Communication Commission (WCC) placing a limited moratorium on the procurement of wireless communication services by local governments would fall within the definition of “rule” in the Administrative Procedures Law (APL), thereby requiring the WCC

       Instructions for the use of an agency “form whose contents or substantive requirements are prescribed by rule or statute” are exempt from the APA’s filing and notice procedures. Whether the contents or substantive requirements of the form, including its accompanying instructions, have been prescribed by a rule or statute is a factual determination. Clark, Mar. 10, 2006, A.G.

     <p>
      If an agency finds that an imminent peril to the public health, safety or welfare requires adoption of a rule upon fewer than twenty-five (25) days’ notice and states in writing its reasons for that finding, it may proceed without prior notice of hearing or upon any abbreviated notice and hearing that it finds practicable to adopt an emergency rule. The rule may be effective for a period of not longer than one hundred twenty (120) days, renewable once for a period not exceeding ninety (90) days, but the adoption of an identical rule under subsection (1) of this section is not precluded.

     <p>
      In order to accomplish the policy set out in Section 25-45-1, each agency of the state shall develop a plan for “one-stop permitting” to coordinate the processing and issuing of permits, licenses and other such instruments by the agency with other state or federal agencies which also require an applicant to obtain a permit, license or other instrument from it or to supply information to it before the applicant may perform certain activities or receive certain benefits. “One-stop permitting” shall enable an applicant for a permit, license or other instrument from an agency of the state to complete all necessary applications at one (1) time and location or to supply enough information to the agency at one (1) time and location so that such agency can process the application or information through any other state or federal agencies necessary for the applicant to obtain authorization to perform the particular activities that he wants to perform or receive the benefits for which he has applied. To the greatest extent possible, each plan for “one-stop permitting” shall provide for the following:
     </p>
     <p>
      Where practicable, a single application form for all required permits, licenses and other instruments from agencies which have separate but similar, related or interrelated jurisdiction or authority over certain activities performed by or benefits granted to persons or entities within the state; such application form shall contain sufficient information so that the necessary reviews of all affected agencies can be expeditiously carried out;
     </p>
     <p>
      Consolidated public hearings so that a single public hearing may serve to meet the requirements of the several public hearings as may now be provided by law for issuing permits, licenses and other such instruments by agencies which have separate but similar, related or interrelated jurisdiction or authority over certain activities performed by or benefits granted to persons or entities within the state;
     </p>
     <p>
      The shortest practicable review period for applications, proper allowances being made for all interested parties to become informed and to make their opinions heard by the appropriate agencies; and
     </p>
     <p>
      Joint permitting procedures for state and federal agencies.

     <p>
      The Legislature recognizes that in order for the State of Mississippi to receive the maximum use and benefit from information technology and services now in operation or which will in the future be placed in operation, there should be full cooperation and cohesive planning and effort by and between the several state agencies and that it is the responsibility of the Legislature to provide statutory authority therefor. The Legislature, therefore, declares and determines that for these and other related purposes there is hereby established an agency of state government to be known as the Mississippi Department of Information Technology Services (MDITS). The Legislature further declares that the Mississippi Department of Information Technology Services (MDITS) shall provide statewide services that facilitate cost-effective information processing and telecommunication solutions. State agencies shall work in full cooperation with the board of MDITS to identify opportunities to minimize duplication, reduce costs and improve the efficiency of providing common technology services across agency boundaries. The provisions of this chapter shall not apply to the Department of Human Services for a period of three (3) years beginning July 1, 2017. The provisions of this chapter shall not apply to the Department of Child Protection Services for a period of three (3) years beginning July 1, 2017.
     </p>
     <p>
      Notwithstanding the exemption of the Department of Human Services and the Department of Child Protection Services from the provisions of this section, before the Department of Human Services or the Department of Child Protection Services may take an action that would otherwise be subject to the provisions of this section, the department(s) shall give notice of the proposed action to the MDITS for any recommendations by the MDITS. Upon receipt of the notice, the MDITS shall post the notice on its website and on the procurement portal website established by Sections 25-53-151 and 27-104-165. If the MDITS does not respond to the department(s) within seven (7) calendar days after receiving the notice, the department(s) may take the proposed action. If the MDITS responds to the department(s) within seven (7) calendar days, then the MDITS has seven (7) calendar days from the date of its initial response to provide any additional recommendations. After the end of the second seven-day period, the department(s) may take the proposed action. The MDITS is not authorized to disapprove any proposed actions that would otherwise be subject to the provisions of this section. This paragraph shall stand repealed on July 1, 2020.

     </p>
     <p>

     <p>
      The executive director shall have no vote in the decisions of said authority, but shall offer such professional or technical advice and assistance to the authority as may be required of him. Said executive director, in order to qualify for his position, shall be required to make a good and sufficient bond in some surety company qualified and doing business in the State of Mississippi, in the minimum penal sum of Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000.00) conditioned upon the faithful performance of his duties as required by law and the directives of the authority.

    Executive director; duties, responsibilities and authority.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The executive director shall have the following duties, responsibilities and authority:
     </p>
     <p>
      He shall conduct continuing studies of all information technology activities carried out by all agencies of the state and shall develop a long-range plan for the efficient and economical performance of such activities in state government. Such plan shall be submitted to the authority for its approval and, having been approved by the authority, shall be implemented by the executive director and all state agencies. Such plan shall be continuously reviewed and modifications thereof shall be proposed to the authority by the executive director as developments in information technology techniques and changes in the structure, activities, and functions of state government may require.
     </p>
     <p>
      He shall review the purchasing practices of all state agencies in the area of the purchasing of supplies for information technology and make recommendations to the authority and to the Public Procurement Review Board for the institution of purchasing procedures which will insure the most economical procurement of such supplies commensurate with the efficient operation of all departments and agencies of state government.
     </p>
     <p>
      He shall see that all reports required of all agencies are promptly and accurately made in accordance with the rules and regulations adopted by the authority. Either in person or through his authorized agents, he shall make such inspections of information technology operations being conducted by any of the agencies of the state as may be necessary for the performance of his duties.
     </p>
     <p>
      He shall suggest and cause to be brought about cooperation between the several state agencies in order to provide efficiency in information technology operation. He shall, together with the heads of the agencies involved, reduce to writing and execute cooperative plans for the acquisition and operation of information technology equipment, and any such plan so adopted shall be carried out in accordance with the provisions of such plan unless the same shall be amended by the joint action of the executive director and the heads of agencies involved. The executive director shall report to the authority the details of any plan so adopted and all amendments or modifications thereof, and shall otherwise report to the authority and to the Public Procurement Review Board any failure on the part of any agency to carry out the provisions of such plan. In the event the head of any agency involved or the executive director shall propose amendments to a plan so adopted and such amendment is disapproved by the head of another agency involved or the executive director, an appeal may be taken to the authority which may, after full consideration thereof, order the adoption of the proposed amendment or any modification thereof. The executive director shall make decisions on all questions of the division of the cost of information technology operations among the several agencies, but his findings shall be subject to the approval or modification by the authority on appeal to it.
     </p>
     <p>
      He shall review all contracts for acquisition of computer equipment or services now or hereafter in force and may require the renegotiation, termination, amendment or execution of any such contracts in proper form and in accordance with the policies and rules and regulations and subject to the direction of the authority. In the negotiation and execution of such contracts, the executive director may negotiate a limitation on the liability to the state of prospective contractors provided such limitation affords the state reasonable protection.
     </p>
     <p>
      He shall act as the purchasing and contracting agent for the State of Mississippi in the negotiation and execution of all contracts for the acquisition of computer equipment or services. He shall receive, review, and promptly approve or disapprove all requests of agencies of the state for the acquisition of computer equipment or services, which are submitted in accordance with rules and regulations of the authority. In the event that any such request is disapproved, he shall immediately notify the requesting agency and the members of the authority in writing of such disapproval, stating his reasons therefor. The disapproval of any request by the executive director of the authority may be appealed to the authority or to the Public Procurement Review Board, respectively, in such manner as may be authorized by such reasonable rules and regulations hereby authorized to be adopted by the authority and by the Public Procurement Review Board to govern the same. The executive director shall report the approval of all such requests to the authority in such manner as may be directed by the authority, and shall execute any such contracts only after complying with rules and regulations which may be adopted by the authority in relation thereto. Any contracts for personal or professional services entered into by the executive director shall be exempted from the requirements of Section 25-9-120(3) relating to submission of such contract to the State Personal Service Contract Review Board.
     </p>
     <p>
      He shall suggest and cause to be brought about cooperation between the several state agencies, departments and institutions in order that work may be done by one agency for another agency, and equipment in one agency may be made available to another agency, and suggest and cause to be brought about such improvements as may be necessary in joint or cooperative information technology operations.
     </p>
     <p>
      He shall be designated as the “Chief Information Confidentiality Officer” after being duly sworn to the oath of this office by the chairman of the authority and shall be responsible for administering the oath to other qualified officers he may designate.
     </p>
     <p>
      He shall appoint employees of the Mississippi Department of Information Technology Services, or at his discretion, employees of other state agencies and institutions that are responsible for handling or processing data for any agency or institution other than that for which they are employed, to a position of information custodial care that shall be known as “Information Confidentiality Officer.” The selection and swearing of all officers shall be reported to the authority at the next regular meeting and names, affirmation dates and employment dates shall be recorded in the permanent minutes of the authority.

      Upon written complaint of any person claiming to be adversely affected by disclosure of confidential information by any information confidentiality officer, the director shall give notice to the information confidentiality officer of the fact that such complaint has been filed and shall give such notice to the Chairman of the Mississippi Department of Information Technology Services, who shall call a meeting of the members of the authority for the purpose of hearing such complaint.

After such hearing, if the authority, based upon substantial evidence, shall find that the information confidentiality officer has disclosed confidential information in violation of his oath, the authority shall enter such finding of fact on its minutes and the information confidentiality officer shall be immediately discharged from employment. If the authority shall find that such oath has not been violated, it shall, likewise, enter such finding on its minutes and the complaint shall be dismissed.

       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       In an action of ejectment respecting the location of a division line and the plaintiff shows that the land in controversy is embraced in his deed, and the defendant relies upon an alleged parol agreement, the burden of proof is upon him to show such agreement, and it is proper so to instruct the jury. Archer v. Helm, 70 Miss. 874, 12 So. 702, 1893 Miss. LEXIS 22 (Miss. 1893).
      </p>

       <b>
        2. Defenses.
       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       A wife in possession of the husband’s homestead, when sued in ejectment by his vendees, may show that he was insane at the time, after abandoning her, when he executed the deed to plaintiff. Larson v. Larson, 82 Miss. 116, 33 So. 717, 1903 Miss. LEXIS 104 (Miss. 1903).
      </p>
      <p>
       A plaintiff seeking recovery on a tax title cannot be shown by the defendant to have been incapacitated to purchase at tax sale, such a defense being equitable rather than legal. Graham v. Warren, 81 Miss. 330, 33 So. 71, 1902 Miss. LEXIS 150 (Miss. 1902).
      </p>
      <p>
       That a municipal tax deed under which plaintiff claims, which was not filed with the clerk in accordance with Code 1892, §§ 3022, 3823 (Code 1906, §§ 3425, 4338), is available as a defense in ejectment, but is not such a defense as will support a subsequent bill for cancellation. Sintes v. Barber, 78 Miss. 585, 29 So. 403, 1900 Miss. LEXIS 156 (Miss. 1900).
      </p>
      <p>
       A party rightfully in possession of land under a bond for title can set up his right for defense to an action of ejectment. Bolton v. Roebuck, 77 Miss. 710, 27 So. 630, 1900 Miss. LEXIS 21 (Miss. 1900).
      </p>
      <h4 id="t25c55s25-55-1-JUDICIALDECISIONS01-3.Evidence.">
       <b>
        3. Evidence.
       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       Where defendant claimed under deeds containing conditions precedent, it was error to exclude plaintiff’s testimony as to whether the conditions had been met. Maxwell v. Mississippi Valley Co., 95 Miss. 466, 48 So. 610, 1909 Miss. LEXIS 220 (Miss. 1909).
      </p>
      <p>
       A tax deed conveying to plaintiff in ejectment a town lot designated as “lot 9 on the south side of Otto Street” does not entitle him to the recovery of a lot bearing the same number south of, but not bordering that street on the south side. Illinois C. R. Co. v. Baldwin, 77 Miss. 788, 28 So. 948, 1900 Miss. LEXIS 62 (Miss. 1900).
      </p>
      <p>
       An unsealed deed, executed prior to the Code 1880, which abolishes private seals, does not convey the legal title, although it was executed in another state where seals were not required. Gibbs v. McGuire, 70 Miss. 646, 12 So. 829, 1893 Miss. LEXIS 32 (Miss. 1893).
      </p>
      <p>
       A plaintiff in ejectment who introduces a patent from the state in which the locus in quo is referred to as swampland, and a certificate from the general land office showing that it is included in the list of swamp and overflowed lands inuring to the state under the Act of Congress, September, 1850, makes out a case. Muse v. Richards, 70 Miss. 581, 12 So. 821, 1893 Miss. LEXIS 27 (Miss. 1893).
      </p>
      <h4 id="t25c55s25-55-1-JUDICIALDECISIONS01-4.Recovery.">
       <b>
        4. Recovery.
       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       This provision has no application to a case where defendant’s plea eliminates any controversy as to the land involved, as where the defendant claims title only as to a specific part of the land described in the declaration; it applies alone to a case where the plaintiff contends to the last for certain described premises and recovers a smaller amount. Carmichael v. J. Cahn Co., 183 Miss. 535, 184 So. 417, 1938 Miss. LEXIS 266 (Miss. 1938).
      </p>
      <p>
       In an action of ejectment against a railroad company to recover land upon which it has wrongfully entered and constructed its track, but acted in good faith the plaintiff’s recovery will be limited to the land itself, with compensation for any use and occupation to the same to cover damages done thereto by the defendant. He cannot recover the track or any sum for the use thereof. Illinois C. R. Co. v. Hoskins, 80 Miss. 730, 32 So. 150, 1902 Miss. LEXIS 301 (Miss. 1902).

        5. Dismissal of action.

      </h4>
      <p>
       Where plaintiff in good faith sold land, it was entitled to dismiss the suit without prejudice. Hibernia Bank & Trust Co. v. Beech, 117 Miss. 668, 78 So. 609, 1918 Miss. LEXIS 210 (Miss. 1918).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where plaintiff sells land, and moves for a dismissal without prejudice, he should be taxed with costs incurred previous to the nonsuit. Hibernia Bank & Trust Co. v. Beech, 117 Miss. 668, 78 So. 609, 1918 Miss. LEXIS 210 (Miss. 1918).
      </p>

       <b>
        6. Miscellaneous.
       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       Plaintiff, though claiming land under grantor with defective title, was entitled to recover land from defendant, where his possession of land was prior to that of defendant, who was a mere intruder. Stewart v. Kennedy & Co., 118 Miss. 766, 80 So. 105, 1918 Miss. LEXIS 134 (Miss. 1918).
      </p>
      <p>
       Ejectment cannot be maintained against one holding under a bond for title, executed by plaintiff or his privies, without evidence of a tender of a deed to and the placing of defendant in default, and in such case it is immaterial that a deed was tendered defendant by strangers to the bond. Graham v. Warren, 81 Miss. 330, 33 So. 71, 1902 Miss. LEXIS 150 (Miss. 1902).

       A decree of chancery court dismissing a bill filed to cancel a deed because of failure by the defendant to show title in himself is not res adjudicata in an action of ejectment for the same land between the same parties, and the record thereof is not admissible in evidence.

       A decree dismissing a bill to redeem an undivided interest in lands from tax sale and for partition after redemption does not estop the complainant from setting up the invalidity of the tax sale when sued in ejectment, although the bill, by an amendment stricken out prior to final decree, assailed the validity of the tax title. Brothers v. Beck, 75 Miss. 482, 22 So. 944, 1897 Miss. LEXIS 126 (Miss. 1897).

     <p>
      In any county in which the record of deeds, or any material part thereof, may be destroyed, the chancellor may examine into the matter; and if he find any abstracts, copies, minutes, or extracts from said records existing after such destruction, he shall appoint two (2) persons learned in such matters to act with him, and the three (3) shall investigate the same. If they find that the abstracts, copies, minutes, or extracts were fairly made before such destruction of the records, and that they contain material and substantial parts of the destroyed records, they shall so certify to the board of supervisors; and thereupon the board of supervisors shall have power to purchase such abstracts, minutes, copies, or extracts, or any part thereof, or to procure copies thereof and to pay therefor, out of the county treasury, a reasonable compensation.

    Assessment rolls.

     </h3>
     <p>
      When the assessment rolls of a county, or either of them, shall be stolen, lost, or destroyed, it shall be the duty of the board of supervisors to obtain certified copies thereof from the office of the state tax commission or the proper custodian thereof, and to pay for the same out of the county treasury. If the assessment have been so recently made that copies thereof are not on file in the auditor’s office, then the assessment roll or rolls of the county used the preceding year shall be in force and, if necessary, copies thereof shall in like manner be obtained, and the taxes of the current year collected thereon; but in such case new assessments shall be made for the following year.

    Presentation of photocopy of state warrant where original has been lost or destroyed.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      When a state warrant has been lost or destroyed before having been paid by the State Treasurer, and a photocopy of such warrant is presented for payment to the State Treasurer by a qualified state depository bank or a Federal Reserve bank, a duplicate warrant need not be issued in order for payment to be made. The State Treasurer may treat the photocopy as the warrant or certificate of the State Auditor or State Fiscal Management Board issued pursuant to law and may pay the same, provided the photocopy is presented in accordance with applicable Federal Reserve Board rules and such regulations as the State Treasurer may prescribe.

    Proceedings to perfect record.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      A lost, stolen, or destroyed record shall not constitute constructive notice longer than three (3) years from the loss, theft, or destruction thereof, unless within that time the instrument shall be again placed on the record, or proceedings be begun to perfect the record. In all cases where the record of any instrument affecting the title, lien, or interest in real estate is lost or destroyed by tornado, fire, or otherwise, any person claiming to be the owner of or having a legal interest in or title to any real estate described in or affected by said lost or destroyed record may file his petition to the chancery court of the county in which the record has been lost or destroyed, setting forth a description of the land involved, with a statement of petitioner’s claim and the nature thereof, the names, places of residence, and post-office addresses of all persons known to the petitioner to have or claim any interest in land by virtue of such lost or destroyed record or having a recordable instrument affecting the title to such land described in or affected by the lost or destroyed instrument or instruments, and giving in clear and succinct language petitioner’s claim to or ownership of the land involved, with a prayer that summons be issued and served on all persons named as defendants, whether resident or nonresident. Upon the filing of such petition, the clerk of the chancery court shall issue summons for the defendants as in other cases in equity, returnable at a day not less than four (4) weeks nor more than eight (8) weeks from such filing, and requiring all defendants to appear and plead, answer, or demur to the petition. When the summons has been personally served upon the resident defendants not less than five (5) days before the return-day and proof of publication has been made for any nonresident defendants, as now required by law, and no one of the named defendants appears and contests the petition, then the chancery court or presiding chancellor, either in term time or vacation, may forthwith hear said petition, adjudicate the sufficiency of process, render any and all necessary decrees pro confesso and enter a final decree or decrees disposing of said petition. If any defendant appears and contests the petition, the chancery clerk shall promptly notify the chancellor of the district in writing of the pendency of said petition and the contest thereon, and the chancellor shall then notify the chancery clerk to set the matter for hearing at some future date not less than ten (10) days thereafter. The clerk shall give the parties or their solicitors of record not less than five (5) days’ notice by letter addressed to the parties or their solicitors, advising that the matter will be heard on the day named, and on the day set for the hearing the chancellor shall hear and determine the controversy as other suits in chancery and enter a decree in accordance with his finding. The chancellor may by his final decree adjudicate the execution of any lost or destroyed or stolen instruments involved in the proceeding, and may order the final decree recorded as provided by law in other cases affecting land titles.

       Where a vendor brought an action to obtain purchasers’ execution of a new note and a deed of trust for a lost one and to obtain a lien for balance of indebtedness then due on land conveyed, this action could have properly been tried by chancellor in term time and the chancellor was without authority to try the case and enter final decree for the vendor in vacation in view of the fact that since the deed of trust had not been recorded, there was no constructive notice to be restored, restoration of constructive notice was the object of the statute. Hood v. Lamar, 219 Miss. 349, 68 So. 2d 456, 1953 Miss. LEXIS 395 (Miss. 1953).
      </p>
      <p>
       A proceeding by landowners in a drainage district to have the district declared illegal and dissolved was not maintainable on the ground that fraud had been practiced in procuring the signatures of some of the landowners to the waiver of process in proceedings under this section, in the absence of a charge in the bill, of the facts relied on as constituting fraud. Vanlandingham v. Meridian Creek Drainage Dist., 191 Miss. 345, 2 So. 2d 591, 1941 Miss. LEXIS 143 (Miss. 1941).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where landowners in a drainage district delayed for twenty years before bringing suit against the district and bondholders to have the district declared illegal, void, and dissolved, and the Chancery Court conducting the proceeding had jurisdiction of the parties and the subject matter, the long delay, under the facts and circumstances, precluded the landowners from relief, and the fact that statutory proceedings had been instituted about nine years previously to re-establish the district organization records, which had been destroyed by fire, had no bearing on the question of laches, and such proceedings neither validated nor invalidated the lost records. Vanlandingham v. Meridian Creek Drainage Dist., 191 Miss. 345, 2 So. 2d 591, 1941 Miss. LEXIS 143 (Miss. 1941).
      </p>
      <p>
       The object of this statute is to restore constructive notice. Vanlandingham v. Meridian Creek Drainage Dist., 191 Miss. 345, 2 So. 2d 591, 1941 Miss. LEXIS 143 (Miss. 1941).
      </p>
      <p>
       Since adverse possession for the statutory period is of itself at least constructive notice of title, and since such title may not be divested by individual action except by transfer from the holder or loss by subsequent and superseding adverse occupancy, the proceedings by which a defendant’s predecessor in title sought to establish his record title under the statute, all existing records having been destroyed by fire, did not affect the complainant’s outstanding title by adverse possession, especially since he was not made a party to such proceedings. Shepherd v. Cox, 191 Miss. 715, 1 So. 2d 495, 4 So. 2d 217, 1941 Miss. LEXIS 112 (Miss. 1941).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section, first enacted in 1892, did not operate retrospectively, except that a record lost, stolen, or destroyed prior to that time is made to cease to constitute constructive notice three years from the time the statute became operative, unless restored; and, for those subsequently lost such notice is made to cease three years from the time of loss, unless restored.

In making its evaluation, the Mississippi Central Data Processing Authority shall consider options available to the county or municipality by reason of the existence of other publicly financed, owned, or operated geographic information systems or multipurpose cadastres available to the county or municipality.”

    Borrowing money to create geographic information system and to prepare multipurpose cadastre.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <ol>
      <li id="t25c58s25-58-3ol11">
       The board of supervisors of any county and the governing authorities of any municipality (both referred to in this section as “governing authority”) are hereby authorized and empowered, in their discretion, to borrow money, pursuant to the provisions of this section to create the geographic information system and prepare the multipurpose cadastre authorized in Section 25-58-1.
      </li>
      <li id="t25c58s25-58-3ol12">
       Before any money is borrowed under the provisions of this section, the governing authority shall adopt a resolution declaring the necessity for such borrowing and specifying the purpose for which the money borrowed is to be expended, the amount to be borrowed, the date or dates of the maturity thereof, and how such indebtedness is to be evidenced. The resolution shall be certified over the signature of the head of the governing authority.
      </li>
      <li id="t25c58s25-58-3ol13">
       The borrowing shall be evidenced by negotiable notes or certificates of indebtedness of the governing authority which shall be signed by the principal officer and clerk of such governing authority. All such notes or certificates of indebtedness shall be offered at public sale by the governing authority after not less than ten (10) days’ advertising in a newspaper having general circulation within the governing authority. Each sale shall be made to the bidder offering the lowest rate of interest or whose bid represents the lowest net cost to the governing authority; however, the rate of interest shall not exceed that now or hereafter authorized in Section 75-17-101, Mississippi Code of 1972. No such notes or certificates of indebtedness shall be issued and sold for less than par and accrued interest. All notes or certificates of indebtedness shall mature in approximately equal installments of principal and interest over a period not to exceed ten (10) years from the dates of the issuance thereof. Principal shall be payable annually, and interest shall be payable annually or semiannually; provided, however, that the first payment of principal or interest may be for any period not exceeding one (1) year. Provided, however, if negotiable notes are outstanding from not more than one (1) previous issue authorized under the provisions of this section, then the schedule of payments for a new or supplementary issue may be so adjusted that the schedule of maturities of all notes or series of notes hereunder shall, when combined, mature in approximately equal installments of principal and interest over a period of ten (10) years from the date of the new or supplementary issue, or if a lower interest rate will thereby be secured on notes previously issued and outstanding, a portion of the proceeds of any issue authorized hereunder may be used to refund the balance of the indebtedness previously issued under the authority of this article. Such notes or certificates of indebtedness shall be issued in such form and in such denominations as may be determined by the governing authority and may be made payable at the office of any bank or trust company selected by the governing authority. In such case, funds for the payment of principal and interest due thereon shall be provided in the same manner provided by law for the payment of the principal and interest due on bonds issued by the governing authority.
      </li>
      <li id="t25c58s25-58-3ol14">
       For the prompt payment of notes or certificates of indebtedness at maturity, both principal and interest, the full faith, credit and resources of the issuing entity are pledged. Furthermore, the governing authority may annually levy a special tax in an amount not to exceed three (3) mills upon all of its taxable property, the avails of which shall be paid into a sinking fund and used exclusively for the payment of principal of and interest on the notes or certificates of indebtedness. Until needed for expenditure, monies in the sinking fund may be invested in the same manner as the governing authority is elsewhere authorized by law to invest surplus funds.
      </li>
      <li id="t25c58s25-58-3ol15">
       The proceeds of any notes or certificates of indebtedness issued under the provisions of this section shall be placed in a special fund and shall be expended only for the purpose or purposes for which they were issued as shown by the resolution authorizing the issuance thereof. If a balance shall remain of the proceeds of such notes or certificates of indebtedness after the purpose or purposes for which they were issued shall have been accomplished, such balance shall be used to pay such obligations at or before maturity and may be transferred to any sinking fund previously established for the payment thereof.
      </li>
      <li id="t25c58s25-58-3ol16">
       Proceeds from the sale of notes or certificates of indebtedness not immediately necessary for expenditure shall be invested in the same manner as surplus funds of the governing authority may be invested.
      </li>
      <li id="t25c58s25-58-3ol17">
       Regardless of the method of paying for the creation of a geographic information system or for the preparation of a multipurpose cadastre, and notwithstanding anything in the Mississippi Public Records Act Section 25-61-1 et seq., to the contrary, a county or municipality which has created or acquired a geographic information system or prepared a multipurpose cadastre may assess a fee or charge in accordance with the provisions of Section 25-61-7(2). However, all fees shall be subject to a standard scale adopted by the governing authority. If the governing authority has issued notes or certificates of indebtedness, any fees shall be deposited into the sinking fund and used exclusively for payment of principal and interest on the notes or certificates of indebtedness until paid in full. Thereafter, the fees shall be deposited into the county’s or municipality’s general fund.

     <p>
      Establish and maintain an active and continuing program for the economical and efficient management of records.
     </p>
     <p>
      Cause to be made and preserved records containing adequate and proper documentation of the organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures and essential transactions of the agency or office and designed to furnish the information necessary to protect the legal and financial rights of the government and of the persons directly affected by the agency’s activities.
     </p>
     <p>
      Submit to the department for review by the state records committee and in accordance with the rules and regulations of the department, a recommended retention schedule for records in its custody, except schedules for certain types of records common to all agencies or offices which may be established by the department and the state records committee. No records will be scheduled for retention any longer than is absolutely necessary in the performance of the required functions of the agency or office. Records not actively required for the performance of the agency’s or official’s duties will be transferred to the records center or the Mississippi State Archives in accordance with rules and regulations established by the department. Records which have been identified as archival, or which must be retained permanently, may be transferred directly to the Mississippi State Archives, consistent with the provisions of this chapter.

     </p>
     <p>
      Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to divest state agency heads or appointed or elected state officials of the authority to determine the nature and form of records acquired in the administration of their several responsibilities.

       § 25-59-17.
    Record control schedules for courts; destruction of court records.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The Mississippi Supreme Court may, by rule of the court, provide for the development of records control schedules for the various and several courts in the Mississippi judiciary system, provided that the director of the department of archives and history shall be consulted prior to the destruction of any court records.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Mississippi Supreme Court may rule that the courts will cooperate with the department in the establishment of records control schedules for the records of the courts.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the alternative, the courts in the individual counties may cooperate with the board of supervisors in that county in the development of an overall records management program and records control schedules. The director of the department of archives and history shall be consulted prior to the destruction of any county court records. The director shall respond to such requests within sixty (60) days.
     </p>
     <p>
      The destruction of court records by authorized retention schedules shall not be construed as affecting the status of that court as a court of record.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Any custodian of public records as defined by this chapter is authorized to reproduce any part of the records kept by the office concerned unless otherwise prohibited by law or withheld from reproduction in the public interest. Such copies shall be produced by equipment and systems which shall accurately reproduce and preserve the original record in all material details and in a durable form. Each agency shall preserve such reproductions in conveniently accessible files and provide for preserving, examining and using them. If the records are of enduring value to the agency concerned or are determined to be of archival value by the Mississippi Department of Archives and History, the reproduction and storage methods and procedures used must meet standards approved by the department. One (1) master copy of each record of enduring or archival value reproduced shall be deposited with the department. Custodians of public records may destroy the original records from which the reproductions have been made, or any part of them, provided that (a) the records are of no value to the agency concerned, (b) the Mississippi Department of Archives and History certifies that the records may be destroyed through the provisions of retention schedules approved by the state records committee, and (c) the records microfilmed or reproduced and approved for destruction are reported to the Mississippi Department of Archives and History in such manner as it may direct. Any such reproduction or copy of any original record or other document shall be deemed to be the original record for all purposes and shall be admissible as evidence in all courts or administrative agencies. A facsimile, exemplified or certified copy thereof shall for all purposes be deemed to be a transcript or certified copy of the original record.

    Short title; legislative policy regarding right of access to records.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the “Mississippi Public Records Act of 1983.” It is the policy of the Legislature that public records must be available for inspection by any person unless otherwise provided by Chapter 453, Laws of 1996. Furthermore, providing access to public records is a duty of each public body and automation of public records must not erode the right of access to those records. As each agency increases its use of and dependence on electronic record keeping, each agency must ensure reasonable access to records electronically maintained, subject to the rules of records retention.

       Chancery court erred, inter alia, in requiring Mississippi Department of Corrections to produce records, without redaction, pertaining to its process and protocol for lethal injections, because, during the pendency of the matter on appeal, the Legislature declared that the information sought was exempt, the Legislature did not include a saving clause, any rights involved in the present suit were public rights shared by all, and the applicant acquired no vested rights in the information as a result of submitting its request and did not take a prejudicial position in reliance on receiving the information.

   Where the Harrison County Development Commission (HCDC), a political subdivision of the State of Mississippi, willfully and knowingly denied a county citizen access to certain records related to a planned development (in part, by unilaterally requiring fees that were not part of its policy), and which were not exempt under the Mississippi Public Records Act of 1983, Miss.

Pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t25c61s25-61-9ol12" target="_self">25-61-9(2)</a></cite>, HCDC should have separated information on its director’s salary and leave time (subject to disclosure), from his personnel file and disclosed any non exempt material; further, the information on its business partners or prospects were not confidential and were subject to disclosure, and therefore, it was not entitled to a protective order per Miss.

       A municipality, including the water/sewer department, is a public body, and the records of such department, including meter reading lists, billings, and individual account documents, are public records. Thompson, May 13, 1992, A.G. Op. #92-0310.
      </p>
      <p>
       Miss. Code Section 25-61-3(b) makes all of records of Justice Court dealing with both criminal cases and civil cases public records; therefore, public has right to inspect records unless they are exempted from Public Records Act (Miss. Code Sections 25-61-1 through 25-61-17) by some other provision. Erby, Apr. 14, 1993, A.G. Op. #93-0210.

       Under Miss. Code Section 25-61-3(b), if public board member tape records meeting at his or her own expense for personal use, such recording is not “public record”. Warren, May 12, 1993, A.G. Op. #93-0340.
      </p>
      <p>
       The definition of “public record” contained in the statute applies to records that were created prior to July 1, 1983 and that were retained outside of the public body custody by a public body official after the expiration of his term. Hilliard, December 11, 1998, A.G. Op. #98-0641.

       As a general rule, unless state law provides a specific exemption from disclosure, records in the possession of a public body, including a municipality and its departments, would be “public records.” Minniece, May 30, 2003, A.G. Op. 03-0262.

      <p>
       It is unclear whether a Planning and Development District (PDD) is an entity of the state or of a political subdivision so as to come within the definition of “public body.” However,
   it is clear that, inherent in a county’s membership in any PPD, is the full right of access to, inspection, and copying of the financial records of the PDD. Any bylaws or rules of the PDD to the contrary are void as against public policy. Smith, Feb. 4, 2004, A.G. Op. 03-0592.

       Structure and wording of the Mississippi Public Records Act of 1983 as a whole indicates that the right the Legislature intended to create was the right of the public to the disclosure of public records; based on the language of the Public Records Act, the Legislature intended the right affected by the 2015 amendments discussed above to be the right of the public to have access to materials that belong to the public. Cellular S., Inc. v. BellSouth Telecomms., LLC, 214 So.3d 208, 2017 Miss. LEXIS 73 (Miss. 2017).

      <p>
       Reports containing identities of informants who told Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) that electric power company was improperly disposing of regulated environmental waste were exempt from disclosure under Public Records Act, despite claim that identities of any informants could be deleted from desired documents. Singing River Elec. Power Ass'n v. State ex rel. Mississippi Dep't of Envtl. Quality, 693 So. 2d 368, 1997 Miss. LEXIS 154 (Miss. 1997).

      <p>
       Fact that electric power company wanted to know identities of informants who told Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) that company was improperly disposing of regulated environmental waste because such knowledge could shed light on either a hostile takeover attempt that targeted company or a shooting incident at one of company’s substation transformers did not provide basis to compel Department to disclose identities of informants notwithstanding statutory direction otherwise.

       Chancery court erred in finding that the Department of Marine Resources (DMR) violated the Mississippi Public Records Act of 1983 when it denied a newspaper publisher’s requests and when it found the investigative-report exemption did not apply because the records the publisher sought were investigative reports; a State grand-jury subpoena prohibited the release of the DMR records to anyone except for the State Auditor, who became the custodian of DMR’s records.

Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t25c61s25-61-15" target="_self">25-61-15</a></cite> regarding the acts of the planning commission because the element of “willfulness” only pertained to assessment of possible civil penalties, not the actual violation. No exception to a Public Records Act violation could occur, since there was no “willfulness” element regarding the violation itself. LaCroix v.

   Where the Harrison County Development Commission (HCDC), a political subdivision of the State of Mississippi, willfully and knowingly denied a county citizen access to certain records related to a planned development (in part, by unilaterally requiring fees that were not part of its policy), and which were not exempt under the Mississippi Public Records Act of 1983, Miss.

Code Ann.§<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t25c61s25-61-1" target="_self">25-61-1</a></cite>7, it was properly ordered to produce those records not specifically exempt, and pay a civil penalty, as well as attorney’s fees. Pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t25c61s25-61-9ol12" target="_self">25-61-9(2)</a></cite>, HCDC should have separated information on its director’s salary and leave time (subject to disclosure), from his personnel file and disclosed any non exempt material; further, the information on its business partners or prospects were not confidential and were subject to disclosure, and therefore, it was not entitled to a protective order per Miss. R. Civ. P. 26(d). Harrison County Dev. Comm'n v. Kinney, 920 So. 2d 497, 2006 Miss. App. LEXIS 51 (Miss. Ct. App. 2006).

       Under Miss. Code Section 25-61-7, when copies of public records are requested, Attorney General’s office may establish and collect fees to reimburse, but in no case to exceed actual cost of searching, reviewing and/or duplicating and, if applicable, mailing copies of public records; these fees may be collected in advance before compliance with request. Erby, Apr. 14, 1993, A.G. Op. #93-0210.

       A search of the criminal records for felony convictions would be exempt from the salary cap on compensation received by Circuit Clerks. Carpenter, February 7, 1996, A.G. Op. #96-0003.
      </p>
      <p>
       When performing criminal record checks, the District Attorney’s office may only charge a fee for the actual cost associated with supplying the record to the requestor. Allgood, Jan. 30, 1998, A.G. Op. #98-0012.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no statutory authority for chancery clerks to charge flat monthly fees to abstractors for use of the fax machine in the office of the clerk or to charge fees for sending faxes to members of the public. Crook, Sept. 13, 2002, A.G. Op. #02-0334.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because Section 25-61-7(2) applies not just to Geographic Information System and multipurpose cadastre information, but also “other electronically accessible data,” a county may establish a standard fee scale to reimburse it for creating, acquiring and maintaining other electronically accessible data. Dowdy, Dec. 27, 2005, A.G. Op. 05-0612.
      </p>
      <p>
       How fees shall be calculated is matter for the board of supervisors to address; however the board must make factual determinations regarding each statutorily authorized factor used in determining the standard fee scale and have those determinations recorded in the minutes. Dowdy, Dec. 27, 2005, A.G. Op. 05-0612.
      </p>
      <p>
       The board of supervisors must establish and approve, as evidenced in the minutes, any standard fee scale authorized by Section 25-61-7(2), as well as any other “pricing policy.” Dowdy, Dec. 27, 2005, A.G. Op. 05-0612.
      </p>
      <p>
       While the board of supervisors may require commercial users of the data to pay a premium for the data, the board may not restrict the data’s use to “private use only” or prohibit resale of the information acquired. Dowdy, Dec. 27, 2005, A.G. Op. 05-0612.
      </p>
      <p>
       Provided the costs and expenses are calculated pursuant to a lawfully enacted policy designed to capture the
   “actual cost” of providing public records as provided by Section 25-61-7, the fact that the initial estimate was lower than the actual amount necessary to cover the costs would not preclude a public body from collecting that additional amount. Baker, July 10, 2006, A.G. Op. 06-0291.

       Structure and wording of the Mississippi Public Records Act of 1983 as a whole indicates that the right the Legislature intended to create was the right of the public to the disclosure of public records; based on the language of the Public Records Act, the Legislature intended the right affected by the 2015 amendments discussed above to be the right of the public to have access to materials that belong to the public.

   Where the Harrison County Development Commission (HCDC), a political subdivision of the State of Mississippi, willfully and knowingly denied a county citizen access to certain records related to a planned development (in part, by unilaterally requiring fees that were not part of its policy), and which were not exempt under the Mississippi Public Records Act of 1983, Miss.

       Structure and wording of the Mississippi Public Records Act of 1983 as a whole indicates that the right the Legislature intended to create was the right of the public to the disclosure of public records; based on the language of the Public Records Act, the Legislature intended the right affected by the 2015 amendments discussed above to be the right of the public to have access to materials that belong to the public. Cellular S., Inc. v. BellSouth Telecomms., LLC, 214 So.3d 208, 2017 Miss. LEXIS 73 (Miss. 2017).
      </p>
      <p>
       Rights and remedies at issue were created solely by the Mississippi Public Records Act of 1983; thus, absent an applicable saving clause, a final judgment, or a loss to the telecommunications company of a vested right, the supreme court had to apply the Public Records Act to a corporation’s petition to revoke a protective order of a proposal and contract between the Department of Information Technology Services and the telecommunications company as though it had always read as it read today. Cellular S., Inc. v. BellSouth Telecomms., LLC, 214 So.3d 208, 2017 Miss. LEXIS 73 (Miss. 2017).
      </p>
      <p>
       Statutes within an act should be construed to “harmonize with” one another, and interpreting the statute in a manner that prevents the plain language of other parts of the Mississippi Public Records Act of 1983 from correcting contradictory or even erroneous orders certainly fails to do so.

     <p>
      The Mississippi Ethics Commission shall have the authority to enforce the provisions of this chapter upon a complaint filed by any person denied the right granted under Section 25-61-5 to inspect or copy public records. Upon receiving a complaint, the commission shall forward a copy of the complaint to the head of the public body involved. The public body shall have fourteen (14) days from receipt of the complaint to file a response with the commission. After receiving the response to the complaint or, if no response is received after fourteen (14) days, the commission, in its discretion, may dismiss the complaint or proceed by setting a hearing in accordance with rules and regulations promulgated by the Ethics Commission. The Ethics Commission may order the public body and any individual employees or officials of the public body to produce records or take other reasonable measures necessary, if any, to comply with this chapter. The Ethics Commission may also impose penalties as authorized in this chapter. The Ethics Commission may order a public body to produce records for private review by the commission, its staff or designee. The Ethics Commission shall complete its private review of the records within thirty (30) days after receipt of the records from the public body. Records produced to the commission for private review shall remain exempt from disclosure under this chapter while in the custody of the commission.

      Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prohibit the Ethics Commission from mediating or otherwise resolving disputes arising under this chapter, from issuing an order based on a complaint and response where no facts are in dispute, or from entering orders agreed to by the parties. In carrying out its responsibilities under this section, the Ethics Commission shall have all the powers and authority granted to it in Title 25, Chapter 4, Mississippi Code of 1972, including the authority to promulgate rules and regulations in furtherance of this chapter.

      Any party may petition the chancery court of the county in which the public body is located to enforce or appeal any order of the Ethics Commission issued pursuant to this chapter. In any such appeal the chancery court shall conduct a de novo review. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prohibit any party from filing a complaint in any chancery court having jurisdiction, nor shall a party be obligated to exhaust administrative remedies before filing a complaint. However, any party filing such a complaint in chancery court shall serve written notice upon the Ethics Commission at the time of filing the complaint. The written notice is for information only and does not make the Ethics Commission a party to the case.

       The 2008 amendment substituted in (1)(a) “inspect or copy” for “inspect and/or copy” near the beginning; and added “or any public records opinion of the Mississippi Ethics Commission” at the end; added (1)(b); and made a minor stylistic change.

       Court of appeals did not except prisoners from the Public Records Act because it never stated or suggested that prisoners were outside the scope of the Act, and if an inmate so desired he could, pursuant to the statute, institute a suit in the chancery court; nothing in the court of appeals decision or in the order of the circuit court prevented his doing so, and the supreme court’s ruling did not impede the inmate’s statutory right to file such an action.

   Language of the statute contains no indication that, by its enactment, the Mississippi Legislature intended to abrogate judicial immunity; because there is no textual indication whatsoever that the legislature intended to abrogate judicial immunity, the supreme court declines to read the “any person” language as a limitation on judicial immunity.

   Where the Harrison County Development Commission (HCDC), a political subdivision of the State of Mississippi, willfully and knowingly denied a county citizen access to certain records related to a planned development (in part, by unilaterally requiring fees that were not part of its policy), and which were not exempt under the Mississippi Public Records Act of 1983, Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t25c61s25-61-1" target="_self">25-61-1</a></cite> to Miss. Code Ann.§<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t25c61s25-61-1" target="_self">25-61-1</a></cite>7, it was properly ordered to produce those records not specifically exempt, and pay a civil penalty, as well as attorney’s fees. Pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t25c61s25-61-9ol12" target="_self">25-61-9(2)</a></cite>, HCDC should have separated information on its director’s salary and leave time (subject to disclosure), from his personnel file and disclosed any non exempt material; further, the information on its business partners or prospects were not confidential and were subject to disclosure, and therefore, it was not entitled to a protective order per Miss. R. Civ. P. 26(d). Harrison County Dev. Comm'n v. Kinney, 920 So. 2d 497, 2006 Miss. App. LEXIS 51 (Miss. Ct. App. 2006).

       The Department of Wildlife did not willfully and knowingly deny access to non-exempt public information, nor did it engage in actions or conduct which rose to the level of bad faith, and, therefore, the assessment of a civil penalty was not warranted where there was no direct Mississippi authority to guide it to release the requested records.

   Chancery court properly dismissed for failure to state a claim a prisoner’s complaint alleging that a judge violated the Mississippi Public Records Act because the claim was barred by the doctrine of judicial immunity; the supreme court had held that the judge had jurisdiction to rule upon the prisoner’s filings, and thus, judicial immunity insulated him from the prisoner’s civil action.

      <p>
       Chancery court did not err in fining the Director of Investigations because he knowingly denied a publishing company access to public documents. Miss. Dep't of Audit v. Gulf Publ. Co., 236 So.3d 32, 2017 Miss. LEXIS 437 (Miss. 2017).
      </p>
      <p>
       Fines were void because the chancery court violated individuals’ due process rights by failing to provide individuals with notice of the alleged Mississippi Public Records Act of 1983 violations and charges to be adjudicated against them; none of the individuals were named in either lawsuit in their individual capacity or given notice that they could potentially be fined. Miss. Dep't of Audit v. Gulf Publ. Co., 235 So.3d 1452, 2016 Miss. App. LEXIS 170 (Miss. Ct. App. 2016), rev'd, in part, vacated, 236 So.3d 32, 2017 Miss. LEXIS 437 (Miss. 2017).

      <p>
       <p>
   Appellate court found no error in the chancellor’s finding of no willful violation of the Public Records Act, Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t25c61s25-61-5" target="_self">25-61-5</a></cite> and Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t25c61s25-61-15" target="_self">25-61-15</a></cite> regarding the acts of the planning commission because the element of “willfulness” only pertained to assessment of possible civil penalties, not the actual violation. No exception to a Public Records Act violation could occur, since there was no “willfulness” element regarding the violation itself. LaCroix v. Marshall County Bd. of Supervisors, 28 So.3d 650, 2009 Miss. App. LEXIS 537 (Miss. Ct. App. 2009), cert. denied, 27 So.3d 404, 2010 Miss. LEXIS 90 (Miss. 2010).
      </p>
      <p>
       The chancellor properly assessed a $100.00 civil penalty and the petitioner’s expenses against the respondent department based on a finding that the department willfully and knowingly denied the petitioner’s public records request, notwithstanding the assertion by the department that it was legitimately concerned about the implications of the request on the privacy rights of the department’s employees and that it should not be penalized because there was no authority addressing the issue presented by the request; there was a great deal of authority from other jurisdictions which should have guided the department to the same conclusion reached by the chancery court, and the department acted against the opinions of the Mississippi Attorney General. Mississippi Dep't of Wildlife, Fisheries & Parks v. Mississippi Wildlife Enforcement Officers' Ass'n, 740 So. 2d 925, 1999 Miss. LEXIS 255 (Miss. 1999).
