     <p>
      A certificate of free sale is sometimes required for agricultural products from Mississippi to enter importing states and foreign countries. Persons exporting products from Mississippi are often asked by importing states and foreign countries to supply a certificate for products registered with or regulated by the Mississippi Department of Agriculture and Commerce. The purpose of Sections 69-1-371 through 69-1-375 is to authorize the Mississippi Department of Agriculture and Commerce to issue a certificate of free sale for agricultural products and those products registered with or regulated by the department for the purpose of exporting these products from Mississippi.

     <p>
      The Legislature hereby finds and declares that there exists within the state a serious emergency as a result of the nation’s agricultural crisis and that there is a need to ensure that services are available for farmers, farm laborers, farm families and small businesses who have been adversely affected by the declining agricultural economy. Existing state programs need to be dedicated to meet these needs to the extent possible without creating additional administration. It is important that existing programs and services be coordinated into a network so that those in the agricultural and small business community can learn of these programs and services and obtain their benefits as expeditiously as possible.

       Any lender which has made a loan to a farmer to finance the nonland capital costs of establishing production of an emerging crop on land in Mississippi may make application to the department for payment of the interest on the loan during the period from beginning of production to harvest or initial sale of the product, which payment shall be made from the fund. The maximum amount of interest loans from the fund for the benefit of any one (1) farmer shall be Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000.00). During the period that the department pays the interest on a loan, the maximum rate of interest which may be charged on the loan by the lender shall be four percent (4%) per annum above the New York prime rate. By payment of the interest on a loan, neither the department nor the State of Mississippi shall be a guarantor of the loan, but the state shall have a lien junior to any lien that the lender may have on the loan.

       Laws, 1990, ch. 570, § 20, effective July 1, 1990, provides as follows:
      </p>
      <p>
       “SECTION 20. (1) Any attorney’s fees paid as the result of the issuance of bonds under this act shall be in compliance with the limits on attorney’s fees for bond issues as adopted by the State Bond Commission. Attorney’s fees paid as the result of the issuance of bonds under this act shall be subject to negotiation but in no event shall exceed the limits established by the State Bond Commission. A detailed accounting of all expenses incurred by all persons, firms, corporations, associations or other organizations involved in such bond issues shall be submitted to the State Bond Commission within ninety (90) days after the issuance of such bonds and shall be a matter of public record.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(2) No member of the Legislature, elected official or appointed official, or any partner or associate of any member of the Legislature, elected official or appointed official, shall derive any income from the issuance of any bonds or the disposition of any property under this act contrary to the provisions of Section 109, Mississippi Constitution of 1890, or Article 3, Chapter 4, Title 25, Mississippi Code of 1972.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(3) In connection with the issuance and sale of bonds authorized under this act, the State Bond Commission shall select a bond attorney or attorneys who are listed in the ”Directory of Municipal Bond Dealers of the United States“ and who are members in good standing of the Mississippi State Bar Association and licensed to practice law in the State of Mississippi; however, upon a finding by the commission spread on its official minutes that the public interest will best be served thereby, the commission may select any bond attorney or attorneys listed in the ’Directory of Municipal Bond Dealers of the United States.’ ”
      </p>
      <p>
       Laws, 2004, 3rd Ex Sess, ch. 1, § 228 provides:
      </p>
      <p>
       “SECTION 228. Except as otherwise provided in this act, any entity using funds authorized and made available under Chapter 1, 2004 Third Extraordinary Session, is authorized, in its discretion, to set aside not more than twenty percent (20%) of such funds for expenditure with small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals. The term “socially and economically disadvantaged individuals” shall have the meaning ascribed to such term under Section 8(d) of the Small Business Act (15 USCS, Section 637(d)) and relevant subcontracting regulations promulgated pursuant thereto; except that women shall be presumed to be socially and economically disadvantaged individuals for the purposes of this section.”

    Full faith, credit, and taxing power of state pledged to payment of bonds.

     </h3>
     <p>
      For the payment of such bonds and the interest thereon, the full faith, credit, and taxing power of the State of Mississippi are hereby irrevocably pledged. If the Legislature finds that there are sufficient funds available in the General Fund of the State Treasury to pay maturing principal and accruing interest of the bonds, and if the Legislature appropriates such available funds for the purpose of paying such maturing principal and accruing interest, then the maturing principal and accruing interest of the bonds shall be paid from appropriations made by the Legislature from the General Fund of the State Treasury. However, if there are not sufficient funds available in the General Fund of the State Treasury to pay the maturing principal and accruing interest of the bonds, or if such funds are available but the Legislature fails to appropriate a sufficient amount thereof to pay such maturing principal and accruing interest as the same becomes due, then there shall be levied annually upon all taxable property in the State of Mississippi an ad valorem tax at the rate sufficient to provide the funds required to pay the bonds at maturity and the interest on the bonds as it accrues.

    Execution, delivery, conversion, redemption, and sale of general obligation bonds.

     <p>
      Such bonds may be executed and delivered by the state at any time and from time to time, may be in such form and denominations and of such terms and maturities, may be in fully registered form or in bearer form registrable either as to principal or interest, or both, may bear such conversion privileges and be payable in such installments and at such time or times not exceeding twenty (20) years from the date thereof, may be payable at such place or places, whether within or without the State of Mississippi, may bear interest payable at such time or times and at such place or places and evidenced in such manner, and may contain such provisions not inconsistent herewith, all as shall be provided in the proceedings of the State Bond Commission under which the bonds are authorized to be issued. Such bonds shall not bear a greater overall maximum interest rate to maturity than that authorized by law for general obligation bonds. If deemed advisable by the State Bond Commission, there may be retained in the proceedings under which any such bonds are authorized to be issued an option to redeem all or any part thereof as may be specified in such proceedings, at such price or prices and after such notice or notices and on such terms and conditions as may be set forth in such proceedings and briefly recited or referred to on the face of the bonds, but nothing herein contained shall be construed to confer on the state any right or option to redeem any bonds, except as may be provided in the proceedings under which they shall be issued. Any such bonds shall be sold on sealed bids at public sale, and for such price as the State Bond Commission determines to be in the best interest of the State of Mississippi, but no such sale shall be made at a price less than par value plus accrued interest to date of delivery of the bonds to the purchaser. The state may pay all expenses, premiums and commissions which the State Bond Commission may deem necessary or advantageous in connection with the issuance thereof, but solely from the proceeds of the bonds. The issuance by the state of one or more series of bonds shall not preclude it from issuing other series of bonds, but the proceedings under which any subsequent bonds may be issued shall recognize and protect any prior pledge made for any prior issuance of bonds.

       In lieu of the issuance of bonds pursuant to the authority granted in Section 69-2-19, Mississippi Code of 1972, the State Bond Commission is authorized and empowered, if more economically feasible, to borrow funds in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed the amount specified in Section 69-2-19, Mississippi Code of 1972. The Bond Commission, to evidence such loan, may issue and sell the negotiable coupon notes of the State of Mississippi, which notes may be issued in series, from time to time, as the proceeds thereof are needed. The notes shall be in such form and shall have such details as may be provided by the commission, except that the notes of each series shall be issued with final maturity not more than five (5) years from the date of such series. For the prompt payment of such notes at maturity, both principal and interest, the same pledges may be made as are authorized for the repayment of bonds in Section 69-2-21, Mississippi Code of 1972.

       Every seedsman who sells, offers for sale, exposes for sale, distributes or solicits orders for the sale of any agricultural seed or mixtures thereof, vegetable seed, flower seed, or tree and shrub seed as defined in Section 69-3-1 to farmers, retail seed dealers, wholesale distributors, or to others who use or plant such seed in the State of Mississippi, shall, before selling or offering such seed for sale or distributing or soliciting orders for the sale of such seed and on or before the first day of July of each year, secure an annual permit from the commissioner to engage in such business. Seed dealers and other sellers of seed shall apply for an annual permit upon forms prescribed by the commissioner and such a permit shall be issued upon the payment of the following permit fees when the application is in proper form:
       <ol type="a">
        <li id="t69c03s69-3-3ol11a">
         Each seedsman selling packet seed, in closed containers of less than four (4) ounces, through commission merchants or agents, shall furnish each agent with permit at fee of Two Dollars and Fifty Cents ($2.50) per agent. A separate permit shall be required for each location or place of business with rack display.
        </li>

         For each seedsman engaged in selling vegetable seed at retail from containers of four (4) ounces or more, not displayed on a rack, a permit fee of Five Dollars ($5.00) for each such place of business. This permit will qualify the seedsman to only sell vegetable seeds, as identified by the Federal Seed Act, directly to the consumer.
        </li>
        <li id="t69c03s69-3-3ol11c">
         For each seedsman engaged in selling seed at retail to the consumer, except vegetable seed dealers as defined above and packet seed agents, a permit fee of Twenty-five Dollars ($25.00) for each such place of business. This permit will qualify the seedsman to only sell seed to the consumer for sowing but not for resale.
        </li>
        <li id="t69c03s69-3-3ol11d">
         For each seedsman engaged in selling seed to wholesale distributors only, a permit fee of Five Dollars ($5.00) for each such place of business of the seller. This permit will qualify the seedsman to sell only to “wholesale distributors.”
        </li>
        <li id="t69c03s69-3-3ol11e">
         For each seedsman engaged in selling seed as a wholesale distributor, a permit fee of One Hundred Dollars ($100.00) for each such place of business. This permit qualifies a seedsman to sell at levels for permits required by paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e) of this section.

      </li>

       Out-of-state seedsmen who sell or ship seed into this state shall obtain a permit in the same manner as described in paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e) of this section.

      <li id="t69c03s69-3-3ol11e3">
       For the purpose of enforcement of the permit provisions of this section, the type of permit held by the buyer shall determine the type of permit required of the seller.

      <li id="t69c03s69-3-3ol11e4">
       Permits shall be renewed annually, beginning July 1, and may be revoked for cause by the commissioner. Failure to renew such permit by September 1 of each year will incur a penalty of twenty-five percent (25%) to the cost of the permit. The initial registration will be at the prescribed fee. However, the fee for first time permit applicants received on or after April 1 will be prorated by the commissioner for all classifications except packet agent permits.
      </li>
      <li id="t69c03s69-3-3ol11e5">

     <ol>
      <li id="t69c03s69-3-20ol11">
       The commissioner shall appoint an arbitration council composed of six (6) members to hear and decide each complaint. The Director of the Mississippi Agricultural and Forestry Experiment Station, the Director of the Mississippi Cooperative Extension Service, the President of the Mississippi Seedsmen’s Association, the President of the Mississippi Farm Bureau Federation, and the Alcorn State University Divisional Director of Agriculture and Applied Sciences shall supply to the commissioner a list of four (4) candidates from their respective organizations. The commissioner shall choose one (1) candidate from each organization’s list in selecting a council to hear each complaint. On or before January 1 of each year the respective recommending organizations shall submit member recommendations if they want to make changes from their previous recommendations. The commissioner, or his designee, shall be a member of and serve as chairman of the council and he may appoint a secretary for the council. It shall be the duty of the chairman to call the council into session to conduct all meetings and deliberations and to direct all other activities of the council. It shall be the duty of the secretary to keep accurate and correct records of all meetings and deliberations and perform such other duties for the council as directed by the chairman. The commissioner shall prescribe and adopt reasonable rules and regulations governing the arbitration process to include conditions and circumstances associated with seed to which arbitration is applicable.
      </li>
      <li id="t69c03s69-3-20ol12">
       The purpose of the arbitration council is to assist consumers and seedsmen in determining the validity of complaints made by consumers against seedsmen and recommend cost damages resulting from failure of the seed to properly perform or produce, whether related to specific representations on the label or the labeling, other information on the seed container or conditions attributed to the quality of the seed.

         When the department refers a complaint made by a consumer against a seedsman to the arbitration council, the council shall make a full and complete investigation of the matters complained of, and at the conclusion of the investigation, report its findings and make its recommendations of cost damages and file them with the department. Council findings and recommendations may be admissible as evidence in a court of law. When a complaint involving transgenic seeds is filed for arbitration, the seedsman shall furnish the commissioner the technology and procedures necessary to conduct any test to determine whether the seeds will perform as represented by the seedsman. The commissioner shall ensure that all technology and procedural information submitted to the department by the seedsman shall be kept confidential to ensure the proprietary rights of the seedsman. After a final disposition of all judicial proceedings or expiration of any applicable statute of limitation, the commissioner shall return all technology, records, test data or procedural information to the seedsman. In addition, remedies for misappropriation of a trade secret shall be governed by the Mississippi Uniform Trade Secrets Act in Sections 75-26-1 through 75-26-19.

        <li id="t69c03s69-3-20ol13b">
         In conducting its investigation the arbitration council or any member or members shall be authorized to examine the consumer on his farming operation of which he complains; to examine the seedsman on his packaging, labeling and selling operation of the seed alleged to be faulty; to conduct an appropriate test of a representative sample of the alleged faulty seed through the facilities of the state and under the supervision of the department when such action is deemed to be necessary; and to hold informal hearings at a time and place designated by the chairman upon reasonable notice to the consumer and the seedsman.

The commissioner shall appoint the arbitrator from a list of six (6) persons who shall be qualified to conduct arbitration proceedings. The commissioner shall publish the lists of qualified arbitrations every other year.

    Requests for improvement of State Fair grounds.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The Mississippi Fair Commission is hereby authorized and empowered, in its discretion, to declare by resolution the number and type buildings which need to be constructed and the type improvements that need to be made on the state fairgrounds, and file a certified copy of said resolution with the State Building Commission. If the State Building Commission believes such construction and improvements to be in the best public interest, and that receipts from admission to the State Fair reasonably shall be expected to produce sufficient revenues over a period not to exceed twenty (20) years to retire bonds issued to pay the cost of such improvements as well as the interest thereon, it may, in its discretion, approve the request of the Mississippi Fair Commission.

       The words “revenue bonds” shall be deemed to mean bonds payable solely from the net revenue received by the Mississippi Fair Commission.

        The Department of Finance and Administration shall have power and is hereby authorized, at one time or from time to time by resolution, to authorize the issuance of negotiable revenue bonds to provide funds for the purpose of paying all or any part of the cost of construction and/or improvements requested by the Mississippi Fair Commission pursuant to Section 69-5-13, or the cost of any purchase of property or improvements thereon pursuant to Section 17-17-49, but in no event shall the amount of such bonds outstanding at any one time exceed Four Million Dollars ($4,000,000.00); and shall cause a certified copy of such resolution to be delivered to the State Bond Commission. No bonds shall be issued under this section after April 23, 2008. Upon the receipt of said authorizing resolution, the State Bond Commission, acting as the issuing agent, shall issue and sell the revenue bonds of the State of Mississippi when authorized at the time and in the amount indicated in said resolution, prescribe the form of the bonds, advertise for and accept bids therefor, issue and sell the bonds, and do any and all other things necessary and advisable in the issuance and sale of said bonds. The principal of and the interest on such revenue bonds shall be payable solely from a special fund to be provided for that purpose from the net revenue received by the Mississippi Fair Commission. Such bonds shall bear date or dates, be in such denomination or denominations, bear interest at such rate or rates, provided that the bonds of any issue shall not bear a greater overall maximum interest rate to maturity than that allowed in Section 75-17-103, be payable at such place or places within or without the State of Mississippi, shall mature at such time or times, be redeemable prior to maturity at such time or times and upon such terms, with or without premium, shall bear such registration privileges, and shall be substantially in such form, all as shall be determined by the State Bond Commission. Such bonds shall mature in annual installments beginning not more than three (3) years from date thereof and extending not more than twenty (20) years from date thereof. Such bonds shall be signed by the Chairman of the State Bond Commission, or by his facsimile signature, and the official seal of the State Bond Commission shall be affixed thereto, and attested by the Secretary of the State Bond Commission. The interest coupons, if any, to be attached to such bonds or other certificates thereon may be executed by the facsimile signatures of said officers. Whenever any such bonds shall have been signed by the officials herein designated to sign the bonds who were in office at the time of such signing but who may have ceased to be such officers prior to the sale and delivery of such bonds, or who may not have been in office on the date such bonds may bear, the signatures of such officers upon such bonds and coupons shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes and have the same effect as if the person so officially signing such bonds had remained in office until the delivery of the same to the purchaser or had been in office on the date such bonds may bear.

      The proceeds of bonds sold pursuant to Section 69-5-17 shall be paid into the state treasury to the credit of a special fund known as the State Fair Fund, and shall be used solely for payment of the cost of the project or combined projects, and shall be disbursed upon order of the State Building Commission under such restrictions, if any, as the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds may provide. Provided, however, that any surplus in the State Fair Fund over and above the requirements to meet the payments on outstanding bonds and interest thereon when due may, in the discretion of the State Bond Commission, be invested in United States Government bills, notes or bonds, Mississippi General Obligation Bonds, Mississippi Revenue Bonds, Mississippi State Highway Bonds, or in bonds of any municipality or any county in Mississippi; and, upon the sale thereof, the entire proceeds of the sale, including all earnings from the investment, shall be paid into the State Fair Fund. If the proceeds of bonds sold pursuant to Section 69-5-17, by error of calculation or otherwise, shall be less than the cost of the project or combined projects, unless otherwise provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds, additional revenue bonds may in like manner be issued to provide the amount of such deficit which, unless otherwise provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds, shall be deemed to be one of the same issue and shall be entitled to payment from the same fund without preference or priority of the bonds first issued for the same purpose; provided, that in no event shall the outstanding bonds total more than Seven Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($750,000.00). If the proceeds of the bonds of any issue shall exceed the amount required for the purpose for which the bonds were issued, the surplus shall be paid into the fund established for the payment of the principal of and the interest on such bonds.

     <p>
      There is hereby imposed and levied an assessment at a rate not to exceed Three Cents (3¢) per case on all eggs produced in Mississippi wherever distributed or marketed and on all eggs marketed in Mississippi wherever distributed or produced. The rate of assessment shall be determined by the board. At the time of the sale, the egg producer shall provide evidence that all assessments provided herein have been paid. However, if the first sale of the eggs is made to a dealer or distributor, the producer shall pay to the dealer or the distributor the amount of the assessment owed; whereupon the dealer or distributor to whom such payment is made shall remit the assessment to the Commissioner of Agriculture and Commerce in accordance with the rules and regulations established and promulgated by the board. The board or the commissioner shall have the power to cause any duly authorized agent or representative to enter upon the premises of any dealer or handler of eggs and examine, or cause to be examined by such agent, any books, papers and records which deal in any way with respect to the payment of the assessment or enforcement of the provisions of this article.
     </p>
     <p>
      All costs incurred by the board or the commissioner in examining or causing the examination of such books, papers and records shall be taxed against the dealer or handler. Cost shall be assessed at the rate of One Hundred Dollars ($100.00) per day or fraction thereof for each agent conducting the examination. Travel expenses shall be assessed in the manner and amount specified in Section 25-3-41, and other expenses shall be assessed at actual cost. All costs taxed against a dealer or handler for the examination of books, papers and records shall be paid within fifteen (15) days from the date such notice of cost is mailed to the dealer or handler.
     </p>
     <p>
      The proceeds of the assessment levied under this article shall be collected by the Commissioner of Agriculture and Commerce in such manner and method as shall be prescribed by him in accordance with the provisions of this article. The funds derived from the assessment shall be paid into the State Treasury on or before the fifteenth day of each month and shall be deposited in a special fund in the State Treasury, which shall be established by the State Treasurer to the credit of the Mississippi Egg Marketing Board, and such funds shall be used by the board solely for the administration of this article. All costs, expenses and obligations incurred by the board for its operation and carrying out the purposes of this article shall be paid out of the special fund herein provided for after expenditures thereof shall have been authorized by the Legislature. Provided further, that the Mississippi Egg Marketing Board shall render to the Mississippi Legislature a detailed annual report of all collections and expenditures of the moneys collected under the provisions of this article. Any egg producer may request and receive a refund of the amount of assessment paid for the previous reporting period, provided he makes a written application with the Mississippi Egg Marketing Board within sixty (60) days from date of payment supported by bona fide copy of payment voucher and copy of canceled check. The application forms shall be prepared by the board and shall be available at the request of the producer. All such applications shall be processed and refunds paid within sixty (60) days after the funds have been received by the board.

     <p>
      Every person owning over three thousand (3,000) hens, or who is engaged or who engages in the business of selling eggs to a retailer who retails eggs in the State of Mississippi shall prior to offering for sale or selling eggs to a retailer, secure a license for such business from the Commissioner of Agriculture and Commerce, which license shall first be approved by the board. Applications for licenses shall be on forms furnished by the Department of Agriculture and Commerce, and shall show the name and address of the applicant and such other information as to identity, kind and type of business engaged in as the commissioner shall deem pertinent. Each license application shall be accompanied by a fee of Fifty Dollars ($50.00). All licenses issued shall expire on June 30 each year. The license may be revoked or suspended by the board for violation of any provision of this article or rules and regulations duly promulgated by the board for the enforcement of this article, or for the violation of any laws of the State of Mississippi pertaining to producing, grading, classifying or marketing eggs in Mississippi or regulations of the State Department of Agriculture and Commerce duly promulgated for such purposes. For the first offense, the license may be suspended for a period of not more than thirty (30) days; for the second offense, the license may be suspended for not more than sixty (60) days; for the third offense, the license may be suspended for not more than one (1) year. For any subsequent offense, the license may be suspended for any period, or may be revoked. Such disciplinary action shall be the result of not less than board action. Any person against whom such disciplinary action has been taken may apply to the board for a hearing in order to show cause why the disciplinary action shall not be taken. Such petition for a hearing shall act as supersedeas of the disciplinary action until such time as the board shall give the applicant an opportunity for a hearing; provided, however, that if such hearing is granted and any continuation or delay is the result of the action of the applicant, the supersedeas shall not continue past the date set by the board for such hearing.
     </p>
     <p>
      Application for reinstatement of a revoked license may be made upon expiration of the period of revocation or if permanently revoked, then after twelve (12) months from date of said revocation. Each reinstatement application shall be accompanied by a reinstatement fee of Fifty Dollars ($50.00). All licenses shall be valid until suspended or revoked as herein provided or until cancelled by the licensee. Licenses shall not be transferable. Proceeds from the license fees collected under this article shall be transmitted to the State Treasurer for credit to the special fund as provided for elsewhere in this article.

     <p>
      Whenever either the committee created by Section 69-7-401 or the committee created by Section 69-7-403 deems it advisable to regulate the marketing of fresh vegetables in any manner considered by them to be helpful to the industry during any specified period, it may so recommend in writing to the commissioner of agriculture and commerce.

     </p>
     <p>
      Based upon the recommendation of the committee created for the districts under consideration and upon the information submitted in connection therewith, and upon other available data, the commissioner of agriculture and commerce may regulate the marketing of fresh vegetables produced in the area defined by this article, for any specified period, by regulating the handling of any vegetable produced in the districts defined in Section 69-7-401 or Section 69-7-403 in one or more of the following manners:
     </p>
     <p>
      By prohibiting unfair methods of competition and unfair trade practices in the purchase or sale thereof.
     </p>
     <p>
      By limiting the grade, size, and maturity of any vegetable which each handler may purchase from or handle on behalf of any and all producers thereof during any specified period or periods.
     </p>
     <p>
      Providing that any vegetable or any grade, size or quality thereof shall be purchased or sold or offered for sale by the handlers thereof only at prices filed by such handlers in the manner provided in such regulation.
     </p>
     <p>
      Providing for the regulating of the handling of any vegetable in the same manner and for the same period in effect under any federal marketing agreement.
     </p>
     <p>
      Specifying standard containers which may be used in the purchase or sale of any vegetables.
     </p>
     <p>
      Requiring that all containers used in the sale of any vegetable shall be plainly marked with the grade and size of the contents therein.
     </p>
     <p>
      With respect to the districts defined in Section 69-7-401, in order to provide proper maturity requiring that no vegetable may be sold prior to a date fixed in the regulation without permission from the commissioner of agriculture and commerce.

     <p>
      The Legislature finds that aquaculture sales and consumption have increased worldwide and that the use of antibiotics or chemicals not approved for use in food-producing animals in the United States is permitted in aquaculture in other countries and that consumers of aquaculture in Mississippi should be provided clear information as to where the aquaculture product originates from to protect the health and welfare of Mississippi consumers; and the Legislature also finds that food-misrepresentation or the passing off of less expensive aquaculture products as pricier aquaculture products to unknowing customers and retailers has become an issue in the marketplace and is a deceitful practice used on consumers and retailers alike and that consumers and retailers should be informed of the country and species of fish.

       When a complaint is made against a person for violation of any of the provisions of this article, or any of the rules or regulations promulgated hereunder, the Director of the Regulatory Division of the Mississippi Department of Agriculture and Commerce, or his designee, shall act as reviewing officer. The complaint shall be filed with the Mississippi Department of Agriculture and Commerce. The reviewing officer shall cause to be delivered to the accused, in the manner described herein, a copy of the complaint and any supporting documents along with a summons requiring the accused to respond to the allegations within thirty (30) days after service of the summons and complaint upon the accused. The accused shall file with the department a written response to the complaint and any supporting documents within the thirty-day period. The accused may be notified by serving a copy of the summons and complaint on the accused or any of his officers, agents or employees by personal service or by certified mail. Upon the expiration of the thirty-day period, the reviewing officer shall review the complaint, the written response of the accused, if any, and all supporting documents offered by the parties in support of their respective positions. The reviewing officer’s decision shall be based solely on the documents provided by the parties. If the reviewing officer determines that the complaint lacks merit, he may dismiss the complaint. If he finds that there are reasonable grounds showing that a violation of the statutes or regulations has been committed, he may impose any or all of the following penalties upon the accused: (a) levy a civil penalty in the amount of no more than One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00) for each violation; (b) issue a stop-sale order; (c) require the accused to relabel any fish that he is offering for sale and which is not labeled in accordance with the provisions of this article; or (d) seize any fish that is not in compliance with this article, and destroy, sell or otherwise dispose of the fish, and apply the proceeds of any such sale to the costs herein and any civil penalties levied, with the balance to be paid to the accused. The reviewing officer’s decision shall be in writing, and it shall be delivered to the accused by any of the methods described herein for service of the summons and complaint on the accused.
      </li>
      <li id="t69c07s69-7-616ol12">
       Either the accused or the department may appeal the decision of the reviewing officer to the Commissioner of Agriculture and Commerce by filing a notice of appeal with the department within thirty (30) days of receipt of the reviewing officer’s decision. If no appeal is taken from the order of the reviewing officer within the allotted time, the order shall then become final. In the event of an appeal, the commissioner, or his designee, shall conduct a full evidentiary hearing relative to the charges. The commissioner may issue subpoenas to require the attendance of witnesses and the production of documents. Compliance with such subpoenas may be enforced by any court of general jurisdiction in this state. The testimony of witnesses shall be upon oath or affirmation, and they shall be subject to cross-examination. The proceedings shall be recorded by a court reporter. The commissioner shall have all the powers of the reviewing officer described herein, and the commissioner may affirm, reverse or modify the order of the reviewing officer. The commissioner’s decision shall be in writing, and it shall be delivered to the parties in the same manner that the summons and complaint may be served upon the accused.
      </li>
      <li id="t69c07s69-7-616ol13">
       Either the accused or the department may appeal the decision of the commissioner to the circuit court of the county of residence of the accused, or if the accused is a nonresident of the State of Mississippi, to the Circuit Court of the First Judicial District of Hinds County, Mississippi. The appellant has the obligation of having the record transcribed and filed with the circuit court. The appeal shall otherwise be governed by all applicable laws and rules affecting appeals to the circuit court. If no appeal is perfected within the required time, the decision of the commissioner, or his designee, shall then become final.
      </li>
      <li id="t69c07s69-7-616ol14">
       The decision of the circuit court may then be appealed by either party to the Mississippi Supreme Court in accordance with the existing laws and rules affecting such appeals.
      </li>
      <li id="t69c07s69-7-616ol15">
       Where any violation of this article, or the rules and regulations promulgated hereunder, occurs, or is about to occur, that presents a clear and present danger to the public health, safety or welfare requiring immediate action, any of the department’s field inspectors and any other persons authorized by the commissioner, may issue an order to be effective immediately, before notice and a hearing, that imposes any or all of the penalties described herein against the accused. The order shall be served upon the accused in the same manner that the summons and complaint may be served upon him. The accused shall then have thirty (30) days after service of the order upon him within which to request an informal administrative review before the reviewing officer, or his designee, as described herein. The accused shall include within his request all documents that support his position. The department may also submit any documents that support its position. If the accused makes such a request within such time, the reviewing officer, or his designee, shall review the documents provided by the parties and render a written decision within thirty (30) days after such request is made. Upon the making of such a request, the procedure described herein shall be followed, except that there is no need for a complaint to be filed against the accused. If the accused does not request an administrative review within such time frame, then he shall have waived his right to an administrative review.

      The Legislature finds that a burden on and an obstruction to intrastate commerce in the catfish farming industry is caused when payment is not made for the catfish and that such arrangements are contrary to the public interest. This article is intended to remedy such burden on and obstruction to intrastate commerce in catfish and to protect the public interest.

      On and after July 1, 1986, every catfish processor shall register with the Commissioner of Agriculture and Commerce. The commissioner shall promulgate such rules and regulations as he may deem necessary to secure the performance of catfish purchasing obligations, and whenever, after due notice and hearing, the commissioner finds any registrant is insolvent or has violated any provisions of this article he may issue an order suspending such registrant for a reasonable specified period. Such order of suspension shall take effect within not less than five (5) days, unless suspended or modified or set aside by the commissioner or a court of competent jurisdiction. If the commissioner finds any processor is insolvent, he may after notice and hearing issue an order requiring such processor to cease and desist from purchasing catfish while insolvent except under such conditions as the commissioner may prescribe to effectuate the purposes of this article. Provided, however, that (a) those processors whose average annual purchases do not exceed Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000.00), and (b) those processors who deliver to the producer or his duly authorized representative the full amount of the purchase price on the same day the catfish product is purchased and possession thereof is transferred, shall be exempt from the provisions of this section.

       There is imposed and levied an assessment at the rate of One Cent (1¢) per bushel on all soybeans grown within the State of Mississippi, and such assessment shall be deducted by the purchaser from the amount paid the producer at the first point of sale, whether within or without the state. Assessments on soybeans put under loan to the Commodity Credit Corporation or purchased by the Commodity Credit Corporation and delivered to it shall be payable when such soybeans are placed under loan or are purchased. The Commodity Credit Corporation may require deduction and payment of the assessment from the loan proceeds or from the purchase price on the behalf of the producer. Assessments on soybeans put under loan to the Commodity Credit Corporation and redeemed by the producer before the takeover date, if already paid by having been deducted from the loan proceeds, shall not be deducted by each handler from the amount paid the producer at the first point of sale as provided in this section; otherwise, the assessment shall be deducted. Any soybean producer may request and receive a refund of the amount of assessment deducted from the sale of his soybeans provided he makes a written application with the Department of Agriculture and Commerce within sixty (60) days from date of sale, supported by bona fide copies of sales slips signed by the purchaser. The application forms shall be prepared by the Department of Agriculture and Commerce and shall be available at the first point of sale. All such applications shall be processed and refunds paid by the Department of Agriculture and Commerce within sixty (60) days after the funds have been received by the department. Each marketing agency shall be furnished a poster to be displayed in a prominent place, stating that refunds are available and forms to be used, including self-addressed envelopes, are available at its office.

       The assessment imposed and levied by this section shall be payable to and collected by the Department of Agriculture and Commerce, hereafter referred to as “the department,” from the purchaser of such soybeans at the first point of sale or from the Commodity Credit Corporation as provided in subsection (1) of this section. The proceeds of the assessment collected by the department shall be deposited with the State Treasurer in a special fund, known as the “Mississippi Soybean Promotion Fund,” and promptly remitted to the Mississippi State University Foundation under the terms and conditions as the Soybean Promotion Board deems necessary to ensure that the assessments are used properly in carrying out the purposes of this chapter. The State Fiscal Officer is authorized to issue warrants for the payment of monies from the Mississippi Soybean Promotion Fund upon requisition by the Commissioner of Agriculture and Commerce, or his designee, for refunds to producers as provided under subsection (1) of this section.

       Each purchaser or the Commodity Credit Corporation shall keep a complete and accurate record of all soybeans handled by him and shall furnish each producer with a signed sales slip showing the number of bushels purchased from him and the amount deducted by him for the Mississippi Soybean Promotion Fund. Such records shall be in such form and contain such other information as the department shall by rule or regulation prescribe. The records shall be preserved by the purchaser for a period of two (2) years and shall be offered for inspection at any time upon oral or written demand by the department or any duly authorized agent or representative thereof. Every purchaser or the Commodity Credit Corporation, at such time or times as the department may require, shall submit reports or other documentary information deemed necessary for the efficient and equitable collection of the assessment imposed in this chapter. The department shall have the power to cause any duly authorized agent or representative to enter upon the premises of any purchaser of soybeans and examine or cause to be examined by such agent only books, papers and records which deal in any way with the payment of the assessment or enforcement of the provisions of this chapter.

       There is imposed and levied an assessment at the rate of Two Cents (2¢) per bushel on all rice grown within the State of Mississippi; from and after July 1, 1991, the rate of assessment shall be increased by an additional One Cent (1¢) per bushel so that the total assessment equals Three Cents (3¢) per bushel. Such assessment shall be deducted by the purchaser from the amount paid the producer at the first point of sale, whether within or without the state. Assessments on rice put under loan to the Commodity Credit Corporation or purchased by the Commodity Credit Corporation and delivered to it shall be payable when such rice is placed under loan or is purchased. The Commodity Credit Corporation may require deduction and payment of the assessment from the loan proceeds or from the purchase price on the behalf of the producer. Assessments on rice put under loan to the Commodity Credit Corporation and redeemed by the producer before the takeover date, if already paid by having been deducted from the loan proceeds shall not be deducted by each miller or handler from the amount paid the producer at the first point of sale as provided in this section; otherwise, the assessment shall be deducted.

      <li id="t69c10s69-10-5ol12">
       The assessment imposed and levied by this section shall be payable to and collected by the Mississippi Department of Agriculture and Commerce, hereafter referred to as “the department,” from the purchaser of such rice at the first point of sale or from the Commodity Credit Corporation as provided in subsection (1) of this section. The proceeds of the assessment collected by the department shall be deposited with the State Treasurer in a special fund, the “Mississippi Rice Promotion Fund,” and promptly remitted to a foundation under such terms and conditions as the Rice Promotion Board deems necessary to ensure that such assessments are used properly in carrying out the purposes of this chapter.

The amount withheld by the department must be approved by the Mississippi Rice Promotion Board by July 1 of each year. The payments to the Mississippi Rice Promotion Board shall be accompanied by a complete report of all funds collected and disbursed.

       Each purchaser or the Commodity Credit Corporation shall keep a complete and accurate record of all rice handled by him and shall furnish each producer with a signed sales slip showing the number of bushels purchased from him and the amount deducted by him for the Mississippi Rice Promotion Fund. Such records shall be in such form and contain such other information as the department shall by rule or regulation prescribe. The records shall be preserved by the purchaser for a period of two (2) years and shall be offered for inspection at any time upon oral or written demand by the department or any duly authorized agent or representative thereof. Every purchaser or the Commodity Credit Corporation, at such time or times as the commissioner of the department may require, shall submit reports or other documentary information deemed necessary for the efficient and equitable collection of the assessment imposed in this chapter. The department shall have the power to cause any duly authorized agent or representative to enter upon the premises of any purchaser of rice and examine or cause to be examined by such agent, only books, papers and records which deal in any way with respect to the payment of the assessment or enforcement of the provisions of this chapter.

     <p>
      The purpose of this chapter is to eradicate and prevent the spread of contagious and infectious diseases of swine in the State of Mississippi through preventative methods based upon recommendations of leading veterinary medical authorities and animal disease research scientists to the effect that raw garbage keeps causative virus alive and the feeding of such garbage causes the spread of several contagious, infectious and deadly diseases of swine. Chief among these is hog cholera which is known to be spread among swine through the feeding of raw garbage. Trichinella infection in human population, foot and mouth disease, swine erysipelas, African swine fever, tuberculosis, brucellosis and other human and animal diseases have been associated with the feeding of garbage to swine. Since the production of swine is of great economic importance not only to the farmers of Mississippi but to the general economy of the state, it is deemed for the best interest and advancement of the agricultural economy and the general welfare of the State of Mississippi to prohibit the commercial feeding of garbage to swine from and after July 1, 1972.

    General stock law.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      There is declared, created and now in existence a statewide stock law which embraces all of the territory of the State of Mississippi and which is declared to be uniform throughout the state, except as hereinafter provided. Any person or persons owning or having under control any livestock such as cattle, horses, mules, jacks, jennets, sheep, goats and hogs, shall not permit such livestock to run at large upon the open or unfenced lands of another person, except as herein expressly provided, but shall keep such livestock confined in a safe inclosure or upon lands belonging to such person. However, upon the petition of twenty percent of the qualified electors of any county of this state, outside of the municipalities thereof, the board of supervisors of such county shall call an election to be held within sixty days after the filing of such petition for the purpose of permitting the qualified electors of such county, outside of the municipalities, to vote upon the question whether or not the provisions of the statewide stock law shall remain in force in such county, outside of the municipalities thereof; and if a majority of the qualified electors of such county, outside of the municipalities thereof, voting in said election, shall vote to sustain the statewide stock law, then it shall remain in full force and effect in said county, but should a majority of the qualified electors of said county, outside of said municipalities, voting in said election, vote against the statewide stock law, then sixty days after said election the provisions thereof shall not apply to or be in force in said county, outside of the municipalities thereof, except in its application to hogs or swine, which shall not be permitted in any event to run at large in any county of this state.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the event a county has heretofore elected to come out from under the stock law, no less than five years after such election, upon the petition of twenty percent of the qualified electors of any such county outside the municipalities thereof, the board of supervisors shall call an election to be held within sixty days after the filing of such petition to vote upon the question of whether or not the provisions of the statewide stock law shall apply in that county outside the municipalities. If a majority of the qualified electors of such county, outside of the municipalities thereof, voting in said election, shall favor the statewide stock law, then sixty days after said election the provisions of the statewide stock law shall apply in that county outside the municipalities. If the majority of those voting in the election vote against the statewide stock law, the provisions of the statewide stock law shall continue to be inapplicable to such county outside municipalities. No election on the same question may be held more often than once every two years.

       Where the statewide stock law is in full force, the owner of livestock is required to keep them under a safe enclosure of his own, without regard to whether or not other land owners in the stock law district have a sufficient fence, or any fence at all, around their crops.

       In a stockowner’s replevin action wherein defendant cross claimed for damages for trespass, the plaintiff was liable for such damages as the defendant could prove within a reasonable degree of certainty as resulting to his fences, pasture or oat crop by reason of the running of the plaintiff’s cattle, and the disturbing of the defendant’s cattle in the execution of the writ of replevin.

       Section 69-13-1 of the general stock laws mandates that all livestock owners “keep such livestock confined in a safe inclosure or upon lands belonging to such person.” The presence of a cattle gap does not serve to legally create an “open range” or remove this obligation.

      Every owner of livestock referred to in Section 69-13-1 shall be liable for damages for all injuries and trespasses committed by such animals by breaking and entering into or upon the lands, grounds, or premises of another person; and the person injured shall have a lien upon the animal, or animals, trespassing for all such damage. The damages for such trespass shall not be less than Ten Dollars ($10.00) for each horse, cow or hog, and Five Dollars ($5.00) for each of the other kinds of stock; and for every succeeding offense, after the owner has been notified of the first trespass or injury, double damages shall be recovered with costs. For breaking or entering into a pasture or waste ground, however, double damage shall not be recoverable, and the damages in such cases may be assessed as low as Eight Dollars ($8.00) for each horse, cow or hog and Two Dollars ($2.00) for each of the other kinds of livestock.

       Statute provides a guideline for the trial court to follow when calculating damages, and the damages can be assessed for as little as $8.00, but the statute does not limit the court’s ability to impose heftier sums per trespassing event; it is within the trial court’s discretion to assess damages in order to make the injured party whole. Maslon v. Brown, 148 So.3d 27, 2014 Miss. App. LEXIS 541 (Miss. Ct. App. 2014).
      </p>
      <p>

   The statutory guide to damages set forth in §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t69c13s69-13-19" target="_self">69-13-19</a></cite> for loss of crops as a result of trespass of livestock is not the maximum amount of damages allowed but it is the minimum. Stephens v. Brock, 568 So. 2d 702, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 296 (Miss. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where defendant cross claimed for damages for trespass in a stockowner’s replevin action, the stockowner was liable for such damages as the defendant could prove within a reasonable degree of certainty as resulting to his fences, pasture or oat crop by reason of the running of the plaintiff’s cattle, and the disturbing of the defendant’s cattle in the execution of the writ of replevin. Galloway v. Brown, 230 Miss. 471, 93 So. 2d 459, 1957 Miss. LEXIS 390 (Miss. 1957).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a stock owner’s replevin action wherein defendant counterclaimed for damages caused by trespassing, an instruction which might have misled the jury to believe that they were authorized to assess the plaintiff with the value of his own cattle in addition to, and as a part of, the allowance to defendant of damages, was error, since defendants were only entitled to have their lien established against the cattle for the amount of actual damages sustained by them by reason of the trespassing of the plaintiff’s cattle upon their land, fences and crops, the amount of which should be proved with a reasonable degree of certainty as a proximate result of the fault of the plaintiff. Galloway v. Brown, 230 Miss. 471, 93 So. 2d 459, 1957 Miss. LEXIS 390 (Miss. 1957).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a stock owner’s replevin action wherein landowner counterclaimed for damages caused by the trespassing cattle, the landowner was not entitled to any damage caused after the stock owner offered to remove his cattle and was prevented by the landowner from doing so, or refrained from doing so because of the strenuous objection of the landowner. Galloway v. Brown, 230 Miss. 471, 93 So. 2d 459, 1957 Miss. LEXIS 390 (Miss. 1957).
      </p>
      <p>
       Double damages were not allowable under this section where stockowner’s cattle had entered upon and grazed upon a portion of an oat field which was planted for and used only as a pasture for cattle belonging to landowner and others, and an instruction, authorizing the assessment of such damages if the jury found there had been, to the knowledge of the stockowner, former trespasses, was erroneous. Galloway v. Brown, 230 Miss. 471, 93 So. 2d 459, 1957 Miss. LEXIS 390 (Miss. 1957).
      </p>
      <p>
       The liability of owner of livestock trespassing upon the lands of another in a stock law district for the actual damages caused by the trespassing cattle is absolute. Galloway v. Brown, 230 Miss. 471, 93 So. 2d 459, 1957 Miss. LEXIS 390 (Miss. 1957).
      </p>
      <p>
       In replevin action to recover cattle which defendant had taken up when they strayed onto his land, wherein defendant made a cross-demand for damages to oat crop and land, and for taking up, caring and feeding the cattle, charges for taking up the cattle and their care and feeding are not subject to double damages. Calcote v. May, 207 Miss. 547, 42 So. 2d 742, 1949 Miss. LEXIS 363 (Miss. 1949).
      </p>
      <p>
       Owner of trespassing stock is absolutely liable for damages done by them to the crops of others and questions of due care and negligence in confining stock are eliminated. Minor v. Dockery, 125 Miss. 727, 88 So. 321, 1921 Miss. LEXIS 160 (Miss. 1921).
      </p>
      <p>
       It was reversible error to instruct the jury that before plaintiff can recover, the hogs of defendant must have done all the damage sued for. Merrill v. Dockery, 124 Miss. 41, 86 So. 709, 1920 Miss. LEXIS 493 (Miss. 1920).
      </p>
      <p>
       The common law which requires the owner of stock to keep them from trespassing upon the land of others has no application here; but the whole subject is under the control and power of the legislature and it may, without violating any legal rights, require an owner to so confine his stock as to keep them off the land of others. Anderson v. Locke, 64 Miss. 283, 1 So. 251, 1886 Miss. LEXIS 57 (Miss. 1886).
      </p>
      <p>
       If an act of legislature against stock running at large authorize stock trespassing to be taken up and carried to the nearest justice of the peace, to be sold by him after due notice given, the fact that the justice, in any given case is father-in-law of the party on whose land the cattle have been trespassing does not render him incompetent to perform such act, since it is not judicial in its character. Anderson v. Locke, 64 Miss. 283, 1 So. 251, 1886 Miss. LEXIS 57 (Miss. 1886).
      </p>
      <p>
       If one allow the stock of a stranger to mingle with his own and trespass on another, he is “owner” pro hac vice, and liable for the damages done by all the stock. Montgomery v. Handy, 62 Miss. 16, 1884 Miss. LEXIS 6 (Miss. 1884).
      </p>
      <p>
       The common inclosure remains until one party has entirely segregated his lands from the others by a lawful fence. Montgomery v. Handy, 62 Miss. 16, 1884 Miss. LEXIS 6 (Miss. 1884).
      </p>
      <p>
       To constitute a common inclosure, the fence surrounding it need not be a lawful fence. Montgomery v. Handy, 62 Miss. 16, 1884 Miss. LEXIS 6 (Miss. 1884).

       Neither Code 1942, § 4864, nor this section was enacted for the purpose of protecting motorists upon the public highways from personal injury or property damage caused by collision with domestic animals straying onto the highway, but for the purpose of protecting agricultural crops in stock law areas from the ravages of straying livestock.

       Damage to the owner’s property was temporary in nature and could be corrected through repairs, and the argument that the damages were not established with reasonable certainty was without merit; there was testimony and evidence in the form of police reports that established damages to the owner’s property, and the damages awarded for the cattle trespass were not unreasonable and outrageous.

      The person taking up an animal trespassing, after two days may begin his action to recover damages and charges and to enforce his lien, by filing a bill of particulars of his damages, together with a description of the animal on which the lien is claimed, with a justice of the peace, if his claim does not exceed two hundred dollars; and the justice shall issue a summons for the owner or person entitled to the custody, returnable instanter at such place as he shall designate; and if the animal be not in the custody of the plaintiff, the justice may issue a writ commanding the officer to seize the animal. The summons being executed and returned, the justice shall proceed as in other suits. If the justice finds in favor of the plaintiff, he will assess the damages and charges and enter judgment accordingly, and direct the animal to be sold to satisfy the judgment; and if the animal be not in custody of the plaintiff or officer the order for sale may embrace a command to levy upon it.

       In a stockowner’s replevin action wherein defendant cross-claimed for damages for trespass, the plaintiff was liable for such damages as the defendant could prove within a reasonable degree of certainty as resulting to his fences, pasture or oat crop by reason of the running of the plaintiff’s cattle, and the disturbing of the defendant’s cattle in the execution of the writ of replevin. Galloway v. Brown, 230 Miss. 471, 93 So. 2d 459, 1957 Miss. LEXIS 390 (Miss. 1957).
      </p>
      <p>
       The surety, although he may in a proper case assert nonliability thereunder by contesting his original liability or asserting discharge, is not properly a party to the action of replevin, and must cede to his principal the responsibility of a defense upon the merits. Calcote v. May, 207 Miss. 547, 42 So. 2d 742, 1949 Miss. LEXIS 363 (Miss. 1949).
      </p>
      <p>
       Surety on possessory bond in replevin suit under this section may not draw upon either the forbearance of the defendant or the neglect of the plaintiff to avoid a liability upon the bond which was evidently satisfactory to both.

      </p>

       Surety on replevin bond could not contend that no judgment could be allowed against him because the bond was ineffectual on the ground that statute required at least two individual sureties. Calcote v. May, 207 Miss. 547, 42 So. 2d 742, 1949 Miss. LEXIS 363 (Miss. 1949).

    Responsibility of commissioner of public safety for impounding of livestock; authority of supervisors.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The commissioner of public safety shall be placed in charge of and be responsible for the taking up and impounding of livestock found on the highways or highway right-of-ways described in Section 69-13-101. The commissioner of public safety is authorized, in his discretion, to secure the services of any person or persons residing in the respective counties of the state where he deems it necessary or advisable, other than an elected county officer, who shall assist the highway safety patrol in taking up such loose livestock and impounding the same in a private enclosure, which the private individual provides, without any cost to the state, such an individual being paid solely from the fees and assessments hereinafter provided against any such livestock. The commissioner of public safety, in the alternative, may require that such livestock be impounded in an enclosure, in the event the board of supervisors of that county has provided such an enclosure for that purpose.
     </p>
     <p>
      A private individual hired by the commissioner of public safety to pick up loose livestock may not pick up such livestock off the highways and highway right-of-ways unless a state highway patrolman, or a sheriff or his deputy, or a constable, or some other law enforcement officer is present at the time such livestock is picked up.
     </p>
     <p>
      The board of supervisors of each county within the State of Mississippi may, in its discretion, make provision for the care of animals so taken up and impounded under the provisions of this article and all county officers and law enforcement officers are directed to give full cooperation to the highway safety patrol in carrying out the provisions of this article.

      Two Dollars and Fifty Cents ($2.50) per head, which shall be an impoundment fee, One Dollar ($1.00) of which shall be forwarded, for each animal impounded, to the state treasurer, earmarked for the Mississippi Highway Safety Patrol, on the first day of each month, and the balance of One Dollar and Fifty Cents ($1.50) shall be deposited in the general county fund of the county in which the animal is impounded.
     </p>
     <p>
      There shall be an assessment of One Dollar and Fifty Cents ($1.50) per day, per head of impounded livestock, such assessment to be deposited in the general county fund to pay for the cost of feeding and caring for such livestock, if the livestock is impounded in a county-owned and operated enclosure, but if the animal is impounded in a private enclosure provided by the private individual employed by the commissioner of public safety, such fee shall be paid to that individual.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any incidental costs, such as securing the services of a veterinarian, a milker or other necessary incidental expenses.
     </p>

      You are hereby notified that the following described livestock (giving full and accurate description of same, including marks and brands) is now impounded at (giving location where livestock is impounded) and the amount due by reason of such impounding is $ dollars per day. The above described livestock will, unless redeemed within five (5) days from date hereof, be offered for sale at public auction to the highest and best bidder for cash.

      If the rightful owners shall claim the impounded animals, they may do so by paying all assessments or liens as herein provided, after signing for them on forms provided by the commissioner of public safety, such forms to include the descriptions of said animals. All receipts shall be deposited in a special fund known as the “Sheriff’s Livestock Sale Fund.” If it is later determined who the rightful owners are, the sheriff may have refunded to them the selling price after all liens are paid. Any funds accrued in this account shall, on June first of each year, be transferred to the general county fund.

      The owners of livestock which through their owner’s negligence are found on federal or state designated paved highways or highway rights-of-way shall be subject to any damages as a result of wrecks, loss of life or bodily injury as a result of said livestock being on the above designated highways. The burden shall be on the owner of any such livestock to prove lack of negligence. This section shall not be applicable to any such highway or highway right-of-way or any type of highway or road located on any levee maintained by the Board of Mississippi Levee Commissioners or the board of levee commissioners for the Yazoo-Mississippi Delta through maintenance contracts calling for or permitting pasturage of livestock on levee rights-of-way.

   The language of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t69c13s69-13-111" target="_self">69-13-111</a></cite> stating that the “burden shall be on the owner of any such livestock to prove lack of negligence” applies to both the act and proximate cause elements of a negligence claim, so that the statute creates a presumption that the owner of stray livestock is negligent in his or her confinement of the animal, and also creates a presumption of proximate causation; the presumption does not create a case of absolute liability, but simply makes a prima facie case of negligence to the extent that the defendant is then called upon to meet it with an explanation. Carpenter v. Nobile, 620 So. 2d 961, 1993 Miss. LEXIS 242 (Miss. 1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       In the absence of evidence of negligence in the maintenance of his fences on the part of the owner of a calf, he was not liable in damages to a motorist whose car collided with the animal on a public highway. Hartford Ins. Group v. Massey, 216 So. 2d 415, 1968 Miss. LEXIS 1224 (Miss. 1968).
      </p>
      <p>
       Proof by a truck owner that his vehicle was damaged as result of a collision between the truck and a bull belonging to defendants, and that the collision took place on a state-designated, paved highway established a prima facie case for liability under this section. Hagger v. Self, 254 Miss. 508, 183 So. 2d 175, 1966 Miss. LEXIS 1554 (Miss. 1966).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence that a bull which damaged a truck on a public highway made its escape by pushing a four-strand barbed wire fence to the ground met the owners’ burden that the escape of the animal had been without negligence on their part. Hagger v. Self, 254 Miss. 508, 183 So. 2d 175, 1966 Miss. LEXIS 1554 (Miss. 1966).

      <p>
       In a case for damages arising from a collision between a driver and a bull, while the statute created a presumption of negligence against the owner of livestock involved in an accident on a highway, it did not necessarily preclude a finding of negligence against a keeper of an animal who exercised control over the animal. McMillan v. Rodriguez, 823 So. 2d 1173, 2002 Miss. LEXIS 255 (Miss. 2002).

      The boards of supervisors in said counties are hereby authorized and empowered in their discretion to levy a tax on the taxable property in said counties lying outside municipalities not exceeding two mills per annum thereon for the purpose of paying the cost of construction and maintenance of such fences and cattlegaps. In order to raise additional revenue for the purpose of paying the cost of construction and maintaining such fences and cattlegaps, the board of supervisors in those counties which have heretofore elected not to come under the statewide livestock law may in their discretion levy a tax against the owners of cattle permitted to roam at large in the amount of twenty-five cents (25¢) per head for cattle located in the respective counties in which an election has carried.

     <p>
      Before said board of supervisors is authorized to levy the aforesaid tax or erect such fences, it shall first be necessary that an election be held in each of such counties in accordance with the laws governing general election so far as possible to determine by majority vote of those voting in such election whether such tax shall be levied or such fences erected. And in said election only those electors outside the corporate limits of municipalities shall be eligible to vote. In the event the election is carried, such boards are authorized to construct such fences by use of convict labor, the funds derived from such tax, and with such aid as may be donated or contributed in material, labor or funds toward the erection of said fences and cattlegaps. In the event that the tax be not authorized at such election the board may nevertheless, in their discretion, erect such fences and cattlegaps by use of convict labor and such donations of labor, funds or materials as may be available, but shall not use public funds therefor.

     <ol>
      <li id="t69c13s69-13-339ol11">
       The Mississippi Military Department, acting through the training site supervisor at Camp Shelby, is hereby authorized and empowered to take up and impound in a proper enclosure all livestock found roaming at large upon any state-owned or leased lands comprising the state military reservation in Forrest and contiguous counties, in violation of the statewide stock law statutes.
      </li>
      <li id="t69c13s69-13-339ol12">
       The training site supervisor shall provide a safe and secure enclosure in which such livestock shall be impounded, and will insure that such animals are cared for in a humane manner until removed for such enclosure as hereinafter provided. It shall be unlawful for any owner of livestock or any other person to remove such livestock without the authority of the training site supervisor, and such offense shall be deemed a misdemeanor.
      </li>
      <li id="t69c13s69-13-339ol13">
       There is hereby created a statutory lien in the amount of the cost of impounding each animal, not to exceed Twenty-five Dollars ($25.00), against each head of cattle, horse or mule, and all other livestock so found upon and impounded upon the state military reservation; and in addition a lien of One Dollar and Fifty Cents ($1.50) per day shall accrue for the feeding and care of each animal so impounded. No animal shall be removed by its owner until the full lien is paid in cash to the training site supervisor, who shall give a receipt for such money paid and account for the same in the manner to be established by the military department. All funds collected under this section shall be forwarded to the adjutant general on or before the fifth day of each month, and such funds shall be expended under his supervision in carrying out the provisions of this section and in making improvements to the military reservation.
      </li>
      <li id="t69c13s69-13-339ol14">
       The training site supervisor shall publish a monthly notice in one (1) newspaper having general circulation in Forrest County, the general description of the livestock impounded and held on the end of the preceding month, and said notice shall offer the lawful owners the opportunity to claim their livestock by a day and hour certain, but not less than ten (10) days, after paying the full statutory lien imposed. All animals not claimed by the designated date and hour may be sold as a herd to the highest bidder for cash within ten (10) days and a proper receipt shall be given the purchaser and the funds accounted for as provided for in the preceding subsection.
      </li>
      <li id="t69c13s69-13-339ol15">
       This section is declared to be remedial legislation and is enacted for the purposes of protecting the personal and real property of the state military reservation known as Camp Shelby from livestock illegally thereon, and enhancing the safety of members of the National Guard and other reserve military forces of Mississippi and other states which train and conduct military exercises and maneuvers on said lands; and neither the training site supervisor, nor any other public employee, shall be liable in any civil or criminal court in carrying out the provisions of this section. The purchasers of livestock under the provisions of this section shall receive a valid title, and such purchaser shall not be liable in a civil or criminal court to any person for any purchase made under this section.

S. Department of Agriculture, Bureau of Animal Industry, duly commissioned by said board of animal health. If the owner shall refuse to accept such appraisal, the animals shall be appraised (under oath) by three competent and disinterested appraisers; one to be selected by the duly commissioned representative of the board of animal health or of the U. S.

S. Department of Agriculture, and not more than two-thirds thereof in the event no portion is paid by said U. S. Department of Agriculture. In no event shall the state be liable on an appraised value exceeding $25.00 per head for grade cattle and $50.00 per head for registered purebred cattle.
     </p>

   Ordinance adopted by town pursuant to police power, requiring permit for application of pesticide to public land, was not pre-empted by Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) (7 USCS §§ 136-136y), because (1) language of FIFRA did not explicitly pre-empt local regulation and provided no clear and manifest indication that Congress sought to supplant local authority over pesticide regulation impliedly, (2) legislative history was at best ambiguous, and (3) there was no actual conflict either between FIFRA in the ordinance or between FIFRA and local regulation generally.

       Every pesticide which is distributed, sold or offered for sale within this state or delivered for transportation or transported in intrastate commerce or between points within this state through any point outside this state shall be registered in the office of the commissioner, and such registration shall be renewed annually. Products which have the same formula, are manufactured by the same person, the labeling of which contains the same claims, and the labels bear a designation identifying the products as the same pesticide, may be registered as a single pesticide. Additional names and labels shall be added by supplement statements during the current period of registration. The registrant shall file with the commissioner a statement including:
       <ol type="a">
        <li id="t69c23s69-23-7ol11a">
         The name and address of the registrant and the name and address of the person whose name will appear on the label if other than the registrant;

         If requested by the commissioner, a full description of the tests made and the results upon which the claims are based. In the case of renewal of registration, a statement shall be required only for information which is different from that furnished when the pesticide was registered or last reregistered; and

In order to protect the public, the commissioner may, at any time, cancel or suspend the registration of a pesticide if he determines that it does not comply with this chapter or creates an imminent hazard. If he receives a notice from the Commission on Environmental Quality under Section 49-17-26 in relation to state underground water quality standards, he may order the relabeling of any pesticide, or suspend or cancel the registration of any pesticide or any use of any pesticide, or adopt a regulation in accordance with Section 69-23-9 to protect the underground water resources, as defined in the Federal Safe Drinking Water Act. He may advise EPA of the manner in which a federally registered pesticide fails to comply with FIFRA and suggest the necessary corrections. Regulatory action taken under this subsection shall be conducted in accordance with Sections 69-25-51 through 69-25-63.

   Ordinance adopted by town pursuant to police power, requiring permit for application of pesticide to public land, was not pre-empted by Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) (7 USCS §§ 136-136y), because (1) language of FIFRA did not explicitly pre-empt local regulation and provided no clear and manifest indication that Congress sought to supplaint local authority over pesticide regulation impliedly, (2) legislative history was at best ambiguous, and (3) there was no actual conflict either between FIFRA in the ordinance or between FIFRA and local regulation generally.

       There shall be paid to the commissioner for all soil or plant amendments distributed in this state an inspection fee of Thirty-five Cents ($.35) per ton. However, products sold in packages of ten (10) pounds or less or one (1) gallon or less shall be subject to an annual inspection fee of Fifty Dollars ($50.00) in lieu of the Thirty-five Cents ($.35) per ton fee.

If the statement is not filed or is filed falsely, or the inspection fee is not paid within thirty (30) days following the reporting year, the commissioner and State Chemist may revoke the registration of the products and a penalty of Ten Dollars ($10.00) per day for each subsequent day shall be assessed against the registrant. The inspection fee and the penalty shall constitute a debt and become the basis for a judgment against the registrant, which may be collected by the commissioner and in any court of competent jurisdiction without prior demand.

However, products” for “Thirty-five Cents ($.35) per ton; provided, however, that products”; in (2), substituted “an annual statement” for “quarterly statements for periods ending September 30, December 31, March 31 and June 30” and “the previous year” for “such quarter” in the first sentence, and “the reporting year” for “each quarter” in the second sentence; substituted “statement” for “report” and “the reporting year” for “each quarter” in the second sentence of (3); substituted “statement” for “report” three times and “registrant filing the” for “registrant making the” in (4); and made minor stylistic changes throughout.

          The order shall be served upon the accused in the same manner that the summons and complaint may be served upon him, except that, in the alternative, it may be served by giving a copy of the order to the attendant or clerk at the accused’s establishment. The accused shall then have thirty (30) days after service of the order to request an informal administrative review before the Director of the Bureau of Plant Industry, or his designee, who shall act as reviewing officer. If the accused requests a review within thirty (30) days, the reviewing officer shall conduct an informal administrative review within ten (10) days after the request is made. If the accused does not request an informal administrative review within thirty (30) days, then he is deemed to have waived his right to a review. At the informal administrative review, subpoena power shall not be available, witnesses shall not be sworn nor be subject to cross-examination and there shall be no court reporter or record made of the proceedings. Each party may present its case in the form of documents or oral statements. The rules of evidence shall not apply. The reviewing officer’s decision shall be in writing, and it shall be delivered to the parties by certified mail.

          If either party is aggrieved by the order of the reviewing officer, he may request a full evidentiary hearing before the hearing committee in accordance with the procedures in Sections 69-25-51 and 69-25-53. The request for an evidentiary hearing must be made with the department within thirty (30) days of receipt of the decision of the reviewing officer. Failure to request an evidentiary hearing within the thirty (30) days is deemed a waiver of such right. If either party is aggrieved by the decision of the hearing committee, he shall have the right of judicial review in circuit court and in the Supreme Court as provided in Section 69-25-59.

    Shipment of bees into State; requirement of certificate or permit.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      All honey bees shipped or moved into the State of Mississippi shall be accompanied by a certificate of inspection signed by the State Entomologist, State Apiary Inspector or corresponding official of the state or country from which such bees are shipped or moved. Such certificate shall certify to the apparent freedom of the bees and their combs and hives, from contagious and infectious diseases and parasites and must be based upon an actual inspection of the bees themselves within a period of sixty (60) days preceding the date of shipment; provided, that when honey bees are to be shipped into this state from other states or countries wherein no official apiary inspector or State Entomologist is available, the Mississippi Department of Agriculture and Commerce may issue permit for such shipment upon presentation of suitable evidence showing such bees to be free from disease. The provisions of this section shall not apply to shipments of live bees in wire cages, when without combs of honey.

The agencies are directed to work with the chair to provide meeting space. The advisory council shall meet and organize thirty (30) days after the passage of this act.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(5) A majority of the members of the advisory council shall constitute a quorum. In the selection of the vice chair, and the adoption of rules, minutes, findings and recommendations, an affirmative vote of a majority of the advisory council shall be required.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(6) No later than November 30, 2018, the council shall report its findings and recommendation in writing to the Chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee and the Chairman of the House Agriculture Committee.

    Pest Control Compact.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The Pest Control Compact is hereby enacted into law and entered into with all other jurisdictions legally joining therein in the form substantially as follows:
     </p>
     <p>
      PEST CONTROL COMPACT
     </p>
     <p>
      Article I
     </p>
     <p>
      Findings
     </p>
     <p>
      The party states find that:
     </p>
     <p>
      In the absence of the higher degree of cooperation among them possible under this Compact, the annual loss of approximately One Hundred Thirty-seven Billion Dollars ($137,000,000,000.00) from the depredations of pests is virtually certain to continue, if not to increase.
     </p>
     <p>
      Because of the varying climatic, geographic and economic factors, each state may be affected differently by particular species of pests; but all states share the inability to protect themselves fully against those pests which present serious dangers to them.
     </p>
     <p>
      The migratory character of pest infestations makes it necessary for states both adjacent to and distant from one another, to complement each other’s activities when faced with conditions of infestation and reinfestation.
     </p>
     <p>
      While every state is seriously affected by a substantial number of pests, and every state is susceptible of infestation by many species of pests not now causing damage to its crops and plant life and products, the fact that relatively few species of pests present equal danger to or are of interest to all states makes the establishment and operation of an Insurance Fund, from which individual states may obtain financial support for pest control programs of benefit to them in other states and to which they may contribute in accordance with their relative interest, the most equitable means of financing cooperative pest eradication and control programs.
     </p>
     <p>
      Article II
     </p>
     <p>
      Definitions
     </p>
     <p>
      As used in this Compact, unless the context clearly requires a different construction:
     </p>
     <p>
      “State” means a state, territory or possession of the United States, the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Requesting state” means a state which invokes the procedures of the Compact to secure the undertaking or intensification of measures to control or eradicate one or more pests within one or more other states.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Responding state” means a state requested to undertake or intensify the measures referred to in subdivision (b) of this Article.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Pest” means any invertebrate animal, pathogen, parasitic plant or similar or allied organism which can cause disease or damage in any crops, trees, shrubs, grasses, or other plants of substantial value.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Insurance Fund” means the Pest Control Insurance Fund established pursuant to this Compact.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Governing Board” means the administrators of this Compact representing all of the party states when such administrators are acting as a body in pursuance of authority vested in them by this Compact.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Executive committee” means the committee established pursuant to Article V(e) of this Compact.
     </p>
     <p>
      Article III
     </p>
     <p>
      The Insurance Fund
     </p>
     <p>
      There is hereby established a Pest Control Insurance Fund for the purpose of financing other than normal pest control operations which states may be called upon to engage in pursuant to this Compact. The Insurance Fund shall contain monies appropriated to it by the party states and any donations and grants accepted by it. All appropriations, except as conditioned by the rights and obligations of party states expressly set forth in this Compact, shall be unconditional and may not be restricted by the appropriating state to use in the control of any specified pest or pests. Donations and grants may be conditional or unconditional, provided that the Insurance Fund shall not accept any donation or grant whose terms are inconsistent with any provision of this Compact.
     </p>
     <p>
      Article IV
     </p>
     <p>
      The Insurance Fund, Internal Operations and Management
     </p>
     <p>
      The Insurance Fund shall be administered by a Governing Board and Executive Committee as hereinafter provided. The actions of the Governing Board and the Executive Committee pursuant to this Compact shall be deemed the actions of the Insurance Fund.
     </p>
     <p>
      The members of the Governing Board shall be entitled to one vote on such board. No action of the Governing Board shall be binding unless taken at a meeting at which a majority of the total number of votes on the Governing Board is cast in favor thereof. Action of the Governing Board shall be only at a meeting at which a majority of the members are present.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Insurance Fund shall have a seal which may be employed as an official symbol and which may be affixed to documents and otherwise used as the Governing Board may provide.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Governing Board shall elect annually, from among its members, a chairman, a vice chairman, a secretary and a treasurer. The chairman may not succeed himself. The Governing Board may appoint an executive director and fix his duties and his compensation, if any. Such executive director shall serve at the pleasure of the Governing Board. The Governing Board shall make provision for the bonding of such of the officers and employees of the Insurance Fund as may be appropriate.
     </p>
     <p>
      Irrespective of the civil service, personnel or other merit system laws of any of the party states, the executive director, or if there be no executive director, the chairman, in accordance with such procedures as the bylaws may provide, shall appoint, remove or discharge such personnel as may be necessary for the performance of the functions of the Insurance Fund and shall fix the duties and compensation of such personnel. The Governing Board in its bylaws shall provide for the personnel policies and programs of the Insurance Fund.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Insurance Fund may borrow, accept or contract for the services of personnel from any state, the United States, or any other governmental agency, or from any person, firm, association, or corporation.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Insurance Fund may accept for any of its purposes and functions under this Compact any and all donations, and grants of money, equipment, supplies, materials, and services, conditional or otherwise, from any state, the United States, or any other governmental agency, or from any person, firm, association, or corporation, and may receive, utilize and dispose of the same. Any donation, gift, or grant accepted by the Governing Board pursuant to this paragraph or services borrowed pursuant to paragraph (f) of this Article shall be reported in the annual report of the Insurance Fund. Such report shall include the nature, amount and conditions, if any, of the donation, gift, grant, or services borrowed and the identity of the donor or lender.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Governing Board shall adopt bylaws for the conduct of the business of the Insurance Fund and shall have the power to amend and to rescind these bylaws. The Insurance Fund shall publish its bylaws in convenient form and shall file a copy thereof and a copy of any amendment thereto with the appropriate agency or officer in each of the party states.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Insurance Fund annually shall make to the Governor and legislature of each party state a report covering its activities for the preceding year. The Insurance Fund may make such additional reports as it may deem desirable.
     </p>
     <p>
      In addition to the powers and duties specifically authorized and imposed, the Insurance Fund may do such other things as are necessary and incidental to the conduct of its affairs pursuant to this Compact.
     </p>
     <p>
      Article V
     </p>
     <p>
      Compact and Insurance Fund Administration
     </p>
     <p>
      In each party state there shall be a Compact administrator, who shall be selected and serve in such manner as the laws of his state may provide, and who shall:
     </p>
     <p>
      1. Assist in the coordination of activities pursuant to the Compact in his state; and
     </p>
     <p>
      2. Represent his state on the Governing Board of the Insurance Fund.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the laws of the United States specifically so provide, or if administrative provision is made therefore within the federal government, the United States may be represented on the Governing Board of the Insurance Fund by not to exceed three representatives. Any such representative or representatives of the United States shall be appointed and serve in such manner as may be provided by or pursuant to federal law, but no such representative shall have a vote on the Governing Board or the Executive Committee thereof.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Governing Board shall meet at least once each year for the purpose of determining policies and procedures in the administration of the Insurance Fund and, consistent with the provisions of the Compact, supervising and giving direction to the expenditure of monies from the Insurance Fund. Additional meetings of the Governing Board shall be held on call of the chairman, the Executive Committee, or a majority of the membership of the Governing Board.
     </p>
     <p>
      At such times as it may be meeting, the Governing Board shall pass upon applications for assistance from the Insurance Fund and authorize disbursements therefrom. When the Governing Board is not in session, the Executive Committee thereof shall act as agent of the Governing Board, with full authority to act for it in passing upon such applications.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Executive Committee shall be composed of the chairman of the Governing Board and four additional members of the Governing Board chosen by it so that there shall be one member representing each of four geographic groupings of party states. The Governing Board shall make such geographic groupings. If there is representation of the United States on the Governing Board, one such representative may meet with the Executive Committee. The chairman of the Governing Board shall be chairman of the Executive Committee. No action of the Executive Committee shall be binding unless taken at a meeting at which at least four members of such Committee are present and vote in favor thereof. Necessary expenses of each of the five members of the Executive Committee incurred in attending meetings of such Committee, when not held at the same time and place as a meeting of the Governing Board, shall be charges against the Insurance Fund.
     </p>
     <p>
      Article VI
     </p>
     <p>
      Assistance and Reimbursement
     </p>
     <p>
      Each party state pledges to each other party state that it will employ its best efforts to eradicate, or control within the strictest practicable limits, any and all pests. It is recognized that performance of this responsibility involves:
     </p>
     <p>
      1. The maintenance of pest control and eradication activities of interstate significance by a party state at a level that would be reasonable for its own protection in the absence of this Compact.
     </p>
     <p>
      2. The meeting of emergency outbreaks or infestations of interstate significance to no less an extent than would have been done in the absence of this Compact.
     </p>
     <p>
      Whenever a party state is threatened by a pest not present within its borders but present within another party state, or whenever a party state is undertaking or engaged in activities for the control or eradication of a pest or pests, and finds that such activities are or would be impracticable or substantially more difficult of success by reason of failure of another party state to cope with infestation or threatened infestation, that state may request the Governing Board to authorize expenditures from the Insurance Fund for eradication or control measures to be taken by one or more of such other party states at a level sufficient to prevent, or to reduce to the greatest practicable extent, infestation or reinfestation of the requesting state. Upon such authorization the responding state or states shall take or increase such eradication or control measures as may be warranted. A responding state shall use monies available from the Insurance Fund expeditiously and efficiently to assist in affording the protection requested.
     </p>
     <p>
      In order to apply for expenditures from the Insurance Fund, a requesting state shall submit the following in writing:
     </p>
     <p>
      1. A detailed statement of the circumstances which occasion the request for the invoking of the Compact.
     </p>
     <p>
      2. Evidence that the pest on account of whose eradication or control assistance is requested constitutes a danger to an agricultural or forest crop, product, tree, shrub, grass, or other plant having a substantial value to the requesting state.
     </p>
     <p>
      3. A statement of the extent of the present and projected program of the requesting state and its subdivisions, including full information as to the legal authority for the conduct of such program or programs and the expenditures being made or budgeted therefore, in connection with the eradication, control, or prevention of introduction of the pest concerned.
     </p>
     <p>
      4. Proof that the expenditures being made or budgeted as detailed in item 3 do not constitute a reduction of the effort for the control or eradication of the pest concerned or, if there is a reduction, the reasons why the level of program detailed in item 3 constitutes a normal level of pest control activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      5. A declaration as to whether, to the best of its knowledge and belief, the conditions which in its view occasion the invoking of the Compact in the particular instance can be abated by a program undertaken with the aid of monies from the Insurance Fund in one (1) year or less, or whether the request is for an installment in a program which is likely to continue for a longer period of time.
     </p>
     <p>
      6. Such other information as the Governing Board may require consistent with the provisions of this Compact.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Governing Board or Executive Committee shall give due notice of any meeting at which an application for assistance from the Insurance Fund is to be considered. Such notice shall be given to the Compact administrator of each party state and to such other officers and agencies as may be designated by the laws of the party states. The requesting state and any other party state shall be entitled to be represented and present evidence and argument at such meeting.
     </p>
     <p>
      Upon the submission as required by paragraph (c) of this Article and such other information as it may have or acquire, and upon determining that an expenditure of funds is within the purposes of this Compact and justified thereby, the Governing Board or Executive Committee shall authorize support of the program. The Governing Board or Executive Committee may meet at any time or place for the purpose of receiving and considering an application. Any and all determinations of the Governing Board or Executive Committee, with respect to an application, together with the reasons therefore shall be recorded and subscribed in such manner as to show and preserve the votes of the individual members thereof.
     </p>
     <p>
      A requesting state which is dissatisfied with a determination of the Executive Committee shall upon notice in writing given within twenty (20) days of the determination with which it is dissatisfied, be entitled to receive a review thereof at the next meeting of the Governing Board. Determinations of the Executive Committee shall be reviewable only by the Governing Board at one of its regular meetings, or at a special meeting held in such manner as the Governing Board may authorize.
     </p>
     <p>
      Responding states required to undertake or increase measures pursuant to this Compact may receive monies from the Insurance Fund, either at the time or times when such state incurs expenditures on account of such measures, or as reimbursement for expenses incurred and chargeable to the Insurance Fund. The Governing Board shall adopt and, from time to time, may amend or revise procedures for submission of claims upon it and for payment thereof.
     </p>
     <p>
      Before authorizing the expenditure of monies from the Insurance Fund pursuant to an application of a requesting state, the Insurance Fund shall ascertain the extent and nature of any timely assistance or participation which may be available from the federal government and shall request the appropriate agency or agencies of the federal government for such assistance and participation.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Insurance Fund may negotiate and execute a memorandum of understanding or other appropriate instrument defining the extent and degree of assistance or participation between and among the Insurance Fund, cooperating federal agencies, states, and any other entities concerned.
     </p>
     <p>
      Article VII
     </p>
     <p>
      Advisory and Technical Committees
     </p>
     <p>
      The Governing Board may establish advisory and technical committees composed of state, local, and federal officials, and private persons to advise it with respect to any one or more of its functions. Any such advisory or technical committee, or any member or members thereof may meet with and participate in its deliberations upon request of the Governing Board or Executive Committee. An advisory or technical committee may furnish information and recommendations with respect to any application for assistance from the Insurance Fund being considered by such Board or Committee and the Board or Committee may receive and consider the same: provided that any participant in a meeting of the Governing Board or Executive Committee held pursuant to Article VI(d) of the Compact shall be entitled to know the substance of any such information and recommendations, at the time of the meeting if made prior thereto or as a part thereof or, if made thereafter, no later than the time at which the Governing Board or Executive Committee makes its disposition of the application.
     </p>
     <p>
      Article VIII
     </p>
     <p>
      Relations with Nonparty Jurisdictions
     </p>
     <p>
      A party state may make application for assistance from the Insurance Fund in respect of a pest in a nonparty state. Such application shall be considered and disposed of by the Governing Board or Executive Committee in the same manner as an application with respect to a pest within a party state, except as provided in this Article.
     </p>
     <p>
      At or in connection with any meeting of the Governing Board or Executive Committee held pursuant to Article VI(d) of this Compact a nonparty state shall be entitled to appear, participate, and receive information only to such extent as the Governing Board or Executive Committee may provide. A nonparty state shall not be entitled to review of any determination made by the Executive Committee.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Governing Board or Executive Committee shall authorize expenditures from the Insurance Fund to be made in a nonparty state only after determining that the conditions in such state and the value of such expenditures to the party states as a whole justify them. The Governing Board or Executive Committee may set any conditions which it deems appropriate with respect to the expenditure of monies from the Insurance Fund in a nonparty state and may enter into such agreement or agreements with nonparty states and other jurisdictions or entities as it may deem necessary or appropriate to protect the interests of the Insurance Fund with respect to expenditures and activities outside of party states.
     </p>
     <p>
      Article IX
     </p>
     <p>
      Finance
     </p>
     <p>
      The Insurance Fund shall submit to the executive head or designated officer or officers of each party state a budget for the Insurance Fund for such period as may be required by the laws of that party state for a presentation to the legislature thereof.
     </p>
     <p>
      Each of the budgets shall contain specific recommendations of the amount or amounts to be appropriated by each of the party states. The request for appropriations shall be apportioned among the party states as follows: one-tenth (1/10) of the total budget in equal shares and the remainder in proportion to the value of agricultural and forest crops and products, excluding animals and animal products, produced in each party state. In determining the value of such crops and products the Insurance Fund may employ such source or sources of information as in its judgment present the most equitable and accurate comparisons among the party states. Each of the budgets and requests for appropriations shall indicate the source or sources used in obtaining information concerning value of products.
     </p>
     <p>
      The financial assets of the Insurance Fund shall be maintained in two accounts to be designated respectively as the “Operating Account” and the “Claims Account.” The Operating Account shall consist only of those assets necessary for the administration of the Insurance Fund during the next ensuing two-year period. The Claims Account shall contain all monies not included in the Operating Account and shall not exceed the amount reasonably estimated to be sufficient to pay all legitimate claims on the Insurance Fund for a period of three years. At any time when the Claims Account has reached its maximum limit or would reach its maximum limit by the addition of monies requested for appropriation by the party states, the Governing Board shall reduce its budget requests on a pro rata basis in such manner as to keep the Claims Account within such maximum limit. Any monies in the Claims Account by virtue of conditional donations, grants, or gifts shall be included in calculations made pursuant to this paragraph only to the extent that such monies are available to meet demands arising out of the claims.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Insurance Fund shall not pledge the credit of any party state. The Insurance Fund may meet any of its obligations in whole or in part with monies available to it under Article IV(g) of this Compact, provided that the Governing Board take specific action setting aside such monies prior to incurring any obligation to be met in whole or in part in such manner. Except where the Insurance Fund makes use of monies available to it under Article IV(g) hereof, the Insurance Fund shall not incur any obligation prior to the allotment of monies by the party states adequate to meet the same.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Insurance Fund shall keep accurate accounts of all receipts and disbursements. The receipts and disbursements of the Insurance Fund shall be subject to the audit and accounting procedures established under its bylaws. However, all receipts and disbursements of funds handled by the Insurance Fund shall be audited yearly by a certified or licensed public accountant and report of the audit shall be included in and become part of the annual report of the Insurance Fund.
     </p>
     <p>
      The accounts of the Insurance Fund shall be open at any reasonable time for inspection by duly authorized officers of the party states and by any persons authorized by the Insurance Fund.
     </p>
     <p>
      Article X
     </p>
     <p>
      Entry Into Force and Withdrawal
     </p>
     <p>
      This Compact shall enter into force when enacted into law by any five (5) or more states. Thereafter, this Compact shall become effective as to any other state upon its enactment thereof.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any party state may withdraw from this Compact by enacting a statute repealing the same, but no such withdrawal shall take effect until two (2) years after the executive head of the withdrawing state has given notice in writing of the withdrawal to the executive heads of all other party states. No withdrawal shall affect any liability already incurred by or chargeable to a party state prior to the time of such withdrawal.
     </p>
     <p>
      Article XI
     </p>
     <p>
      Construction and Severability
     </p>
     <p>
      This Compact shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes thereof. The provisions of this Compact shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this Compact is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any state or of the United States or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person, or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this Compact and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person, or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If this Compact shall be held contrary to the constitution of any state participating herein the Compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining party states and in full force and effect as to the state affected as to all severable matters.

       § 69-27-3.
    Legislative determinations and declarations of policy.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      It is hereby declared, as a matter of legislative determination:
     </p>
     <p>
      The condition.— That good soil and usable water are essential to the success of agricultural activities in the State of Mississippi; that our farms, forests and grazing lands are among the basic assets of the state; and that the preservation of these lands and usable waters is necessary to protect and promote the health, safety and prosperity of the people.
     </p>
     <p>
      That improper land usage causes the breaking of natural cover, and results in serious soil erosion of the farms, forests and grazing lands by uncontrolled waters; that erosion feeds itself, causing an accelerated washing of sloping fields and pastures, speeding up with the removal of absorptive topsoil, causing exposure of less absorptive and less protective but more erodible subsoil; that failure by any landowner or operator to conserve the soil and water and control erosion upon his lands causes a washing of soil from his lands onto other lands and makes the conservation of soil and water and control of erosion on such other lands difficult or impossible; that good soil and water usage is possible only through joint actions of farmers, ranchers and foresters made possible through legislative action.
     </p>
     <p>
      The consequences.— That the consequences of such soil erosion in the form of soil-washing are the silting and sedimentation of stream channels, reservoirs, dams, ditches, and harbors and the movement of silt into creeks, rivers, ponds, lakes and bayous contributing to the pollution of the surface waters of the state; the piling up of soil on lower slopes, and its deposit over alluvial plains; the reduction in productivity or outright ruin of rich bottom lands by overwash of poor subsoil material, sand, and gravel swept out of the hills; deterioration of soil and its fertility, deterioration of crops grown thereon, and declining acre yields despite development of scientific process for increasing such yields; loss of soil and water which causes destruction of food and cover for wildlife; a washing of soil into streams which silts over spawning beds, and destroys water plants, diminishing the food supply of fish; a diminishing of the underground and surface water reserve, which causes water shortages, intensifies periods of drought and causes crop failures; and increase in the speed and volume of rainfall runoff, causing severe and increasing floods, which bring suffering, disease, and death; impoverishment of families attempting to farm eroding and eroded lands; damage to roads, highways, railways, farm buildings and other property from floods; and losses in navigation, hydro-electric power, municipal water supply, farming and grazing. Other consequences are the loss of surface soil and water because of the denuding of the forests, and the abuse and erosion of sloping lands; the declining mean low flow of the rivers reducing the amount of surface water available seasonally for beneficial use; the decrease in effectiveness and decline of ground water reaching aquifers which provide a source of water for beneficial use; and the increase in rates of runoff from sloping land, adding to flood damage of the flood plains and valleys of the state; all adding to the drainage problem.
     </p>
     <p>
      The appropriate corrective methods.— That to conserve soil and water resources and control and prevent soil erosion, it is necessary that practices contributing to soil and water wastage and soil erosion be discouraged and discontinued, and appropriate water and soil conserving practices be adopted and carried out; that among the procedures necessary for widespread adoption, are the carrying on of engineering operations such as the construction of terraces, terrace outlets, check dams, dikes, ponds, lakes, ditches, and the like; the utilization of strip cropping, lister furrowing, contour cultivating, and contour furrowing; seeding and planting of waste, sloping, abandoned, or eroded lands to water-conserving and erosion-preventing plants, trees, and grasses; afforestation and reforestation; rotation of crops; soil stabilization with trees, grasses, legumes, and other thick-growing, soil-holding crops, retardation of runoff by increasing absorption of rainfall; and retirement from cultivation of steep, highly erodible areas and areas now badly gullied or otherwise eroded.
     </p>
     <p>
      Declaration of policy.— It is hereby declared to be the policy of the legislature to provide for the conservation of the water and soil resources of this state, and for the control and prevention of soil erosion, and thereby to preserve natural resources, control floods, prevent impairment of dams and reservoirs, assist in maintaining the navigability of rivers and harbors, preserve wildlife, protect the tax base, protect public lands, and protect and promote the health, safety, prosperity, and general welfare of the people of this state.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is further declared to be the policy of the legislature to alleviate and prevent flood damage; to conserve the waters of the state through improvement and cover, and through impoundments and effective use for various beneficial purposes; to develop private lands and waters of the state for recreational purposes; to promulgate soil and water conservation practices and measures which beautify the landscape, and promote the economic welfare of communities, counties, and areas of the state; and to provide leadership through soil and water conservation districts to other governmental agencies, departments and private groups in the promotion of the conservation of land, water, and related resources.

      Within sixty (60) days after a petition pursuant to Section 69-27-15 has been filed with the State Soil and Water Conservation Committee, it shall cause due notice to be given of a proposed hearing upon the question of the desirability and necessity in the interest of public health, safety, and welfare, of the creation of such district, upon the question of the appropriate boundaries to be assigned to such district, upon the propriety of the petition and other proceedings taken under this article, and upon all questions relevant to such inquiries. All owners and all operators of land within the limits of the territory described in the petition, and of lands within any territory considered for addition to such described territory, and all other interested parties, shall have the right to attend such hearings and to be heard. If it shall appear upon the hearing that it may be desirable to include within the proposed district territory outside of the area within which due notice of the hearing has been given, the hearing shall be adjourned and due notice of further hearing shall be given throughout the entire area considered for inclusion in the district, and such further hearing held. After such hearing, if the committee shall determine, upon the facts presented at such hearing and upon such other relevant facts and information as may be available, that there is need, in the interest of the public health, safety, and welfare, for a soil and water conservation district to function in the territory considered at the hearing, it shall make and record such determination, and shall define, by metes and bounds or by legal subdivisions, the boundaries of such district. In making such determination and in defining such boundaries, the committee shall give due weight and consideration to the topography of the area considered and of the state, the composition of soils therein, the distribution of erosion, the prevailing water and land use practices, the desirability and necessity of including within the boundaries the particular lands under consideration and the benefit such lands may receive from being included within such boundaries, the relation of the proposed area to existing watersheds and agricultural regions, and to other soil and water conservation districts already organized or proposed for organization under the provisions of this article, and such other physical, geographical, and economic factors as are relevant, having due regard to the legislative determinations set forth in Section 69-27-3. The territory to be included within such boundaries need not be contiguous. If the committee shall determine after such hearing, after due consideration of the said relevant facts, that there is no need for a soil and water conservation district to function in the territory considered at the hearing, it shall make and record such determination and shall deny the petition. After twelve (12) months shall have expired from the date of the denial of any such petition, subsequent petitions covering the same or substantially the same territory may be filed as aforesaid and new hearings held and determinations made thereon. If it be determined that there is no need for such soil and water conservation district, then in no event shall any expense or part thereof, incurred in connection with the hearing or other proceedings had to determine such question, be assessed against any landowner or other party except those landowners signing the original petition.

        The two (2) appointed commissioners shall present to the Secretary of State an application signed by them, which shall set forth (and such application need contain no detail other than the mere recitals): (a) that a petition for the creation of the district was filed with the State Soil and Water Conservation Committee pursuant to the provisions of this article, and that the proceedings specified in this article were taken pursuant to such petition; that the application is being filed in order to complete the organization of the district as a governmental subdivision and a public body, corporate and politic, under this article; and that the committee has appointed them as commissioners; (b) the name and official residence of each of the commissioners, together with a certified copy of the appointments evidencing their right to office; (c) the term of office of each of the commissioners; (d) the name which is proposed for the district; and (e) the location of the principal office of the commissioners of the district.

The application shall be accompanied by a statement by the State Soil and Water Conservation Committee, which shall certify (and such statement need contain no detail other than the mere recitals) that a petition was filed, notice issued, and hearing held as aforesaid; that the committee did duly determine that there is need, in the interest of the public health, safety, and welfare, for a soil and water conservation district to function in the proposed territory and did define the boundaries thereof; that notice was given and a referendum held on the question of the creation of such district, and that the result of such referendum showed a majority of the votes cast in such referendum to be in favor of the creation of the district; that thereafter the committee did duly determine that the operation of the proposed district is administratively practicable and feasible. The said statement shall set forth the boundaries of the district as they have been defined by the committee.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Secretary of State shall examine the application and statement, and, if he finds that the name proposed for the district is not identical with that of any other soil and water conservation district of this state or so nearly similar as to lead to confusion or uncertainty, he shall receive and file them and shall record them in an appropriate book of record in his office. If the Secretary of State shall find that the name proposed for the district is identical with that of any other soil and water conservation district of this state, or so nearly similar as to lead to confusion and uncertainty, he shall certify such fact to the State Soil and Water Conservation Committee, which shall thereupon submit to the Secretary of State a new name for said district, which shall not be subject to such defects. Upon receipt of such new name, free of such defects, the Secretary of State shall record the application and statement, with the name so modified, in an appropriate book of record in his office. When the application and statement have been made, filed and recorded, as herein provided, the district shall constitute a governmental subdivision of this state and a public body, corporate and politic. The Secretary of State shall make and issue to the said commissioners a certificate, under the seal of the state, of the due organization of the said district, and shall record such certificate with the application and statement. The boundaries of such district shall include the territory as determined by the State Soil and Water Conservation Committee as aforesaid, but in no event shall they include any area included within the boundaries of another soil and water conservation district organized under the provisions of this article.

Landowners may sign more than one such nominating petition to nominate more than one candidate for commissioner but in no event shall a landowner sign more than three (3) such nominating petitions. The committee is hereby authorized to enact and implement rules to provide that not more than one commissioner shall be a resident of any one county or supervisors district, unless there is no person qualified and willing to serve in another county or supervisors district. The committee shall give due notice of an election to be held for the election of three (3) commissioners for the district. The names of all nominees, on behalf of whom such nominating petitions have been filed within the time herein designated, shall appear, arranged in alphabetical order of the surnames, upon ballots, with a square before each name and a direction to insert an X mark in the square before any three (3) names to indicate the voter’s preference. All owners of lands lying within the district shall be eligible to vote in such election. Only such landowners shall be eligible to vote. The three (3) candidates who receive a majority of the votes cast in such an election shall be elected commissioners for such district. In the event any candidate fails to receive a majority, then the candidates receiving the largest number of votes shall run off in an election to be held two (2) weeks thereafter.

    Appointment, qualifications, and tenure of commissioners.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The governing body of the district shall consist of five (5) commissioners, elected or appointed as provided hereinabove. The commissioners shall be persons who are landowners and/or operators within the geographical areas of the district qualified to perform the specialized skilled services which will be required of them in the performance of their duties hereunder, and able to attend all meetings.
     </p>
     <p>
      The commissioners shall designate a chairman annually. The term of office of each commissioner shall be three (3) years, except that the commissioners who are first appointed shall be designated to serve for terms of one (1) and two (2) years, respectively, from the date of their appointment. A commissioner shall hold office until his successor has been elected or appointed and has qualified. Vacancies shall be filled by election or appointment as in the case of the election or appointment of other commissioners, but in the event the unexpired terms remaining of the offices vacated are less than one (1) year, said vacancy shall be filled for the unexpired term by the other commissioners. The selection of successors for a full term shall be made in the same manner in which the original retiring commissioners shall, respectively, have been selected. A majority of the commissioners shall constitute a quorum and the concurrence of a majority in any matter within their duties shall be required for its determination. A commissioner and any deputy commissioner shall receive no compensation for their services, but they shall be entitled to expenses, including travelling expenses, necessarily incurred in the discharge of their duties.
     </p>
     <p>
      The commissioners may utilize the services of the county agricultural agents and the facilities of the county agricultural agents’ offices insofar as practicable and feasible, and may, with the approval of the State Soil and Water Conservation Commission employ such other help as may be necessary. Employees hired pursuant to this section, upon agreement by the commissioners and the county board of supervisors, shall be considered as employees of the county or counties in which the district is located solely for the purpose of allowing such county or counties to include these employees in any group life and/or health insurance or workers’ compensation insurance program maintained by the county or counties for its employees and to include these employees in the county payroll system. Upon such agreement, the county or counties shall be responsible for the payment and withholding functions for the commissioners and shall provide the employees with all required tax documents. If more than one (1) county desires to include these employees in a group life and/or health insurance or workers’ compensation insurance program, the counties shall determine the program in which the employees shall be included and the amount of contributions that the other county or counties shall make to that program on behalf of the employees. Nothing in this section shall be construed to mean that these employees are to be considered as county employees for any purpose other than the purpose of including these employees in a county employee group life and/or health insurance or workers’ compensation insurance program and the county’s payroll system. The commissioners may call upon the Attorney General of the state for such legal services as they may require, or may use such other legal counsel as may be available. The commissioners may delegate to their chairman, to one or more commissioners, or to one or more agents, or employees, such powers and duties as they may deem proper, and may appoint such deputy commissioners as they deem appropriate, not to exceed one (1) deputy commissioner for each supervisor district in the soil and water conservation district, to assist the commissioners in the performance of their duties; however, deputy commissioners shall not be entitled to vote on any matter coming before the commissioners. The State Soil and Water Conservation Commission shall establish and administer qualification standards and establish term of office for deputy commissioners. The commissioners shall furnish to the State Soil and Water Conservation Commission, upon request, copies of such ordinances, rules, regulations, orders, contracts, forms and other documents as they shall adopt or employ, and such other information concerning their activities as it may require in the performance of its duties under this article.
     </p>
     <p>
      The commissioners may provide for the execution of surety bonds for all employees and officers who shall be entrusted with funds or property; shall provide for the keeping of a full and accurate record of all proceedings and of all resolutions, regulations and orders issued or adopted; and shall provide for an annual audit of the accounts of receipts and disbursements if total annual receipts or expenditures exceeds Sixty Thousand Dollars ($60,000.00) and an annual financial statement if total annual receipts or expenditures is equal to or less than Sixty Thousand Dollars ($60,000.00).
     </p>
     <p>
      The commissioners may invite the legislative body of any municipality or county located near the territory comprised within the district to designate a representative to advise and consult with the commissioners of the district on all questions of program and policy which may affect the property, water supply, or other interests of such municipality or county.

       § 69-27-37.
    Adoption of land-use regulations.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The commissioners of any district shall have authority to formulate regulations governing the use of lands within the district in the interest of conserving water and soil and soil resources and preventing and controlling soil erosion subject to the approval of and acceptance by two-thirds (2/3) of the landowners owning at least sixty-six and two-thirds per cent(662/3) of the lands affected by such proposed regulations. Such regulations shall be compatible with state laws, particularly those related to the board of water commissioners.
     </p>
     <p>
      The commissioners may conduct such public meetings and public hearings upon tentative regulations as may be necessary to assist them in this work. The commissioners shall not have authority to enact such water and land use regulations into law until after they shall have caused due notice to be given of their intention to conduct a referendum for submission of such regulations to the owners of lands lying within the boundaries of the district for their indication of approval or disapproval of such proposed regulations, and until after the commissioners have considered the result of such referendum. The proposed regulations shall be embodied in a proposed ordinance. Copies of such proposed ordinance shall be available for the inspection of all eligible voters during the period between publication of such notice and the date of the referendum. The notices of the referendum shall recite the contents of such proposed ordinance, or shall state where copies of such proposed ordinance may be examined. The question shall be submitted by ballots, upon which the words “for approval of proposed ordinance No._______________ , prescribing land and water use regulations for conservation of soil and water and prevention of erosion” and “against approval of proposed ordinance No._______________ , prescribing water and land use regulations for conservation of soil and water and prevention of erosion” shall appear, with a square before each proposition and a direction to insert an X mark in the square before one or the other of said propositions as the voter may favor or oppose approval of such proposed ordinance. The commissioners shall supervise such referendum, shall prescribe appropriate regulations governing the conduct thereof, and shall publish the result thereof. All owners of land within the district shall be eligible to vote in such referendum. Only such landowners shall be eligible to vote. No informalities in the conduct of such referendum or in any matters relating thereto shall invalidate said referendum or the result thereof if notice thereof shall have been given substantially as herein provided and said referendum shall have been fairly conducted.
     </p>
     <p>
      The commissioners shall not have authority to enact such proposed ordinance into law unless two-thirds (2/3) of the landowners owning at least sixty-six and two-thirds per cent(662/3%) of all lands affected by such proposed ordinance shall have voted in favor thereof. The approval of the proposed ordinance by two-thirds (2/3) of the landowners owning at least sixty-six and two-thirds per cent (662/3%) of the land affected by such ordinance shall not be deemed to require the commissioners to enact such proposed ordinance into law. Water and land use regulations prescribed in ordinances adopted pursuant to the provisions of this section by the commissioners of any district shall have the force and effect of law in the said district.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any owners or operators of land within such district may at any time file a petition with the commissioners asking that any or all of the water and land use regulations prescribed in any ordinance adopted by the commissioners under the provisions of this section shall be amended, supplemented or repealed. Water and land use regulations prescribed in any ordinance adopted pursuant to the provisions of this section shall not be amended, supplemented, or repealed except in accordance with the procedure prescribed in this section for adoption of water and land use regulations. Referendums on adoption, amendment, supplementation, or repeal of water and land use regulations shall not be held more often than once in twelve (12) months.
     </p>
     <p>
      The regulations to be adopted by the commissioners under the provisions of this section may include:
     </p>
     <p>
      Provisions requiring the carrying out of necessary engineering operations, including the construction of terraces, terrace outlets, check dams, dikes, ponds, ditches, and other necessary structures.
     </p>
     <p>
      Provisions requiring observance of particular methods of cultivation, including contour cultivating, contour furrowing, lister furrowing, sowing, planting, strip cropping, seeding, and planting of lands to water conserving and erosion-preventing plants, trees, and grasses, afforestation, and reforestation.
     </p>
     <p>
      Specifications of cropping programs and tillage practices to be observed.
     </p>
     <p>
      Provisions requiring the retirement from cultivation of highly erodible areas or of areas on which erosion may not be adequately controlled if cultivation is carried on.
     </p>
     <p>
      Provisions for such other means, measures, operations, and programs as may assist conservation of water and soil resources and prevent or control soil erosion in the district having due regard to the legislative findings set forth in Section 69-27-3.
     </p>
     <p>
      The regulations shall be uniform throughout the territory comprised within the district except that the commissioners may classify the lands within the district with reference to such factors as soil type, degree of slope, degree of erosion threatened or existing, cropping and tillage practices in use, and other relevant factors, and may provide regulations varying with the type or class of land affected, but uniform as to all lands within each class or type. Copies of water and land use regulations adopted under the provisions of this section shall be made available to all owners and operators of lands lying within the district.

      Where the commissioners of any district shall find that any of the provisions of land-use regulations prescribed in an ordinance adopted in accordance with the provisions of Section 69-27-37 are not being observed on particular lands, and that such violations are the proximate cause of damage to any other landowner within the district, then the commissioners may present to the chancery court of the county in which the lands of the defendant may lie a petition, duly verified, setting forth the adoption of the ordinance prescribing land-use regulations, the failure of the defendant landowner or operator or both to observe such regulations, and to perform particular work, operations or avoidance as required thereby and that such nonobservance tends to increase erosion on such lands and is interfering with the prevention or control of erosion on other lands within the district and is the proximate cause of damage to other landowners within the district, and praying the court to require the defendant to perform the work, operations, or avoidances within a reasonable time and to order that if the defendant shall fail so to perform the commissioners may go on the land, perform the work or other operations or otherwise bring the condition of such lands into conformity with the requirements of such regulations and recover the costs and expenses thereof from the defendant. Upon the filing of such petition, process shall issue against the defendant returnable in the manner provided by law, and said cause shall be tried in the manner provided by law for the trial of civil actions. The defendant may demand a trial by jury and in such event, the jurors shall have the qualifications of jurors in eminent domain proceedings in the chancery court. If the decree of the court be against the defendant, the court may require the defendant to perform the work, operations, or avoidances, and may provide that upon the failure of the defendant to initiate such performance within the time specified in the order of the court, and to prosecute the same to completion with reasonable diligence, the commissioners may enter upon the lands involved and perform the work or operations or otherwise bring the condition of such lands into conformity with the requirements of the regulations and may recover the costs and expenses thereof, from the defendant. In no case, however, shall the commissioners enter upon such lands for such purpose until the court shall have found that the landowner or person in possession has not prosecuted such work as was ordered by the court with reasonable diligence. In all cases where the person in possession of lands who shall fail to perform such work, operations, or avoidances shall not be the owner, the owner of such lands shall be joined as party defendant.
     </p>
     <p>
      The court shall retain jurisdiction of the case until after the work has been completed. Upon completion of such work pursuant to such order of the court, the commissioners may file a petition with the court, a copy of which shall be served upon the defendant in the case, in the manner provided by law for service of process, stating the costs and expenses sustained by them in the performance of the work and praying judgment therefor. The court shall have jurisdiction to enter, upon a hearing to be held not sooner than five days after service of such process, its decree for the amount of such costs and expenses together with the costs of suit, including a reasonable attorney’s fee to be fixed by the court. Such decree shall when entered upon the lis pendens docket of said court, constitute a lien on the lands of the defendant.

      Any landowner or operator may file a petition with the board of adjustment alleging that there are great practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships in the way of his carrying out upon his lands the strict letter of the land-use regulations prescribed by ordinance approved by the commissioners, and praying the board to authorize a variance from the terms of the land-use regulations in the application of such regulations to the lands owned or operated by the petitioner. Copies of such petition shall be served by the petitioner upon the chairman of the commissioners of the district within which his lands are located and upon the chairman of the State Soil and Water Conservation Committee.

Any party to the hearing before the board may appear in person, by agent, or by attorney. If, upon the facts presented at such hearing, the board shall determine that there are great practical difficulties or unnecessary hardship in the way of applying the strict letter of any of the land-use regulations upon the lands of the petitioner, it shall make and record such determination and shall make and record findings of fact as to the specific conditions which establish such great practical difficulties or unnecessary hardship. Upon the basis of such findings and determination, the board shall have power by order to authorize such variance from the terms of land-use regulations in their application to the lands of the petitioner, as will relieve such great practical difficulties or unnecessary hardship and will not be contrary to the public interest, and such that the spirit of the land-use regulations shall be observed, the public health, safety, and welfare secured, and substantial justice done.

      Any petitioner aggrieved by an order of the board granting or denying, in whole or in part, the relief sought, the commissioners of the district, or any intervening party, may obtain a review of such order in the chancery court of the county in which the lands of the petitioner may lie, by filing in such court a petition praying that the order of the board be modified or set aside and may demand a jury qualified in all respects as the jurors in eminent domain proceedings in the chancery court. A copy of such petition shall forthwith be served upon the parties to the hearing before the board and thereupon the party seeking review shall file in the court a transcript of the entire record in the proceedings, certified by the board, including the documents and testimony upon which the order complained of was entered, and the findings, determination, and order of the board. Upon such filing, the court shall cause notice thereof to be served upon the parties and shall have jurisdiction of the proceedings and of the questions determined or to be determined therein, and shall have power to grant such temporary relief as it deems just and proper, and to make and enter a decree enforcing, modifying and enforcing as so modified, or setting aside in whole or in part, the order of the board. No contention that has not been urged before the board shall be considered by the court unless the failure or neglect to urge such contention shall be excused because of extraordinary circumstances. The findings of the board as to the facts, if supported by evidence, shall be conclusive. If any party shall apply to the court for leave to produce additional evidence and shall show to the satisfaction of the court that such evidence is material and that there were reasonable grounds for the failure to produce such evidence in the hearing before the board, the court may order such additional evidence to be taken before the board and to be made a part of the transcript. The board may modify the findings as to the facts or make new findings, taking into consideration the additional evidence so taken and filed, and it shall file such modified or new findings which, if supported by evidence, shall be conclusive, and shall file with the court its recommendations, if any, for the modification or setting aside of its original order. The jurisdiction of the court shall be exclusive and its judgment and decree shall be final, except that the same shall be subject to review in the same manner as are other judgments or decrees of the court.

       § 69-27-63.
    Discontinuance of districts.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      At any time after the organization of a district under the provisions of this article, any twenty-five (25) owners of land lying within the boundaries of such district may file a petition with the State Soil and Water Conservation Committee praying that the operations of the district be terminated and the existence of the district discontinued. The committee may conduct such public meetings and public hearings upon such petition as may be necessary to assist it in the consideration thereof. Within sixty (60) days after such a petition has been received by the committee, it shall give due notice of the holding of a referendum, and shall supervise such referendum, and issue appropriate regulations governing the conduct thereof, the question to be submitted by ballots upon which the words “For terminating the existence of the_______________(name of the soil and water conservation district to be here inserted)” and “Against terminating the existence of the_______________(name of the soil and water conservation district to be here inserted)” shall appear, with a square before each proposition and a direction to insert an X mark in the square before one or the other of said propositions as the voter may favor or oppose discontinuance of such district. All owners of lands lying within the boundaries of the district shall be eligible to vote in such referendum. Only such landowners shall be eligible to vote. No informalities in the conduct of such referendum or in any matters relating thereto shall invalidate such referendum or the result thereof if notice thereof shall have been given substantially as herein provided and said referendum shall have been fairly conducted.
     </p>
     <p>
      The committee shall publish the result of such referendum and shall thereafter consider and determine whether the continued operation of the district within the defined boundaries is administratively practicable and feasible. If the committee shall determine that the continued operation of such district is administratively practicable and feasible, it shall record such determination and deny the petition. If the committee shall determine that the continued operation of such district is not administratively practicable and feasible, it shall record such determination and shall certify such determination to the commissioners of the district. In making such determination the committee shall give due regard and weight to the attitudes of the owners and operators of lands lying within the district, the number of landowners eligible to vote in such referendum who shall have voted, the proportion of the votes cast in such referendum in favor of the discontinuance in the district to the total number of votes cast, the approximate wealth and income of the landowners of the district, the probable expense of carrying on erosion-control operations within such district, and such other economic and social factors as may be relevant to such determination, having due regard to the legislative findings set forth in Section 69-27-3. However, the committee shall not have authority to determine that the continued operation of the district is administratively practicable and feasible unless at least a majority of the votes cast in the referendum shall have been cast in favor of the continuance of such district.
     </p>
     <p>
      Upon receipt from the State Soil and Water Conservation Committee of a certification that the committee has determined that the continued operation of the district is not administratively practicable and feasible, pursuant to the provisions of this section, the commissioners shall forthwith proceed to terminate the affairs of the district. The commissioners shall dispose of all property belonging to the district at public auction and shall pay over the proceeds of such sale to be covered into the state treasury. The commissioners shall thereupon file an application, duly verified, with the Secretary of State for the discontinuance of such district, and shall transmit with such application the certificate of the State Soil and Water Conservation Committee setting forth the determination of the committee that the continued operation of such district is not administratively practicable and feasible. The application shall recite that the property of the district has been disposed of and the proceeds paid over as in this section provided, and shall set forth a full accounting of such properties and proceeds of the sale. The Secretary of State shall issue to the commissioners a certificate of dissolution and shall record such certificate in an appropriate book of record in his office.
     </p>
     <p>
      Upon the issuance of a certificate of dissolution under the provisions of this section, all ordinances and regulations theretofore adopted and in force within such district shall be of no further force and effect. All contracts theretofore entered into, to which the district or commissioners are parties, shall remain in full force and effect for the period provided in such contracts. The State Soil and Water Conservation Committee shall be substituted for the district or commissioners as party to such contracts. The committee shall be entitled to all benefits and subject to all liabilities under such contracts and shall have the same right and liability to perform, to require performance, to sue and be sued thereon, and to modify or terminate such contracts by mutual consent or otherwise as the commissioners of the district would have had. Such dissolution shall not affect the lien of any judgment entered under the provisions of Section 69-27-41, nor the pendency of any action instituted under the provisions of such section, and the committee shall succeed to all the rights and obligations of the district or commissioners as to such liens and actions.
     </p>
     <p>
      The State Soil and Water Conservation Committee shall not entertain petition for the discontinuance of any district nor conduct referendums upon such petitions nor make determinations pursuant to such petitions in accordance with the provisions of this section, more often than once in one (1) year.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the event a majority of the landowners vote to dissolve a district the State Soil and Water Conservation Committee shall dissolve same.

      The university is hereby authorized, empowered and directed to formulate and submit to the Secretary of Agriculture, in conformity with the provisions of said Soil Conservation and Domestic Allotment Act, a state plan for each calendar year. It shall be the purpose of each such plan to promote such utilization of land and such farming practices as the university finds will tend, in conjunction with the operation of such other plans as may be approved for other states by the Secretary of Agriculture, to preserve and improve soil fertility, promote the economic use of land, diminish the exploitation and wasteful and unscientific use of natural soil resources, and reestablish and maintain the ratio between the purchasing power of the net income per person on farms and that of the income per person not on farms as defined in subsection (a) of Section 7 of said Soil Conservation and Domestic Allotment Act. Each such plan shall provide for adjustments in the utilization of land and in farming practices, through agreements with producers or through other voluntary methods, and for benefit payments in connection therewith, and also for such methods of administration not in conflict with any law of this state and such reports as the Secretary of Agriculture finds necessary for the effective administration of the plan and for ascertaining whether the plan is being carried out according to its terms.

      All contracts entered into hereunder between a county designated in Section 69-27-201 and an owner of land therein for the terracing and/or ditching thereof shall be in such legal form as may be approved by the attorney for the board of supervisors, and each such contract, before becoming effective, shall contain a legal description of the land, shall be signed in his own behalf by the owner of the land, and if the property contained in such description be a part of the homestead of such owner, by the husband or wife, as the case may be, before at least two witnesses, and properly proved for recording, or acknowledged before some officer authorized to accept acknowledgments, shall be approved in writing by the secretary of the soil erosion committee, and shall be accepted by the board of supervisors, by order upon its minutes setting forth the date of the contract and the name of the landowner. Any number of such contracts may be accepted in one order, but no such contract shall be accepted unless all taxes theretofore becoming due and payable on the land therein described have been paid. Upon the acceptance of such contract or contracts, the clerk of the board of supervisors, acting in his official capacity as chancery clerk, shall note upon the lis pendens record the name of such landowner, together with a description of the land contained in such contract, which listing shall be notice to any subsequent purchaser or incumbrancer. Any subsequent transaction concerning such land shall be by reason of such listing and such notice subject to any and all assessments which may thereafter be made by virtue of such contract. All such contracts so accepted shall remain binding upon the signers thereof unless cancelled by an order of the board of supervisors, either of its own motion or by mutual agreement with the then owner of the land. The county shall not be liable for damages or otherwise because of its cancellation of any such contract, or its failure to perform the same; and the owner of the land shall not be required to make any payment under such contract unless and until the work to be done thereunder has been completed. The amount to be paid by the owner of the land for the work to be done under any such contract may at his option be paid in one payment on or before the 1st day of February following the completion thereof, or in not more than four equal annual payments, the first payment to be due on the first day of February following completion of the work, and one on the first day of February in each year thereafter until all are paid, with six per cent (6%) interest from the maturity date of the first payment; but such option shall be exercised in advance, and the terms of payment stated in the contract. All payments under such contracts shall be made to the tax collector of the county, for the benefit of a soil erosion fund or funds, to be collected, accounted for, paid in, and commissions charged thereon by the tax collector, as in case of other taxes collected for the county, except that sales of land for default in such payments shall be as herein provided.

      The board of supervisors of a county as designated in Section 69-27-201 may, on the recommendation of the soil erosion committee, or shall, if so required by the election hereinafter provided for, advertise for bids as in other cases and purchase the proper terracing and/or ditching machinery, either for the county as a whole or for any one or more supervisors districts thereof as a soil erosion district, and provide the necessary labor for the operation thereof, and the necessary supplies and maintenance to properly operate the same, subject, however, to the approval of the soil erosion committee herein otherwise provided.

Such advertisement for bids shall constitute notice to the public of the intention of the board to make such purchase and the board may proceed accordingly unless on or before the first day of the meeting at which said bids are to be opened a petition, signed by twenty percent (20%) or more of the qualified electors of the county, exclusive of those who pay poll tax only, or if the soil erosion district is composed of one or more supervisors districts then of twenty percent (20%) or more of such soil erosion district, shall be filed with the clerk of the board protesting against such purchase, in which event such purchase shall not be made unless approved in an election called and held for the purpose in the manner provided for the calling and holding of elections on the question of the issuance of tax anticipation note or notes. Said board shall have full supervision of all soil erosion work, the machinery, labor, supplies, contracts, and the funds arising from work performed, from taxation, if any, or otherwise, except to the extent herein otherwise specifically provided; and in administering the soil erosion fund the board shall take into consideration the repairs and replacements incident to the operation of the character of machinery in use in order that the work may continue without undue interruption as long as may be necessary. In event machinery be purchased hereunder for soil erosion districts composed of one or more supervisors districts, but less than the whole county, then the soil erosion fund shall be administered in one or more subdivisions as may be necessary, so as to keep separate the operations of the several soil erosion districts of the county, and the taxes levied, if any, shall likewise be levied upon said separate soil erosion districts, in the same manner as for separate road districts; and for these purposes such separate soil erosion districts may be designated by name or number, to be declared by the board. All acts and proceedings of the board with respect to soil erosion work and the funds thereof shall be by order upon its minutes, as in other cases. Contracts for terracing and/or ditching shall be performed as nearly as possible in the order of their dates, any deviation therefrom by reason of necessity, public convenience, causes beyond the control of the committee, or agreement with the landowners, to be under the direction of the soil erosion committee. Only one (1) committee shall be appointed in said county, regardless of the number of soil erosion districts in operation therein.

By its order purchasing such machinery the board may provide for the payment of interest at a rate of not more than six per cent (6%) per annum upon the deferred payments evidenced by said certificates, in which event said certificates shall show upon their face that fact, and shall be payable with interest accordingly; and said certificates shall also show upon their face the date when and the purpose for which issued, the principal amount of the certificate, the aggregate amount of the certificates issued for that particular purchase, the date when payable, and whether payable from the soil erosion fund of the whole county or of some named or numbered soil erosion district thereof; and all such certificates shall be signed by the president of the board, shall be countersigned by the clerk thereof, shall have the seal of the county impressed thereon, and shall be registered by the clerk when issued as is required in the case of bonds, and may be validated as such. The board shall also make appropriate provision, by budget and tax levy as in other cases, to so govern and supplement the soil erosion fund arising from performance of contracts for landowners, as to make prompt payments of all bills for labor, fuel, oil, supplies, repairs and other necessary cost and expenses incident to the operation of said machinery, the performance of said contracts, and the carrying out of the provisions hereof, and prompt payment of the certificates of indebtedness issued for the purchase of machinery, with interest, if any, as and when due. The board may also borrow money for the county in anticipation of taxes and the special assessments herein provided for, for the payment of current operating expenses of soil erosion work, as in case of other current operating expenses, the same to be paid out of the soil erosion fund, supplemented if necessary by a special tax as in other cases. Money so borrowed, as well as the certificates of indebtedness issued for the purchase of machinery, shall be a liability of the county until paid.

The assessor shall, at the next meeting of the board beginning more than ten days after such notice, file with the board of supervisors, in duplicate, on appropriate forms, keeping a copy thereof on file in his own office, an assessment of the land for a special improvement tax thereon equal to the amount fixed by the committee, and payable as provided by the contract. It shall be the duty of the board of supervisors at said meeting to hear any objections to such assessment, by the landowner or the holder of any lien thereon, and to determine the amount of the assessment, not to exceed the amount fixed by the committee, and to approve the assessment as finally determined. The clerk of the board shall forthwith certify such assessment to the tax collector of the county upon the duplicate of the assessment filed by the assessor. In event such assessment be not returned to or acted upon by the board at the first meeting for any reason, it may be returned, considered and acted upon at any subsequent meeting. When approved, such assessment shall be a lien upon the land subordinate only to the lien of other taxes, prior and subsequent, and no delay or irregularity in the giving of notices, the making of the assessment, the hearing and approval thereof, or the certification thereof to the tax collector, shall affect the validity of the assessment if the work was actually done upon the land and the amount of the assessment does not exceed the contract price. Appeals may be taken to the circuit court of the county as in other cases of assessments for taxation, by the landowner or the holder of any lien upon the land. Nothing herein contained shall prevent any landowner from making payment to the tax collector of the estimated amount to become due under his contract, or any part thereof, in advance of the time the same becomes due, and the tax collector shall receive any payment so tendered, and give the landowner credit therefor against the assessment when made.

      Such bonds may be executed and delivered by the state at any time and from time to time, may be in such form and denominations and of such terms and maturities, may be in fully registered form or in bearer form registrable either as to principal or interest or both, may bear such conversion privileges and be payable in such installments and at such time or times not exceeding twenty (20) years from the date thereof, may be payable at such place or places, whether within or without the State of Mississippi, may bear interest payable at such time or times and at such place or places and evidenced in such manner, and may contain such provisions not inconsistent herewith, all as shall be provided in the proceedings of the State Bond Commission under which the bonds are authorized to be issued. Such bonds shall not bear a greater overall maximum interest rate to maturity than that authorized by law for general obligation bonds. If deemed advisable by the State Bond Commission, there may be retained in the proceedings under which any such bonds are authorized to be issued an option to redeem all or any part thereof as may be specified in such proceedings, at such price or prices and after such notice or notices and on such terms and conditions as may be set forth in such proceedings and briefly recited or referred to on the face of the bonds, but nothing herein contained shall be construed to confer on the state any right or option to redeem any bonds, except as may be provided in the proceedings under which they shall be issued. Any such bonds shall be sold on sealed bids at public sale, and for such price as the State Bond Commission determines to be in the best interest of the State of Mississippi, but no such sale shall be made at a price less than par value plus accrued interest to date of delivery of the bonds to the purchaser. The state may pay all expenses, premiums and commissions which the State Bond Commission may deem necessary or advantageous in connection with the issuance thereof, but solely from the proceeds of the bonds. The issuance by the state of one or more series of bonds shall not preclude it from issuing other series of bonds, but the proceedings under which any subsequent bonds may be issued shall recognize and protect any prior pledge made for any prior issuance of bonds.

     <p>
      It is the intent and purpose of the Legislature to encourage the conservation, protection and responsible utilization of lands that are managed for purposes of agricultural production. It is recognized that such lands are finite, fragile and valuable resources that contribute economically and socially to the well-being of the State of Mississippi. It is also recognized that these lands are subject to change and conversion from agricultural production as a result of urban expansion, transportation projects, water impoundments, utility expansion and similar land development measures. It is the policy of the Legislature to provide a process for the recognition of lands dedicated to agricultural production and to assure an accurate understanding of the impacts of public policy decisions that might otherwise alter the capability of those lands to remain in agricultural production.

       § 69-28-5.
    Qualifications for designation as agricultural district.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      To qualify for designation as an agricultural district, a district shall initially contain at least fifty (50) contiguous acres and may include any number of individual property ownerships; however, no single ownership shall contain less than fifteen (15) acres.
     </p>
     <p>
      Agricultural districts shall include only ownerships engaged in agricultural production.
     </p>
     <p>
      Before designation of an agricultural district, landowners must submit a petition to the local soil and water conservation district commissioners requesting designation of an agricultural district. The petition shall include the following information:
     </p>
     <p>
      A general description of the proposed agricultural district including total number of ownerships, total acreage, land use information, social and economic information about the respective area of the county and potential impacts on development of agricultural production;
     </p>
     <p>
      Location of the proposed agricultural district boundary on a standard United States Geological Survey Quadrangle map (1:2000 scale);
     </p>
     <p>
      Location of the proposed agricultural district boundary on the local county tax assessor map including location and identification of each ownership within the agricultural district as well as identification of all ownerships adjacent to the agricultural district;
     </p>
     <p>
      A description of the type and extent of agricultural production activity for each ownership within the proposed agricultural district;
     </p>
     <p>
      Other pertinent information as the local soil and water conservation district commissioners may require to evaluate the petition.
     </p>
     <p>
      Individual ownership participation in an agricultural district is entirely voluntary, and no land shall be included in the agricultural district without the consent of the owner.
     </p>
     <p>
      Upon receipt of a petition the local soil and water conservation district commissioners shall notify the county board of supervisors and/or any local or regional planning or zoning body that may apply by sending a copy of the petition to such body.
     </p>
     <p>
      In evaluating a petition for the establishment of an agricultural district the local soil and water conservation district commissioners shall consider the following:
     </p>
     <p>
      The capability of the land to support continued agricultural production as indicated by soil conditions, climate, topography and other natural conditions;
     </p>
     <p>
      The ability of the local, regional, state and international markets to support continued agricultural production; and
     </p>

     </h3>
     <p>
      Upon review of a petition, the local soil and water conservation district commissioners may approve designation of an agricultural district. A designated agricultural district shall be established for a period of five (5) years and reviewed for redesignation every five (5) years thereafter. However, the soil and water conservation district may review the status of designation at any time upon the written request and justification of the respective county board of supervisors, city board of aldermen, city council, city selectmen, city commissioners, city manager or mayor or upon a decision of the district commissioners that such a review is appropriate. The soil and water conservation district commissioners may sustain or repeal designation of an agricultural district based upon the following:
     </p>
     <p>
      The continued viability of the agricultural district. An agricultural district may become reduced in acreage based upon the voluntary withdrawal of any of the ownerships. However, the agricultural district shall cease to exist if the total acreage drops below twenty (20) acres;
     </p>
     <p>
      The impacts and consequences of proposed land development; and
     </p>
     <p>
      Other factors that the district commissioners may find relevant.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any ownership, or any successor heir of the ownership, within an agricultural district may withdraw from the agricultural district upon notifying the local soil and water conservation district in writing.
     </p>
     <p>
      Landowners may submit or resubmit petitions for designation or redesignation at any time to the local soil and water conservation district.
     </p>
     <p>
      If a petition is rejected or the local soil and water conservation district commissioners repeal designation of an agricultural district, the ownerships within the agricultural district may appeal the decision of the district commissioners to the State Soil and Water Conservation Commission. Based upon a review of all relevant information and following a public hearing, the State Soil and Water Conservation Commission may either sustain or overturn the decision of the local soil and water conservation district.

     </p>
     <p>
      The local soil and water conservation district with assistance of the State Soil and Water Conservation Commission shall provide appropriate notification about establishment of the agricultural district to local and state government agencies, local media and other communication networks. The soil and water conservation district shall also issue appropriate certificates of recognition to the respective ownerships within the agricultural district.
     </p>
     <p>
      The local soil and water conservation district, in cooperation with the local road manager, or his counterpart, as well as the Mississippi Department of Transportation, may erect signs as may be appropriate to recognize a designated agricultural district.

      <li id="t69c29s69-29-105ol11">
       Any cattle or other livestock owner, who uses or desires to use and adopt a brand or mark to identify his livestock must register his brand or mark by making application for such registration to the Department of Agriculture and Commerce. Not only all livestock owners who have their cattle branded before this law goes into effect must apply for registration, but also those persons who desire to brand or mark their livestock for the first time must apply for registration, and submit their proposed brand or mark to the department for clearing before it is applied. The application shall be made on forms prescribed and furnished by the department, which application shall be accompanied by a fee of Five Dollars ($5.00) and a facsimile of the brand or mark or proposed brand or mark to be registered shall also be furnished by the applicant. All fees collected hereunder for registration, transfer, or reregistration of brands or marks shall be deposited in the State Treasury. If the brand or mark described in the application has not previously been registered by another cattle owner, or does not closely resemble a registered brand or mark, the department shall approve the application, register the brand or mark in the name of the applicant, and issue to the applicant a certificate of registration. In case of duplication of brands or marks as shown by applications, the owner of the brand or mark who first records with the department will be recognized. When a livestock owner, who has registered a brand or mark with the department, transfers such brand or mark to another person, he shall immediately notify the department of the transfer, giving the date of transfer, and the name and address of the transferee. Upon receipt of the notice and a transfer fee of Two Dollars ($2.00), the department shall cause such transfer to be noted in the register of brands and marks, and such brand or mark shall not be used by the new owner until permission has been given by the department for the use of such brand or mark.

       No two (2) or more brands or marks of the same design or figure, and no two (2) or more earmarks of the same kind shall be adopted, designed and recorded, and when a brand, mark or earmark shall have been designed, adopted and recorded, the person so adopting and recording same shall be entitled to the exclusive use thereof, and it shall be his exclusive property, but the right to the use of such brand or mark may be sold and transferred by an instrument in writing, signed, acknowledged and recorded in the chancery clerk’s office of the county where the brand, mark or earmark is recorded. When the right to the use of a brand, mark or earmark has been sold and transferred and recorded as herein provided, the chancery clerk shall note on the “brand, mark and earmark book” that such brand, mark or earmark has been sold and transferred, giving the book and page where such transfer is recorded.

       Any person who shall violate any of the provisions of subsection (2) of this section shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction therefor, shall be punished by a fine of not less than One Hundred Dollars ($100.00) nor more than Five Hundred Dollars ($500.00), and by imprisonment in the county jail not less than thirty (30) days nor more than six (6) months.

       An instruction that every dealer in cattle is required when selling cattle to give to the buyer a bill of sale, having the signature and the address of the buyer and the date of sale and delivery, was properly refused, because this instruction adds nothing to the information of the jury relevant to the issue of the guilt vel non of the defendant. Lucas v. State, 211 Miss. 339, 51 So. 2d 583, 1951 Miss. LEXIS 361 (Miss. 1951).

      <p>
       The action of sheriff who after spying a cow in truck on highway one quarter of a mile ahead, overtook the truck, asked defendant occupants if they had a bill of sale to cattle therein, and upon receiving negative answer and unsatisfactory explanation as to identification of alleged seller and the presence of cattle, took the defendants into custody, did not constitute an unlawful search and seizure. Huggins v. State, 209 Miss. 552, 47 So. 2d 852, 1950 Miss. LEXIS 413 (Miss. 1950).

      <p>
       In prosecution for grand larceny of cattle, testimony of witness accompanying sheriff on patrolling expedition investigating cattle theft that the sheriff asked the defendants about a bill of sale of other cattle not covered by previous examination of witness was not prejudicial where court admonished the jury to disregard the question, and where the cross-examination of defendants disclosed the facts of other similar thefts in same neighborhood, including theft of cattle belonging to witnesses, and the failure of defendants to exhibit bill of sale.

     <p>
      All brands or marks of cattle and other livestock, upon being registered with the department shall be reregistered once every five (5) years thereafter. Those brands or marks which have been filed and recorded in the Office of the Secretary of State after January 1, 1946, give the owner priority to the use of such brand or mark, and in event of duplication, the brand or mark first filed with the Secretary of State shall have priority over any same or similar brand or mark filed with the Secretary of State thereafter.
     </p>
     <p>
      After the effective date of this article it shall be necessary for all such owners of brands or marks who have filed and recorded brands or marks in the Office of the Secretary of State after January 1, 1946, to reregister any and all such brands or marks with the department, and pay the necessary registration fee. Brands or marks recorded in the Office of the Secretary of State before January 1, 1946, are not recognized for the purpose of priority, because of the confused state of the records. After the registration of such brands or marks with the department, they must be reregistered not later than five (5) years thereafter, or ownership thereto will be lost.
     </p>
     <p>
      All brands or marks registered after the effective date of this article shall be reregistered on or before five (5) years after the date of registration. Upon the transfer of any such brand or mark, notice of such transfer shall be furnished the department by the transferor, and the department shall keep a record of all such transfers.
     </p>
     <p>
      At least ninety (90) days before the renewal date for all brands or marks, the department shall notify all persons having brands or marks registered of the date on which such brand or mark must be renewed. On or before the renewal date of all brands or marks the registered owner thereof shall pay to the department a renewal fee of Five Dollars ($5.00) and shall furnish such additional information as the department may require on forms to be furnished by the department. If any cattle owner fails to renew any brand or mark registered in his name, such brand or mark shall be forfeited and shall be available to any other applicant.

Copies of the register of brands and marks may be furnished to other persons requesting such copies, at a price to be determined by the department. Copies of the register of brands and marks shall be published in booklet form.

     <p>
      For the purpose of encouraging the production of more and better livestock and poultry in this state, and for the purpose of preventing theft of livestock and poultry by posting cash rewards for the arrest and conviction of livestock and poultry thieves, and requesting the Governor to aid by posting rewards and employing detectives for this purpose, all owners of livestock and poultry and land owners in any county are hereby authorized and encouraged to organize a county livestock and poultry owners protective association, hereinafter referred to as the association. All persons owning land in the county and all persons owning any livestock or poultry in the county are eligible to membership in the association. They shall organize by meeting at the county courthouse, by electing a president of the association and a secretary, and a treasurer, who shall each agree to serve for one year, without pay, when their successors shall be elected. There shall be a board of directors, not to exceed three members from each beat in the county, elected at the same time and in the same manner as the other officers. No legal charter of incorporation shall be necessary. Each county association shall have authority to make and publish its own by-laws and fix the amount of annual dues. The association, being purely voluntary, may disband or continue to function, as the members shall determine. Any association already organized in any county shall be deemed to be lawfully organized for the purpose of this article.

     <p>
      When the theft of any livestock or poultry shall be reported to the sheriff of the county where the theft occurred, it shall be the duty of the sheriff to make prompt and diligent effort to arrest the thief or thieves. At the same time, it shall be the duty of the president of the association to assist the sheriff in the capture of the thief or thieves by posting or publishing the standing reward offered by the association for information leading to arrest and conviction of the said thief or thieves, but in case of a theft of poultry no such reward shall be offered by the association where the value of the poultry stolen would amount to a misdemeanor only. When additional assistance may be needed to bring those guilty of the theft of any livestock or poultry to justice, the president of the association, or in his absence or disability, three or more directors of the association may, in their discretion, notify the Governor and request his assistance. When the Governor shall receive such request it shall then be his duty to offer such reward as he may deem proper for arrest and conviction of the said thief or thieves, or for information leading to the arrest and conviction, but such reward shall not exceed Fifty Dollars ($50.00) in any particular case. In case it is impossible to break up livestock and poultry thefts without employment of detectives, then the Governor may, in his discretion, employ a reliable detective to assist the sheriff and the association in any county. The reward to be offered by the Governor and the expense of detectives shall be paid out of the Governor’s contingent fund.

     <p>
      The Southern Dairy Compact, the full text of which is hereinafter set forth and confirmed by the Mississippi Legislature, is hereby entered into on behalf of the State of Mississippi. The compact shall become effective when enacted into law by at least two (2) other states within the compact group of states and when the consent of Congress has been obtained. The full text of said compact is as follows:
     </p>
     <p>
      SOUTHERN DAIRY COMPACT
     </p>
     <p>
      ARTICLE I. STATEMENT OF PURPOSE, FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF POLICY
     </p>
     <p>
      § 1. Statement of purpose, findings and declaration of policy.
     </p>
     <p>
      The purpose of this compact is to recognize the interstate character of the southern dairy industry and the prerogative of the states under the United States Constitution to form an interstate commission for the southern region. The mission of the commission is to take such steps as are necessary to assure the continued viability of dairy farming in the south, and to assure consumers of an adequate, local supply of pure and wholesome milk.
     </p>
     <p>
      The participating states find and declare that the dairy industry is an essential agricultural activity of the South. Dairy farms, and associated suppliers, marketers, processors and retailers are an integral component of the region’s economy. Their ability to provide a stable, local supply of pure, wholesome milk is a matter of great importance to the health and welfare of the region.
     </p>
     <p>
      The participating states further find that dairy farms are essential and they are an integral part of the region’s rural communities. The farms preserve land for agricultural purposes and provide needed economic stimuli for rural communities.
     </p>
     <p>
      In establishing their constitutional regulatory authority over the region’s fluid milk market by this compact, the participating states declare their purpose that this compact neither displace the federal order system nor encourage the merging of federal orders. Specific provisions of the compact itself set forth this basic principle.
     </p>
     <p>
      Designed as a flexible mechanism able to adjust to changes in a regulated marketplace, the compact also contains a contingency provision should the federal order system be discontinued. In that event, the interstate commission is authorized to regulate the marketplace in replacement of the order system. This contingent authority does not anticipate such a change, however, and should not be so construed. It is only provided should developments in the market other than establishment of this compact result in continuance of the order system.
     </p>
     <p>
      By entering into this compact, the participating states affirm that their ability to regulate the price which southern dairy farmers receive for their product is essential to the public interest. Assurance of a fair and equitable price for dairy farmers ensures their ability to provide milk to the market and the vitality of the southern dairy industry, with all the associated benefits.
     </p>
     <p>
      Recent, dramatic price fluctuations with a pronounced downward trend threaten the viability and stability of the southern dairy region. Historically, individual state regulatory action had been an effective emergency remedy available to farmers confronting a distressed market. The federal order system, implemented by the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, establishes only minimum prices paid to producers for raw milk, without preempting the power of states to regulate milk prices above the minimum levels so established.
     </p>
     <p>
      In today’s regional dairy marketplace, cooperative rather than individual state action is needed to more effectively address the market disarray. Under our constitutional system, properly authorized states acting cooperative may exercise more power to regulate interstate commerce than they may assert individually without such authority. For this reason, the participating states invoke their authority to act in common agreement, with the consent of Congress, under the compact clause of the Constitution.
     </p>

This price shall be established either as a compact over-order price or by one or more commission marketing orders. Whenever such a price has been established by either type of regulation, the legal obligation to pay such price shall be determined solely by the terms and purpose of the regulation without regard to the situs of the transfer of title, possession or any other factors not related to the purposes of the regulation and this compact. Producer-handlers as defined in an applicable federal market order shall not be subject to a compact over-order price.

The provisions for compensatory payments may require payment of the difference between the Class I price required to be paid for such milk in the state of production by a federal milk marketing order or state dairy regulation and the Class I price established by the compact over-order price or commission marketing order.

     <p>
      The Legislature has determined that the boll weevil is a public nuisance, a pest and a menace to the cotton industry. The purpose of this chapter is:
     </p>
     <p>
      To provide procedures through which cotton growers in the State of Mississippi may manage boll weevil suppression, pre-eradication or eradication programs and boll weevil containment/maintenance programs;
     </p>
     <p>
      To provide for certification of the Mississippi Boll Weevil Management Corporation to cooperate with state and federal agencies in the administration of cost-sharing programs for suppression, pre-eradication, eradication or post-eradication of boll weevils in Mississippi; and
     </p>
     <p>
      To empower the Mississippi Department of Agriculture and Commerce to promulgate and enforce regulations in support of those programs. This chapter should be construed liberally to achieve these purposes.

      <p>

       The amount of any one assessment cannot exceed $40 per acre as provided in Section 69-37-17 for suppression, pre-eradication or eradication programs. However, it is up to regulations established by the Commissioner of Agriculture to determine for what period of time the assessment shall be levied, how it shall be levied and when it shall be paid. Foster, January 25, 1996, A.G. Op. #96-0037.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 69-37-17 appears to contemplate that individual cotton growers shall only be liable for assessments, penalties and fees as provided in the statute. The Certified Cotton Growers Organization could be liable for its debts. All employees and agents of the Organization who handle funds must be adequately bonded. Foster, January 25, 1996, A.G. Op. #96-0037.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under Section 69-37-17, the bureau may limit those eligible to vote to those who are actually growing cotton, i.e. farmers, and may limit the assessment to those eligible voters. Foster, January 25, 1996, A.G. Op. #96-0037.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under Section 69-37-17, assessment is made on a per acre basis. The same assessment for each acre cannot be payable twice; for example, by both the farmer and the landlord who owns the land and has a lien on the growing cotton. Foster, January 25, 1996, A.G. Op. #96-0037.
      </p>
      <p>
       Based on the Section 69-37-21 and 69-37-17(5), in order for the program to continue fifty percent of the voting cotton growers must vote and two-thirds of those voting must vote for continuing with the program. If less than fifty percent of the registered cotton growers in the affected area do not vote then the referendum would not pass and the program would not continue. Moody, February 16, 1996, A.G. Op. #96-0052.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any language that goes beyond the question to be voted upon or beyond the information required to be included by Section 69-37-17 should not appear on the ballot. Foster, February 22, 1996, A.G. Op. #96-0112.

       For statewide management when assessments are established by passage of a referendum, the commissioner shall have a lien for payment of the assessments, together with any penalties levied under this chapter, against all cotton grown by each cotton grower who grows cotton within the state. This lien shall be of equal dignity with liens for taxes in favor of the state and the commissioner is authorized to issue executions for the collection of the assessments and liens described in this section in like manner as executions are issued for ad valorem property taxes due the state.

However, any buyer of cotton shall take free of the lien if the buyer has not received written notice of the lien from the commissioner, or if he has paid for the cotton by a check in which the department is named as joint payee.

       Commercial cotton that is located in sites that cannot be treated adequately because of health, environmental or other concerns shall be deemed to be a public nuisance and shall be destroyed promptly.

        In those cases where commercial cotton is destroyed because of prevented treatment due to health or environmental concerns, the owner of the cotton shall be compensated for that portion of the crop that is destroyed. The per acre amount of the payments shall be based on a reasonable estimate of the value of the crop as determined by the commissioner in consultation with the corporation and the affected producer.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The bureau, with the concurrence of the corporation, is authorized to designate by regulation one or more areas of this state as “suppression zones,” “pre-eradication zones” or “eradication zones” where the specified boll weevil management programs will be undertaken. The bureau, with the concurrence of the corporation, is authorized to promulgate reasonable regulations regarding areas where cotton cannot be planted within a specified management zone when there is reason to believe that growing cotton in those areas will jeopardize the success of the program or present a hazard to public health or safety. The bureau, with the concurrence of the corporation, is authorized to issue regulations prohibiting the planting of noncommercial cotton in the management zones and requiring that all growers of commercial cotton in these zones participate in the specified boll weevil management program and share equitably in the cost. The costs shall be determined by available scientific data on the basis of the level of boll weevil infestation and the anticipated costs of the program in the various regions and shall be approved via referendum by cotton growers within the affected area under procedures set forth in this chapter. Notice of the prohibition and requirement shall be given by publication for one (1) day each week for three (3) successive weeks in a newspaper having general circulation in the affected area. The bureau, with the concurrence of the corporation, is authorized to set by regulation a reasonable schedule of penalty fees to be assessed when growers in designated “management zones” do not meet the requirements of regulations issued by the bureau with respect to reporting of acreage and participation in cost-sharing as prescribed by regulation. The penalty fees shall not exceed a charge of One Hundred Dollars ($100.00) per acre. The cotton grower charged with those penalties has the right to appeal this decision to the corporation.

      The commissioner, with the concurrence of the corporation, is authorized to destroy, or cause to be treated with pesticides, volunteer or other noncommercial cotton and to establish procedures for the purchase and destruction of commercial cotton in eradication zones when the commissioner deems the action necessary to effectuate the purposes of this chapter. No payment shall be made by the commissioner to the owner or lessee for the destruction or injury of any cotton that was planted in an eradication zone after publication of notice as provided in this chapter, or was otherwise handled in violation of this chapter or the regulations adopted under this chapter. However, the commissioner shall pay for losses resulting from the destruction of cotton that was planted in those zones before promulgation of the notice. Payments for those losses shall be funded by assessment fees paid by cotton growers and administered by the corporation.

    Exemptions from assessment penalties for financial hardship; payment plan.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The commissioner, with the consent of the corporation, is authorized to exempt from the assessment penalty requirements set forth in this chapter those cotton growers for whom paying the assessment penalties would impose an undue financial hardship, and the commissioner is authorized to establish, upon the recommendation of the corporation, a payment plan in those hardship cases. This exemption shall be implemented as follows:
     </p>
     <p>
      The commissioner, with the consent of the corporation, shall adopt rules and regulations defining the criteria to be used in determining financial hardship. However, no exemption shall be granted to any cotton grower who, after the amount of assessments and penalties otherwise due has been subtracted from his taxable net income, has a net income exceeding Fifteen Thousand Dollars ($15,000.00) for the year in which he seeks an exemption;
     </p>
     <p>
      Any cotton grower who claims an exemption shall apply on a form prescribed by the commissioner. A separate application shall be filed for each calendar year in which a cotton grower claims an exemption. Each application shall contain an explanation of the conditions to be met for approval. An oath shall be included on the form that upon completion shall be returned to the commissioner;
     </p>
     <p>
      The commissioner shall forward all completed exemption application forms to the corporation. The corporation shall determine from the information contained in the application forms whether or not the applicants qualify for a hardship exemption (exemption from penalty) and may recommend a payment plan to the commissioner; and
     </p>
     <p>
      The corporation shall notify the commissioner of its determination, which shall be binding upon the applicants. Upon receipt of the determination of the corporation, the commissioner shall promptly notify each affected cotton grower of that determination. If an exemption has been denied, assessments and penalties for the year in which the application was made shall become due at the time they would otherwise have become due had no application for exemption been filed or within thirty (30) days after the date of the commissioner’s notice of an adverse determination, whichever is later.

       After July 1, 2006, there is imposed and levied an assessment at the rate of One Cent (1¢) per bushel on all corn grown within the State of Mississippi, and the assessment shall be deducted by the purchaser from the amount paid the producer at the first point of sale, whether within or without the state. If a producer pledges corn grown by that producer as collateral for a loan issued by the Commodity Credit Corporation and if that producer forfeits the corn in lieu of loan repayment, the Commodity Credit Corporation shall, at the time of the loan settlement, collect the assessment from the producer.

       The Commissioner of Agriculture and Commerce is authorized to make cash payments to producers of ethanol, anhydrous alcohol, bio-diesel and wet alcohol located in the state. These payments shall apply only to ethanol, bio-diesel, anhydrous alcohol and wet alcohol fermented and produced at plants in the state. For purposes of this section, an entity that holds a controlling interest in more than one (1) ethanol or bio-diesel plant is considered a single producer. The amount of the payment for each producer’s annual production is:

         <p>
          The producer payments for anhydrous alcohol, bio-diesel and wet alcohol under this section may be paid to the original producer.

     </p>
     <p>
      “Agritourism activity” means any activity which allows members of the general public, for recreational, entertainment or educational purposes, to view or enjoy rural activities, including, but not limited to, farming activities, ranching activities or historic or cultural or natural attractions.
