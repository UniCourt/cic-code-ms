      </h4>
      <p>
       Courts cannot ingraft exceptions on the statute. Williams v. Lee, 130 Miss. 481, 94 So. 454, 1922 Miss. LEXIS 225 (Miss. 1922).
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
       Payment of debt having situs in Mississippi to foreign administrator is no defense against heirs. Richardson v. Neblett, 122 Miss. 723, 84 So. 695, 1920 Miss. LEXIS 472 (Miss. 1920).
      </p>
      <p>
       The effect of the statute is to abolish ancillary administrations in this state altogether. Carroll v. McPike, 53 Miss. 569, 1876 Miss. LEXIS 118 (Miss. 1876); Partee v. Kortrecht, 54 Miss. 66, 1876 Miss. LEXIS 12 (Miss. 1876).

        2. Application.
       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       Although the Uniform Commercial Code may govern whether a certificate of deposit passes to the estate or under a presumed joint tenancy, it does not determine who takes a certificate of deposit once it is in the estate. Matter of
   Zimmerman v. Corely, 519 So. 2d 430 (Miss. 1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       But where the owner of the debt so deals with it as to establish an intention to locate it here, or if the debt arose as an incident to a business conducted in this state, the statute applies. Jahier v. Rascoe, 62 Miss. 699, 1885 Miss. LEXIS 127 (Miss. 1885).
      </p>
      <p>
       The statute does not per se localize here all debts which are due by residents of this state to persons domiciled out of it. Speed v. Kelly, 59 Miss. 47, 1881 Miss. LEXIS 73 (Miss. 1881).
      </p>
      <p>
       The statute applies in cases of partial intestacy. Wilson v. Cox, 49 Miss. 538, 1873 Miss. LEXIS 142 (Miss. 1873).
      </p>
      <p>
       The statute applies only to the estates of intestates. The renunciation of a will by a widow will not make the statute applicable. Slaughter v. Garland, 40 Miss. 172, 1866 Miss. LEXIS 60 (Miss. 1866).

      </p>
      <p>
       Rent on land in Mississippi is a debt governed by its laws. Richardson v. Neblett, 122 Miss. 723, 84 So. 695, 1920 Miss. LEXIS 472 (Miss. 1920).
      </p>
      <p>
       Descent of the leasehold interest in school lands situated within the state, owned by testatrix domiciled outside of the state, is to be governed by the laws of the state, and of legacy of such interest lapses on the death of the legatee without children, though under the statute of the domicile of testatrix it would not lapse. Neblett v. Neblett, 112 Miss. 550, 73 So. 575, 1916 Miss. LEXIS 145 (Miss. 1916).
      </p>

      When any person shall die seized of any estate of inheritance in lands, tenements, and hereditaments not devised, the same shall descend to his or her children, and their descendants, in equal parts, the descendants of the deceased child or grandchild to take the share of the deceased parent in equal parts among them. When there shall not be a child or children of the intestate nor descendants of such children, then to the brothers and sisters and father and mother of the intestate and the descendants of such brothers and sisters in equal parts, the descendants of a sister or brother of the intestate to have in equal parts among them their deceased parent’s share. If there shall not be a child or children of the intestate, or descendants of such children, or brothers or sisters, or descendants of them, or father or mother, then such estate shall descend, in equal parts, to the grandparents and uncles and aunts, if any there be; otherwise, such estate shall descend in equal parts to the next of kin of the intestate in equal degree, computing by the rules of the civil law. There shall not be any representation among collaterals, except among the descendants of the brothers and sisters of the intestate.

       Brother clearly had standing to challenge the transfer of the family farm from their mother to a revocable trust on the basis of undue influence because he was one of his mother’s heirs at law; if the conveyance of the property from his mother to the trust was set aside, the brother presumptively stood to inherit a child’s share of the property.

       Question of whether party asserting interest in property, which had been inherited through Mississippi laws of descent and distribution, should be prohibited in equity from doing so was not appropriate matter for decision on motion for summary judgment, where heir at law did not intend to relinquish any inherited rights by signing final estate decree and signed for sole purpose of settling will contest between children and widow, where evidence existed that persons taking under estate decree also knew of and recognized interest of heir at law in property, and he took action to assert his interest in that property.

   The nephews and nieces of an intestate decedent, who were children of his whole-blood brothers, succeeded to his entire estate to the exclusion of his half-blood sister, under §§<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t91c01s91-1-5" target="_self">91-1-5</a></cite> and<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t91c01s91-1-3" target="_self">91-1-3</a></cite>, since his whole-blood brothers would have been his sole and only surviving legal heirs to the exclusion of his half-blood sister, and their children occupied the same position as their parents, by right of representation.

      </p>
      <p>
       Under the rule of the civil law, a first cousin, although of the half-blood, is nearer in degree of kindred to an intestate than a second cousin of the whole-blood. Mississippi State Highway Dep't v. Meador, 184 Miss. 381, 185 So. 816, 186 So. 642, 1939 Miss. LEXIS 47 (Miss. 1939).

      </p>
      <p>
       By the common law, the kindred of the half-blood could not inherit real property. The object of the statute was to change that rule. Those of the whole-blood are preferred to those of the half-blood; but if there be none of the whole-blood, then those of the half-blood inherit. Fatheree v. Fatheree, 1 Miss. 311, 1828 Miss.

       Where proponents of a will never denied that contestants were the natural grandchildren of the testator, and where, although there was no record of a divorce between the testator’s son, through whom the grandchildren sought to inherit, and his first wife, there was a ceremonial marriage between the son and his second wife, from which union the grandchildren were born, there was no impediment to their inheriting as lawful heirs-at-law of the testator’s son. Webster v. Kennebrew, 443 So. 2d 850, 1983 Miss. LEXIS 3056 (Miss. 1983).

      <p>
       This statute is applicable to illegitimates as well as to legitimates when determining blood relationship for the purpose of inheritance, and permits the rights of illegitimates inter sese to be determined on the same basis as if they were legitimate and some of them were related to the intestate as of the whole-blood and some of the half-blood.

       Where it appeared that the father of an intestate and the mothers of several groups of claimants to intestate’s property were all illegitimate children of the same mother, but that the mother of one group had the same father as the intestate’s father, the latter group was entitled to take the property to exclusion of the other groups of claimants, since, although children of an illegitimate, they were kindred of the whole-blood to the intestate, while the other groups, also being children of illegitimates, were kindred of the half-blood by reason of their mothers having a different father.

    Descent of property as between husband and wife.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      If a husband die intestate and do not leave children or descendants of children, his widow shall be entitled to his entire estate, real and personal, in fee simple, after payment of his debts; but where the deceased husband shall leave a child or children by that or a former marriage, or descendants of such child or children, his widow shall have a child’s part of his estate, in either case in fee simple. If a married woman die owning any real or personal estate not disposed of, it shall descend to her husband and her children or their descendants if she have any surviving her, either by a former husband or by the surviving husband, in equal parts, according to the rules of descent. If she have children and there also be descendants of other children who have died before the mother, the descendants shall inherit the share to which the parent would have been entitled if living, as coheirs with the surviving children. If she have no children or descendants of them, then the husband shall inherit all of her property.

       No right to property vests by virtue of the marriage relationship alone prior to entry of a judgment or decree granting equitable or other distribution pursuant to dissolution of the marriage; thus, the rights of alienation and the laws of descent and distribution are not affected by the recognition of marital assets.

   While this statute [Code 1972, §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t91c01s91-1-7" target="_self">91-1-7</a></cite>] controls the general descent of property as between husband and wife, the statute is not applicable to the descent of exempt property; Code 1972, §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t91c01s91-1-19" target="_self">91-1-19</a></cite> specifically controls the descent of exempt property.

      <p>
       In the absence of proof of a subsequent bigamous marriage which could work an estoppel, one spouse is not barred from inheriting from the other on account of his or her abandonment, desertion, nonsupport, or adultery, and evidence of a wife’s adulterous conduct did not preclude her from taking her deceased husband’s estate as his sole heir at law.

   One who enters into a ceremonial marriage with another without obtaining a divorce from a former spouse is estopped from asserting a right to inherit from such former spouse. Harrison v.

       The recording of a deed from the defendants’ predecessor’s widow to the complainants’ predecessor was the equivalent of actual knowledge by the defendant heirs that the complainants’ predecessor claimed adversely to them, where by its terms the deed purported to convey the entire interest, and the legal presumption that one cotenant holds property for the benefit of his cotenants as well as for himself was refuted and an ouster was affected. Hardy v. Lynch, 258 So. 2d 414, 1972 Miss. LEXIS 1495 (Miss. 1972).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a cotenant’s widow in possession claimed the property to the exclusion of the other cotenants for more than 10 years after the death of her husband, who had claimed the entirety of the property, and during such period the widow had received all benefits flowing from the land and had made all expenditures without accounting to anyone, there was the equivalent of an ouster of the other cotenants and she had clear full title by adverse possession, the fiduciary relationship usually presumed to exist between cotenants having no application here; since the circumstances surrounding the widow’s acquisition of title completely negated any such relation to the extent that it was the equivalent of an ouster of the other cotenants. Bayless v. Alexander, 245 So. 2d 17, 1971 Miss. LEXIS 1349 (Miss. 1971).

      <p>
       Where a husband and wife lived together for approximately 40 years, had no children, and where the husband predeceased the wife by approximately eight years, the wife became the owner of the property of her husband and had every right to devise it in any manner that she desired so long as the devise was not contrary to public policy, and the fact that her holographic will referred to a request of her husband, was no more than an explanation as to her reason for devising the property as she did, and was not an expression of the testamentary intent of the husband.

      <p>
       The Preamble to Chapter 339, Laws, 1983, provides as follows:
      </p>
      <p>
       “WHEREAS, The Mississippi Legislature passed an act amending
   Section 91-1-15, Mississippi Code of 1972, and other sections of said code pertaining to the rights and claims of illegitimates, during the 1981 Regular Session, said amendment being effective from and after July 1, 1981; and
      </p>
      <p>
       “WHEREAS, Section 91-1-15 was so amended to provide for intestate succession among an illegitimate and the natural father and his kindred with certain limitations, and to afford unto all illegitimates without classification a remedy whereby they could enforce their substantive rights and claims of intestate succession as provided for in said amendment; and
      </p>
      <p>
       “WHEREAS, the Legislature recognized that the decisions and statutes of this state existing prior to said amendment placed an insurmountable barrier to inheritance by illegitimates when compared to the rights of a legitimate person, and that said decisions and statutes effectively barred an unnecessarily large number of illegitimates from inheritance through their natural father as a result of certain classifications into which the illegitimate may be categorized in violation of equal protection under the law; and
      </p>
      <p>
       “WHEREAS, it now appears that there is confusion as to the legislative intent in amending
   Section 91-1-15, Mississippi Code of 1972, and said section is now interpreted by some segments of the judiciary to mean that the Legislature did not intend to create a new, separate and distinct remedy for the benefit of all illegitimates without any classification and said amendment as now codified in
   Section 91-1-15, Mississippi Code of 1972, is interpreted by some segments of the judiciary to be prospective only rather than retrospective and prospective in effect and is interpreted not to have created a new, separate and distinct remedy for the claims of all illegitimates without classification; and
      </p>
      <p>
       “WHEREAS, the Legislature recognized at the time it was considering said amendment, that by creating said remedy the Legislature was opening the door to the possible litigation of stale or fraudulent claims and that a further effect of bestowing said remedy upon all illegitimates would possibly be to create a certain amount of confusion and uncertainty as to the status of titles to real property; however, the Legislature intended to bestow upon illegitimates a new and additional remedy whereby such illegitimates could maintain their rights of inheritance notwithstanding such interests of the state in preventing stale and fraudulent claims and avoiding uncertainty as to the titles of real property and, accordingly, the Legislature enacted appropriate periods of limitations within which illegitimates could bring their claims;.
      </p>
      <p>
       “NOW, THEREFORE, in order to eliminate any ambiguity in
   Section 91-1-15, Mississippi Code of 1972, and to conform said section to express the true legislative intent,
      </p>
      <p>

   The administrator of an estate is required to provide actual notice to known or reasonably ascertainable legitimate children who are potential heirs and whose claims would be barred by the running of the 90-day period from the notice of publication to creditors under the nonclaim statute, §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t91c01s91-1-15ol13c" target="_self">91-1-15(3)(c)</a></cite>. To hold otherwise would encourage administrators and executors to benefit as heirs at law by setting in motion the shortest filing period which, unbeknownst to the potential heir, has significantly shortened the time for the potential heir to meet with the statutory requirements to inherit as an heir.

   A claimant’s timely filing, 3 days after the decedent’s death, of a sworn Petition for Letters of Administration in which he alleged that he was the son and sole surviving heir of the deceased, sufficiently complied with the provisions of §§<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t91c01s91-1-15" target="_self">91-1-15</a></cite>,<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t91c01s91-1-27" target="_self">91-1-27</a></cite> and<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t91c01s91-1-29" target="_self">91-1-29</a></cite> and therefore his claim of heirship was not barred by the statute of limitations of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t91c01s91-1-15" target="_self">91-1-15</a></cite>(3)(c). The fact that the claimant did not precisely state that he was the “illegitimate” or “born-out-of-wedlock” son, as opposed to simply declaring himself to be “the son,” was a matter of semantics which made no difference; the indication that he was the sole surviving heir was sufficiently clear.

   A Section of the Illinois Probate Act barring illegitimate children to inherit by intestate succession from their fathers violated the Equal Protection Clause, although not a “suspect classification”, a statutory classification based on illegitimacy must, at minimum, bear some rational relationship to a legitimate state purpose, in view of which the provision in question could not be justified on the ground that it promotes legitimate family relationships since a state may not attempt to influence the actions of men and women by imposing sanctions on children born of their relationships, nor do the difficulties of proving paternity in some situations justify the total statutory disinheritance of illegitimate children whose fathers die intestate. The fact that an illegitimate child’s father could have provided for her by making a will did not save the provision from invalidity. Finally, the provision could not stand validated on the theory that it represents the legislature’s attempt to mirror the intent of the state’s decedents. Trimble v. Gordon, <cite class="us_code">430 U.S. 762</cite>, <cite class="s_court">97 S. Ct. 1459</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">52 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 31, 1977 U.S. LEXIS 77 (U.S. 1977).

   A state’s intestate succession statutes which provide that an illegitimate child, acknowledged but not legitimated by the father, cannot claim the right of a legitimate child and may take the father’s property only to the exclusion of the state when the father has left no descendants, ascendants, collateral relatives, or surviving wife, while legitimate children have a right of forced heirship in the father’s estate, which statutes have the effect of barring an acknowledged illegitimate child from sharing in the father’s estate with surviving collateral relatives, are not violative of constitutional due process and equal protection provisions, such statutes having a rational basis in the state’s interest in promoting family life and in directing the disposition of property left within the state.

       Chancery court did not err in determining an illegitimate child was the natural daughter of a decedent who died intestate because there was evidence the putative father openly acknowledged and treated the child as his natural daughter, as exhibited by declarations the putative father made to others outside the family and by the fatherly conduct he bestowed on the child since the time she was a young girl; the weight to be given the DNA results, which were inconclusive as to paternity, was for the chancellor.

Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t91c01s91-1-15" target="_self">91-1-15</a></cite> and as such, the petition to be determined heirs of the decedent was barred by the time provision of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t91c01s91-1-15" target="_self">91-1-15</a></cite>; additionally, § 91-1-15 did not violate the Equal Protection Clause or the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution. Further, appellants were not deprived of either their procedural or substantive due process rights as Mississippi had a legitimate state interest in the legislation propounded in § 91-1-15, therefore, the statute did not violate any substantive due process rights; in addition, appellants had notice of the putative father’s death and would have been afforded a hearing for adjudication of paternity, however, they failed to make such a petition within the statutory limits of § 91-1-15.

Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t91c01s91-1-15" target="_self">91-1-15</a></cite>(3)(a), such that the minor can inherit from his natural father where the father has executed an acknowledgment of paternity; therefore, substantial evidence supported a finding that a decedent’s illegitimate minor son was his sole heir at law because, although the son’s mother did not institute paternity proceedings within the required time under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t91c01s91-1-15" target="_self">91-1-15</a></cite>, the father acknowledged paternity pursuant to Miss.

       Decedent’s administratrix’s failure to notify decedent’s illegitimate children of the administration of their father’s estate resulted in tolling of the 90-day statute. In re Estate of Thomas, 883 So. 2d 1173, 2004 Miss. LEXIS 1269 (Miss. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Illegitimate children’s claim that the administratrix’s failure to provide them with actual notice tolled the running of the one-year statute of limitations could not be supported and they were barred from recovery under the decedent’s estate. In re Estate of Thomas, 881 So. 2d 257, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 996 (Miss. Ct. App. 2003), rev'd, 883 So. 2d 1173, 2004 Miss. LEXIS 1269 (Miss. 2004).

       Claim for heirship was barred because the alleged illegitimate son filed the claim more than 18 years after the father’s death. Delaying out of respect for the widow did not excuse failing to take timely action to establish paternity. Mann v. Mann, 853 So. 2d 1217, 2003 Miss. LEXIS 412 (Miss. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       The plaintiff’s claim that she was the illegitimate child and sole heir of the decedent was barred by the statute where she failed to assert her claim until 14 years after the death of the decedent, notwithstanding her assertion that she was too young at the time of his death and that she did not know any better than to wait to stake any claim she might have had until after the death of his alleged common law wife.

   The administratrix of an estate had sufficient actual knowledge of the potential right of heirship of a child to have required her, within a reasonable time after the child’s birth, to comply with the formalities of §§<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t91c01s91-1-27" target="_self">91-1-27</a></cite> and<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t91c01s91-1-29" target="_self">91-1-29</a></cite> by making the child a party to the administration proceeding; therefore, the administratrix was precluded from raising the 90 day time bar set out in subsection (3)(c) of this section.

   Evidence that both executrixes de son tort held themselves out as representatives of deceased musician’s estate and took actions to chill interest of copyright purchasers in locating musician’s rightful heirs waived three-year statutory bar to claim by musician’s alleged illegitimate son; executrixes de son tort breached duty to act for rightful heirs of musician, rather than for themselves.

       The failure of the illegitimate children of a decedent to assert any claim in the decedent’s estate until after the expiration of 90 days from the date of the first publication of notice to creditors did not bar their claim of heirship or wrongful action where the petition for letters of administration specifically named the illegitimate children as the natural children of the decedent and the administratrix failed to give them notice of the letters’ issuance.

       A minor seeking to be declared an heir of the decedent as an illegitimate daughter and to share in the estate should have been allowed to amend her complaint to allege that the widow and former executrix knew of the existence of the minor as an illegitimate child of the decedent, but fraudulently failed to so inform the court, notwithstanding that the minor’s petition was filed more than 90 days after the publication of notice to the creditors of the estate.

       Doctrine of unclean hands was inapplicable because a mother’s failure to give a father notice of a wrongful death acton did not amount to a willful act that transgressed equitable standards of conduct; the mother and the father were never married, the father consistently denied paternity of the deceased child, and the father failed to meet the statutory requirements to constitute a wrongful death beneficiary of the child.

   Father and his children failed to provide the Attorney General with notice of their constitutional challenge at the trial level because they first notified the Attorney General of their challenge to the constitutionality of the statute in their notice of appeal; thus, the father and children did not comply with the requirements of Miss.

   Deceased child’s biological father was not entitled to inherit from his daughter’s estate and to receive proceeds from a wrongful death suit because to permit the father to inherit from the decedent’s estate would result in a financial windfall to the father; the evidence supports a conclusion that the father refused or neglected to support the child under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t91c01s91-1-15ol13" target="_self">91-1-15(3)</a></cite> where the father failed to provide any financial support to the child’s mother before he went to prison the month before the child was born and instead permitted the mother to support him and where, although the father received money from friends and relatives while he was in prison, he failed to direct any of those funds to the care and support of his child.

       The father of an illegitimate child failed to establish his right to inherit from the child where he never met the child, failed to support the child, and failed to acknowledge the child as his own during the child’s lifetime, notwithstanding that he did not receive the results of a blood test that established his paternity until just four days before the child’s death.

       Where it appeared that the father of an intestate and the mothers of several groups of claimants to intestate’s property were all illegitimate children of the same mother, but that the mother of one group had the same father as the intestate’s father, the latter group was entitled to take the property to exclusion of the other groups of claimants, since, although children of an illegitimate, they were kindred of the whole-blood to the intestate, while the other groups, also being children of illegitimates, were kindred of the half-blood by reason of their mothers having a different father.

     <p>
      When any of the children of a person dying intestate, or their descendants, shall have received from such intestate, in his lifetime, any real or personal estate by way of advancement, and shall choose to come into the partition and distribution of the estate with the other parceners and distributees, such advancement, both of real and personal estate, shall be brought into hotchpot with the whole estate, real and personal, descended. Such party bringing such advancement into hotchpot shall thereupon be entitled to his or her proper portion of the whole estate descended, both real and personal; but such advancement shall be valued according to its value at the time said distributee received it.

       Inasmuch as this section [Code 1942 § 475] is applicable only in the case of a person dying intestate, where decedent died testate, conveyances of property to two children did not constitute an advancement. Mills v. Mills, 279 So. 2d 917, 1973 Miss. LEXIS 1495 (Miss. 1973).

       To constitute “advancement,” donor must irrevocably part with title, which must be vested in donee, in lifetime of donor; where no estate which can be alienated is given donee, no advancement is made. Greene v. Greene, 145 Miss. 87, 110 So. 218, 1926 Miss. LEXIS 2 (Miss. 1926).

       Mere gift of money to a son is not presumed an advancement, but money advanced to son to purchase real estate is presumed an advancement. Kemp v. Turman, 104 Miss. 501, 61 So. 548, 1913 Miss. LEXIS 56 (Miss. 1913).

    Descent of exempt property.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The property, real and personal, exempted by law from sale under execution or attachment shall, on the death of the husband or wife owning it, descend to the survivor of them and the children and grandchildren of the decedent, as tenants in common, grandchildren inheriting their deceased parent’s share; and if there be no children or grandchildren of the decedent, to the surviving wife or husband; and if there be no such survivor, to the children and grandchildren of the deceased owner. Where the surviving husband or wife shall own a place of residence equal in value to the homestead of the decedent, and the deceased husband or wife have no surviving children or grandchildren of the last marriage but have children or grandchildren of a former marriage, the homestead of such decedent shall not descend to the surviving husband or wife, but shall descend to the surviving children and grandchildren of the decedent by such former marriage, as other property.

   This statute [Code 1972, §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t91c01s91-1-19" target="_self">91-1-19</a></cite>] specifically controls the descent of exempt property, and those entitled thereto under the statute inherit the exempt property in fee simple free of decedent’s debts; only when the decedent leaves no surviving spouse or children or grandchildren does the exempt property become liable for the decedent’s debts under Code 1972, §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t91c01s91-1-21" target="_self">91-1-21</a></cite>. Weaver v. Blackburn, 294 So. 2d 786, 1974 Miss. LEXIS 1828 (Miss. 1974).

       Undivided interest in homestead descended to decedent’s wife and children. Jones v. Jones, 249 Miss. 322, 161 So. 2d 640, 1964 Miss. LEXIS 393 (Miss. 1964).
      </p>
      <p>
       A widow, children and grandchildren are tenants in common subject to the right by the widow to undisturbed possession of the exempt homestead. Bonds v. Bonds, 226 Miss. 348, 84 So. 2d 397, 1956 Miss. LEXIS 406 (Miss. 1956).
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that a widow was given a right under the statute to have the undisturbed possession of the exempt homestead following the death of the husband does not have the effect of destroying the tenancy in common, which arose in the property upon the death of the husband, merely because of the fact that the right of possession of the other heirs is postponed pending the widowhood of the wife. Bonds v. Bonds, 226 Miss. 348, 84 So. 2d 397, 1956 Miss. LEXIS 406 (Miss. 1956).
      </p>
      <p>
       Son, one of ten adult heirs of deceased father, who paid to his mother $400 which was owing to father on purchase of homestead, there being no administrator and no agent appointed by heirs authorized to receive payment, is not entitled to be credited with $250 paid to mother as allowance to widow, as widow had only a one-tenth interest in this $400, in suit in which heirs claimed balance due them on purchase price of land. Davis v. Davis, 205 Miss. 794, 39 So. 2d 486, 1949 Miss. LEXIS 465 (Miss. 1949).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section [Code 1942, § 476] lays down general rule that upon death of a husband or wife, his or her exempt property shall descend to the survivor and to the children of the owner as tenants in common, but the section concludes with an exception thereto. Reed v. Reed, 197 Miss. 261, 19 So. 2d 745, 1944 Miss. LEXIS 294 (Miss. 1944).
      </p>
      <p>
       A bill to establish widow’s right to possession and occupancy of the homestead of her deceased husband need not negative the exception contained in this section [Code 1942, § 476]. Reed v. Reed, 197 Miss. 261, 19 So. 2d 745, 1944 Miss. LEXIS 294 (Miss. 1944).
      </p>
      <p>
       The status of cotenancy is recognized in statutory provisions that a decedent’s widow shall share in the homestead property as a tenant in common with the children, and that there shall be no partition during her widowhood, or while she continues to occupy or use it, but the usual rights thereunder are made subordinate to the widow’s right of use and occupancy during her life. Bohn v. Bohn, 193 Miss. 122, 5 So. 2d 429, 1942 Miss. LEXIS 77 (Miss. 1942).
      </p>
      <p>
       In line with the purpose of and under the statutory provisions that a decedent’s widow shall share in the homestead property as a tenant in common with the children, and that there shall be no partition during her widowhood, or while she continues to occupy or use it, the immunity from partition, being personal to the widow, is not extended to her grandniece. Bohn v. Bohn, 193 Miss. 122, 5 So. 2d 429, 1942 Miss. LEXIS 77 (Miss. 1942).
      </p>
      <p>
       The right of the widow has the attributes and incidents of a life estate, and the other heirs are vested with a future estate which takes effect in possession at the termination of the preceding estate or interest. Bohn v. Bohn, 193 Miss. 122, 5 So. 2d 429, 1942 Miss. LEXIS 77 (Miss. 1942).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where deceased share tenant left nothing except exempt property, administration was unnecessary; hence widow and children having unsuccessfully demanded tenant’s share from landlord could recover in replevin. Williams v. Sykes, 170 Miss. 88, 154 So. 267, 154 So. 727, 1934 Miss. LEXIS 100 (Miss. 1934).

       Complainant in partition suit, claiming interest as tenant in common through ancestor, was not required to prove that ancestor died intestate. Smith v. Stanley, 159 Miss. 720, 132 So. 452, 1931 Miss. LEXIS 68 (Miss. 1931).
      </p>
      <p>
       Exempt property, real or personal, left by a deceased husband descends to his widow and children as tenants in common, the grandchildren taking per stirpes the share of deceased children, but the widow has the right to occupy and use the same free from liability for rent or hire and from partition during her widowhood. Martin v. Martin, 84 Miss. 553, 36 So. 523, 1904 Miss. LEXIS 56 (Miss. 1904).
      </p>
      <p>
       If the widow renounces the will disposing of exempt property, she is only entitled to share in the estate generally and is not entitled to the specific exempt property so disposed of. Nash v. Young, 31 Miss. 134, 1856 Miss. LEXIS 48 (Miss. 1856).
      </p>

      <p>
       Executrix did not waive the homestead exemption by entering into a contractual relationship with the Mississippi Division of Medicaid on behalf of a decedent because the record did not support the idea that the decedent had any knowledge of the benefits a homestead exemption provided, nor that he intentionally waived his right to the benefit of that exemption since the contract did not provide any information pertaining to, or even mention, the significance of any exemption; there was no evidence of the decedent’s intent to waive any of his rights because by entering into the contract, the decedent merely acknowledged Medicaid as a creditor of his estate, which estate had no property against which Medicaid could recover. State v. Stinson (In re Estate of Darby), 68 So.3d 702, 2011 Miss. App. LEXIS 96 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 69 So.3d 767, 2011 Miss. LEXIS 419 (Miss. 2011).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Trial court did not err in granting an executrix summary judgment and in determining that the claim of the Mississippi Division of Medicaid was not valid against a decedent’s property because the decedent predeceased his children and a grandchild to whom he devised all of his property, and pursuant to the unambiguous language of Miss. Code Ann. §§<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.85.html#t85c03s85-3-21" target="_blank">85-3-21</a></cite>,<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t91c01s91-1-19" target="_self">91-1-19</a></cite>, and<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t91c01s91-1-21" target="_self">91-1-21</a></cite>, coupled with case law, the homestead, with its exemption, passed from the decedent to his children and grandchildren free of his debts; thus, Medicaid was not entitled to pursue a claim against the exempted property as it was not a part of the estate. State v. Stinson (In re Estate of Darby), 68 So.3d 702, 2011 Miss. App. LEXIS 96 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 69 So.3d 767, 2011 Miss. LEXIS 419 (Miss. 2011).

       Executrix did not waive the homestead exemption by entering into a contractual relationship with the Mississippi Division of Medicaid on behalf of a decedent because the record did not support the idea that the decedent had any knowledge of the benefits a homestead exemption provided, nor that he intentionally waived his right to the benefit of that exemption since the contract did not provide any information pertaining to, or even mention, the significance of any exemption; there was no evidence of the decedent’s intent to waive any of his rights because by entering into the contract, the decedent merely acknowledged Medicaid as a creditor of his estate, which estate had no property against which Medicaid could recover. State v. Stinson (In re Estate of Darby), 68 So.3d 702, 2011 Miss. App. LEXIS 96 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 69 So.3d 767, 2011 Miss. LEXIS 419 (Miss. 2011).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Trial court did not err in granting an executrix summary judgment and in determining that the claim of the Mississippi Division of Medicaid was not valid against a decedent’s property because the decedent predeceased his children and a grandchild to whom he devised all of his property, and pursuant to the unambiguous language of Miss. Code Ann. §§<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.85.html#t85c03s85-3-21" target="_blank">85-3-21</a></cite>,<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t91c01s91-1-19" target="_self">91-1-19</a></cite>, and<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t91c01s91-1-21" target="_self">91-1-21</a></cite>, coupled with case law, the homestead, with its exemption, passed from the decedent to his children and grandchildren free of his debts; thus, Medicaid was not entitled to pursue a claim against the exempted property as it was not a part of the estate. State v. Stinson (In re Estate of Darby), 68 So.3d 702, 2011 Miss. App. LEXIS 96 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 69 So.3d 767, 2011 Miss. LEXIS 419 (Miss. 2011).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Where a decedent died leaving no surviving spouse, child or grandchild, the homestead exemption expired with her death and was not valid as against unpaid claims against her estate, even though the decedent left a will devising her previously exempt homestead property to her ex-husband; the specific language of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t91c01s91-1-21" target="_self">91-1-21</a></cite> does not continue a decedent’s homestead exemption for anyone other than a surviving spouse, children or grandchildren, and consequently there was no exemptionist who could defeat the claim against the estate’s homestead property. Memorial Hosp. v. Franzke (In re Estate of Franzke), 634 So. 2d 117, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 132 (Miss. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       The general rule imposing liability for the debts of the decedent upon his exempt property in the absence of wife or children, is laid down in this section [Code 1942, § 477], but there are exceptions of limitations placed thereon in cases where the proceeds of life insurance policy, in one case, are made payable to beneficiary, and in the other, made to inure to the heirs of legatees of the decedent. Coates v. Worthy, 72 Miss. 575, 17 So. 606, 1895 Miss. LEXIS 24 (Miss. 1895).

       Judgment creditor of husband and wife who together owned property as tenants by the entirety could levy execution and sell that portion of homestead property which exceeded value of statutory homestead exemption which had vested in wife following husband’s death; this section was not applicable to debt for which surviving spouse was jointly and severally liable. In re Osborne, 120 B.R. 64, 1990 Bankr. LEXIS 2184 (Bankr. N.D. Miss. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       A surviving spouse’s statutory right to occupy a homestead prevails where, by will, the owner devises it to another without share to the spouse; the surviving spouse need not renounce the will of the deceased owner in order to benefit from the statutory homestead right. Rush v. Rush, 360 So. 2d 1240, 1978 Miss. LEXIS 2341 (Miss. 1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section would not apply to defeat the former wife’s partition action of a home to which she had been given exclusive right of possession under the decree of divorce, where neither the former wife nor former husband were deceased. Blackmon v. Blackmon, 350 So. 2d 44, 1977 Miss. LEXIS 2207 (Miss. 1977).
      </p>
      <p>
       Exempt homestead which descended to decedent’s wife and children was not subject to partition during the widowhood of the surviving wife, provided she remained a widow and qualified under the exemption statute. Jones v. Jones, 249 Miss. 322, 161 So. 2d 640, 1964 Miss. LEXIS 393 (Miss. 1964).
      </p>
      <p>
       A husband in possession of realty which he and his wife held as cotenants, may, so long as he remains a widower, resist partition sought by one to whom the wife devised her interest. Biggs v. Roberts, 237 Miss. 406, 115 So. 2d 151, 1959 Miss. LEXIS 485 (Miss. 1959).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a widow of a landowner, who had died intestate leaving also a son and daughter, neither waived nor attempted to dispose of her homestead rights by a deed conveying her one third interest to her son reserving to herself a life estate in all the lands, a grantee of one half interest of the tract of land from the son, to whom the daughter had also conveyed her one third interest therein, was not entitled to have the exempt property partitioned over the widow’s objection. Gresham v. Clark, 231 Miss. 206, 95 So. 2d 234, 1957 Miss. LEXIS 506 (Miss. 1957).
      </p>
      <p>
       The property of an intestate was not subject to partition or sale for partition during the widowhood, as long as it was occupied by her, unless she consented. La Blanc v. Busby, 223 Miss. 415, 78 So. 2d 456, 1955 Miss. LEXIS 397 (Miss. 1955).
      </p>
      <p>
       Under provision widow has the right to retain the homestead as it was during her husband’s lifetime, and this is true even though he also left children surviving. Bohn v. Bohn, 193 Miss. 122, 5 So. 2d 429, 1942 Miss. LEXIS 77 (Miss. 1942).
      </p>

       Children cannot have partition of exempt property occupied or used by widow. Stevens v. Wilbourn, 88 Miss. 514, 41 So. 66, 1906 Miss. LEXIS 167 (Miss. 1906).
      </p>
      <p>
       Exempt property, real or personal, left by a deceased husband descends to his widow and children as tenants in common, the grandchildren taking per stirpes the share of the deceased children, but the widow has the right to occupy and use the same freed from liability for rent or hire and from partition during her widowhood.

       Where property is subject to partition during the lives of cotenants-husbands, the right to partition is not enjoined by the deaths of the cotenants-husbands and the survival of their wives; however, the widows should retain their houses as improvements on the land, if possible, or, in the alternative, if it is not feasible to partition the land to allow the widows to receive their respective houses as improvements, then an accounting should be had as to such improvements. Carter v. Brewton, 396 So. 2d 617, 1981 Miss. LEXIS 2055 (Miss. 1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the husband of the defendant in a partition action had never established the property in question as his homestead, his widow had no homestead interest in the land which would prevent its partition. Mathis v. Quick, 271 So. 2d 924, 1973 Miss. LEXIS 1527 (Miss. 1973).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section [Code 1942, § 478] applies only to the property of the decedent owned at the time of his death, and does not prevent partition of the property of a deceased cotenant. Solomon v. Solomon, 187 Miss. 22, 192 So. 10, 1939 Miss. LEXIS 86 (Miss. 1939).

      </p>
      <p>
       It is not necessary to the operation of this section [Code 1942, § 478] that title should have been acquired by inheritance. Biggs v. Roberts, 237 Miss. 406, 115 So. 2d 151, 1959 Miss. LEXIS 485 (Miss. 1959).
      </p>

       Widow, redeeming her interest from tax sale, had right against the other tenants to occupy property as homestead while widow, regardless of source from which cotenant’s title was derived. Lackey v. Harrington, 162 Miss. 512, 139 So. 313, 1932 Miss. LEXIS 123 (Miss. 1932).

      </p>
      <p>
       Upon a widow’s renunciation of a testator’s will devising to her a life estate in his home with remainder to a daughter, the widow became entitled to a one-third interest to the property in fee, and the daughter to the other two-thirds interest therein, subject to the right of the widow to occupy and use it during her widowhood. Milton v. Milton, 193 Miss. 563, 10 So. 2d 175, 1942 Miss. LEXIS 131 (Miss. 1942).

       The right here conferred upon the widow is purely a personal one which does not pass to a grantee of her interest in the property. Middleton v. Claughton, 77 Miss. 131, 24 So. 963, 1899 Miss. LEXIS 41 (Miss. 1899).

      <p>
       The fact that a widow was given a right under the statute to have the undisturbed possession of the exempt homestead following the death of the husband does not have the effect of destroying the tenancy in common, which arose in the property upon the death of the husband, merely because of the fact that the right of possession of the other heirs is postponed pending the widowhood of the wife. Bonds v. Bonds, 226 Miss. 348, 84 So. 2d 397, 1956 Miss. LEXIS 406 (Miss. 1956).
      </p>

       A widow, children and grandchildren are tenants in common subject to the right by the widow to undisturbed possession of the exempt homestead. Bonds v. Bonds, 226 Miss. 348, 84 So. 2d 397, 1956 Miss. LEXIS 406 (Miss. 1956).
      </p>
      <p>
       The status of cotenancy is recognized by the statute, but the usual rights thereunder are made subordinate to the widow’s right of use and occupancy during her life. Bohn v. Bohn, 193 Miss. 122, 5 So. 2d 429, 1942 Miss. LEXIS 77 (Miss. 1942).
      </p>

       Under these provisions a widow’s right has the attributes and incidents of a life estate, and the other heirs are vested with a future estate which takes effect in possession at the termination of the preceding estate or interest.

       Where a decedent resided on one tract of land and used this tract with another as a farm unit which consisted of less than 160 acres, the widow was entitled to claim both parcels of land as a homestead although they were not contiguous.

      <p>
       <p>
   The question of value has no place in the consideration of the rights of a surviving widow to use and occupancy of the homestead, her rights being absolute so long as she remains a widow; the limitation on the value of the homestead that is exempt from creditors’ demands, set by §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.85.html#t85c03s85-3-21" target="_blank">85-3-21</a></cite>, is not applicable.

      </p>
      <p>
       The value of the homestead is not material in passing on the rights of the surviving widow, since it was never the intention of the legislature that “160 acres of land should be reduced in quantity, save in one instance, and that is where the rights of the creditors were involved.” Horton v. Horton, 210 Miss. 116, 48 So. 2d 850, 1950 Miss. LEXIS 328 (Miss. 1950).

      </p>
      <p>
       Under this section [Code 1942, § 478] a surviving widow is entitled to occupy the homestead as it existed in the lifetime of the husband without reference to its value, the limit of value placed by law on exempt homesteads being solely for the benefit and protection of creditors and not affecting the rights of a surviving widow to the use and occupation of the homestead against the other heirs of the deceased exemptionist.

       Where a widow of intestate occupied and used intestate’s tax delinquent property, she could not permit the title to mature in the state and thereafter purchase the land for her own benefit at the expense of the children and any purchase she made of the tax title was made for the joint benefit of her and the intestate’s children.

       Public Employees’ Retirement System (PERS) Board of Trustees did not err in denying the claim a deceased PERS member’s sister because the member’s husband was entitled to lifetime spousal survivor benefits, notwithstanding the fact he was convicted of aggravated driving under the influence in connection with the member’s death; the husband did not willfully cause the member’s death under the slayer statutes, and he had been married to the member for over one year.

       Mississippi Supreme Court has applied the same statutory principles of the “slayer statutes” where the property at issue was life insurance proceeds rather than an inheritance; the same principles would apply to Public Employees’ Retirement System benefits for the strong public policy against allowing someone to profit from involvement in the death of another.

   Although the chancellor cited the wrong statutory section in finding that a father had no interest in his former wife’s estate, the finding was substantively correct where there was no dispute that he had murdered his former wife, and as a result, he could have no interest in the estate under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t91c01s91-1-25" target="_self">91-1-25</a></cite> (Rev. 2013). Young v. O'Beirne, 147 So.3d 877, 2014 Miss. App. LEXIS 311 (Miss. Ct. App. 2014).

       In an action in which a beneficiary filed suit against an insurance company alleging claims of tortious breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty and duty of good faith and fair dealing, negligence, gross negligence, and intentional infliction of emotional distress, the insurance company was granted summary judgment where: (1) the insured executed a voluntary statement to police that her husband had stabbed her with a knife and a month after the knife wound, the insured died in her bed; (2) no reasonable juror could conclude that the insurance company acted with malice, gross negligence, or reckless disregard in wanting to review the autopsy report; and (3) the delay in receiving the autopsy report was due in part to the beneficiary’s failure to inform them of his address change.

       Decedent’s husband was entitled to inherit an interest in land owned by his wife, even though he had entered into a consent decree in Michigan in which he relinquished his rights as heir of his wife, where the parties did not intend the Michigan decree to cover Mississippi lands; the testimony of husband that he shot his wife accidentally was properly admitted in evidence as an exception to the dead man’s statute; insofar as the shooting was not wilful, the husband was not barred from inheriting by statute. Bianchi v. Scott, 363 So. 2d 289, 1978 Miss. LEXIS 2191 (Miss. 1978).

      <p>
       Equitable estoppel does not and cannot authorize the exercise of a personal right which terminates with the death of a spouse, and the fact that a husband shot and killed his wife, an act which would have precluded his inheriting her estate, is no justification for permitting the deceased wife’s personal representatives to renounce the husband’s will, an act which by law can only be invoked personally by a surviving spouse.

      <p>
       In a suit to cancel as cloud on title claim asserted by husband by virtue of inheritance from his deceased spouse, where it was finally adjudicated that the husband had pleaded guilty to manslaughter in the death of his wife, the suit was not one for penalty or forfeiture on a penal statute required to be brought within one year from the date of offense.

       Under this section [Code 1942, § 479] it is not requisite that the wilful killing shall amount to murder but it is enough that it was wilful and without justification in law. Henry v. Toney, 211 Miss. 93, 50 So. 2d 921, 1951 Miss. LEXIS 335 (Miss. 1951).

       In a suit to cancel husband’s claim to property of wife on the ground that he had feloniously slain his wife in Ohio and thereby forfeited his right to the property under this section [Code 1942, § 479], the fact that the husband pleaded guilty to manslaughter in Ohio does not admit a wilful killing but the husband should be allowed to introduce evidence to explain the circumstances of killing.

   A claimant’s timely filing, 3 days after the decedent’s death, of a sworn Petition for Letters of Administration in which he alleged that he was the son and sole surviving heir of the deceased, sufficiently complied with the provisions of §§<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t91c01s91-1-15" target="_self">91-1-15</a></cite>,<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t91c01s91-1-27" target="_self">91-1-27</a></cite> and<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t91c01s91-1-29" target="_self">91-1-29</a></cite> and therefore his claim of heirship was not barred by the statute of limitations of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t91c01s91-1-15" target="_self">91-1-15</a></cite>(3)(c). The fact that the claimant did not precisely state that he was the “illegitimate” or “born-out-of-wedlock” son, as opposed to simply declaring himself to be “the son,” was a matter of semantics which made no difference; the indication that he was the sole surviving heir was sufficiently clear.

   Section<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t91c01s91-1-15ol13c" target="_self">91-1-15(3)(c)</a></cite>, which requires that an action seeking adjudication of paternity be filed within 90 days after the first publication of notice to creditors, does not require that notice be given within the 90-day period. An out-of-wedlock child who brought a claim for heirship after her father’s death complied with the filing requirement by petitioning to be appointed administratrix and seeking to be declared the sole and only heir-at-law, where other persons, who would inherit from the decedent, had actual knowledge of the claim of heirship as evidenced by their hiring of an attorney, and, before the estate was closed, were properly allowed by the court to file their claim. The summons by publication requirement of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t91c01s91-1-29" target="_self">91-1-29</a></cite> was met, and all parties were given their day in court. This procedure sufficiently complied with the notice requirements of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t91c01s91-1-27" target="_self">91-1-27</a></cite> and §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t91c01s91-1-29" target="_self">91-1-29</a></cite>, and the filing requirements of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t91c01s91-1-15ol13c" target="_self">91-1-15(3)(c)</a></cite>.

       Administrator who, in his petition for administration, represented that decedent’s half-sister was the sole heir, even though he had actual knowledge that decedent had a living natural daughter, made a serious misrepresentation to the court, and, if the misrepresentation was determined to be a fraud on the court, the administrator would be removed.

       Decedent’s administratrix’s failure to notify decedent’s illegitimate children of the administration of their father’s estate resulted in tolling of the 90-day statute. In re Estate of Thomas, 883 So. 2d 1173, 2004 Miss. LEXIS 1269 (Miss. 2004).

       When the individual asserting heirship claims to be an illegitimate child, the necessary parties include those blood relations of the decedent that would be the decedent’s heirs at law should the illegitimate’s claim of paternity fail; these persons are necessary parties even if they would be completely excluded from inheritance if the paternity claim is proven.

       A testator cannot, by will, dispose of property which he or she placed, during his or her lifetime, in a validly created joint tenancy account with rights of survivorship. A subsequent will does not destroy the joint tenancy and does not terminate that tenancy and divest the corpus of it into the estate of the testator.

       The evidence was sufficient to rebut the presumption that a testator revoked a will which was known to have been made and was kept in a locked drawer of the testator’s desk, but which was not found upon his death, where the testator had a close and affectionate relationship with his daughter who was the sole beneficiary under the will, he talked to people about his will and told them that he was leaving his entire estate to his daughter, there was nothing in the record suggesting that he had changed his mind, the desk in which the will was kept was subject to entry by others, and there was evidence that someone had entered the house and the desk area after the testator died and emptied the contents of filing cabinet drawers. Matter of
   Berry v. Smith, 584 So. 2d 400 (Miss. 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       The trial court properly set aside a jury verdict finding that the decedent’s lost or destroyed will had been properly executed where there was neither direct nor secondary evidence that the alleged lost or destroyed will was ever signed, witnessed, and executed according to law. Gaston v. Gaston, 358 So. 2d 376, 1978 Miss. LEXIS 2527 (Miss. 1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although there was no direct proof that the testatrix had destroyed the will, proof showing that the will was in her possession when last seen and that it could not be found after her death, together with other evidence, sustained the chancellor’s finding that complainant’s proof was insufficient to establish the existence of the alleged lost or destroyed will at the time of testatrix’s death, or to overcome the presumption that the will had been destroyed by the testatrix during her lifetime with the intention of revoking it. James v. Barber, 244 Miss. 234, 142 So. 2d 21, 1962 Miss. LEXIS 443 (Miss. 1962).
      </p>
      <p>
       Failure to locate an instrument apparently alleged to have revoked a lost will of which an admittedly true copy was produced, coupled with evidence that the devisee named had for years devoted himself to fulfillment of an oral agreement with the testator, sustained establishment of the lost will. Denson v. Denson, 203 Miss. 146, 33 So. 2d 311, 1948 Miss. LEXIS 242 (Miss. 1948).
      </p>
      <p>
       To establish destroyed will, interested parties must establish date thereof, attesting witnesses, and whether wholly or partly written and subscribed in testator’s genuine handwriting. Didlake v. Ellis, 158 Miss. 816, 131 So. 267, 1930 Miss. LEXIS 112 (Miss. 1930).

       The mental capacity required to revoke a will is the same as that required to make one. Trotter v. Trotter, 490 So. 2d 827, 1986 Miss. LEXIS 2485 (Miss. 1986).

       Where the residuary clause of a will devised the remainder of a trust to named persons, “my heirs at law, including”, following which all the testator’s heirs were named with the exception of his two older children by his first wife, and the will was carefully drawn, with gifts made to the testator’s heirs at law in other parts of the will without naming them individually, it was evident that the testator intended under the residuary clause to make a gift to certain named individuals, rather than to a class.

       Children failed to come forward with evidence to overcome the prima facie case of their father’s testamentary capacity; the father’s physical weakness did not preclude him from making a will, and a bare and unexplained assertion that his mental state was “terrible” did not raise a jury issue as to his mental capacity. The father’s agreement that he was no longer up to the task of campaigning for elected office did not amount to an admission or even evidence that he lacked the mental capacity to sign a will, and all testimony relevant to his mental capacity on March 2, 2009, indicated that he had sufficient capacity to execute both a general power of attorney and a will.

       One of the many ways of effecting undue influence upon a testator is by misrepresentation of fact; the misrepresentation may be made with the deliberate intent to deceive, knowing full well that it is false, as well as recklessly made without regard to its truth or falsity.

       Chancery court properly granted summary judgment to a testator’s siblings in their contest to the testator’s will because the ninth page of the will naming a friend of the testator as the sole beneficiary of her estate failed to meet the statutory requirements of a valid codicil or holographic will where it constituted a separate document from the first eight pages of the will (it was typed in a different font style and size than the rest of the will and contained its own separate signature line), the will failed to incorporate it by reference, and there was no evidence that the testator signed the ninth page in the presence of two credible witnesses or that she published or acknowledged it as her will in the presence of witnesses.

       Although a testator did not affix her initials in the margins of the first two pages of her four-page will, the will was validly executed because there was evidence the testator actually signed the will in the presence of two attesting witnesses.

   The chancery court correctly denied probate to a document offered as the will of a decedent, where the document was neither wholly written and subscribed by the testator nor attested by two or more credible witnesses in the presence of the testator as required by §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t91c05s91-5-1" target="_self">91-5-1</a></cite>, but was entirely typewritten, signed by the decedent, and had a certificate of a notary public that it had been “sworn to and subscribed before me” followed by the signature and seal of the notary. The history of will contests in Mississippi supports the view that the requirements that there be two attesting witnesses to a will and, moreover, that it be attested by them in the presence of the testator, and that such attestation be evidenced by the affixation of their signatures to document, are indispensable safeguards of the integrity of testimentary documents. Batchelor v. Powers, 348 So. 2d 776, 1977 Miss. LEXIS 2108 (Miss. 1977).

      <p>
       Where a testator in his will clearly expressed a desire that his estate be held together, and it was evident that his intent could be followed only by execution of the trust recommended by the testator in his will, the form of the trust attached to the will was mandatory, and it was proper that the trust was admitted to probate and established, notwithstanding that the testator’s words in the will attaching a draft of his plans for the trust, and recommending it as a guide, were merely precatory. Farmer v. Broadhead, 230 So. 2d 779, 1970 Miss. LEXIS 1561 (Miss. 1970).

       As a general rule of law, courts tend to sustain a testamentary document as having been legally executed if it is possible to do so consistent with statutory requirements. Lyle v. Shannon, 228 So. 2d 594 (Miss. 1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       Ordinarily, substantial compliance with statutory formalities in the execution of a will is sufficient in the absence of a suggestion of fraud, deception, undue influence or mental incapacity. Lyle v. Shannon, 228 So. 2d 594 (Miss. 1969).

       It is the requisite to a valid will that it be executed as prescribed by statute. Boyles Coffee Co. v. Anderson, 218 So. 2d 843, 1969 Miss. LEXIS 1621 (Miss. 1969).
      </p>

       No matter how earnestly one may desire and intend to make a will, a paper, although fully intended by the maker to be a will, is ineffective and invalid unless its execution meets statutory requirements. Boyles Coffee Co. v. Anderson, 218 So. 2d 843, 1969 Miss. LEXIS 1621 (Miss. 1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       The purpose of statutes prescribing formalities for the execution of wills is not to restrict the power of testator to dispose of his property, but it is to guard against mistakes, impositions, undue influences, fraud, deception, etc., which would divert the property of the testator from those intended by him or her to inherit same.

       An instrument executed by a husband and wife which purported to be their last will and testament but which was not witnessed by two subscribing witnesses and was neither wholly in the handwriting of each, nor wholly in the handwriting of either, was invalid under the provisions of this section [Code 1942, § 657].

       The writing of a will by a witness, at the request of the deceased, and embodying therein the disposition the deceased desired to make of his property, and the signing of the will by the deceased, was a sufficient declaration by the latter that the paper he had signed was his last will and testament, it being unnecessary for him to so declare in appropriate words.

       If it appears from the face of a writing testamentary in its character that a contemplated voyage and the dangers incident thereto were merely the occasion of its execution, and that the testator’s death while on the voyage was not made a condition upon which its validity depended, it will be operative and may be probated after his return and subsequent death.

   The Chancellor made no error in submitting the issue to the jury of whether there was compliance with §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t91c05s91-5-1" target="_self">91-5-1</a></cite>, where contestants of a will specifically charged that the signature to the will was not the testator’s, where proponents, in their answer, denied all such allegations, where all witnesses for the proponents and all evidence offered on their behalf indicated that the testator had signed the will without assistance, and where the proponents changed their testimony only after overwhelming evidence was offered by the contestants that, at the very least, the testator, who was 88 years old at the time the will was executed, was assisted in making her signature.

       Evidence of subscribing witness that testatrix told him that instrument was her will, that she had signed it and wanted him to sign it as a witness, and that he did so in her presence, and testimony of other witness who did not sign in presence of other subscribing witness and was not present when other witness signed, that testatrix told him instrument was her will and requested him to sign it as a witness, was sufficient to authorize admission of will to probate in solemn form.

       A request to sign a will as a witness, made in the presence of the testator by one intrusted with the preparation of the will, is equivalent to a request by the testator, and it is sufficient that enough is said and done in the presence and with the knowledge of the testator to make the witnesses understand that he desires them to know that the paper is his will, and that they are to be the witnesses thereto.

       An instrument in the form of a deed which provided that the grantors were to retain possession, control and occupancy of the lands during their lifetime and then vest in the purported grantee, “but not until the death of both grantors herein, does the title pass,” was testamentary in character since it did not meet the requirement of a deed that it must convey some estate effective upon delivery.

   A purported holographic will did not comport with the execution requirements of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t91c05s91-5-1" target="_self">91-5-1</a></cite> and was therefore invalid, where the will was a one-page document with writing on the front and back, the testator’s name appeared in the first line of the will but did not appear again, and the will was not signed at the end. Amyotte v. Hollingsworth, 585 So. 2d 731 (Miss. 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no legal requirement that signature “subscribing” holographic will must be placed on the same sheet of paper as the dispositive provisions of the will, so long as the signature is at the conclusion of the will; and the part of the will containing the signature may be mechanically attached to the other part of the will so that it may be identified as a part thereof.

       The intent of one to make a will, insofar as probate of a holographic will is concerned, is immaterial; for the question is whether the will actually is executed in accordance with the statute of the state. Boyles Coffee Co. v. Anderson, 218 So. 2d 843, 1969 Miss. LEXIS 1621 (Miss. 1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       With respect to holographic wills, this section [Code 1942, § 657] has been construed to mean that such a will must be signed at the end of a document, testamentary in character, which shows on its face that the testamentary purpose therein expressed is completed, that nothing which follows the signature may be considered, and if the writing does not meet the requirements of this section the intent of the writer is immaterial.

       In giving legal effect to an instrument prepared by a lay person, the court should endeavor to ascertain what the words contained in it meant to the author, not simply what they could connote to a lawyer. Thus, where a holographic will provided that if the testator preceded his wife in death “all of my earthly possessions be received by her,” the use of the ordinary words “possessions” and “receive,” with no further qualification or restriction, indicated that the testator intended for his wife to receive and own everything he possessed and owned. In re Estate of Dedeaux, 584 So. 2d 419, 1991 Miss. LEXIS 462 (Miss. 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a will contest, requiring construction of a holographic will, in view of evidence that the testatrix’ use and enjoyment of land was not restricted and that there was no fence defining a “yard” in which a dwelling house and out buildings were located, and the testatrix had been accustomed to referring to the entire place by the term “home”, her bequest of one-half the value of the “home” was not a bequest of one-half the value of the house and “yard” but of one-half the value of the entire 58.4 acres of land on which the house was situated. Carlisle v. Estate of Carlisle, 252 So. 2d 894, 1971 Miss. LEXIS 1208 (Miss. 1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       In construing a will, consideration must be given to all the provisions of the instrument and every part thereof taken together, rather than to any particular clause, sentence or form of words, and this is particularly true with respect to a holographic will since the words and terms are those of the testator who is also the writer and the will is not therefore as subject to mistake through misunderstanding as might be the case where the instrument is drawn by one other than the testator. Carlisle v. Estate of Carlisle, 252 So. 2d 894, 1971 Miss. LEXIS 1208 (Miss. 1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       Fact that wife’s holographic will referred to a request of her husband was no more than an explanation as to her reason for devising the property as she did, and was not an expression of the testamentary intent of the husband.

       A simple statement written by the signer that she gives everything she owns without bond to her sister named, which writing is kept in the signer’s possession until the time of her death, is effective as a holographic will, even though the day of the month when executed is not specified by the signer who could not possibly have attained her majority during the particular month of the year shown by the writing.

       Instrument entirely in handwriting of deceased, with caption consisting of the name of deceased followed by the words “writing this,” where no signature, date or other writing appeared underneath the last paragraph of the instrument, was inadmissible to probate as a holographic will, since the instrument was not subscribed to within the meaning of this section [Code 1942, § 657]. Words appearing at top and as caption were mere words of description and identification of the person writing the instrument and did not constitute a signature in execution of the instrument.

       In contest proceeding arising out of offer of letter for probate as holographic will of writer, later unsigned will prepared at writer’s suggestion, letter with reference to unsigned will, circumstances surrounding preparation of documents, their contents, and action of parties with reference thereto are competent evidence upon question of whether writer intended letter as will and so considered it, and whether, in legal effect, it was will. In re George's Estate, 208 Miss. 734, 45 So. 2d 571, 1950 Miss. LEXIS 292 (Miss. 1950).

      <p>
       In will contest, admission in evidence of opinions of lay witnesses as to mental incapacity of testatrix to make will on date of its alleged execution followed by statement by witnesses of facts or incidents in connection with their acquaintance, association and experience with testatrix on which opinion is based is not reversible error in absence of objection interposed by proponents to expression of these opinions by witnesses for contestants on ground that they had not previously stated facts upon which their opinions were given, objection on ground that profferred testimony involved opinion of lay witness being insufficient. Blalock v. Magee, 205 Miss. 209, 38 So. 2d 708, 1949 Miss. LEXIS 426 (Miss. 1949).
      </p>
      <p>
       Parol evidence to effect that deceased stated that she had made her will was inadmissible on question whether alleged holographic will was intended to be and in fact was “subscribed” within the meaning of this section [Code 1942, § 657], even though parol evidence generally is competent to show whether an instrument was intended to be of testamentary character where its meaning in that behalf is not clearly shown on the face thereof, since there was no issue as to whether the instrument was testamentary in character. Baker v. Baker's Estate, 199 Miss. 388, 24 So. 2d 841, 1946 Miss. LEXIS 208 (Miss. 1946).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence as to how testator acquired certain personal property about 23 years prior to making of his will is inadmissible, as too remote, on issue of testamentary capacity, especially where it is not shown that any of this property was in existence at time of testator’s death. Norman v. Norman, 196 Miss. 597, 18 So. 2d 130, 1944 Miss. LEXIS 239 (Miss. 1944).
      </p>
      <p>
       Error by trial court in excluding evidence as to timber cruise on testator’s lands, in suit contesting will on grounds of undue influence and lack of testamentary capacity, did not constitute reversible error in view of other evidence admitted showing value and extent of testator’s estate. Norman v. Norman, 196 Miss. 597, 18 So. 2d 130, 1944 Miss. LEXIS 239 (Miss. 1944).

      </p>
      <p>
       Declarations of sole beneficiary of a will shortly after testatrix’s death held incompetent in will contest on ground of forgery, he being a witness in his own behalf and testifying he wrote the will. Liles v. May, 105 Miss. 807, 63 So. 217, 1913 Miss. LEXIS 252 (Miss. 1913).

      </p>

       Declarations of testator that he would make no will held incompetent. Miller v. Miller, 96 Miss. 526, 51 So. 210, 1910 Miss. LEXIS 164 (Miss. 1910).

       In will contest on ground of lack of testamentary capacity and existence of undue influence, there is but a single issue-will or no will, and burden is on proponent throughout. Blalock v. Magee, 205 Miss. 209, 38 So. 2d 708, 1949 Miss. LEXIS 426 (Miss. 1949).

       § 91-5-3.
    Revocations.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      A devise so made, or any clause thereof, shall not be revocable but by the testator or testatrix destroying, canceling, or obliterating the same, or causing it to be done in his or her presence, or by subsequent will, codicil, or declaration, in writing, made and executed. Every last will and testament made when the testator or testatrix had no child living, wherein any child he or she might have is not provided for or not mentioned, if at the time of his or her death he or she have a child, or if the testator leave his wife enceinte of a child who shall be born, shall have no effect during the life of any such after-born child and shall be void unless the child die without having been married, or without leaving issue capable of inheriting, and before he or she shall have attained twenty-one years. The estate, both real and personal, so devised shall descend to such child in the same manner as if the testator or testatrix had died intestate, subject, nevertheless, to the bequests made in the last will and testament in case of the death of such child before marriage, or without issue capable of inheriting, and under the age of twenty-one years. When a testator shall leave children born and his wife enceinte, the posthumous child or children, if unprovided for by settlement and neither provided for nor disinherited, but only pretermitted, by the last will and testament, shall succeed to the same portion of the father’s estate as such child or children would have been entitled to if the father had died intestate, towards raising which portion the devisees and legatees shall contribute proportionably out of the parts devised and bequeathed to them by the same will and testament.

       In Mississippi, revocation of a duly executed will is governed by a statute, and in order to affect the revocation of a will, it is essential that it be shown in some competent manner that the testator or someone for him performed one or more of the acts specified in the statute of “destroying, cancelling, or obliterating” the will and that he did so with the intention of revoking the will.

       In order for an act to have the effect of revoking a will the intention to revoke must clearly and unequivocally appear, so that a will is not revoked by any act of spoliation or destruction not deliberately done animo revocandi, and even where the statutory methods for revoking a will are followed by the testator, his act is ineffectual unless his intent thereby to revoke or alter the will appears.

       In a proceeding to annul probate of will and codicil and for decree that decedent died intestate, the question whether the instrument of revocation had been executed in compliance with the requirements of the statute was a question of fact to be determined according to the proof.

   Mississippi Supreme Court declined to adopt a rule of revocation of a will by divorce and to adopt a rule that a pre-divorce will was automatically or expressly revoked by a divorce accompanied by a property settlement agreement with provisions inconsistent with the terms of the pre-divorce will; on the other hand, it did acknowledge that there may be an implied revocation of a pre-divorce will in cases where there is a divorce accompanied by a property settlement agreement with provisions inconsistent with the terms of the pre-divorce will, but any document submitted by a contestant as a subsequent declaration pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t91c05s91-5-3" target="_self">91-5-3</a></cite> must reveal by “clear and unequivocal” evidence the testator’s intention to revoke the prior will by looking to the facts and circumstances of the particular case, the terms of the will itself, the divorce decree and the property settlement, and the conduct of the parties.

      </h4>
      <p>
       The evidence was sufficient to rebut the presumption that a testator revoked a will which was known to have been made and was kept in a locked drawer of the testator’s desk, but which was not found upon his death, where the testator had a close and affectionate relationship with his daughter who was the sole beneficiary under the will, he talked to people about his will and told them that he was leaving his entire estate to his daughter, there was nothing in the record suggesting that he had changed his mind, the desk in which the will was kept was subject to entry by others, and there was evidence that someone had entered the house and the desk area after the testator died and emptied the contents of filing cabinet drawers. Berry v. Smith, 584 So. 2d 400 (Miss. 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a testator’s will was found in a lock box at his bank, to which box only he had access, and where the testator’s signature, but not the signatures of the witnesses, had been cut off of the bottom of the first two pages of the will apparently with scissors, but the third page with the signature of the testator and those of the witnesses, and with an attestation certificate also signed by the witnesses, was unmarred and intact, and in all other respects the will was in its original condition, the will had not been revoked. Griffith v. Movie Star of Collins, Inc., 233 So. 2d 760, 1970 Miss. LEXIS 1664 (Miss. 1970).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although there was no direct proof that the testatrix had destroyed the will, proof that the will was in her possession when last seen and that it could not be found after her death, together with other evidence, supported finding that complainant’s proof was insufficient to establish the existence of the alleged lost or destroyed will at the time of testatrix’s death, or to overcome the presumption that the will had been destroyed by the testatrix during her lifetime with the intention of revoking it. James v. Barber, 244 Miss. 234, 142 So. 2d 21, 1962 Miss. LEXIS 443 (Miss. 1962).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although a will which had last been seen in testatrix’ possession was not found after her death, evidence established that the testatrix did not revoke her will and rebutted the presumption as to revocation arising due to the fact that the will could not be found upon her death, especially since it appeared that the devisees under the will were blood relatives of the testatrix, and that one, who desired to defeat the will, had access to the place where it was kept. Adams v. Davis, 233 Miss. 228, 102 So. 2d 190, 1958 Miss. LEXIS 377 (Miss. 1958).
      </p>
      <p>
       Under evidence that testatrix might have desired to revoke her will but later changed her mind, the chancellor did not err in holding that there had been no revocation where both copies of the instrument were found in her possession at the time of death, and even though the original or ribbon copy of the instrument, which was found in the envelope with other of the testatrix’ papers, was torn from the bottom upwards by five separate tears which extended to points opposite or above the testatrix’ signature, it was shown that no part of the instrument was torn off, and the signature of the testatrix and subscribing witnesses were plainly legible, there were no interlineations, erasures or cancellations on the instrument, and the carbon copy thereof was not torn.

       A breach of a contract not to revoke a will is just that a breach of contract. It is not grounds for contesting the will pertaining to the contract.

       Where testator executes a will in compliance with an oral agreement with the devisee that the latter will render unique and necessary personal services to testator involving a substantial change in the status and manner of living of the promisee, and such services have been performed, so that a revocation of the will amounts to fraud upon the devisee rendering it impossible or impracticable to restore devisee to prior situation, equity will hold such will to be irrevocable and the rights thereunder may be established.

       In interpreting a will, as affected by this section [Code 1942, § 659], and in an effort to determine the intent of the testatrix, the court should take into consideration all of the terms and provisions of the will and the circumstances surrounding the testatrix at the time at which she executed the will. Guion v. Guion, 232 Miss. 647, 100 So. 2d 351, 1958 Miss. LEXIS 313 (Miss. 1958).

       In a case involving an adopted child born before the execution of a will, the court need not reach the question whether this section [Code 1942, § 659] was intended to apply to adopted children born after the execution of a will since the legislature intended pretermitted children provisions to apply only to children born after the will was made.

       Where a mother had two living children at the time she executed her will, the fact that she devised and bequeathed all of her property to her husband manifested an intent to disinherit her children as a class, so that a child born after the execution of the will had no inheritable rights in the mother’s estate.

       A general devise of a remainder or reversionary interest to the heirs of the testator or to his children does not comprehend a posthumous child, so as to prevent it from claiming under the statute as a child pretermitted by the will, in the absence of anything to show that the child was in the mind of the testator.

Mahaffey v. First Nat'l Bank, 231 Miss. 798, 97 So. 2d 756, 1957 Miss. LEXIS 567 (Miss. 1957).

   Where the residuary clause of the decedent’s will gave an undivided one-half interest of the remainder of his estate to his wife, and secondly, an undivided one-half interest, per stirpes, to his children (by an earlier marriage), and where the wife predeceased the husband by one week, the chancery court properly rejected the stepchildren’s argument that either spouse intended for all six children (the decedent’s children and the stepchildren), to divide their estate equally, no matter which parent died first; because the writing was clear and spoke for itself, parol evidence was not admissible to alter the terms of the document, and the anti-lapse statute, Miss Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t91c05s91-5-7" target="_self">91-5-7</a></cite>, was clearly applicable, such that the failed devise to the wife passed to the decedent’s natural children. Marlar v. Castillo-Ruiz (In re Will of Roland), 920 So. 2d 539, 2006 Miss. App. LEXIS 85 (Miss. Ct. App. 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       Rule as to lapsed devises is applicable primarily to instances where devisee named in will predeceased testatrix. Mississippi State Univ. Found. v. Clark (In re Estate of Homburg), 697 So. 2d 1154, 1997 Miss. LEXIS 317 (Miss. 1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       Testamentary gift to life income beneficiary of testamentary trust lapsed when beneficiary predeceased testatrix; however, gift over to remaindermen did not lapse, as remaindermen were capable of taking at time of death of testatrix. Mississippi State Univ. Found. v. Clark (In re Estate of Homburg), 697 So. 2d 1154, 1997 Miss. LEXIS 317 (Miss. 1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a proceeding seeking interpretation of a residuary clause of a will in which the testator left his residual estate to his daughter and to his brothers and sisters, share and share alike, several of whom predeceased the testator, the chancellor properly held that the lapsed portions of the testator’s estate descended by the laws of intestate succession to his daughter, his heir-at-law. Moffett v. Howard, 392 So. 2d 509, 1981 Miss. LEXIS 1903 (Miss. 1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a son died intestate prior to the death of the testatrix and left a son and daughter as his surviving heirs, such surviving heirs succeeded to the share of their father in the estate. Martin v. Eslick, 229 Miss. 234, 90 So. 2d 635, 1956 Miss. LEXIS 604 (Miss. 1956).
      </p>
      <p>
       The rule as to lapsed devises is applicable primarily to instances where the devisee named in the will had died prior to the death of the testator. Hays v. Cole, 221 Miss. 459, 73 So. 2d 258, 1954 Miss. LEXIS 551 (Miss. 1954).
      </p>
      <p>
       Under devise of residue of estate under will to the fiancee, two uncles and a cousin of testator, the share of one of the devisees who predeceased the testator goes to testator’s heirs at law, and is not saved by this section [Code 1942, § 660]. Clark v. Case, 207 Miss. 163, 42 So. 2d 109, 1949 Miss. LEXIS 326 (Miss. 1949).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section [Code 1942, § 660] does not apply to bequests to those who are not descendants of the testator, and a legacy to a niece who predeceased the testator lapsed so that her son did not inherit through her. Kullman v. Dreyfus' Estate, 201 Miss. 887, 30 So. 2d 81, 1947 Miss. LEXIS 460 (Miss. 1947).
      </p>
      <p>
       Leasehold interest in school land in state owned by testatrix of other state is governed by Mississippi law; legacy lapses on death of legatee without children though statute of domicile of testatrix provides contrary. Neblett v. Neblett, 112 Miss. 550, 73 So. 575, 1916 Miss. LEXIS 145 (Miss. 1916).

      When a husband makes his last will and testament and does not make satisfactory provision therein for his wife, she may, at any time within ninety (90) days after the probate of the will, file in the office where probated a renunciation to the following effect, viz.: “I, A B, the widow of C D, hereby renounce the provision made for me by the will of my deceased husband, and elect to take in lieu thereof my legal share of his estate.” Thereupon she shall be entitled to such part of his estate, real and personal, as she would have been entitled to if he had died intestate, except that, even if the husband left no child nor descendant of such, the widow, upon renouncing, shall be entitled to only one-half (1/2) of the real and personal estate of her deceased husband. The husband may renounce the will of his deceased wife under the same circumstances, in the same time and manner, and with the same effect upon his right to share in her estate as herein provided for the widow.

       Where a husband can properly renounce his wife’s will, and there are no children, he is entitled to one half of the estate of his deceased wife; however, the right of a husband to renounce is qualified by Code 1942, § 670, which expressly applies to husband renouncing the will of his wife.

       Spouse’s right to renounce will under statute was personal and abated at her demise; therefore, such right may not be undertaken by personal representative after death of spouse, even where death occurs prior to expiration of statutory period for election.

       Where a wife in her will failed to make any provision for her surviving husband, and the husband’s property was not equal to his lawful portion of the wife’s estate, the right of the husband to renounce the will and to take his legal share of the wife’s estate vested as a matter of law and became part of his estate upon his death, exercisable by the executor of the husband’s estate, even though before his death, 3 weeks following his wife’s death, the husband did not renounce the wife’s will or take any affirmative action with reference thereto.

       The personal representative of a deceased spouse does not have the right to renounce the will of a predeceased spouse under this section [Code 1942, § 668], for the privilege is one which must be invoked personally by the surviving spouse during her lifetime.

       Equitable estoppel does not and cannot authorize the exercise of a personal right which terminates with the death of a spouse, and the fact that a husband shot and killed his wife, an act which would have precluded his inheriting her estate, is no justification for permitting the deceased wife’s personal representatives to renounce the husband’s will, an act which by law can only be invoked personally by a surviving spouse.

       Where a widow has been mentally incompetent continuously from the death of the testator and has no guardian acting in her behalf during the statutory period for renunciation, its lapse is no bar to a subsequent election in her behalf by the court, or guardian acting under supervision and approval of the court; for the general rule is that where an election is required by statute to be made within a certain period of time, the incompetency of the person entitled to elect is considered as warranting an extension of the statutory period.

       Renouncement by a widow of her husband’s will does not constitute an abandonment of her action to contest the will, since renouncement does not affect the validity of the will but merely affects the amount of property which the parties receive, and, therefore, renouncement does not constitute an estoppel to contest the will.

       Where a widow contesting the will of her husband renounced within the time prescribed, there was no inconsistency between such renunciation and the will contest so as to preclude her appeal from an adverse decision in the will contest, since both by the renunciation and the contest, if successful, she takes by inheritance; and renunciation is not an abandonment of the contest since renouncement does not affect the validity of the will but merely affects the amount of property which the parties receive.

       In a proceeding to determine whether surviving husband’s separate estate was equal in value to one half portion of his deceased wife’s estate, the chancellor properly found that the husband had not conveyed his one half interest in certain Louisiana property to his children prior to wife’s death, but had given the property to his children by an act of donation after the event; thus, the value of the husband’s one half interest in the Louisiana property, less one half of the outstanding mortgage loan, should have been included in the valuation of his separate estate along with the value of his personal property, and he was precluded by Code 1942, § 670, from renouncing his wife’s will, which made no provision for him, since his property at the time of her death was more than equal in value to what would have been his lawful portion of her estate.

    Effect of no provision for husband or wife.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      If the will of the husband or wife shall not make any provision for the other, the survivor of them shall have the right to share in the estate of the deceased husband or wife, as in case of unsatisfactory provision in the will of the husband or wife for the other of them. In such case a renunciation of the will shall not be necessary, but the rights of the survivor shall be as if the will had contained a provision that was unsatisfactory and it had been renounced.

   Trial court erred in failing to determine whether a widow clearly deserted or abandoned her marriage when she left the decedent’s home by her own volition after his leg was amputated, and was living in her own home when he died such that she was not entitled to take a child’s share of the estate under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t91c05s91-5-27" target="_self">91-5-27</a></cite>. In re Estate of Estes, 111 So.3d 1223, 2012 Miss. App. LEXIS 820 (Miss. Ct. App. 2012).

       No revocation of will as matter of law occurred when, subsequent to death of beneficiary, constructive trust was imposed on assets of estate resulting in husband’s will making no provision for wife. Shattuck v. Estate of Tyson, 508 So. 2d 1077, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2556 (Miss. 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       The trial court erred in holding that a husband was not entitled to an undivided one-half interest in the real and personal property owned by his deceased wife where, although the parties had lived apart for 15 to 20 years, there was no substantial evidence to show a desertion or abandonment as to estop the husband from claiming under the statute; at most the evidence proved that there had been a long separation between the parties.

       A wife’s failure to renounce her husband’s will in the six months after its probate constituted a waiver of her right to do so. Rush v. Rush, 360 So. 2d 1240, 1978 Miss. LEXIS 2341 (Miss. 1978).

       In an action between the beneficiaries under testator’s will and the heirs of his widow, who had renounced the will, the chancellor, after finding the testator’s net estate and the widow’s net estate at the time of testator’s death, correctly determined that the estate should be distributed according to Code 1942, § 670, and that the widow’s heirs were entitled to the difference between one half of the net estate of the testator and the net value of the widow’s estate. The contention by the heirs at law of the widow that under the provisions of this section [Code 1942, § 669] the widow was entitled to one half of the real and personal estate of the testator without regard to Code 1942, § 670, and that in any event they were entitled to an undivided one third interest in the real property and one third of the net distribution of the personal property of the deceased, was rejected. Carter v. Evans, 230 Miss. 803, 94 So. 2d 237, 1957 Miss. LEXIS 425 (Miss. 1957).

       Husband’s will giving property to one who provided for him pursuant to contract prior to his marriage to the wife who survived him, and while a former wife was still living, was not abrogation of contract which would enable widow to renounce will.

       § 91-5-29.
    Effect of wife or husband having separate estate.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      In case the wife have a separate property at the time of the death of her husband, equal in value to what would be her lawful portion of her husband’s real and personal estate, and he have made a will, she shall not be at liberty to signify her dissent to the will or to renounce any provision or bequest therein in her favor and elect to take her portion of his estate. If her separate property be not equal in value to what would be the value of her portion of her husband’s estate, then she may signify her dissent to the will, as in other cases provided by law, and claim to have the deficiency made up to her, notwithstanding the will. The court in which the will is probated may appoint three commissioners to ascertain, by valuation of the estate, what her lawful portion thereof would be worth; and the commissioners shall also value her own separate estate and report their valuation to the court. Whereupon the court shall make the proper order for allowing her to share in her husband’s real and personal estate to make up the deficiency after the following rule: if her separate property be equal in value to two thirds of what she would be entitled to, she shall have one third of her lawful portion of the land and one third of what would be her distributive share of the personalty; if her separate property be worth half in value what she would be entitled to, then she shall be entitled to half her lawful portion of real estate and half of what would be her distributive share of the personalty; if her separate property be worth only one third in value what she would be entitled to, then she shall be entitled to two thirds of her lawful portion of real estate and two thirds of what would be her distributive share in the personalty. This section shall not preclude or prevent any married woman from renouncing the provisions of her husband’s will and electing to take her lawful portion if her separate property do not amount in value to one fifth of what she would be entitled to. This section shall apply to a husband renouncing the will of his wife, and shall govern as to his right to share in her estate in such case.

       The rule for the distribution of the estate of a decedent upon renunciation of a will is to determine the value of the gross estate of the decedent, deduct from that amount the debts of the decedent, administrative expenses and funeral expenses, leaving the net value of the decedent’s estate; when the surviving spouse is entitled to one-half of the estate, the net value must be divided by two and the net value of the estate of the surviving spouse is deducted from such figure, and any balance remaining would be a deficiency to be made up to the surviving spouse. Banks v. Junk, 264 So. 2d 387, 1972 Miss. LEXIS 1356 (Miss. 1972).
      </p>

       Husband whose property greatly exceeds that of his wife may not renounce her will. Biggs v. Roberts, 237 Miss. 406, 115 So. 2d 151, 1959 Miss. LEXIS 485 (Miss. 1959).

       Widow who had entered into a property settlement agreement with husband may not elect to take against his will unless her estate is less than one half of her deceased husband’s estate. Will of Best v. Brewer, 236 Miss. 359, 111 So. 2d 262, 1959 Miss. LEXIS 325 (Miss. 1959).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a husband can properly renounce his wife’s will, and there are no children, he is entitled to one half of the estate of his deceased wife; however, the right of a husband to renounce is qualified by this section [Code 1942, § 670], which expressly applies to husband renouncing the will of his wife. Myers v. Laird, 230 Miss. 675, 93 So. 2d 828, 1957 Miss. LEXIS 409 (Miss. 1957).
      </p>
      <p>
       Under Code 1942, § 668, together with this section [Code 1942, § 670], the widow is entitled to one-half of testator’s net estate, where he died leaving widow and adopted son as only heirs of law. Campbell v. Cason, 206 Miss. 420, 40 So. 2d 258, 1949 Miss. LEXIS 271 (Miss. 1949).
      </p>
      <p>
       The effect of renunciation is to make the deceased spouse an intestate as to one-half of the willed property, leaving the will to stand as to the other half, so that the deductions provided in this section [Code 1942, § 670] on account of the separate estate of the surviving spouse are to be taken out of the half of the total estate to which the surviving spouse is limited by Code 1942, § 668. Davis v. Miller, 202 Miss. 880, 32 So. 2d 871, 1947 Miss. LEXIS 351 (Miss. 1947).

       The widow is not made a creditor of the estate by this section [Code 1942, § 670] where she has elected to take against her husband’s will. Gordon v. James, 86 Miss. 719, 39 So. 18, 1905 Miss. LEXIS 93 (Miss. 1905).

       In an action between the beneficiaries under testator’s will and the heirs of his widow, who had renounced the will, the chancellor, after finding the testator’s net estate and the widow’s net estate at the time of testator’s death, correctly determined that the estate should be distributed according to this section [Code 1942, § 670], and that the widow’s heirs were entitled to the difference between one half of the net estate of the testator and the net value of widow’s estate.

      <p>
       In a proceeding to determine whether a surviving husband’s separate estate was equal in value to one half portion of his deceased wife’s estate, the chancellor properly found that the husband had not conveyed his one half interest in certain Louisiana property to his children prior to death of testator, but that he had given his children the property by an act of donation after the event; thus, the value of the husband’s one half interest in the Louisiana property, less one half of the outstanding mortgage loan, should have been included in the valuation of his separate estate along with the value of his personal property, and he was precluded by this section [Code 1942, § 670] from renouncing his wife’s will, which made no provision for him, since his property at the time of her death was more than equal in value to what would have been his lawful portion of her estate.

       Where heirs at law had a vested remainder, subject to defeasance by the exercise of a power of disposition by the defendant foundation, but the foundation failed to exercise such power, the subsequent repeal of the statute did not affect the heirs’ rights and they maintained rights in the land not disposed of by the foundation.

       § 91-5-33.
    Person who kills another not to take under his will.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      If any person shall wilfully cause or procure the death of another in any manner, he shall not take the property, or any part thereof, real or personal, of such other under any will, testament, or codicil. Any devise to such person shall be void and, as to the property so devised, the decedent shall be deemed to have died intestate.
     </p>
     <p>
      This shall not defeat the title of a bona fide purchaser for value of the property so devised, who acquired the same after one year from the probation of the will without notice that the person to whom the same was devised so caused or procured the death of the testator.

       Public Employees’ Retirement System (PERS) Board of Trustees did not err in denying the claim a deceased PERS member’s sister because the member’s husband was entitled to lifetime spousal survivor benefits, notwithstanding the fact he was convicted of aggravated driving under the influence in connection with the member’s death; the husband did not willfully cause the member’s death under the slayer statutes, and he had been married to the member for over one year. Hicks v. Public Employees' Ret. Sys. of Miss., — So.3d —, 2019 Miss. App. LEXIS 479 (Miss. Ct. App. Oct. 1, 2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       Mississippi Supreme Court has applied the same statutory principles of the “slayer statutes” where the property at issue was life insurance proceeds rather than an inheritance; the same principles would apply to Public Employees’ Retirement System benefits for the strong public policy against allowing someone to profit from involvement in the death of another. Hicks v. Public Employees' Ret. Sys. of Miss., — So.3d —, 2019 Miss. App. LEXIS 479 (Miss. Ct. App. Oct. 1, 2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section requires a finding of willful conduct to preclude a person from inheriting from his or her victim. Because an insane person lacks the requisite ability willfully to kill another person, the Slayer Statute is not applicable in cases where the killer is determined to be insane at the time of the killing. Armstrong v. Armstrong (In re Estate of Armstrong), 170 So.3d 510, 2015 Miss. LEXIS 378 (Miss. 2015).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Evidence of a guilty plea to a charge of manslaughter is not sufficient, standing alone, to enable a fact finder to conclude that one is prohibited from inheriting under §§<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t91c01s91-1-25" target="_self">91-1-25</a></cite> and<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t91c05s91-5-33" target="_self">91-5-33</a></cite>.

      </p>
      <p>
       Equitable estoppel does not and cannot authorize the exercise of a personal right which terminates with the death of a spouse, and the fact that a husband shot and killed his wife, an act which would have precluded his inheriting her estate, is no justification for permitting the deceased wife’s personal representatives to renounce the husband’s will, an act which by law can only be invoked personally by a surviving spouse. Jenkins v. Borodofsky, 211 So. 2d 874, 1968 Miss. LEXIS 1288 (Miss. 1968).

   Forum county pursuant to Miss. Const. Art. VI, § 159 had full jurisdiction over admission of the testator’s will to probate. Indeed, under that constitutional provision it had full jurisdiction over matters testamentary and of administration, and the forum county under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t91c07s91-7-1" target="_self">91-7-1</a></cite> was the proper location to hear probate matters concerning the testator’s estate because the testator at the time of his death had a fixed residence in the forum county. Ellzey v. McCormick, 17 So.3d 583, 2009 Miss. App. LEXIS 118 (Miss. Ct. App. 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       Hancock County was the proper venue to admit a nondomiciliary’s will where the decedent, after living in the county for more than 30 years, had at least acquired some clothing or other personal property in the county in which he died. In re Estate of Kelly v. Cuevas, 951 So. 2d 564, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 995 (Miss. Ct. App. 2005), aff'd in part and rev'd in part, 951 So. 2d 543, 2007 Miss. LEXIS 18 (Miss. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   As decedent’s will was not a foreign will, but a domestic will, sounding in Mississippi law, executed by the decedent in Mississippi where he had resided in a residential care facility for 25 years, and where he died, the trial court properly determined that it had subject matter jurisdiction to probate the will under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t91c07s91-7-1" target="_self">91-7-1</a></cite>. Estate of Kelly v. Cuevas, 951 So. 2d 543, 2007 Miss. LEXIS 18 (Miss. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       If the testator had no fixed place of residence, and only personal property is to be disposed of by the will, it may be proved in, and letters granted by, the chancery court of the county where the testator died, or the county in which some part of the property may be. Halford v. Hines, 223 Miss. 786, 79 So. 2d 264, 1955 Miss. LEXIS 439 (Miss. 1955).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where it was shown that the testator had lived for seventy years on the farm, and when he moved to a town did not move any of his household effects and a witness testified that the testator was coming back home, the evidence was sufficient to support the finding that the testator had not changed his residence. Halford v. Hines, 223 Miss. 786, 79 So. 2d 264, 1955 Miss. LEXIS 439 (Miss. 1955).
      </p>
      <p>
       Domestic will when probated and recorded in county in which testator resided at time of death constituted notice throughout state to subsequent mortgagee of land in Mississippi devised by will, without necessity of recording will in county wherein land was situated. Federal Land Bank v. Newsom, 175 Miss. 114, 161 So. 864, 166 So. 345, 1935 Miss. LEXIS 27 (Miss. 1935).
      </p>
      <p>
       Probate of will is a proceeding in rem having no effect on property outside of jurisdiction where will probated. Woodville v. Pizzati, 119 Miss. 442, 81 So. 127, 1919 Miss. LEXIS 22 (Miss. 1919).

      When any last will and testament is exhibited to be proved, the court may take the probate thereof, and any one interested in a will may propound it for probate. Summons may be issued by the clerk for the subscribing witnesses, or for other witnesses, to be examined as to such will.

       The probation of 1980 will in common form and its admission to probate created prima facie evidence that the will was valid. Trotter v. Trotter, 490 So. 2d 827, 1986 Miss. LEXIS 2485 (Miss. 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       The probate of a will in common form is not a final adjudication of its validity but is an “incipient step” necessary to enable the court to proceed to carry the will into execution, and it is not conclusive against heirs and distributees, and if they desire to contest the validity of the will this shall be done by an issue devisavit vel non. Perry v. Aldrich, 251 Miss. 429, 169 So. 2d 786, 1964 Miss. LEXIS 361 (Miss. 1964).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a niece and two nephews had recited in a sworn petition for letters of administration that their aunt had died intestate some five years previously, although at the time admittedly all knew of the existence of the aunt’s will, and the estate had been administered and discharged, the niece was estopped 21 years later from offering the aunt’s will to probate. Logan v. Smith, 229 Miss. 513, 91 So. 2d 707, 1956 Miss. LEXIS 633 (Miss. 1956).
      </p>
      <p>
       If from any cause the original will cannot be had, secondary evidence of its contents is admissible, and it may be probated in that form. Pratt v. Hargraves, 77 Miss. 892, 28 So. 722, 1900 Miss. LEXIS 52 (Miss. 1900).
      </p>
      <p>
       The refusal to probate a will in common form because of insufficient proof does not preclude the subsequent probate on sufficient evidence. Martin v. Perkins, 56 Miss. 204, 1878 Miss. LEXIS 60 (Miss. 1878).

      The due execution of the will, whether heretofore or hereafter executed, must be proved by at least one (1) of the subscribing witnesses, if alive and competent to testify. If none of the subscribing witnesses can be produced to prove the execution of the will, it may be established by proving the handwriting of a testator and of the subscribing witnesses to the will, or of some of them. The execution of the will may be proved by affidavits of subscribing witnesses. The affidavits may be annexed to the will or may be a part of the will, and shall state the address of each subscribing witness. Such affidavits may be signed at the time that the will is executed.

       A record of probate in common form which does not contain the affidavit of a subscribing witness or other testimony in writing proving the validity of the will, and no explanation of the absence of such proof, is not prima facie evidence of the validity of the will. Gibson v. Jones, 238 Miss. 186, 117 So. 2d 879, 1960 Miss. LEXIS 394 (Miss. 1960).

       In a will contest where proponents introduced a record of probate of will in common form, it was not necessary that they go further and make proof of will by having one of subscribing witnesses present to testify.

       This section [Code 1942, § 498] does not require that the execution of the will be proved by more than one of the subscribing witnesses, and where one of two subscribing witnesses testifies to every fact necessary to the due execution of a lost will, together with evidence that the testator made corroborative statements up to the time of her death, the proponent was held to have met the burden of proof, notwithstanding that the other subscribing witnesses denied his attestation or presence at the execution thereof. Warren v. Sidney's Estate, 183 Miss. 669, 184 So. 806, 1938 Miss. LEXIS 281 (Miss. 1938).

      <p>
       Evidence of subscribing witness that testatrix told him that instrument was her will, that she had signed it and wanted him to sign it as a witness, and that he did so in her presence, and testimony of other witness who did not sign in presence of other subscribing witness and was not present when other witness signed that testatrix told him instrument was her will and requested him to sign it as a witness, was sufficient to authorize admission of will to probate in solemn form.

      </p>
      <p>
       Although under Code 1942, § 498 the testimony of only one living witness is sufficient to establish a will’s proper execution, proof of two signatures of witnesses is required to prove due execution where the witnesses to a will are deceased.

      <p>
       As the will was not contested, the affidavits of two attesting witnesses that the decedent was of sound and disposing mind at the time he executed his will was sufficient to establish the will was properly executed. In re Estate of Kelly v. Cuevas, 951 So. 2d 564, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 995 (Miss. Ct. App. 2005), aff'd in part and rev'd in part, 951 So. 2d 543, 2007 Miss. LEXIS 18 (Miss. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       Under Code 1942, § 499 where there was no will contest, the affidavit of the subscribing witness constituted testimony of the attesting witness for the proponent of the will. Chapman v. Chapman, 264 So. 2d 395, 1972 Miss. LEXIS 1357 (Miss. 1972).
      </p>
      <p>
       The logical basis of the rule that subscribing witnesses to a will that has been admitted to probate in common form should be produced is that the affidavit of proof of due execution of a will authorized by statute is an ex parte statement by the subscribing witnesses. Chapman v. Chapman, 264 So. 2d 395, 1972 Miss. LEXIS 1357 (Miss. 1972).
      </p>
      <p>
       A person contesting a will should be allowed to examine the subscribing witnesses to the will as to all matters relevant to the will’s execution and to inquire into surrounding facts and circumstances so that the court may determine if the will was properly signed and attested, if attestation be required, and if the testator was mentally competent and free of undue influence. Chapman v. Chapman, 264 So. 2d 395, 1972 Miss. LEXIS 1357 (Miss. 1972).
      </p>
      <p>
       The contestant of a will was entitled to impeach the testimony of subscribing witnesses who were called by the contestant as adverse witnesses, in an affidavit which was the basis for admission of the will to probate, even if such impeachment was made by the witnesses’ own testimony. Chapman v. Chapman, 264 So. 2d 395, 1972 Miss. LEXIS 1357 (Miss. 1972).
      </p>
      <p>
       A record of probate in common form which does not contain the affidavit of a subscribing witness or other testimony in writing proving the validity of the will, and no explanation of the absence of such proof, is not prima facie evidence of the validity of the will. Gibson v. Jones, 238 Miss. 186, 117 So. 2d 879, 1960 Miss. LEXIS 394 (Miss. 1960).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a will contest where proponents introduced a record of probate of will in common form, it was not necessary that they go further and make proof of will by having one of subscribing witnesses present to testify. Bearden v. Gibson, 215 Miss. 218, 60 So. 2d 655, 1952 Miss. LEXIS 555 (Miss. 1952).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a will contest after probate, proponents of a will, executed in Texas, were not required to make proof of the validity of the will by having the subscribing witnesses present to testify, or their testimony in the form of depositions, and a prima facie case of the validity of the will was properly made out by introducing the probate of the will in common form by the affidavits of the subscribing witnesses who resided in Texas. Hilton v. Johnson, 194 Miss. 671, 12 So. 2d 524, 1943 Miss. LEXIS 77 (Miss. 1943).
      </p>
      <p>
       The affidavits of two subscribing witnesses to a will were sufficient for the probate thereof in common form. Austin v. Patrick, 179 Miss. 718, 176 So. 714, 1937 Miss. LEXIS 74 (Miss. 1937).

       Daughter would not forfeit her share of a decedent’s estate because sufficient evidence existed that the daughter acted in good faith when submitting the second codicil; even though the jury found the second codicil invalid, that decision alone did not mean that it was submitted in bad faith or without probable cause, and under the statute the jury could not ever reach that question. Estate of Roosa v. Roosa, — So.3d —, 2019 Miss. App. LEXIS 163 (Miss. Ct. App. Apr. 23, 2019).
      </p>

       Court of appeals declined to remand for a jury to determine whether a decedent’s daughter exhibited good faith in probating the second codicil because the issue was not within the jury’s province under the statute. Estate of Roosa v. Roosa, — So.3d —, 2019 Miss. App. LEXIS 163 (Miss. Ct. App. Apr. 23, 2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court did not err in granting beneficiaries summary judgment in a will contest because they established a prima facie case that the will was valid and that the testator possessed testamentary capacity, and the son failed to rebut the prima facie case with any summary-judgment evidence that there was a genuine issue for trial; the will was admitted to probate, and the beneficiaries attached affidavits of individuals that testified as to the testator’s mental capacity. Froemel v. Estate of Froemel, 248 So.3d 876, 2018 Miss. App. LEXIS 230 (Miss. Ct. App. 2018).

   Chancellor erred in holding that Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t91c07s91-7-33" target="_self">91-7-33</a></cite> absolutely barred the sister from initially proving a lost foreign will in Mississippi where the will disposed of property in this state. Given the existence of genuine issues of material fact regarding the validity of the testator’s will, the chancellor should have proceeded with the will contest and impaneled a jury to decide the will’s validity. Watt v. Cobb (In re Estate of High), 19 So.3d 1282, 2009 Miss. App. LEXIS 743 (Miss. Ct. App. 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       Summary judgment is properly granted where no genuine issues of material fact have been presented although question of will or no will is primary issue in will contest and either party to will contest has automatic right to jury trial. Gallagher v. Warden, 507 So. 2d 27 (Miss. 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence that testator of advanced years living in nursing home was dependent upon beneficiary to some degree is insufficient basis for finding of confidential relationship resulting in will being product of undue influence where there is no proof that testator looked to beneficiary to care for personal needs, to tend to him, or to handle his affairs. In re Will & Estate of Varvaris, 477 So. 2d 273, 1985 Miss. LEXIS 2256 (Miss. 1985).

      </p>
      <p>
       In a probate action the chancery court properly overruled a motion to exclude the jury on the issue involving probate of a 1961 will, where the mover’s pleading involving a 1979 will raised the issue of revocation of the 1961 will, and where the question of revocation was a proper question for the jury. Deposit Guaranty Nat'l Bank v. Cotten, 420 So. 2d 242, 1982 Miss. LEXIS 2203 (Miss. 1982).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the evidence was conflicting, jury’s finding that an alleged holographic will was not in the handwriting of the deceased would not be disturbed by the supreme court where there was ample evidence to warrant that conclusion, and the chancellor’s decree had upheld a jury’s verdict. In re Estate of Rumley, 234 Miss. 490, 106 So. 2d 678, 1958 Miss. LEXIS 522 (Miss. 1958).

       It was not required in a probate proceeding that an issue devisavit vel non be tried to a jury. Darby v. Arrington, 194 Miss. 123, 11 So. 2d 220, 1942 Miss. LEXIS 170 (Miss. 1942).

       Where cousins of a testatrix’s heir, who would inherit the estate if the will, under which the heir would receive a life estate, should be set aside, were precluded from prosecuting an appeal from a decree validating the will, upon the death of the heir pending the appeal, since the proceedings involved the only persons then interested, and the cousins were not beneficiaries, his administrator, in his naked right as administrator of the only “interested person,” could not (there being no creditors of the deceased heir’s estate), prosecute the appeal, either on behalf of the estate or of the cousins.

       The admission of a will to probate was only prima facie evidence of its validity and would not conclude the heirs at law as interested parties from contesting will within two years in manner prescribed by statute, where the heirs at law had not been made parties to the petition for the probate thereof.

      </p>
      <p>
       In proceeding to probate will and to remove administratrix theretofore appointed, chancery court was without jurisdiction to hear contest as to validity of will where none of the interested parties as such were before the court, and hence such parties would not be concluded by decree adjudicating validity of will.

       A chancery court did not have jurisdiction to hear a will contest where the executor failed to properly designate the beneficiaries as necessary parties, since the “interested and necessary parties” were not timely noticed and properly joined in the lawsuit; the chancellor should have joined all necessary and proper parties before exercising jurisdiction. Padron v. Martell (In re Estate of McClerkin), 651 So. 2d 1052, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 135 (Miss. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   In an action to probate a will, the chancellor erred in sustaining the executor’s and beneficiaries’ motions to dismiss a caveat against probate filed by will contestants on the ground that the will was not contested within 2 years as required by §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t91c07s91-7-23" target="_self">91-7-23</a></cite> where the beneficiaries were not listed as interested parties on the petition to probate the will, since the beneficiaries were necessary parties entitled to notice of the action. Padron v. Martell (In re Estate of McClerkin), 651 So. 2d 1052, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 135 (Miss. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       Pleadings filed by the executor and sole beneficiary of 1980 will constituted a caveat against or contest of 1982 will sought to be substituted for earlier will for probate. Trotter v. Trotter, 490 So. 2d 827, 1986 Miss. LEXIS 2485 (Miss. 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a will has been admitted to probate in common form as the last will of a testator, it will remain the last will of the testator unless (within the time allowed by law) it is set aside by an order of the chancery court upon a contest and issue devisavit vel non. Perry v. Aldrich, 251 Miss. 429, 169 So. 2d 786, 1964 Miss. LEXIS 361 (Miss. 1964).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where contest of a will was filed after admission of the will to probate by the clerk in vacation without notice to the objectors but before such admission was approved and confirmed by the court, such contest was not filed “before probate” within the meaning of this section [Code 1942, § 504], so as to preclude introduction in evidence of the probate of the will as prima facie evidence of its validity, in the trial of the will contest. Bigleben v. Henry, 196 Miss. 586, 17 So. 2d 602, 1944 Miss. LEXIS 238 (Miss. 1944).
      </p>
      <p>
       Entry by the clerk of his order in vacation admitting a will to probate is an adjudication by him that the instrument has been duly proven by the presentation thereof with the affidavits of the subscribing witnesses thereto attached. Bigleben v. Henry, 196 Miss. 586, 17 So. 2d 602, 1944 Miss. LEXIS 238 (Miss. 1944).
      </p>
      <p>
       Probate of a will in common form before the clerk in vacation should be deemed prima facie evidence of the validity of the will unless and until its invalidity shall have been determined by the court. Bigleben v. Henry, 196 Miss. 586, 17 So. 2d 602, 1944 Miss. LEXIS 238 (Miss. 1944).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where instrument purporting to be a will was admitted to probate by the clerk in vacation, without notice to the objectors, and will contest was filed thereafter but before approval and confirmation of clerk’s acts in question, and admission to probate was thereafter approved and confirmed over objection of contestants, and on subsequent trial of will contest probate of the instrument was offered in evidence but contestant offered no evidence, peremptory instruction in favor of proponent was correct. Bigleben v. Henry, 196 Miss. 586, 17 So. 2d 602, 1944 Miss. LEXIS 238 (Miss. 1944).

   Daughter of testator was not entitled to go forward on the daughter’s will contest filed in the forum county more than two years after the testator’s will was admitted to probate there. Pursuant to Miss.

      <p>
       The failure to join known interested parties within 2 years from the date of probate of a will did not require dismissal of a petition to contest the will; treatment of the “persons interested” as necessary parties would be governed by Rules 19 and 21, Miss. R. Civ. P., and therefore the chancery court was required to make the interested persons parties and process issue accordingly. Estate of Schneider, 585 So. 2d 1275, 1991 Miss.

   The word “probate” within the meaning of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t91c07s91-7-23" target="_self">91-7-23</a></cite> refers to the act of the clerk accepting the will for probate, rather than the date upon which the estate closed and, therefore, the 2-year limitations period runs from the date the clerk admits the will to probate.

       Attempt to contest will was unseasonable where, while chancery court was in vacation, chancery clerk on January 24, 1983, admitted will and codicils to probate, thereafter issuing Letters Testamentary; on June 13, 1983, chancellor entered order ratifying actions by chancery clerk conducted while court was in vacation; and, action to set aside will alleging mental incompetency when making will was commenced on May 6, 1985.

       In an action by a devisee under a 1935 will to perfect his title in certain realty, the trial court correctly dismissed the pending proceedings upon the motion of such devisee, even though a contest of the will had been filed, where it was discovered that the original will had been admitted to probate in 1937 and where the contestants made no attempt to come within the exceptions to the two-year statute of limitations for will contests.

       Under former provisions, it was held that in a proceeding on a petition for probate of a will and revocation of a will previously probated by the defendants, where the plaintiff had filed a petition within the two-year statute of limitations but did not request service of process to issue until after the limitation period, the suit was barred by limitations, since to constitute “legal filing” of the suit, so as to toll the statute of limitations, the presentation of the bill or petition to the clerk must be followed by the issuance of process in the normal and usual manner without undue delay. Knuckles v. Wells, 222 So. 2d 660 (Miss. 1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a will has been admitted to probate in common form as the last will of a testator, it will remain the last will of the testator unless within the time allowed by law it is set aside by an order of the chancery court upon a contest and issue devisavit vel non. Perry v. Aldrich, 251 Miss. 429, 169 So. 2d 786, 1964 Miss. LEXIS 361 (Miss. 1964).
      </p>
      <p>
       In the contest of a will, the burden was on the proponent to prove the validity of the will, i.e., that the testator had mental capacity to make it, and that he was not procured to make it by the pressure of undue influence upon him, and this burden was met by the introduction of evidence that the will had been duly admitted to probate. O'Bannon v. Henrich, 191 Miss. 815, 4 So. 2d 208, 1941 Miss. LEXIS 176 (Miss. 1941).
      </p>
      <p>
       The admission of a will to probate was only prima facie evidence of its validity and would not conclude the heirs at law as interested parties from contesting will within two years in manner prescribed by statute, where the heirs at law had not been made parties to the petition for the probate thereof. Austin v. Patrick, 179 Miss. 718, 176 So. 714, 1937 Miss. LEXIS 74 (Miss. 1937).
      </p>
      <p>
       Contest as to the validity of a will probated without notice must be brought in the court in which the will was probated, the contest being merely supplementary to and a continuation of, the probate proceedings, and, accordingly, the contest is not maintainable in federal courts.

   Grandchildren of decedent had no standing to maintain an action challenging the validity of the decedent’s will because they were not interest parties at the time of the will’s entry into probate as required by Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t91c07s91-7-23" target="_self">91-7-23</a></cite>.

       Putative illegitimate children were not interested persons because they failed to establish any right to inherit as illegitimates, therefore, they lacked standing to contest the last will and testament of the decedent.

      <p>
       A will contestant who alleged that she was the only natural child and heir at law of the decedent had standing to contest the will, even though she would take more under the will than she would without it under her existing status, since her status could change pending the hearing on heirship, and she would take more without the will than under the will if she was found to be the sole heir at law.

       Children of deceased, who entered into agreement with their father not to interfere with his plans as to the future or to make any claim on other property of decedent, in return for gift of property, were not barred from subsequently contesting will where the chancellor found that the agreement was lacking in certainty as to the purpose and extent of the waiver.

       An administrator is not such an “interested party” within statutes providing that a proponent may make all interested persons parties to application for probate of will and that any interested person may at any time within two years contest validity of will probated without notice, as is authorized to contest will subsequently presented for probate.

       Whether writing produced is testator’s will is sole question to be determined on issue of devisavit vel non, and questions as to construction, sufficiency of identification of beneficiaries, and description of property devised cannot be considered.

   Appellants’ claim that the chancellor erred in finding that a property interest had passed through inheritance was not considered on appeal where the argument was not raised before the chancellor, the will at issue was probated in 1986, no issue of concealed fraud had been raised, and thus, consistent with Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t91c07s91-7-23" target="_self">91-7-23</a></cite> (Rev. 2013), the inheritance issue was procedurally barred. Wood v. Miller, 179 So.3d 48, 2015 Miss.

       A will contest initiated by the daughter of a predeceased son of the decedent, in which she alleged that she was inadvertently omitted from the will, was time-barred where it was not commenced within two years, notwithstanding her contention that the executrix and the attorney for the estate intentionally misled her by stating that she did not need to worry because there was no objection to her and her siblings receiving a share of the estate since she knew from almost the moment the will was offered for probate that she was not included in the estate and the probate of the estate was not hidden from her. Williams v. Estate of Winding (In re Last Will & Testament of Winding), 783 So. 2d 707, 2001 Miss. LEXIS 102 (Miss. 2001).

       “Concealed fraud,” within statute extending time for contesting validity of will probated without notice, is designed fraud by which party knowing to whom right belongs conceals circumstances giving that right, thereby enabling himself to enter and hold.

       Chancery court’s judgment denying daughters’ petition to contest the will of their mother had to be reversed and set aside because all necessary parties were not joined. Schmidt v. True (In re Will of True), 220 So.3d 276, 2017 Miss. App. LEXIS 288 (Miss. Ct. App. 2017).
      </p>
      <p>
       A chancery court did not have jurisdiction to hear a will contest where the executor failed to properly designate the beneficiaries as necessary parties, since the “interested and necessary parties” were not timely noticed and properly joined in the lawsuit; the chancellor should have joined all necessary and proper parties before exercising jurisdiction. Padron v. Martell (In re Estate of McClerkin), 651 So. 2d 1052, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 135 (Miss. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   In an action to probate a will, the chancellor erred in sustaining the executor’s and beneficiaries’ motions to dismiss a caveat against probate filed by will contestants on the ground that the will was not contested within 2 years as required by §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t91c07s91-7-23" target="_self">91-7-23</a></cite> where the beneficiaries were not listed as interested parties on the petition to probate the will, since the beneficiaries were necessary parties entitled to notice of the action.

      </p>
      <p>
       The failure to join known interested parties within 2 years from the date of probate of a will did not require dismissal of a petition to contest the will; treatment of the “persons interested” as necessary parties would be governed by Rules 19 and 21, Miss. R. Civ. P., and therefore the chancery court was required to make the interested persons parties and process issue accordingly. Estate of Schneider, 585 So. 2d 1275, 1991 Miss. LEXIS 643 (Miss. 1991).

      </p>
      <p>
       Proponent’s failure to plead nonjoinder of necessary parties to will contest does not waive the objection. Moore v. Jackson, 247 Miss. 854, 157 So. 2d 785, 1963 Miss. LEXIS 364 (Miss. 1963).
      </p>
      <p>
       Heirs at law who would take property of the deceased in the absence of a valid will are necessary parties. Provenza v. Provenza, 201 Miss. 836, 29 So. 2d 669, 1947 Miss. LEXIS 453 (Miss. 1947).
      </p>
      <p>
       Once the court has acquired jurisdiction of all interested parties, jurisdiction is not lost by the withdrawal of an answer filed on behalf of one of the defendants by one duly authorized to make such filing. Provenza v. Provenza, 201 Miss. 836, 29 So. 2d 669, 1947 Miss. LEXIS 453 (Miss. 1947).
      </p>
      <p>
       In suit to confirm title to land, seeking construction of will to effect that it did not convey title to the land because it was devised to no named legatees, all the beneficiaries should have been under valid process. Dorsey v. Sullivan, 199 Miss. 602, 24 So. 2d 852, 1946 Miss. LEXIS 231 (Miss. 1946).
      </p>
      <p>
       All “interested parties,” or those whose interest detrimentally affected by will, are necessary parties to will contest; heirs at law who would take property but for will, are interested parties; where contestants rely on prior will, all beneficiaries therein are interested parties; all beneficiaries in intermediate will are necessary parties in will contest.

       Appellant was properly ordered to pay an estate’s attorneys’ fees under Miss. R. Civ. P. 11, as appellant’s arguments on the issue of his standing to contest the will were frivolous, his filings contained misrepresented facts, and the estate was forced to incur unnecessary attorney’s fees in responding to those filings.

       <p>
   As appellant failed to obtain a judgment, or status as a creditor of the estate, because the statute of limitations had expired and the action was not properly served upon the estate or the decedent during his lifetime, appellant did not have a direct pecuniary interest against the estate and thus was not an interested party under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t91c07s91-7-25" target="_self">91-7-25</a></cite>; therefore, he was not a proper party to the will contest. Covington v.

       The probation of 1980 will in common form and its admission to probate created prima facie evidence that the will was valid. Trotter v. Trotter, 490 So. 2d 827, 1986 Miss. LEXIS 2485 (Miss. 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       The probate of a will in common form is not a final adjudication of its validity but is an “incipient step” necessary to enable the court to proceed to carry the will into execution, and it is not conclusive against heirs and distributees, and if they desire to contest the validity of the will this shall be done by an issue devisavit vel non. Perry v. Aldrich, 251 Miss. 429, 169 So. 2d 786, 1964 Miss. LEXIS 361 (Miss. 1964).

       Will was properly upheld because the wife made a prima facie case for the will’s validity when she probated it in common form, and evidence indicated that although she and the testator had a close relationship, she had not overcome the testator’s will so as to exert undue influence on him. Estate of Chapman v. Chapman, 966 So. 2d 1262, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 722 (Miss. Ct. App. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       A will is not shown to have been duly admitted to probate in common form, by a record which fails to show compliance with Code 1942, § 501 and makes no attempt to excuse such noncompliance. Gibson v. Jones, 238 Miss. 186, 117 So. 2d 879, 1960 Miss. LEXIS 394 (Miss. 1960).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a will contest, proof of the probate is all that is required of proponents initially in meeting the burden of proof resting upon them. Wallace v. Harrison, 218 Miss. 153, 65 So. 2d 456, 1953 Miss. LEXIS 525 (Miss. 1953).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a will contest, a prima facie case was made by proponents by introduction of the proof of probate in common form and this extends to every aspect of the will touching upon its validity and without more, the proponents have introduced sufficient evidence to sustain their burden. Bearden v. Gibson, 215 Miss. 218, 60 So. 2d 655, 1952 Miss. LEXIS 555 (Miss. 1952).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a will contest where proponents introduced a record of probate of will in common form, it was not necessary that they go further and make proof of will by having one of subscribing witnesses present to testify. Bearden v. Gibson, 215 Miss. 218, 60 So. 2d 655, 1952 Miss. LEXIS 555 (Miss. 1952).
      </p>
      <p>
       Probate of will in common form before chancery clerk in vacation is prima facie evidence of validity of will until will is declared invalid and set aside by proper and lawful proceeding in proper court, having jurisdiction of subject matter and of parties in interest. Rice v. McMullen, 207 Miss. 706, 43 So. 2d 195, 1949 Miss. LEXIS 382 (Miss. 1949).
      </p>
      <p>
       Probate of a will in common form before the clerk in vacation should be deemed prima facie evidence of the validity of the will unless and until its invalidity shall have been determined by the court. Bigleben v. Henry, 196 Miss. 586, 17 So. 2d 602, 1944 Miss. LEXIS 238 (Miss. 1944).
      </p>
      <p>
       Entry by the clerk of his order in vacation admitting a will to probate is an adjudication by him that the instrument has been duly proven by the presentation thereof with the affidavits of the subscribing witnesses thereto attached. Bigleben v. Henry, 196 Miss. 586, 17 So. 2d 602, 1944 Miss. LEXIS 238 (Miss. 1944).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a will contest after probate, proponents of a will, executed in Texas, were not required to make proof of the validity of the will by having the subscribing witnesses present to testify, or their testimony in the form of depositions, and a prima facie case of the validity of the will was properly made out by introducing the probate of the will in common form by the affidavits of the subscribing witnesses who resided in Texas. Hilton v. Johnson, 194 Miss. 671, 12 So. 2d 524, 1943 Miss. LEXIS 77 (Miss. 1943).
      </p>
      <p>
       In the contest of a will, the burden was on the proponent to prove the validity of the will, i.e., that the testator had mental capacity to make it, and that he was not procured to make it by the pressure of undue influence upon him, and this burden was met by the introduction of evidence that the will had been duly admitted to probate. O'Bannon v. Henrich, 191 Miss. 815, 4 So. 2d 208, 1941 Miss. LEXIS 176 (Miss. 1941).

        1. Burden of proof.
       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       The proponent of a will at all times bears the burden of persuading the trier of fact on all issues requisite to the validity of the will, e.g., due execution and testamentary capacity. At the outset, the proponent bears the burden of producing evidence of due execution and testamentary capacity. This burden is conventionally met by offering the will itself, the affidavits of subscribing witnesses and the judgment admitting the will to probate; these offerings make out the proponent’s prima facie case. Once the proponent has shouldered his or her burden of production such that he or she has made out a prima facie case, the burden of production shifts to the contestants. The burden of persuading the trier of fact on the issues of due execution and testamentary capacity rests on the proponent throughout and never shifts to the contestants; that burden of persuasion is subject to the preponderance of the evidence standard. Clardy v. National Bank of Commerce, 555 So. 2d 64, 1989 Miss. LEXIS 507 (Miss. 1989).
      </p>
      <p>
       The burden of proof of a proponent of a will is met by the offering and receipt into evidence of the will and the record of its probate and a prima facie case is made by the proponent solely by this proof; the contestants then must offer proof to overcome such prima facie case and although the burden of proof is still with the proponent, the burden of going forward with proof of undue influence or lack of testamentary capacity, or other defenses, shifts to the contestants. Harris v. Sellers, 446 So. 2d 1012, 1984 Miss. LEXIS 1649 (Miss. 1984), overruled in part, Mullins v. Ratcliff, 515 So. 2d 1183, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2933 (Miss. 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a will contest an instruction for the proponents that the material inquiry was the capacity of a testator on the very day and at the very time of the execution of the instrument, properly informed the jury of the issue, and was not invalidated by additional language to the effect that such was true regardless of what the jury might think or believe as to the mental capacity of the testator at any other time. Sides v. Adams, 243 So. 2d 59, 1971 Miss. LEXIS 1502 (Miss. 1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       In will contest on ground of lack of testamentary capacity and existence of undue influence, there is but a single issue-will or no will, and burden is no proponent throughout. Blalock v. Magee, 205 Miss. 209, 38 So. 2d 708, 1949 Miss. LEXIS 426 (Miss. 1949).
      </p>
      <p>
       In cases where a too close issue of fact is involved, instructions on burden of proof should go no further than to advise jury that proponent of will or plaintiff in other civil cases is required to establish issue by preponderance of evidence. Blalock v. Magee, 205 Miss. 209, 38 So. 2d 708, 1949 Miss. LEXIS 426 (Miss. 1949).
      </p>
      <p>
       In will contest on ground of mental incapacity and undue influence, instructions are not prejudicially erroneous if, when all of instructions are considered as whole, jury is correctly informed that burden resting upon proponents is to show testamentary capacity and lack of undue influence by preponderance of evidence, although two of instructions given were to effect that burden of proof is upon proponents of will to show by preponderance of evidence that alleged testatrix was at time of execution of alleged will of sound and disposing mind and that if jury finds burden has not been met and that it is left uncertain and doubtful whether testatrix was of sound mind then jury should find for contestants. Blalock v. Magee, 205 Miss. 209, 38 So. 2d 708, 1949 Miss. LEXIS 426 (Miss. 1949).
      </p>
      <p>
       Instruction that probating of will was prima facie evidence of its validity, and that burden of proving forgery thereof was on contestant, held erroneous. Ellis v. Ellis, 160 Miss. 345, 134 So. 150, 1931 Miss. LEXIS 187 (Miss. 1931).
      </p>
      <p>
       Error in placing on contestant burden of proving will was forgery held not cured by instruction that burden was on proponent to prove signature was genuine. Ellis v. Ellis, 160 Miss. 345, 134 So. 150, 1931 Miss. LEXIS 187 (Miss. 1931).
      </p>
      <p>
       In suit to probate a will, and to cancel the probate of prior wills, the burden of proof was on complainant. Mims v. Johnson, 129 Miss. 403, 92 So. 577, 1922 Miss. LEXIS 58 (Miss. 1922).

       A daughter overcame the presumption of undue influence arising from her father’s execution of a will leaving her 1/2 of his estate to the exclusion of a friend and charitable organizations where the father had told 2 totally disinterested witnesses that he wanted to change his will, the will was executed openly at a medical center in the presence of the 2 subscribing witnesses and medical personnel, and there was evidence that the father understood the extent and value of his assets and was rational, strong-willed, and independent up until the time of his death. Pallatin v. Jones (In re Will of Fankboner), 638 So. 2d 493, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 314 (Miss. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       The test for rebutting a presumption of undue influence has been modified and no longer requires the independent advice of a competent person, but instead requires a showing of the grantor’s “independent consent and action.” Marsalis v. Lehmann, 566 So. 2d 217, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 532 (Miss. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence that testator of advanced years living in nursing home was dependent upon beneficiary to some degree is insufficient basis for finding of confidential relationship resulting in will being product of undue influence where there is no proof that testator looked to beneficiary to care for personal needs, to tend to him, or to handle his affairs. In re Will & Estate of Varvaris, 477 So. 2d 273, 1985 Miss. LEXIS 2256 (Miss. 1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       In an action contesting a will there is a presumption of undue influence that the law imposes where a confidential or fiduciary relationship exists. Harris v. Sellers, 446 So. 2d 1012, 1984 Miss. LEXIS 1649 (Miss. 1984), overruled in part, Mullins v. Ratcliff, 515 So. 2d 1183, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2933 (Miss. 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a proceeding devisavit vel non involving a will which was challenged on the ground of lack of testamentary capacity and of undue influence, the submission to jury of both issues was error where the evidence as to undue influence was insufficient. In re Alexander's Will, 221 Miss. 478, 73 So. 2d 172, 1954 Miss. LEXIS 553 (Miss. 1954).
      </p>
      <p>
       In will contest on ground of lack of testamentary capacity and existence of undue influence, general verdict of jury on issue of whether or not proponents have shown by preponderance of evidence both testamentary capacity and lack of undue influence at time of execution of will should be sustained if proponents fail to prove either or both of these necessary requirements. Blalock v. Magee, 205 Miss. 209, 38 So. 2d 708, 1949 Miss. LEXIS 426 (Miss. 1949).
      </p>
      <p>
       In will contest on ground of lack of testamentary capacity and existence of undue influence, it should be assumed that general verdict of jury against validity of will was on ground of want of testamentary capacity which was amply supported by evidence, where proof was insufficient to sustain verdict on ground of undue influence. Blalock v. Magee, 205 Miss. 209, 38 So. 2d 708, 1949 Miss. LEXIS 426 (Miss. 1949).
      </p>
      <p>
       As to undue influence testator’s declarations at time of execution of will admissible as res gestae. Sanders v. Sanders, 126 Miss. 610, 89 So. 261, 1921 Miss. LEXIS 70 (Miss. 1921).
      </p>
      <p>
       Instruction on “undue influence” omitting element of destruction of free agency, is erroneous. Scally v. Wardlaw, 123 Miss. 857, 86 So. 625, 1920 Miss. LEXIS 89 (Miss. 1920).

      </p>
      <p>
       On an issue devisavit vel non, where the question is as to the sanity of the testator, the contestants are not required to prove his insanity beyond all reasonable doubt. King v. Rowan, 82 Miss. 1, 34 So. 325, 1903 Miss. LEXIS 158 (Miss. 1903).
      </p>
      <p>
       Upon an issue devisavit vel non, an instruction for contestants is erroneous if it authorizes the jury, without qualification or limitation, to consider the reasonableness or unreasonableness of the will. King v. Rowan, 82 Miss. 1, 34 So. 325, 1903 Miss. LEXIS 158 (Miss. 1903).

Fisher, 353 So. 2d 497, 1977 Miss. LEXIS 2002 (Miss. 1977).
      </p>
      <p>
       The probate of a will in common form is not a final adjudication of its validity but is an “incipient step” necessary to enable the court to proceed to carry the will into execution, and it is not conclusive against heirs and distributees, and if they desire to contest the validity of the will this shall be done by an issue devisavit vel non.

   Chancellor erred in holding that Miss.

   Trial court had jurisdiction to admit to probate in Mississippi the will of nondomiciliary as the decedent had lived in a Mississippi county for more than 30 years, and the chancery court properly determined that at the time of his death decedent would have owned some clothing or other personal property in the county, and Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t91c07s91-7-33" target="_self">91-7-33</a></cite> does not require that the property be of a certain value or amount. In re Estate of Kelly v.

Before granting such administration, each executor named in the will and testament who has not renounced the executorship shall be summoned to show cause why administration should not be granted. If any executor named be absent from the state at the time of the probate of the will and administration should be granted during his absence, such executor shall be allowed forty days after his return to make application for letters testamentary and, on his qualifying, the letters of administration shall be revoked; and the administrator shall deliver all the estate which has come to his hands to the executor and settle the account of his administration.

    Executor as residuary legatee.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      If the executor be a residuary legatee, he may, instead of the bond required of other executors, give bond payable to the state in a sum, with two or more sureties, to the satisfaction of the court or clerk, conditioned to pay all the debts and legacies of the testator within one year. In such case the executor shall not be required to return an inventory or appraisement, but he shall file with his petition a sworn statement of the amount of the indebtedness of the testator, so far as he can ascertain the same. The giving of such bond shall not discharge the estate of the testator from liability for the payment of his debts; and such bond shall be subject to suits in the same manner as the bond required of other executors.

      If the testator, by will, direct that his executor shall not be required to give bond, then none shall be required unless the court or the clerk, at the time of granting the letters or afterwards, shall have reason to require bond, in which event it shall be the duty of the court or clerk to require bond with sufficient sureties. If any creditor of such testator petition the court or the clerk in vacation, under oath, stating his claim and that he believes he is in danger of losing his demand, or some of it, by the bad management of said estate or by the personal insolvency of the executor, such executor, having had five days’ notice of the petition, shall be required to give a bond with sureties, to be approved by the court or clerk in vacation, payable to said creditor in a sufficient sum to cover his legal demand, and conditioned to save him from all loss by reason of any act or omission of such executor. Instead of such bond, the executor may give bond as if he had not been relieved from it by the will. If the bond required in either case be not given, it shall be the duty of the court or clerk to remove the executor and grant letters of administration, with the will annexed, to some other person.

       Judicial estoppel applied because plaintiff had a duty to discover all of the assets of his father’s estate before he agreed to close the estate and he could not now take a position that was opposed to his previous position which was to his benefit at the time.

       Although one person may be named as both executrix and testamentary trustee, the executrix performs only such duties and powers granted to her as the law and will designates, and the power designated by the will only for the testamentary trustee does not transfer to the executrix unless the will so designates.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Whenever any last will and testament shall empower and direct the executor as to the sale of property, the payment of debts and legacies, and the management of the estate, the directions of the will shall be followed by the executor, and the provisions herein contained shall not so operate as to require the executor to pursue a different course from that prescribed in the will, if it be lawful. If land be directed by the will to be sold, the sale shall be made and the proper conveyance executed by the executors, or such of them as shall undertake the execution of the will, or by the person appointed by the will to execute the trust. If the executor fail to qualify or die before he execute the will, and if the person appointed fail to execute the trust, the sale shall be made by the administrator with the will annexed. The executor shall, in all cases, make publication for creditors to probate their claims, as required in the administration of the estates of intestates and with like effect, any provision of the will to the contrary notwithstanding.

       Chancery court did not err by considering the final accounting, the petition to close a decedent’s estate, and the wife’s objections to the final accounting because the daughter, who was appointed executor, repeatedly failed to comply with the chancery court’s orders; as executor, the daughter bore a responsibility to administer and close the estate, and she could not complain of errors she caused by failing to properly fulfill her duty. Chester v. Labasse (In re Estate of Labasse), 242 So.3d 167, 2017 Miss. App. LEXIS 540 (Miss. Ct. App. 2017), cert. denied, 246 So.3d 70, 2018 Miss. LEXIS 192 (Miss. 2018).

       Crops growing on devised land at time of death of testatrix which are not needed by executor for payment of debts or cost of administration of estate pass to devisee of land rather than into estate for benefit of residuary legatees where will devised land and all trucks, farm implements, tractors and equipment thereon and directed that immediately after death of devisor devisee should be vested with entire control over her part of property.

       Where a power of sale of the real estate is conferred by a testator because of his personal trust and confidence in the named executors neither the surviving executor, where more than one is designated, nor an administrator with the will annexed, where the named executors fail to qualify, die or resign, can convey title to the real property of testator without a valid order of court authorizing and empowering the sale and conveyance.

      </p>

       Under will providing “after my house and the rest of jewelry have been sold, I want the money equally divided between two named legatees,” and “should either boy die before of age this money to revert to the estate for further distribution of other request,” executrix had implied power to sell the realty, although proceeds therefrom were not to be delivered until the legatees became of age.

       Sale by executrix of realty under power of sale in will is not a judicial sale, and needs no court order justifying it. Davis v. Sturdivant, 197 Miss. 139, 19 So. 2d 499, 1944 Miss. LEXIS 284 (Miss. 1944).

       Decision to sell, made by executor, given discretion by will to sell or to operate wholesale grocery business, cannot be said to be other than act of ordinarily prudent business man, when success of business was due to decedent, whose place could not be filled because of war, great uncertainty prevailed in business field, good sale could be made, and objectors showed no certainty of profit from operations, or better sale later after attempt at continuation of business. Walker v. First Nat'l Bank, 204 Miss. 696, 38 So. 2d 98, 1948 Miss. LEXIS 398 (Miss. 1948).
      </p>
      <p>
       Supreme court will not say that confirmation of sale of wholesale grocery business by executor, acting under authority of will, was manifestly wrong, when it is not pointed out by what means or manner a higher price could have been obtained for the assets of the estate nor in what respect beneficiaries in will suffered any loss.

       Sale of decedent’s property without legal citation to beneficiaries in will is valid where will relieves executor from legal citation to interested parties. Walker v. First Nat'l Bank, 204 Miss. 696, 38 So. 2d 98, 1948 Miss. LEXIS 398 (Miss. 1948).
      </p>
      <p>
       Objection to executor’s sale of wholesale grocery business on ground that it was not sufficiently advertised is not well taken when, under the terms of will under which sale was made, no public notice of proposed sale was required to be given. Walker v. First Nat'l Bank, 204 Miss. 696, 38 So. 2d 98, 1948 Miss. LEXIS 398 (Miss. 1948).
      </p>
      <p>
       Objection to executor’s sale of wholesale grocery business on ground that it was not sufficiently advertised is not well taken where publication containing elements of sale was made in three newspapers for period of approximately a week, prospective bidders were notified by telephone and letters, many people inspected property, successful bid exceeded appraised value, and objectors produced no proof more than possibility or speculation that had sale been postponed for ten or twenty days there would have been higher, or more numerous, bids on the later date. Walker v. First Nat'l Bank, 204 Miss. 696, 38 So. 2d 98, 1948 Miss. LEXIS 398 (Miss. 1948).
      </p>
      <p>
       Fact that no notice was given to interested parties respecting sale of realty by executrix under power of sale in will, either in proceedings for sale or those whereby directions of court were sought, does not constitute a valid defense in executrix’s suit against purchaser at sale for specific performance. Davis v. Sturdivant, 197 Miss. 139, 19 So. 2d 499, 1944 Miss. LEXIS 284 (Miss. 1944).

       Executrix would be surcharged for the amount the testamentary trust property was damaged or put in jeopardy due to her mortgaging of estate’s unencumbered real property as security for debt incurred by testator which was never probated. Harper v. Harper, 491 So. 2d 189, 1986 Miss. LEXIS 2508 (Miss. 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       Reasonable expenditures for better sale of land were properly made out of general funds of estate where will directed sale of land and payment of proceeds, in different amounts, to special legatees with provision for reduction in proper proportion of each in event property did not sell for total amount devised, since special legatees are to be favored over residuary legatees to end that they may receive entire amount bequeathed to them respectively if property designated for that purpose could be caused to bring enough for that purpose by reasonable expenditures to promote advantageous sale. Oberst v. Mullens, 43 So. 2d 560 (Miss. 1949).
      </p>
      <p>
       Unpaid taxes did not constitute valid defense to executrix’s suit for specific performance against purchaser of realty sold under power of sale in will, since executrix has duty under Code 1942, § 572 to pay the taxes and such obligation can be readily accounted for under the decree for specific performance. Davis v. Sturdivant, 197 Miss. 139, 19 So. 2d 499, 1944 Miss. LEXIS 284 (Miss. 1944).

      <p>
       A testamentary power of sale conferred on two named executors did not survive the death of one of them and sales of real property made by the surviving executor were set aside where the intention of the testator, as indicated by repeated references in the will to actions to be taken by the co-executors in their joint discretion, was that the power of the remaining executor not survive. Reynolds v. State, 331 So. 2d 913, 1976 Miss. LEXIS 1887 (Miss. 1976).
      </p>
      <p>
       The court would not order specific performance of a contract for the sale of land, which contract was signed by only one of two coexecutors where the second coexecutor knew nothing of the execution of the will and had not authorized the other executor to sign it for him, and where the contract itself did not purport to be signed by the executor for himself and for the coexecutor as joint executors, and where, although the second coexecutor signed a deed as contemplated by the contract, such deed was delivered not to the purchaser but merely to the attorney for the two coexecutors, such act not constituting delivery of the deed nor a ratification of the contract by the second coexecutor.

     <p>
      Whenever it shall be necessary for the care and preservation of the estate of a decedent before the grant of letters testamentary, or of administration, to the person entitled thereto, the chancery court or chancellor in vacation, or the clerk of such court, on the petition of any creditor or other interested person, shall appoint a suitable person to be known as “temporary administrator.” The person named as executor or the person apparently entitled to letters of administration may be appointed temporary administrator, unless the court shall find that the circumstances require the appointment of a different person.
     </p>
     <p>
      Whenever an appeal shall be taken from the grant of letters testamentary, or of administration, or whenever a last will and testament shall be contested, the chancery court or chancellor in vacation, on petition of any interested person, may appoint a temporary administrator if it shall appear necessary for the protection of the rights of the parties, and may make such appointment on such terms and impose such conditions as may seem proper.
     </p>
     <p>
      The powers of such temporary administrator may be special or general, as the court may find proper, and he may be authorized to take charge of, preserve, and administer the estate until the appeal or contest shall be determined. Letters may be issued to him in ordinary form, except that he shall be therein designated as temporary administrator, and any terms or conditions imposed shall be stated therein; and the letters shall state that he is to act only until another appointment shall be made, either temporary or permanent.

       It was not an abuse of discretion to appoint a decedent’s son as the administrator of the decedent’s estate, even though the son was not so named in the decedent’s will, because (1) the administrator named in the will died, (2) the court had considerable discretion to appoint a temporary administrator to conserve the estate, and (3) the decedent’s daughters received sufficient notice of the appointment during the course of the litigation. Flowers v. Flowers (In re Estate of Flowers), 269 So.3d 120, 2018 Miss. App. LEXIS 2 (Miss. Ct. App. 2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because a chancellor applied the wrong legal standard and incorrectly believed that only uncontested evidence was sufficient to remove the executor of the decedent’s estate, remand was necessary for a determination of whether a temporary executor was to be appointed. On remand, the chancellor was to use the correct legal standard, with the understanding that it is within the chancellor’s discretion to remove the executor even though the will contestant’s evidence may have been contested. Parker v. Benoist, 160 So.3d 198, 2015 Miss. LEXIS 113 (Miss. 2015).
      </p>
      <p>
       On a will contest, the chancellor was justified in refusing to appoint a temporary administrator of the estate when, at the time the opponent of the will filed his petition to probate a later will in solemn form, the executrix, acting under an earlier will previously admitted to probate, had fully administered the estate, including notice to creditors and payment of all debts properly probated and nothing remained to be done except final distribution of the assets after a final decree of the court terminating the litigation. Cupit v. International Paper Co., 196 So. 2d 521, 1967 Miss. LEXIS 1489 (Miss. 1967).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a will probated in common form is contested, the executor may be temporarily removed pending the contest, and a temporary administrator appointed, without first finding the executor disqualified or guilty of misconduct. Sandifer v. Sandifer, 237 Miss. 464, 115 So. 2d 46, 1959 Miss. LEXIS 491 (Miss. 1959).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a proceeding on a petition for appointment of a permanent administrator, where the chancery court’s determination of the heirs at law was not final because of a pending appeal, the appropriate action was appointment of a suitable person to act as a temporary administrator until the legal heirs of the decedent were finally determined. In re Estate of Burnside, 227 Miss. 110, 85 So. 2d 817, 1956 Miss. LEXIS 660 (Miss. 1956).
      </p>
      <p>
       The status of an administrator is an issue distinct from other matters and it is not necessary that an appeal from an order withdrawing letters of administration await the final determination of the estate, and to hold otherwise would defeat the claim of a petitioner by permitting the incumbent to serve throughout the entire administration. Wells v. Boatner, 216 Miss. 108, 61 So. 2d 662, 1952 Miss. LEXIS 622 (Miss. 1952).

       Chancery court has power under this section [Code 1942, § 520] to continue widow of deceased testator as administratrix for purpose of sale of land to pay debts in absence of sufficient personalty therefore, and failure of the court, after the existence of the will became known, to change the letters of administration granted to widow and sole heir at law to letters as temporary administratrix pending a will contest, did not render the action of the court absolutely void in ordering the land sold by her, but only voidable at most, since the court had constitutional jurisdiction of the subject matter and jurisdiction of all the parties in interest. Gill v. Johnson, 206 Miss. 707, 40 So. 2d 600, 1949 Miss. LEXIS 295 (Miss. 1949).

    Estate to be appraised.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Before the temporary administrator shall act as such, he shall take and subscribe an oath at or prior to the time of his appointment to faithfully discharge the duties required of him by law as such temporary administrator, and shall give bond, payable to the state, in such penalty and with such sureties as may be approved by the court or clerk, conditioned for the faithful discharge of the duties required of him as such temporary administrator by law or by order of the court or clerk. Thereupon, the estate shall be appraised as now provided by law upon the grant of letters testamentary or of administration, unless the same shall be dispensed with by the court or clerk. The temporary administrator shall make and return to the court a complete inventory of the estate, as is required by law to be made by executors in general or regular administrators, and, as soon as practicable, shall publish the notice provided by law to be published by executors and administrators, requiring creditors to have their claims against the estate probated and registered. All the provisions of the law governing such notice, the proof and registering of claims, and the bar of such as are not proved and registered shall apply when the notice is published by the temporary administrator, as when published by an executor or a general or regular administrator. When the temporary administrator shall have published such notice, no further notice to creditors to have their claims probated and registered shall be given or published upon any subsequent grant of letters testamentary or of administration; and where the estate has been appraised upon the appointment of a temporary administrator, no other appraisement shall be made upon the grant of letters testamentary or of the administration thereafter, unless the court or clerk shall deem the appraisement necessary or advisable.

    Powers of temporary administrator.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The temporary administrator shall have power, and it shall be his duty, to collect the goods, chattels, personal property and debts of the decedent and to give acquittances for debts and liabilities upon payment. He may sue and be sued in all cases in which a general or regular administrator may sue or be sued; and suits brought by or against him shall not abate by the termination of his authority, but may be prosecuted by or against the executor or administrator thereafter appointed, and judgments recovered by or against him may be enforced by or against the executor or regular administrator thereafter appointed. The court, or chancellor in vacation, may at any time authorize the temporary administrator to sell such of the estate as may be perishable, likely to deteriorate in value, or be expensive to keep, and to dispose of any crops for cash, and to account for such property sold or disposed of. The court or chancellor, in ordering the sale of such property, shall take into consideration any disposition thereof by last will and testament, in case there be such, and shall order the sale of such property or not, as may be best for the parties in interest. After ninety (90) days from the time the temporary administrator was appointed and the time for probating claims has expired, the court or chancellor in vacation may order the temporary administrator to pay the claims of creditors and to hold the balance of the estate to await the ultimate probate or defeat of such last will and testament. In case the court, or chancellor in vacation, shall order the temporary administrator to pay creditors and make distribution, or to do either, he shall have all the powers and rights for the purpose over the estate, real and personal, that are conferred by law upon general or regular administrators; and all laws governing the acts and duties of a general or regular administrator shall then apply to and govern the temporary administrator.

     <p>
      On the grant of letters testamentary or of administration, the powers of a temporary administrator shall cease, and it shall be his duty at once to settle his accounts with the court or chancellor in vacation and to deliver all the estate that may be in his hands to the person to whom letters testamentary or of administration shall have been granted. In case of refusal, the court or chancellor may proceed against him by attachment and impose a fine, as for a contempt, not exceeding twenty percent (20%) upon the amount of the estate in his hands; and his bond may be put in suit by the executor or administrator. The temporary administrator shall, at the same time, furnish the executor or administrator with a list of all judgments or suits to which he is a party. The court, or chancellor in vacation, may allow the temporary administrator such compensation as may be just, not exceeding five percent (5%) on the amount of the estate inventoried by him.

       Letters of administration shall be granted by the chancery court of the county in which the intestate had, at the time of his death, a fixed place of residence; but if the intestate did not have a fixed place of residence, then by the chancery court of the county where the intestate died, or that in which his personal property or some part of it may be. The court shall grant letters of administration to the relative who may apply, preferring first the husband or wife and then such others as may be next entitled to distribution if not disqualified, selecting amongst those who may stand in equal right the person or persons best calculated to manage the estate; or the court may select a stranger, a trust company organized under the laws of this state, or of a national bank doing business in this state, if the kindred be incompetent. If such person does not apply for administration within thirty (30) days from the death of an intestate, the court may grant administration to a creditor or to any other suitable person.

   Because the evidence indicated that the decedent had not divorced her former husband when she purportedly married the administrator, a chancellor did not abuse his discretion under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t91c07s91-7-63ol11" target="_self">91-7-63(1)</a></cite> in removing and replacing the administrator. Estate of Wallace v. Mohamed, 55 So.3d 1057, 2011 Miss.

   Widower who was replaced as administrator should have remained administrator for his wife’s estate; given the statutory order of preference in Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t91c07s91-7-63ol11" target="_self">91-7-63(1)</a></cite>, he was preferred to serve over the chancery court clerk because he was the natural father of one of his wife’s heirs.

Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t91c07s91-7-63ol11" target="_self">91-7-63(1)</a></cite>, because the evidence before the chancery court was wholly inadequate to show that the widower was not the decedent’s legal husband at the time of her death. There were no clerks’ certificates affirmatively showing that there was no divorce in counties where the decedent and her prior husband had lived. Estate of Wallace v.

   Where an administratrix was appointed in a county with no evidence that the decedent resided there, then the estate was transferred to the decedent’s county of residence and the estate filed a negligence action against defendants, summary judgment should have been granted to defendants because under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t91c07s91-7-63ol11" target="_self">91-7-63(1)</a></cite>, no legitimate estate ever existed and the appointment of the administratrix was void.

   Status as executrix de son tort, in favor of alleged illegitimate child of deceased musician, was assumed when irrevocable power of attorney was accepted from decedent’s half-sister after half-sister had assigned all rights to musician’s copyrights, as well as by later accepting appointment as personal representative of half-sister’s estate. Johnson v. Harris (In re Estate of Johnson), 705 So. 2d 819, 1997 Miss. LEXIS 381 (Miss. 1997), cert. denied, Harris v.

   Although the appointment of non-distributee relatives lies within the discretion of the chancery court under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t91c07s91-7-63" target="_self">91-7-63</a></cite>, a non-distributee relative had a legal right to letters of administration under the statute where she was the guardian of the sole minor heir.

       Notice to creditors of decedent’s estate signed by the then duly appointed and qualified administrator was valid, notwithstanding that he was removed, on motion of decedent’s widow, on the same date that notice to the creditors was first published, and a creditor’s claim filed some 2 months after expiration of the 90 day period from first publication date was time barred.

   Widow’s failure to qualify as administratrix did not adversely affect the rights of husband’s insurer to recover on items covered by a subrogation agreement and the subrogation provisions of policy since the insurer had the right under Code 1972 §§<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t91c07s91-7-61" target="_self">91-7-61</a></cite>,<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t91c07s91-7-63" target="_self">91-7-63</a></cite>, to apply for and receive letters of administration to conduct whatever suits it deemed necessary to enforce its right.

       <p>
   The provision of a state probate code giving a mandatory preference for appointment as administrator of a decedent’s estate to a male applicant over a female applicant otherwise equally qualified violates the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment; giving a mandatory preference to members of either sex over members of the other, merely to accomplish the elimination of a hearing on the merits of the applicants, constitutes an arbitrary legislative choice forbidden by the Fourteenth Amendment. Reed v. Reed, <cite class="us_code">404 U.S. 71</cite>, <cite class="s_court">92 S. Ct. 251</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">30 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 225, 1971 U.S. LEXIS 8 (U.S. 1971).

       A daughter of a decedent who is his sole heir and distributee, and fully competent, is entitled, as against decedent’s guardian, to be appointed administratrix of his estate. Moore v. Roecker, 239 Miss. 606, 124 So. 2d 473, 1960 Miss. LEXIS 329 (Miss. 1960).

       Action of attorneys for plaintiff, who had a cause of action arising out of a motor vehicle collision, in actively participating in securing the appointment of another as administrator of decedent’s estate in order that the action against the estate might be brought in Simpson County and, thus, draw two other codefendants into the circuit court of that county was not improper, in the absence of a fraudulent agreement between plaintiff’s attorneys and the administrator, and the codefendant’s motion for a change of venue was properly denied. Great Southern Box Co. v. Barrett, 231 Miss. 101, 94 So. 2d 912, 1957 Miss. LEXIS 494 (Miss. 1957).
      </p>
      <p>
       A chancellor has large discretion in the selection of the person to be appointed administrator of an estate except in cases made mandatory by the statute. In re Estate of Burnside, 227 Miss. 110, 85 So. 2d 817, 1956 Miss. LEXIS 660 (Miss. 1956).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a proceeding on a petition for an appointment of an administrator, where a will appointing executors for decedent’s estate was set aside, the court did not abuse its discretion in denying an application for appointment as administrator and declining to remove the executors theretofore appointed. In re Estate of Burnside, 227 Miss. 110, 85 So. 2d 817, 1956 Miss. LEXIS 660 (Miss. 1956).

       Executor or administrator is regarded as officer of court subject to direction, supervision and control of court until estate is closed and he is finally discharged. Bailey v. Sayle, 206 Miss. 757, 40 So. 2d 618, 1949 Miss. LEXIS 298 (Miss. 1949).
      </p>

       Chancellor has large measure of discretion, within limitations, in appointment and revocation of administration of decedents’ estates. Stribling v. Washington, 204 Miss. 529, 37 So. 2d 759, 1948 Miss. LEXIS 386 (Miss. 1948).
      </p>
      <p>
       The right of husband, wife, or distributees to preference in granting of administration of intestate’s estate is legal right, unless incompetent, but matter is within sound discretion of court as to others. Stribling v. Washington, 204 Miss. 529, 37 So. 2d 759, 1948 Miss. LEXIS 386 (Miss. 1948).
      </p>
      <p>
       Removal of appointed administratrix and appointment of deceased’s widow on petition by widow filed more than thirty days after intestate’s death is exercise of sound discretion of chancellor and proper when original administratrix was appointed on petition of daughter who withheld from chancellor all information as to widow, stating deceased was survived by three children, and widow knew nothing of proceedings and did not know administration was necessary. Stribling v. Washington, 204 Miss. 529, 37 So. 2d 759, 1948 Miss. LEXIS 386 (Miss. 1948).
      </p>
      <p>
       Appointment of one other than husband of deceased as administrator within thirty-day period is not void, but appointee is subject to removal on husband’s application within thirty days, provided husband is fit person for appointment. Kevey v. Johnson, 167 Miss. 775, 150 So. 532, 1933 Miss. LEXIS 152 (Miss. 1933).
      </p>

       Where a nonresident and a resident were killed in an automobile collision in Mississippi allegedly as the result of the nonresident’s negligence, the heirs of the deceased resident had a cause of action against the personal representative of the deceased nonresident under the wrongful death statute Code 1942, § 1453, and were creditors of the nonresident’s estate, and upon their petition the chancery court of the county where the nonresident’s death occurred had jurisdiction to grant administration upon the estate of the nonresident.

       Provision of this section [Code 1942, § 525] that if such persons as are preferred do not apply for administration within thirty days from death of intestate court may grant administration to creditor or other person is primarily for benefit of creditors, and only secondarily for benefit of persons inferior in priority to right to administer.

       The receiver of an alleged creditor of a decedent could not request appointment of administrator for decedent’s estate, unless it appeared that decedent died owing debt to alleged creditor. Thompson v. Carter's Estate, 180 Miss. 104, 177 So. 356, 1937 Miss. LEXIS 117 (Miss. 1937).
      </p>

       The possession and ownership of a decedent’s note on which there was a balance due disclosed, prima facie, such a debt as entitled receiver of alleged creditor of decedent to request appointment of administrator for decedent’s estate.

      The person to whom administration is granted, at or prior to the granting thereof, shall take and prescribe the following oath:
     </p>
     <p>
      “I do swear that_______________ , deceased, died without any will, as far as I know or believe, and that I, if and when appointed, will well and truly administer all the goods, chattels, and credits of the deceased, and pay his debts as far as his goods, chattels, and credits will extend and the law requires me, and that I will make a true and perfect inventory of the said goods, chattels, and credits, and a just account, when thereto required. So help me God.”

      He shall give bond in a penalty equal to the value of all the personal estate, with such sureties as may be approved by the court or clerk, payable to the state, with condition in form or to the effect following, to wit:
     </p>
     <p>
      “The condition of this bond is, that if the above bound_______________ , as administrator of the goods, chattels, rights, and credits of_______________ , deceased, shall faithfully discharge all the duties required of him by law, then this obligation shall be void.”

      Upon the death intestate of any person under legal disability for whom a guardian, conservator or other fiduciary has been appointed by a court of competent jurisdiction and is serving, the judge or clerk of such court, upon proof of death of such person, may issue letters of administration to the already acting fiduciary, unless some relative or other person entitled to administer the estate shall within thirty days after the death of such person apply to the court for such administration. Upon the issuance of letters of administration to the already acting fiduciary, such fiduciary shall thereupon publish notice to creditors and administer the decedent’s estate in the manner required by law. Such fiduciary’s bond shall continue in force and he shall make only one (1) final account, unless the court, on the motion of any interested party or its own motion, shall require additional bond or accounting.

      Every administrator de bonis non shall be entitled to all choses in action taken or held by any former executor or administrator, and may institute suit therefor and, if necessary, enjoin the former executor or administrator from collecting the same. He may sue on the bond of any former executor or administrator of the estate, where the estate is insolvent or where suit and recovery may be necessary for the payment of the debts of the estate, for any money due by the former executor or administrator and which should have been accounted for and paid over by him. Where it shall be necessary for the payment of debts of the estate, an administrator de bonis non may except to the final account of a former executor or administrator, or surcharge and falsify an annual or partial settlement of such former executor or administrator, or file and maintain a bill to review any order or decree of the court allowing the account of such executor or administrator, in the same manner that distributees or legatees may do. The court or chancellor may require of an administrator de bonis non an additional bond to cover the money sought to be recovered by any such proceedings.

       Administrator’s right to recover funds wrongfully paid to deceased’s sisters and to guardian of deceased’s illegitimate child passed to administratrix de bonis non upon her appointment, and it was her right and duty to recover such funds. National Surety Corp. v. Laughlin, 178 Miss. 499, 172 So. 490, 1937 Miss. LEXIS 187 (Miss. 1937).

       While, under statute, administrator de bonis non is entitled to all choses in action taken or held by former administrator, and can maintain suit therefor, he can sue on bond of former administrator only in case estate is insolvent or where suit and recovery may be necessary for payment of debts of estate.

He shall administer the estate, as in other cases, under the direction of the court, with the same rights and liabilities as executors and other administrators. The county administrator shall not be bound to incur or be liable for costs, except such as the estate in his hands, in excess of his commissions shall be sufficient to pay. On the final settlement of the estate, he shall be allowed by the court, as his commissions, a sum not to exceed ten percent (10%) on the whole estate administered. The county administrator may also be appointed temporary administrator pending an appeal from the grant of letters testamentary or of administration, and administrator to institute suit in proper cases. He shall be liable in all cases on his official bond for his acts, and another bond need not be executed by him in any case unless, his official bond being insufficient, the court shall require an additional bond, or where he may be required to give bond to account for the proceeds of a sale of land.

   Executor’s misrepresentation of the true facts to the chancery court (his brother’s known claims of ownership to the livestock and the evidence of a valid inter vivos gift by the decedent), amounted to “improper conduct” under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t91c07s91-7-85" target="_self">91-7-85</a></cite>, and his removal as executor of the estate was proper. Further, the chancellor properly found that the executor (and his attorney), violated the Mississippi Litigation Accountability Act, Miss. Code Ann. §§<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.11.html#t11c55s11-55-1" target="_blank">11-55-1</a></cite> through<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.11.html#t11c55s11-55-1" target="_blank">11-55-1</a></cite>5 (Rev. 2002), and Miss. R. Civ. P. 11(b), by their misrepresentations in obtaining an order from the chancery court, permitting them to retrieve the subject livestock, and the chancellor’s award of attorney’s fees and expenses was proper. In re Estate of Ladner v. Ladner, 909 So. 2d 1051, 2004 Miss. LEXIS 1356 (Miss. 2004) (Miss. – 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancellor’s removal of executrix of decedent’s estate was amply supported by record showing that she had paid unprobated claims, had failed to timely file estate tax returns, and had paid attorney’s fees without court approval, as well as conflicts of interest in the matter of administering the estate. Harper v. Harper, 491 So. 2d 189, 1986 Miss. LEXIS 2508 (Miss. 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the chancellor had the power to appoint a temporary administrator, it followed that if an executor had qualified, such executor must be removed during the pendency of the will contest in order to permit the temporary administrator to perform his duties pending the outcome of the contest, but since the petition for appointment of the temporary administrator was not brought under this section [Code 1942, § 536], if the will is upheld, appellant would be entitled to resume the office of executor, unless and until he is removed permanently under appropriate proceedings.

       Where an instrument was considered to be a deed and there was a grant of intestate administration, this was not res judicata on the issue whether testator died leaving a will, and the grant of testator administration is not a bar to the subsequent probate of a will. White v. Inman, 212 Miss. 237, 54 So. 2d 375, 1951 Miss. LEXIS 447 (Miss. 1951).

      <p>
       Chancery court has power under Code 1942, § 520, to continue widow of deceased testator as administratrix for purpose of sale of land to pay debts in absence of sufficient personalty therefor, and failure of the court, after the existence of the will became known, to change the letters of administration granted to widow and sole heir at law to letters as temporary administratrix pending a will contest, did not render the action of the court absolutely void in ordering the land sold by her, but only voidable at most, since the court had constitutional jurisdiction of the subject-matter and jurisdiction of all the parties in interest. Gill v. Johnson, 206 Miss. 707, 40 So. 2d 600, 1949 Miss. LEXIS 295 (Miss. 1949).

      <p>
       Where testimony was sufficient to have will probated in solemn form, chancery court had authority to admit will to probate, grant letters testamentary to executor named therein, and set aside appointment of administratrix theretofore made under statute providing that if a will shall be found and probated, and letters testamentary granted thereon, the same shall be a revocation of administration.

       Since all the personal and real property of a deceased surety of an administratrix of a veteran’s estate were assets of his estate and chargeable as such with his debts, a proceeding to enforce such charge against the property in the hands of such deceased surety’s sole distributee because of administratrix’s maladministration of the veteran’s estate must be recognized.

       A will manifests the testator’s intention that the property transferred to his wife be free of estate taxes where “Item IV” exempts from the payment of estate taxes and administration costs those bequests made earlier in the will to his wife and “Item III” specifically states that his wife is to receive $4,800 a year “free of any debts” and therefore this property cannot bear the burden of estate taxes.

      <p>
       Notwithstanding the provisions of this section [Code 1942, § 539], a testator may charge his real property with the entire burden of the payment of his debts to the complete exoneration of his personalty, if and when the real estate is sufficient to do so, or he may apportion the burden between real and personal property, the will and not the statute controlling as between legatees, devisees, and distributees.

       This statute in no way affects the rule that when a testator makes bequests of his personalty and no devise of his realty, the latter is charged with his debts to the exoneration of the bequests. Temple v. First Nat'l Bank, 202 Miss. 92, 30 So. 2d 605, 1947 Miss. LEXIS 245 (Miss. 1947).

       The property specifically set aside by testator to take care of debts, costs, and expenses of the estate proving insufficient, descendible personalty and realty were required to be first exhausted in the payment of such debts, etc., before encroaching upon the legacies provided for in the will, in view of testator’s directions that such legacies should be invaded and abated for such purpose only as a last resort.

     <p>
      The executor or administrator shall, within ninety (90) days of the grant of his letters unless further time be allowed by the court or clerk, file an inventory, verified by oath, of the money and property owned by the decedent at the time of death, listing it with reasonable detail, and indicating as to each listed item, its market value as of the date of the decedent’s death, and the type and amount of any encumbrance that may exist with reference to any item.
     </p>
     <p>
      There shall be no requirement for filing an inventory if the requirement of filing an inventory is waived in the testator’s will. The court or the chancellor may also waive the requirement for filing an inventory in an intestate estate upon petition to the court by the administrator. Even though the requirement of filing an inventory is waived in the testator’s will or waived by the court or the chancellor upon petition to the court by the administrator in an intestate estate, the court or the chancellor may later order the executor or administrator to file an inventory upon the petition of a beneficiary or other interested party if the court or the chancellor determines that the filing of inventory is necessary or advisable.

He shall, where appraisement is dispensed with or be not made, embrace in said inventory and give its value all property which has come to his hands; and where an appraisement has been made, he shall be charged therewith unless he show cause to the contrary.”

       In determining what is received by administrator, court may look to appraisement. Hayes v. National Surety Co., 169 Miss. 676, 153 So. 515, 1934 Miss. LEXIS 67 (Miss. 1934).
      </p>
      <p>
       Statutory provision that administrator shall be charged with what is shown by appraisement does not preclude proper parties from proving that articles appraised were actually worth more than respective appraised amounts. Hayes v. National Surety Co., 169 Miss. 676, 153 So. 515, 1934 Miss. LEXIS 67 (Miss. 1934).
      </p>
      <p>
       Appraisement, as regards items with which it is authorized by law to deal, stands as correct charge prima facie against administrator. Hayes v. National Surety Co., 169 Miss. 676, 153 So. 515, 1934 Miss. LEXIS 67 (Miss. 1934).
      </p>
      <p>
       Statutory provision, that administrator shall stand charged with appraisement unless he show cause to contrary, does not limit showing to one by administrator himself, but showing may be made by any proper person sought to be charged with administrator’s liability. Hayes v. National Surety Co., 169 Miss. 676, 153 So. 515, 1934 Miss. LEXIS 67 (Miss. 1934).
      </p>
      <p>
       In action against administrator of administrator, apparent defects in appraisement, introduced to show what administrator received, were supplied by operation of presumption that incidental procedural steps which should have been taken were taken. Hayes v. National Surety Co., 169 Miss. 676, 153 So. 515, 1934 Miss. LEXIS 67 (Miss. 1934).
      </p>
      <p>
       Appraisement was no evidence against administrator in regard to accounts due estate, life insurance, and money on hand, because appraisement does not legally deal with money and choses in action, since such items are to be returned by inventory. Hayes v. National Surety Co., 169 Miss. 676, 153 So. 515, 1934 Miss. LEXIS 67 (Miss. 1934).
      </p>
      <p>
       That administrator actually received more or less than was charged to him by appraisement may be shown by competent evidence adduced by any proper party in interest. Hayes v. National Surety Co., 169 Miss. 676, 153 So. 515, 1934 Miss. LEXIS 67 (Miss. 1934).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although appraisement was no evidence against administrator regarding insurance and cash, he was chargeable with insurance collected and cash received where evidence outside appraisement showed he received them. Hayes v. National Surety Co., 169 Miss. 676, 153 So. 515, 1934 Miss. LEXIS 67 (Miss. 1934).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where cotton crop was produced by tenants working on shares and landlord’s estate was entitled to only one-third of crop, administrator was chargeable only with such one-third of crop. Hayes v. National Surety Co., 169 Miss. 676, 153 So. 515, 1934 Miss. LEXIS 67 (Miss. 1934).
      </p>

       On accounting administrator is chargeable with actual value of property coming into his hands rather than value fixed by appraiser. Davis v. Blumenberg, 107 Miss. 432, 65 So. 503, 1914 Miss. LEXIS 102 (Miss. 1914).

      If the goods, chattels, and effects are improperly withheld from the executor or administrator, then he shall not be answerable for a failure to return the inventories herein required until the goods, chattels, and effects, or some part thereof, have been received. If the executor or administrator shall have cause to believe that any of the assets of the estate are concealed or have been or are wrongfully withheld from him, or that any person has in his possession or under his control any records, books, or documents containing evidence concerning such assets and the ownership thereof, or has knowledge or information thereof otherwise, then it shall be the duty of such executor or administrator to forthwith proceed by a summary petition before the court or chancellor against all persons suspected of having concealed or wrongfully withheld such assets, as well as all persons having books, records, documents, or information relating thereto, for a discovery of the assets of the estate and all adverse claim thereto, if any. All persons made parties to such petition may be compelled by attachment for contempt to discover under oath by answer filed or testimony given, either or both at such time and place as the court or chancellor may direct, all the facts known to them concerning the assets of the estate and of all adverse claims thereto, if any. If on the hearing it shall appear that any person has property or assets of the estate to which there is no adverse claim, the court or chancellor may direct it to be delivered to the executor or administrator, who shall forthwith account therefor in his inventory. No decree shall be rendered in such proceeding concerning any adverse claim set up by any person to any of the assets. The costs of such proceeding shall be borne by the estate.

      If any person interested discover that the inventory returned does not contain a full account of all the property, goods, chattels, and effects of the deceased, such person may, on petition to the court, have the executor, administrator, or temporary administrator cited to appear and show cause why an additional inventory should not be returned. If, on hearing, the court be satisfied that a true inventory was not originally returned, it may order the executor or administrator to return a new one; and on his failure to do so, his letters may be revoked. If the title to any property not inventoried be in dispute, it shall be sufficient for the executor, administrator, or collector so to report; and he shall not be required to return an additional inventory until the title be settled in his favor. It shall also be the duty of every executor and administrator to return additional inventories at least once in each year of the increase of the property of the estate, if there be any such increase.

       § 91-7-135.
    Court or chancellor to set apart one year’s support for family.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      It shall be the duty of the court or the chancellor to set apart out of the effects of the decedent, for the spouse and children who were being supported by the decedent, or for the spouse if there be no such children, or for such children if there be no spouse, one (1) year’s provision, including such provision as may be embraced in the exempt property set apart. If there be no provisions, or an insufficient amount, the court or the chancellor shall determine the sum necessary for the comfortable support of the spouse and children, or spouse or children, as the case may be, for one (1) year.
     </p>
     <p>
      HISTORY: 
Codes, Hutchinson’s 1848, ch. 49, art. 17 (1); 1857, ch. 60, art. 172; 1871, §§ 1290, 1957; 1880, § 1279; 1892, § 1877; 1906, § 2052; Hemingway’s 1917, § 1717; 1930, § 1664; 1942, § 561; Laws, 1992, ch. 321 § 1, eff from and after passage (approved April 20, 1992); Laws, 2019, ch. 458, § 5, eff from and after July 1, 2019.

      </h4>
      <p>
       The 2019 amendment substituted “court or the chancellor” for “appraisers” and “appraiser” in the first and second sentences; substituted “shall determine the sum necessary” for “shall allow money in lieu thereof or in addition thereto necessary” in the second sentence; and deleted the former last two sentences, which read: “In addition to the provisions or money in lieu thereof, the appraisers shall ascertain and allow what sum of money will be needed to purchase necessary wearing apparel for the spouse and such children, or the spouse or children, as the case may be, and to pay tuition for the children for one (1) year. If a parent dies leaving children who are infants and were being maintained by the parent, the same provisions and allowance shall be set apart and made for them as above provided.”

      <p>
       Real estate owned as tenants by the entirety vested exclusively in surviving wife upon husband’s death, and thus did not become asset of husband’s probate estate and was not available to be distributed in kind as widow’s allowance. In re Osborne, 120 B.R. 64, 1990 Bankr. LEXIS 2184 (Bankr. N.D. Miss. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       Right of widow to year’s allowance is absolute, whatever may be condition of estate, and application therefor is matter with which administrator has no concern. Harwell v. Woody, 206 Miss. 863, 41 So. 2d 35, 1949 Miss. LEXIS 308 (Miss. 1949).
      </p>
      <p>
       Administrator, as such, is without right to prosecute appeal from order of court decreeing year’s allowance to widow of decedent, in absence of issue involving her status as widow entitled to allowance. Harwell v. Woody, 206 Miss. 863, 41 So. 2d 35, 1949 Miss. LEXIS 308 (Miss. 1949).
      </p>
      <p>
       The right of a widow to an allowance for a year’s support is absolute and cannot be conditioned on the payment by her to the administrator of her deceased husband’s wages which she has collected. Westbrook v. Shotts, 200 Miss. 456, 27 So. 2d 683, 1946 Miss. LEXIS 309 (Miss. 1946).
      </p>
      <p>
       Making a year’s allowance for support of deceased’s widow is part of jurisdiction of chancery court, which cannot be taken away nor impaired by legislature, so that authority in appraisers to set aside year’s support does not deprive chancellor of authority. Prentiss v. Turner, 170 Miss. 496, 155 So. 214, 1934 Miss. LEXIS 158 (Miss. 1934).

      </h4>
      <p>
       In order to be entitled to the widow’s allowance, a widow need only show that she and decedent were living together as husband and wife at the time of his death. Waldrup v. United States, 499 F. Supp. 820, 1980 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16059 (N.D. Miss. 1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       A widow’s allowance was properly denied where the widow did not make a motion for or in any other manner indicate that she wanted a widow’s allowance set aside to her before the estate was finally closed, and where there was no suggestion of fraud. Thomas v. Bailey, 375 So. 2d 1049, 1979 Miss. LEXIS 2607 (Miss. 1979), overruled in part, Clark v. Neese, 131 So.3d 556, 2013 Miss. LEXIS 643 (Miss. 2013).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where widow and decedent were living together as husband and wife at time of decedent’s death and he was under a duty to support her, widow’s allowance was proper under Code 1942 § 561. Mills v. Mills, 279 So. 2d 917, 1973 Miss. LEXIS 1495 (Miss. 1973).
      </p>
      <p>
       One claiming this allowance has the burden of showing that she was being supported by decedent. In re Will of Marshall, 243 Miss. 472, 138 So. 2d 482, 1962 Miss. LEXIS 364 (Miss. 1962).

       A widow is entitled to the statutory widow’s allowance, regardless of a will, unless it clearly appears that the provisions of the will for the widow are in lieu of the year’s support provided by statute. Rush v. Rush, 360 So. 2d 1240, 1978 Miss. LEXIS 2341 (Miss. 1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section [Code 1942 § 561] applies to cases of testacy and intestacy alike except in the case of wills where it clearly appears that the provisions in the will for the widow and minor children of the decedent are in lieu of the 1 year’s support provided for by the statute. Mills v. Mills, 279 So. 2d 917, 1973 Miss. LEXIS 1495 (Miss. 1973).
      </p>
      <p>
       Allowance of a year’s support to a widow renouncing her husband’s will is within the chancellor’s discretion. Sandifer v. Sandifer, 237 Miss. 464, 115 So. 2d 46, 1959 Miss. LEXIS 491 (Miss. 1959).
      </p>
      <p>
       Widow’s contract reciting that she waived right to renounce will of husband and take by inheritance held too indefinite to preclude widow from $3,000 as year’s allowance provided by statute. Gidden v. Gidden, 176 Miss. 98, 167 So. 785, 1936 Miss. LEXIS 116 (Miss. 1936).
      </p>
      <p>
       Will held not to show intention on part of testator that provisions therein for widow were to be in lieu of statutory allowance for support for year. Gilmer v. Gilmer, 151 Miss. 23, 117 So. 371, 1928 Miss. LEXIS 286 (Miss. 1928).
      </p>

       Widow and minor children entitled to year’s support in case of will where provision of will not made in lieu of all other claim, or there is no inconsistency between will and provision for allowance. Stewart v. Stewart, 132 Miss. 515, 96 So. 694, 1923 Miss. LEXIS 74 (Miss. 1923).

      </p>
      <p>
       Making a year’s allowance for support of deceased’s widow is part of jurisdiction of chancery court, which cannot be taken away nor impaired by legislature, so that authority in appraisers to set aside year’s support does not deprive chancellor of authority.

       Action of appraisers in making allowance for year’s support to widow of decedent is not final, but only advisory to chancellor, and subject to his approval or disapproval. Prentiss v. Turner, 170 Miss. 496, 155 So. 214, 1934 Miss. LEXIS 158 (Miss. 1934).

In re Estate of Estes, 111 So.3d 1223, 2012 Miss. App. LEXIS 820 (Miss. Ct. App. 2012).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where husband’s obligation to support wife was terminated by a property settlement, the wife is not entitled to the statutory support allowance out of his estate. Will of Best v. Brewer, 236 Miss. 359, 111 So. 2d 262, 1959 Miss. LEXIS 325 (Miss. 1959).

      </p>

       Allowance to widow of support for one year was authorized where evidence warranted court in believing that separation of deceased and wife resulted from no fault of wife but was the fault of deceased and that his duty to support her continued. Vaughan v. Vaughan, 195 Miss. 463, 16 So. 2d 23, 1943 Miss. LEXIS 175 (Miss. 1943).

      <p>
       Where a decedent left an estate of an approximate value of $139,000, an allowance to the widow of $6,000 for one year’s support was not excessive. Bryan v. Quinn, 233 Miss. 366, 102 So. 2d 124, 1958 Miss. LEXIS 392 (Miss. 1958).
      </p>
      <p>
       Amount of widow’s allowance is discretionary with chancellor where fees of administrator and counsel have been paid and award is $800 less than that recommended by appraisers. Harwell v. Woody, 206 Miss. 863, 41 So. 2d 35, 1949 Miss. LEXIS 308 (Miss. 1949).
      </p>
      <p>
       The amount allowed by the appraisers to the widow for year’s support is advisory to, but not binding upon, the chancellor. Moseley v. Harper, 202 Miss. 442, 32 So. 2d 192, 1947 Miss. LEXIS 296 (Miss. 1947).
      </p>
      <p>
       In determining the amount of the widow’s allowance, the chancellor should consider the value of the estate, the rights of others having an interest therein, the manner of living to which the widow was accustomed during her husband’s life, her station in life and the demands of that station. Moseley v. Harper, 202 Miss. 442, 32 So. 2d 192, 1947 Miss. LEXIS 296 (Miss. 1947).
      </p>
      <p>
       Refusal of chancellor to increase appraiser’s allowance for widow’s support from $5,000 to $8,500 was not an abuse of discretion, where items presented by widow to substantiate her petition for increase included improper items such as expenses for repairs, taxes and insurance upon her separate property, lot and clothing for burial of decedent, and other excessive costs.

   The role played by the chancery court in probate proceedings under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t91c07s91-7-143" target="_self">91-7-143</a></cite>, upon which the statute’s time bar is dependent in that notice may be published only after an affidavit is filed with the clerk of court, is sufficient state action to implicate the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution; thus, a creditor’s claim against an estate was a property interest protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.

   The time bar of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t91c07s91-7-145" target="_self">91-7-145</a></cite> did not apply, and therefore a creditor’s untimely claim against an estate was valid, where the creditor was “reasonably ascer-tainable” and the administratrix merely published notice rather than providing notice by mail as mandated by the statute; furthermore, the insufficient notice violated the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.Vann v.

       Because the executrix failed in the executrix’s statutory duty to provide notice to any creditors regarding the probate of the decedent’s estate, the filing period for probate claims did not expire as the executrix failed to provide the required statutory notice to trigger the running of the filing period.

       § 91-7-149.
    Probate of claims.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Any person desiring to probate his claim shall present to the clerk the written evidence thereof, if any, or if the claim be a judgment or decree, a duly certified copy thereof, or if there be no written evidence thereof, an itemized account or a statement of the claim in writing, signed by the creditor, and make affidavit, to be attached thereto, to the following effect, viz.: That the claim is just, correct, and owing from the deceased; that it is not usurious; that neither the affiant nor any other person has received payment in whole or in part thereof, except such as is credited thereon, if any; and that security has not been received therefor except as stated, if any. Thereupon, if the clerk shall approve, he shall indorse upon the claim the words following: “Probated and allowed for $ _______________and registered this_______________day of_______________ , A.D.,_______________ ,” and shall sign his name officially thereto. Probate registration and allowance shall be sufficient presentation of the claim to the executor or administrator; provided, that should the clerk probate and allow and register the claim, but fail or neglect to indorse thereon the words, “Probated and allowed for $ _______________and registered the_______________day of_______________ , A.D.,_______________ ,” and officially sign his name thereto, the court may, upon proper showing, allow the clerk to indorse on the claim, nunc pro tunc, the words, “Probated and allowed for $ _______________and registered, this the_______________day of_______________ , A.D.,_______________ ,” and sign his name officially thereto. If the claim be based upon a demand of which there is no written evidence or upon an itemized account, the statement of said claim or the itemized account shall be retained and kept by the clerk among the official papers pertaining to the estate; and if the claim be based upon a promissory note or other instrument purporting to have been executed by the decedent, the creditor shall file with his claim either the original thereof or a duplicate of such original in the discretion of the creditor. If the original writing is presented to the clerk, it may be withdrawn by the creditor, and the clerk shall make a duplicate thereof. No specific writing or certificate shall be required to be made by the clerk on either the original writing or the duplicate retained by the clerk. In no instance shall an original writing be required to be presented to the clerk unless (a) a question is raised by the personal representative of the estate, or by any party in interest, as to the authenticity of the original or (b) in the circumstances it would be unfair to admit into evidence the duplicate in lieu of the original. In either of the above situations, the court or chancellor, upon good cause being shown, may require the creditor to produce the original before the court or clerk for the inspection of the personal representative or other party in interest, who may examine the original and who may make photographic copies thereof under the supervision of the clerk.
     </p>
     <p>
      Notwithstanding the foregoing, any record, voucher, claim, check, draft, receipt, writing, account, statement, note or other evidence which may be furnished, filed, probated, presented or produced, or required to be produced, by a federally regulated bank, thrift or trust company shall be deemed to be an original admitted, furnished, filed, probated, presented, or produced for all purposes and with the same effect as the original, if such financial institution produces a copy of such evidence from a format of storage commonly used by financial institutions, whether electronic, imaged, magnetic, microphotographic or otherwise.

   The amendment to §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t91c07s91-7-149" target="_self">91-7-149</a></cite> which deleted the requirement of filing the original promissory note when a creditor makes a claim against the estate, would be retroactively applied to a case which was before the court when the amendment was enacted. Bell v. Mitchell, 592 So. 2d 528, 1991 Miss. LEXIS 968 (Miss. 1991).
      </p>

   In order for a claimant to introduce evidence to support a claim against an estate for medical expenses upon contest, the claimant may proceed under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.41.html#t41c09s41-9-119" target="_blank">41-9-119</a></cite>, but to do this, he or she must be allowed to go into court to present the bills incurred and to testify for what purpose they were incurred. Since a summary judgment, by its nature, disposes of a case before a trial is commenced, summary judgment practice under Rule 56, Miss. R. Civ. P. is inapplicable in contests of probated claims because it is inconsistent with the statutory procedure which necessitates that a claimant enter court to introduce evidence in support of his or her claim and permits a personal representative to rebut the claim. Thus, the procedure for summary judgment is not applicable to dispose of claims made under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t91c07s91-7-149" target="_self">91-7-149</a></cite>. Biloxi Regional Medical Center, Inc. v. Estate of Ross, 546 So. 2d 667, 1989 Miss. LEXIS 297 (Miss. 1989).

       The purposes of nonclaim statutes are to furnish the legal representative with evidence of the validity of the claim, give him an opportunity to contest the same, and enable him to justify the payment and be allowed credit therefor in his account.

       Purpose of additional provisions, incorporated into statute regulating manner of filing claims for probate was to require evidences of debt to remain on file in clerk’s office, where heirs, or other creditors or parties in interest, could better examine into facts, so as to avoid collection of false claims.

       The statute clearly contemplates that, in presenting claims against the estate of a decedent, the evidence or statement of same probated must on its face show a prima facie right in the claimant to recover from the estate the amount claimed, and that it must disclose the nature and amount of the claim with sufficient prevision to bar, when paid, an action therefor.

       Where a claim was for services rendered as a servant of deceased for washing, ironing, cooking, cleaning house and etc., for 842 days at a $1.00 per day and night totalling the sum of $842, the statement of claim was sufficient on its face to inform the administrator that the services were rendered under an implied, if not an express, promise to pay for the same and the claimant should be permitted to introduce her proof to establish either an express or implied promise to pay for the services.

   In a case in which appellant, along with her children, filed claims against her ex-husband’s estate for child support arrears, other unpaid support obligations, and for life insurance proceeds, appellant’s presentation of the divorce decree, the property settlement agreement, and other various documents was sufficient to satisfy the requirements of Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t91c07s91-7-14" target="_self">91-7-14</a></cite>. To the extent the chancellor dismissed appellant’s claims on the merits, such action was improper, as the merits were not before the chancellor to decide. Strickland v. Estate of Broome, 179 So.3d 1088, 2015 Miss. LEXIS 604 (Miss. 2015).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a probate proceeding involving a claim based upon an oral contract between the claimant and the decedent whereby the claimant would lend the decedent $11,000 and the decedent would leave a bequest of certain real property to the claimant, the chancellor properly admitted into evidence the claimant’s cancelled check and the document reporting to be the defective holographic will of the decedent, neither of which had been attached as exhibits to the claim, where the claim itself was based upon the oral contract and the exhibits were merely introduced as evidence in support of the claim. Estate of McKellar v. Brown, 404 So. 2d 550, 1981 Miss. LEXIS 2229 (Miss. 1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       The chancellor properly dismissed an amended probate of claim where the alleged written contract between the decedent and the claimant did not in and of itself sufficiently state a claim against the estate and where the claimant failed to allege and prove compliance with the various conditions of the agreement. French v. Druetta, 399 So. 2d 1327, 1981 Miss. LEXIS 1966 (Miss. 1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the timely affidavit filed by the creditor designated as the credit account the decedent’s business rather than the decedent himself, and it neither presented written evidence of the claim nor an itemized account thereof, it provided no information to the administrator of the estate from which he could reasonably act in either allowing or disallowing the claim, and the trial court properly refused to allow the creditor to amend his complaint after the expiration of 6 months. Stuart C. Irby Co. v. Patton, 301 So. 2d 845, 1974 Miss. LEXIS 1665 (Miss. 1974).

       Where the respective proofs of two notes presented as claim against an estate recited that the claim was “annexed” and that the original was presented therewith, and described the claim with great particularity and with such accuracy that there could be no mistake as to what claims were referred to, there was a sufficient compliance with this section [Code 1942, § 568], notwithstanding that the proofs were not physically attached to the claims, this section being mandatory as to substance but not as to letter. Fidelity Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Goldstein, 187 Miss. 285, 192 So. 584, 1940 Miss. LEXIS 206 (Miss. 1940).

       Claims, giving claimant’s name and stating that specified amount is due for clearing land, should be allowed where correctness proved by evidence of amount of work and price per acre is shown by written agreement signed by deceased. Fairley v. Fairley, 120 Miss. 400, 82 So. 267 (Miss. 1919).

       It was error to disallow claim of creditor who lost original of his claim after probate, but filed copies thereof on day set for filing. Keiffer Bros. Co. v. Bank of Commerce, 105 Miss. 662, 63 So. 189, 1913 Miss. LEXIS 246 (Miss. 1913).

    Claims to be registered in ninety days or barred; amendment of affidavits.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      All claims against the estate of deceased persons, whether due or not, shall be registered, probated and allowed in the court in which the letters testamentary or of administration were granted within ninety (90) days after the first publication of notice to creditors to present their claim. Otherwise, the same shall be barred and a suit shall not be maintained thereon in any court, even though the existence of the claim may have been known to the executor or administrator. Where the affidavit is made in good faith and the claim is registered, probated and allowed by the clerk but the affidavit is defective or insufficient, the court may allow the affidavit to be amended so as to conform to the requirements of the statute, at any time before the estate is finally settled; whereupon the probate shall be as effective and the claim as valid against the estate as if the affidavit had been correct and sufficient in the first instance.

       Section 91-7-151 applies only to monetary claims against an estate. Allen v. Mayer, 587 So. 2d 255, 1991 Miss. LEXIS 673 (Miss. 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       Executrix was properly surcharged for payment of decedent’s debts which had not been probated, registered, or allowed. Harper v. Harper, 491 So. 2d 189, 1986 Miss. LEXIS 2508 (Miss. 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       The statute is not applicable to a situation where a party denies that it is indebted to an estate and raises no claim against the estate. Bible Ministry Asso. v. Merritt, 391 So. 2d 641, 1980 Miss. LEXIS 2166 (Miss. 1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       The six months statute of limitations as to claims of creditors is irrelevant to an action against the personal representative and heirs of a decedent seeking adjudication of the existence of a partnership and an accounting of the partnership property. Kelly v. Windham, 204 So. 2d 477, 1967 Miss. LEXIS 1206 (Miss. 1967).
      </p>
      <p>
       An unliquidated claim is not probatable. Powell v. Buchanan, 245 Miss. 4, 147 So. 2d 110, 1962 Miss. LEXIS 526 (Miss. 1962).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section [Code 1942, § 569] operates to bar a claim for services, notwithstanding a dispute as to rate of compensation. Love v. Estate of Strong, 234 Miss. 869, 108 So. 2d 215, 1959 Miss. LEXIS 561 (Miss. 1959).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section [Code 1942, § 569] applies only to contractual claims and not to those in tort. Mossler Acceptance Co. v. Moore, 218 Miss. 757, 67 So. 2d 868, 1953 Miss. LEXIS 601 (Miss. 1953); Hancock v. Pyle, 191 Miss. 546, 3 So. 2d 851, 1941 Miss. LEXIS 175 (Miss. 1941).
      </p>
      <p>
       The term “claim” in statutes relating to claims against estates includes not only debts already due, but unmatured debts, but it applies only to specific money demands due or to become due and not to inchoate and contingent claims. Reedy v. Alexander, 202 Miss. 80, 30 So. 2d 599, 1947 Miss. LEXIS 244 (Miss. 1947).
      </p>
      <p>
       A claim against the estate of a deceased person is a demand of a pecuniary nature, which could have been enforced against the decedent during his lifetime; the term does not include a claim to the proceeds of the sale of personal property of an estate. Reedy v. Alexander, 202 Miss. 80, 30 So. 2d 599, 1947 Miss. LEXIS 244 (Miss. 1947).
      </p>
      <p>
       That widow’s petition, claiming the proceeds of certain personalty sold by order of the court as her own rather than that of the estate, had the oath of probate attached to it, and the clerk certified it had been probated, registered and allowed, did not convert it to a probatable or probated claim. Reedy v. Alexander, 202 Miss. 80, 30 So. 2d 599, 1947 Miss. LEXIS 244 (Miss. 1947).
      </p>
      <p>
       The statute of limitations does not bar the claim of an administrator against the estate for an individual debt duly probated and not barred at the time of his appointment. Oliver v. Smith, 94 Miss. 879, 49 So. 1, 1909 Miss. LEXIS 364 (Miss. 1909).
      </p>
      <p>
       Claim for damages is not within this section [Code 1942, § 569]; the section refers to contractual claims only. Feld v. Borodofski, 87 Miss. 727, 40 So. 816, 1905 Miss. LEXIS 216 (Miss. 1905).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section [Code 1942, § 569] has no application to a surviving partner administering partnership assets. Lance v. Calhoun, 85 Miss. 375, 37 So. 1014, 1904 Miss. LEXIS 171 (Miss. 1904).

       Claim for reimbursement of funeral expenses was not untimely under this section because the expenses were not required to be probated; such claims were considered to be a part of the cost of the administration of the estate, and the requirement to probate a claim applied to obligations incurred by a decedent during his lifetime. In re Estate of Whitley v. Love, 129 So.3d 260, 2013 Miss. App. LEXIS 789 (Miss. Ct. App. 2013).
      </p>

       Clearly, more than 90 days after the first notice to creditors had elapsed when plaintiff (a surviving child), filed his claim against the estate, claiming he was entitled to all the insurance proceeds per the decedent’s property settlement with a former wife. However, when the decedent died, plaintiff was a minor, and according to the terms of the decedent’s will, the decedent’s second and surviving spouse had been appointed testamentary guardian of plaintiff’s person and estate; defendant was in a fiduciary relationship with plaintiff, and in that capacity, she not only had an obligation to initiate any and all claims which plaintiff may have had, but she had an obligation to initiate them timely, and therefore, the chancery court erred in granting defendant’s Miss. R. Civ. P. 12(b) motion since a constructive trust was possibly at issue. Thornhill v. Thornhill, 905 So. 2d 747, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 1083 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Statute was inapplicable to a claim for furniture, since the claim was not pecuniary in nature and was therefore not a probatable claim within the meaning of the statute. Allen v. Mayer, 587 So. 2d 255, 1991 Miss. LEXIS 673 (Miss. 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Since the liability of the deceased guarantor of a promissory note was contingent, and would possibly never occur, §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t91c07s91-7-151" target="_self">91-7-151</a></cite> did not require that it be filed for probate within a period of 90 days following first notice to creditors, and thus the trial court erred in dismissing the lender bank’s suit against the guarantor’s estate. Peoples Bank of Mendenhall v. Wyatt, 441 So. 2d 117, 1983 Miss. LEXIS 3018 (Miss. 1983).

   In an action seeking to compel a perfect inventory, void certain conveyances, partition property, and establish a claim against an estate, §§<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t91c07s91-7-149" target="_self">91-7-149</a></cite>,<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t91c07s91-7-251" target="_self">91-7-251</a></cite> had no application and petitioner’s claim was improperly dismissed as untimely, where the claim was not for a specific money demand due or to become due but rather was an inchoate and contingent claim involving the ownership by co-tenancy of specific property. Maxwell v. Yuncker, 419 So. 2d 580, 1982 Miss. LEXIS 2165 (Miss. 1982).
      </p>
      <p>
       A creditor’s claim against decedent’s estate for default on an unsecured note assumed by decedent was barred by this section’s 90 day statute of limitations, where the balance due under the note was not an inchoate or contingent claim excepted from the statute, but was a claim enforceable against decedent during his lifetime. Barrett v. Moffitt, 381 So. 2d 624, 1980 Miss. LEXIS 1924 (Miss. 1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       The claim of a bank, based on an agreement between the decedent and the managing director of the bank for services to be rendered the decedent in consideration of an assignment of 30 percent of the decedent’s interest in another’s estate, was not a joint, undivided and inchoate interest or a contingent unliquidated claim not subject to probate provisions and the time limitation with which to file the claim against an estate, but was instead a claim for personal services which was barred by the bank’s failure to file its claim until 6 months had elapsed from the first publication notice to creditors by the administrator. Vacek v. Hoerner-Bank of West Berlin, 258 So. 2d 793, 1972 Miss. LEXIS 1513 (Miss. 1972).

      <p>
       Where payee failed to timely probate a claim on a note of deceased, and was barred from asserting claim on the note as an unsecured creditor, he was entitled to recovery of the salvage value of the destroyed automobile which had been mortgaged to secure the note.

       Purchaser’s claim against decedent’s estate for purchase price of royalty interest in oil and gas lease because of breach of warranty based on decedent’s prior conveyance of his interest, there having been no production of oil and gas under the lease prior to decedent’s death, was a probatable claim against decedent’s estate which was barred for failure to probate same within the period prescribed by this section [Code 1942, § 569]. Dale v. Hickman, 207 Miss. 606, 42 So. 2d 810, 1949 Miss. LEXIS 373 (Miss. 1949).

      <p>
       Claims for the proceeds of timber sold from land purchased at an invalid foreclosure sale, and rents received by the purchaser, are not required to be probated within six months, the claims coming within the purview of such requirement being such as, if paid by the executor or administrator, would prima facie entitle him to credit therefor. Hancock v. Pyle, 191 Miss. 546, 3 So. 2d 851, 1941 Miss. LEXIS 175 (Miss. 1941).
      </p>

       Unliquidated claim against negligent bank director is not a claim for probate against his estate. Boyd v. Applewhite, 121 Miss. 879, 84 So. 16, 1920 Miss. LEXIS 128 (Miss. 1920).
      </p>
      <p>
       The limitation provided under this section [Code 1942, § 569] does not apply where a will creates an express trust for the payment of debts and the executor follows the directions of the will as provided in Code 1942, § 518.

       Because the executrix failed in the executrix’s statutory duty to provide notice to any creditors regarding the probate of the decedent’s estate, the filing period for probate claims did not expire as the executrix failed to provide the required statutory notice to trigger the running of the filing period. Avakian v. Wilmington Trust N.A. (In re Estate of Avakian), 231 So.3d 208, 2017 Miss. App. LEXIS 201 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 229 So.3d 122, 2017 Miss. LEXIS 492 (Miss. 2017).

       Where it appeared that on the death of one partner, the surviving partner had agreed to hold the shares of two of the decedent’s heirs as an active trust for their benefit until demand was made by them for payment of the principal, that all of the parties to the agreement had died and the estate of the surviving partner had been administered, with due notice given to creditors, a bill filed by heirs of the first deceased partner, more than three and one-half years after the death of the surviving partner and after the estate had been administered and the personal property distributed, and without a claim having been presented to the administratrix of his estate, to fix and impose a money decree upon the administratrix and the heirs at law of the surviving partner, was barred by the nonclaim statute, and also by the statute relating to limitation of actions on unwritten contracts.

       Decision of umpire designated by will to settle disputes between executors, determining that taxes on real estate devised subject to the mortgage debt thereon were not payable by the estate but by the devisee, was not binding on the devisee, where the provision for action by such umpire was designed to bring about harmony between the executors, and such decision was contrary to the manifest intention of the testatrix.

     <p>
      The executor, trustee, or other fiduciary having discretionary powers under a last will and testament or transfer in trust shall be authorized to enter into agreements with the commissioner of internal revenue of the United States of America and other taxing authorities to exercise the fiduciary’s discretion so that the assets to be distributed in satisfaction of a bequest or transfer in trust will be selected in such a manner that cash and other properties distributed will have an aggregate fair market value representative of the pecuniary legatee’s or transferee’s proportionate share of the appreciation or depreciation in value to the date, or dates, of distribution of all property then available for distribution in satisfaction of such bequest or transfer. It is the purpose of this section to authorize such fiduciary to enter into any agreement that may be necessary or advisable in order to secure for federal estate tax purposes the maximum marital deduction available under the Internal Revenue Laws of the United States of America, and to do and perform all acts incident to such purpose.

   In order for a claimant to introduce evidence to support a claim against an estate for medical expenses upon contest, the claimant may proceed under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.41.html#t41c09s41-9-119" target="_blank">41-9-119</a></cite>, but to do this, he or she must be allowed to go into court to present the bills incurred and to testify for what purpose they were incurred. Since a summary judgment, by its nature, disposes of a case before a trial is commenced, summary judgment practice under Rule 56, Miss. R. Civ. P. is inapplicable in contests of probated claims because it is inconsistent with the statutory procedure which necessitates that a claimant enter court to introduce evidence in support of his or her claim and permits a personal representative to rebut the claim. Thus, the procedure for summary judgment is not applicable to dispose of claims made under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t91c07s91-7-149" target="_self">91-7-149</a></cite>.

       Decision of chancellor that admission to probate of claims against an estate established a presumption of its correctness was erroneous as being a misconception of the effect of a probated claim, since a claim against an estate, although duly probated and registered, must be established by clear and reasonably positive evidence, if contested by the administratrix.

       Claim against testator’s estate, which purported to be itemized account or statement of claim in writing, which charged estate with purchase of note on which there was a balance due, would be disallowed where evidence clearly disclosed that there was no sale of note by claimant to testator, but that testator agreed to collect note for claimant, pay certain amount on debt of testator’s son to testator and turn over balance to claimant, and that testator merely became claimant’s agent or trustee for collection of note.

    Creditor having lien failing to present claim.

     </h3>
     <p>
      A creditor of a decedent who has a lien of any kind on property of the decedent shall not be barred of his right to enforce the lien against the property by a failure to present his claim and have it probated and registered, but shall be barred of all claim to be satisfied out of the assets not affected by such lien. A person claiming to have a lien on any property of the decedent may be made a party to any proper proceeding by the executor or administrator or a creditor to test the validity of such claim to a lien, and to determine upon the right of such claim. This may be in a proceeding to sell property, which may be ordered to be sold free from such lien, or subject to it; and the decree may be made as to a sale and disposition of the proceeds of the sale of the property, as may be according to the rights of parties before the court.

   Sale of real estate made by heir was in his individual capacity as owner of property, as sole surviving heir at law of his father, and suit for commission by real estate agent, who alleged she procured purchaser for home, could not be maintained against estate, because conditions for sale of real estate by administrator of estate established in §§<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t91c07s91-7-187" target="_self">91-7-187</a></cite> and<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t91c07s91-7-191" target="_self">91-7-191</a></cite> had not been shown to exist.

      </p>
      <p>
       A will manifests the testator’s intention that the property transferred to his wife be free of estate taxes where “Item IV” exempts from the payment of estate taxes and administration costs those bequests made earlier in the will to his wife and “Item III” specifically states that his wife is to receive $4,800 a year “free of any debts” and therefore this property cannot bear the burden of estate taxes. Waldrup v. United States, 499 F. Supp. 820, 1980 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16059 (N.D. Miss. 1980).

       Under this section [Code 1942, § 588] and Code 1942, § 539, the personal estate must be exhausted before the lands may be resorted to for the payment of debts, unless a contrary intent be manifested in the will of the decedent.

       Dismissal of an action alleging waste due to the cutting of timber was improperly dismissed on the basis that an estate lacked standing to bring the action since it had no interest therein and no power to bring such an action; the trial court should have allowed a substitution of the heirs as parties to the action.

      The court, after service of summons or proof of publication, shall hear and examine the allegations and evidence in support of the petition and the objections to and evidence against it, if any. If on such hearing the court be satisfied that the land ought to be sold to pay the debts of the descendent and expenses of the estate, it may make a decree for the sale of a part or the whole of the land; and when a part only is decreed to be sold, the decree shall specify what part. If the real estate be so situated that a part cannot be sold without manifest prejudice to the heirs or devisees, the court may decree that the whole shall be sold; and the overplus arising from such sale, after the payment of debts and expenses, shall be distributed amongst the heirs according to the law of descents, or amongst the devisees according to the will. The sale of the land and distribution of the proceeds of the sale shall be subject to the abatement provisions of Section 91-7-90.

       The 2019 amendment substituted “land ought to be sold to pay the debts of the descendent and expenses of the estate” for “personal estate is insufficient to pay the debts of the deceased and that the land ought to be sold for that purpose” in the second sentence; deleted the former last sentence, which read: “The heir or devisee whose lands shall be sold may compel all others holding or claiming under such intestate or testator to contribute in proportion to their respective interests, so as to equalize the burden of the loss”; and added the present last sentence.

      <p>
       In proceedings divesting title to lands out of the legatees or heirs and vesting the same in the executor or administrator the statutes must necessarily be complied with to effect such a divestiture, and where the decree of court ordering sale did not adjudicate that the personal estate was insufficient to pay debts and that land ought to be sold for that purpose, did not decree the sale of a part or the whole of the land, and described no land, it was wholly insufficient to order a judicial sale. McWilliams v. Estate of Brown, 183 So. 2d 820, 1966 Miss. LEXIS 1443 (Miss. 1966).

      <p>
       Where sale of land to pay debts is shown to have been made under a solemn decree of chancery court, with proper notice and appearance by all parties in interest, and that decree of confirmation was unappealed from, the presumption is that chancery court had acted in good faith in ordering the sale and that administratrix was guilty of no bad faith in conducting the sale and conveying the property to the purchaser, the court necessarily adjudicating that the property had brought a fair price in confirming the sale. Gill v. Johnson, 206 Miss. 707, 40 So. 2d 600, 1949 Miss. LEXIS 295 (Miss. 1949).

     <p>
      A decree for the sale or lease of land shall not be made if any person interested will give bond, describing therein the land sought to be sold, payable to the executor or administrator in a sum to be fixed and with sureties approved by the court, conditioned to pay all the debts duly registered against the estate and the expenses of the administration, so far as the personal estate of the deceased shall be insufficient to pay the same. Such bond shall be filed among the papers of administration and entered on the minutes of the court, and shall have the force and effect of a judgment, upon which execution and other necessary process may be issued in the name of the executor or administrator, after the expiration of six months from the date it shall have been given, against the obligors therein from time to time, until such debts and expenses of administration be paid or the penalty of the bond exhausted. The same may be levied on the lands described in the bond, and the entire interest of the deceased therein may be sold as if the court had decreed the sale in the first instance; and the property of the sureties on said bond may be sold for whatever the land may be insufficient to pay. Instead of enforcing said bond, the executor or administrator or any creditor may petition anew for the sale of the land, as if such bond had not been given; and after the sale under such proceedings, the bond may be enforced, in the manner provided, for whatever the land may be insufficient to pay, and no other bond shall be allowed to prevent a decree for a sale or lease of the land.

     <p>
      When an executor or administrator shall discover that the personal property will not be sufficient to pay the debts of the decedent and the expenses of the administration of the estate, he may file a petition in the chancery court in which the estate is being administered, for the purpose of borrowing money to be secured by a deed of trust, mortgage, or other encumbrance on the lands of the decedent, except the exempt property or homestead which shall not be so encumbered save to pay an indebtedness which constitutes a lien on such exempt property or homestead, and then not without the consent of the exemptionist. The money, when so borrowed, shall be used to pay said claims and expenses.

     <p>
      With such petition the executor or administrator shall file and exhibit to the court a true account of the personal estate, debts due from the deceased, the expenses, and a description of the land to be used as security for the money so borrowed. The court, after service of summons or proof of publication of summons, shall hear and examine the allegations and evidence in support of the petition and the objections to and the evidence against it, if any. If on the hearing, the court be satisfied that the personal estate is insufficient to pay the debts of the deceased and said expenses, and that the land ought to be encumbered for such purposes, it may make a decree for the encumbrance of a part or the whole of the land; and when a part only is decreed to be so encumbered, the decree shall specify what part.

       Dismissal of an action alleging waste due to the cutting of timber was improperly dismissed on the basis that an estate lacked standing to bring the action since it had no interest therein and no power to bring such an action; the trial court should have allowed a substitution of the heirs as parties to the action.

       In an accountant negligence action arising from the accountant’s alleged negligence in performing accounting services for an estate, the trial court did not err in allowing plaintiffs other than the executrix to remain in the suit as nominal parties only; by naming the residuary beneficiaries plaintiffs, the executrix was protecting herself against any possible future lawsuits.

       Power of attorney prohibited the decedent’s attorneys-in-fact from profiting from their role, commingling their funds with hers, or taking ownership of her assets, and during the decedent’s lifetime, she could have commenced an action to set aside relatives’ joint ownership of certain certificates of deposit; thus, upon her death, her estate became the proper party to commence such an action, and thus the estate had standing to challenge actions taken by a relative that violated the terms of the power of attorney.

   Pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t91c07s91-7-237" target="_self">91-7-237</a></cite>, the estate executor stepped into the decedent’s shoes in prosecuting an action against the decedent’s nephew for unlawfully withdrawing funds; thus, the executor was entitled to the same remedy due the decedent had he been alive at judgment, and the proceeds of suit should have been returned to the estate. Estate of Beckley v. Beckley, 961 So. 2d 707, 2007 Miss. LEXIS 342 (Miss. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       An action for loss of consortium survives the death of the party asserting it, and may be brought as any other action by the executor or administrator or personal representative of the deceased party. Flight Line, Inc. v. Tanksley, 608 So. 2d 1149, 1992 Miss. LEXIS 447 (Miss. 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where statute was re-enacted by legislature without change after decision holding that term “personal action” is one brought for recovery of personalty, for enforcement of some contract or to recover damages for its breach, or for recovery of damages for commission of injury to person or property, interpretation became part of statute, and could not be changed or modified except by legislature. Catchings v. Hartman, 178 Miss. 672, 174 So. 553, 1937 Miss. LEXIS 259 (Miss. 1937).
      </p>
      <p>
       Term “personal action” as used in statute providing that, where either of parties to “personal action” shall die before final judgment, executor or administrator may prosecute or defend such action, does not include an action of slander, so as to entitle administratrix to continue the action, since statute, being in derogation of common law, must be strictly construed. Catchings v. Hartman, 178 Miss. 672, 174 So. 553, 1937 Miss. LEXIS 259 (Miss. 1937).

   According to established precedent and Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t91c07s91-7-237" target="_self">91-7-237</a></cite>, an executrix’s medical malpractice action against a doctor and a medical practice survived a decedent’s death and did not have to be recommenced because the executrix complied with Miss. R. Civ. P. 25 as the doctor and medical practice made no suggestion of death upon the record to trigger the ninety-day time requirement set out by the rule; nowhere does Rule 25 state that the substitution of parties is a commencement of a new action, but instead, it is the continuation of a prior action. Harris v. Darby, 17 So.3d 1076, 2009 Miss. LEXIS 447 (Miss. 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a cancer patient died while a medical malpractice suit he filed was pending, and his daughter was substituted as plaintiff and was appointed executrix of his estate, the trial court erred in dismissing the suit for failing to state a claim, because the amended complaint filed by the daughter on behalf of the estate sought recovery for injuries the patient suffered during his lifetime. Necaise v. Sacks, 841 So. 2d 1098, 2003 Miss. LEXIS 137 (Miss. 2003).

       <p>
   In an action to recover for damage to a life estate, the life tenant’s sole heir could not be substituted as the plaintiff following the life tenant’s death where no estate had been opened for the deceased life tenant and no administrator had been appointed, since the life tenant’s sole heir did not automatically become her legal representative on her death (§<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t91c07s91-7-237" target="_self">91-7-237</a></cite>).

   Action by anesthesiologist against hospital challenging suspension of his privileges was not rendered moot by plaintiff’s death, as such parts of claim which alleged wrongful discharge were preserved under state survival statute.

       Health care providers’ claim against the decedent’s estate was time-barred because the four-year statute of limitations began to run ninety days after the executor was issued letters of administration, but the providers did not bring their cause of action until after the expiration of the limitations period. Rush Found. Hosp. v. Carlisle, 269 So.3d 222, 2018 Miss. App. LEXIS 111 (Miss. Ct. App. 2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       The purpose of this section [Code 1942, § 612] is to allow time to the administrator to examine and understand the condition of the estate, to provide the means of paying debts, if practicable, without suit by collection of assets, and to be advised of any demands against the estate which it may be necessary to defend. Great Southern Box Co. v. Barrett, 231 Miss. 101, 94 So. 2d 912, 1957 Miss. LEXIS 494 (Miss. 1957).

      When there are two (2) or more administrators of an estate, and one or more of them take all the assets, or the greatest part thereof, and refuse to pay the debts or funeral expenses of the deceased, or to account with the other, the court, on petition of the aggrieved administrator and five (5) days’ notice thereof to the other, may make an order requiring the delivery or payment to the aggrieved administrator of the proportionate share of the estate to which he is entitled. To enforce compliance, the court may revoke the letters of the administrator in default, and may fine him not exceeding One Hundred Dollars ($100.00) or imprison him not exceeding three (3) months as for contempt. Any executor being a residuary legatee may proceed in the same way and with like effect against his co-executor to recover his part of the estate.

    Procedures for insolvent estates.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The executor or administrator shall take proper steps speedily to ascertain whether the estate be solvent or insolvent. If both the real and personal estate be insufficient to pay the debts of the deceased, he shall exhibit to the court a true account of all the personal estate, assets of every description, the land of the deceased, and all the debts due from the deceased; and if it appears to the court that the estate is insolvent, it shall make an order for the sale of all the property. The proceeds of such sale and all other assets shall be equally distributed among all the creditors whose claims shall be duly filed and established, in proportion to the sums due and owing to them respectively, the expenses of the last sickness, the funeral, and the administration, including commissions, being first paid. The sale of the land and distribution of the proceeds of the sale shall be subject to the abatement provisions of Section 91-7-90. Before any decree for sale is made, the devisees or heirs shall be made parties to the proceeding.

     <p>
      When the time for probating and registering claims has elapsed, the court shall cause notice to be inserted for three successive weeks in some newspaper published in the county that at a time fixed the claims will be taken up for examination and adjudication by the court or by the clerk in vacation, as the order may designate, that all claims not required by law to be probated and registered must be filed with the clerk by the day named in the notice, and that all creditors may attend. At the time appointed the court shall examine into the validity of each claim which has been probated and registered and such other claims as may have been filed with the clerk. The executor or administrator or any creditor may object to any claim, and the court shall hear evidence in support of the objection, shall allow any claim that should be allowed, and shall reject in whole or in part any which is in whole or in part not well founded. It shall not be necessary for any creditor to refile with the clerk any claim which has been duly probated and registered within the time and in the manner required by law. All other claims, unless filed with the clerk by the day named in the notice, shall not be allowed; but lawful claims, not required to be probated and registered, which are not filed with the clerk by the day named in the notice shall not be barred as to any surplus that remains after paying in full all claims allowed by the court at the examination and adjudication named in the notice. Provided, however, that in cases where the executor or administrator shall have, prior to the adjudication of insolvency, paid any claim or claims, whether probated and registered or not, such executor or administrator shall have the right by the day named in the notice, to file with the clerk a verified itemized statement of the amount which has been paid thereon, and obtain allowance therefor in the same amount to which the creditor or creditors, whose claim or claims had been so paid, would have been entitled had such creditor filed the claim.

    Distribution of assets in insolvent estate.

     </h3>
     <p>
      When the claims are established and the amount of assets ascertained, the court shall adjudge the pro rata share of each creditor, deducting first the preference claims and deducting from debts not due the legal interest from the time of payment up to the time of their maturity; and the executor or administrator shall distribute all money amongst the creditors, in proportion to their demands. The payment of the claims of the creditors shall be subject to the abatement provisions of Section 91-7-90. A creditor whose pro rata share has been so adjudged, after ten (10) days from the date of the decree ascertaining his share, the same not having been paid, may have execution against the executor or administrator and the sureties on his bond for such sum as may be due him, and costs of execution.

      Every executor or administrator, at least once in each year or oftener if required by the court, shall present under oath an account of his administration, showing the disbursements, every item of which and the amount thereof to be distinctly stated, and it shall also show the receipts of money and from what sources. The failure to account annually shall be a breach of the administration bond, for which it may be put in suit, or the executor or administrator may be removed; but the court may, on application and on cause shown, extend the time for accounting. The court shall examine all such accounts and if satisfied that the account is just and true, it shall decree the same approved and allowed as a correct annual settlement.

Even though the requirement of filing annual accounts is waived in the testator’s will or waived by the court or the chancellor upon petition to the court by the administrator in an intestate estate, the court or the chancellor may later order the executor or administrator to file annual accounts upon the petition of a beneficiary or other interested party if the court or the chancellor determines that the filing of annual accounts is necessary or advisable.

       Denial of daughters’ accounting request was not an abuse of discretion because the chancellor correctly held that under the mother’s will, the daughters’ had so remote an interest with such a mere expectancy of a future inheritance that they were not entitled to an accounting until that interest vested; neither daughter was entitled to an accounting because there was no showing of waste, loss, mismanagement, or fraud.

      In annual and final settlements, the executor, administrator, or guardian shall be entitled to credit for such reasonable sums as he may have paid for the services of an attorney in the management or in behalf of the estate, if the court be of the opinion that the services were proper and rendered in good faith.

       Attorney’s fees are not authorized where services are rendered for sole benefit of individual interested in estate; administratrix should not have been allowed attorney’s fees, to be paid out of estate, where she was the only creditor of estate and record revealed that only pleading for motion filed by her not in furtherance of recovering her claim against estate was payment of outstanding funeral bill. Braxton v. Johnson, 514 So. 2d 1232 (1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       The payment of attorneys’ fees is an expense of the administration of a decedent’s estate, and since such fees are incurred after testator’s death, they do not have to be probated; the testator may waive the testatrix’s duty to account, but upon a charge of the devisees of mismanagement by the executrix, the chancery court may properly require an accounting, with the result that an executrix may act at her peril in paying attorneys’ fees without court approval. Harper v. Harper, 491 So. 2d 189, 1986 Miss. LEXIS 2508 (Miss. 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although attorney’s fees are the personal obligation of the administrator or executor, they may be paid out of the estate as administration expenses. Scott v. Hollingsworth, 487 So. 2d 811, 1986 Miss. LEXIS 2438 (Miss. 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       The supreme court would not require an estate to pay for legal services rendered by an attorney in the interest of the executrix in her individual capacity and which was of no benefit to the estate itself. Ruffin v. Burkhalter, 238 Miss. 358, 118 So. 2d 357, 1960 Miss. LEXIS 413 (Miss. 1960).
      </p>
      <p>
       Attorney’s fees in the management of statutory estates are not a charge upon the estate itself, but are personal obligations of the administrator or executor or guardian, and an allowance for attorney’s fees must be done on the request or petition of the administrator or executor or guardian and not on the direct petition of the attorney himself. Hutton v. Gwin, 188 Miss. 763, 195 So. 486, 1940 Miss. LEXIS 55 (Miss. 1940).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the testator prescribes that his wife should be the guardian of the person and estate of his minor son until he should become twenty-one years of age and should give a bond as guardian effective during that time, and that after the minor had reached his majority the guardian should thereupon become trustee and should furnish bond as such trustee until the son should attain thirty-one years old, at which time the balance of the estate was to be distributed, a period of minority constituted a statutory guardianship and attorney’s fees for services rendered during that period could not be allowed on the direct petition of the attorney himself. Hutton v. Gwin, 188 Miss. 763, 195 So. 486, 1940 Miss. LEXIS 55 (Miss. 1940).
      </p>
      <p>
       Attorneys’ fees incurred by the personal representative in the administration of an estate in his custody are his personal obligations, for which he may be reimbursed if the court be of the opinion that the services were necessary and rendered in good faith. Clarksdale Hospital v. Wallis, 187 Miss. 834, 193 So. 627, 1940 Miss. LEXIS 238 (Miss. 1940).
      </p>
      <p>
       Allowance for attorneys’ fees is unauthorized where services are rendered for sole benefit of an individual, or group of individuals, interested in the estate, as against the others interested. Clarksdale Hospital v. Wallis, 187 Miss. 834, 193 So. 627, 1940 Miss. LEXIS 238 (Miss. 1940).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where hospital’s claim to legacy was against the interest of all the other legatees and devisees under a will, and its successful termination resulted in decreasing their claims, the hospital was not entitled to reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred in defending its rights to the legacy, notwithstanding that the decision as to the validity of the bequest involved a construction of the will which was of interest to all concerned. Clarksdale Hospital v. Wallis, 187 Miss. 834, 193 So. 627, 1940 Miss. LEXIS 238 (Miss. 1940).
      </p>
      <p>
       Attorney’s fees held personal debts of administrator, and not of estate. Reedy v. Allen, 181 Miss. 471, 179 So. 569, 1938 Miss. LEXIS 89 (Miss. 1938).
      </p>
      <p>
       Ordinarily administrator is personally liable to attorney, and entitled, in connection with annual and final settlement, to credit for reasonable attorney’s services on behalf of estate if court thinks they were proper and in good faith. Reedy v. Allen, 181 Miss. 471, 179 So. 569, 1938 Miss. LEXIS 89 (Miss. 1938).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancellor had no authority to allow attorney’s fees where there was no evidence of employment contract. Reedy v. Allen, 181 Miss. 471, 179 So. 569, 1938 Miss. LEXIS 89 (Miss. 1938).
      </p>
      <p>
       Order allowing attorney’s fee in ex parte proceeding for services rendered predecessor of present administratrix and trustee could not be sustained on ground administratrix should have objected to filing petition, where neither petition nor proof showed any power in administratrix or trustee to bind estate, and it was not shown that predecessor was insolvent or out of state. Reedy v. Allen, 181 Miss. 471, 179 So. 569, 1938 Miss. LEXIS 89 (Miss. 1938).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where will empowered executor and trustee to employ persons necessary to manage trust estate, attorney’s fees could be made charge against trust estate. Gwin v. Fountain, 159 Miss. 619, 126 So. 18, 132 So. 559, 1930 Miss. LEXIS 354 (Miss. 1930).
      </p>
      <p>
       Ordinarily debts contracted by administrator are only personal obligations, and this is especially true of attorneys’ fees. Howell v. Myer, 105 Miss. 771, 63 So. 233, 1913 Miss. LEXIS 261 (Miss. 1913).
      </p>
      <p>
       Statute is intended to prevent necessity of suit by attorney against administrator to establish claim for services to estate; statute has no reference to claim which attorney seeks to enforce over administrator’s protest. Murphy v. Harris, 93 Miss. 286, 48 So. 232, 1908 Miss. LEXIS 166 (Miss. 1908).
      </p>
      <p>
       The funeral expenses of decedent and an administrator’s attorney’s fees are not debts against him, and the administrator may pay them with the proceeds of a life insurance policy which is exempt from liability for his debts.

       The chancellor did not abuse his discretion by not allowing additional attorneys fees where the executrix was found in civil and criminal contempt for failing to abide by a previous court order and was subsequently jailed, and where the executrix received legal advice in connection with the contempt action from the same counsel whom she retained on behalf of the estate and thus did not have the purpose of benefiting the estate. In re Estate of Collins v. Collins, 742 So. 2d 147, 1999 Miss. App. LEXIS 251 (Miss. Ct. App. 1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Lawyer should submit time sheet to chancellor listing hours spent serving estate and fee normally charged for such service when pursuing attorneys fees under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t91c07s91-7-281" target="_self">91-7-281</a></cite>; attorney’s fees are not recoverable from estate for services performed before appointment of administrator. Braxton v. Johnson, 514 So. 2d 1232 (1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       The chancellor did not abuse his discretion in allowing the payment of attorney’s fees for services rendered prior to the date the decedent’s estate could and should have been closed, nor in surcharging the executrix for the balance of the legal fees incurred after that date. Harper v. Harper, 491 So. 2d 189, 1986 Miss. LEXIS 2508 (Miss. 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       Award of $1500 as fees for attorney retained by an estate valued in excess of $229,000 was not so inadequate as to amount to an abuse of the chancellor’s discretion. Scott v. Hollingsworth, 487 So. 2d 811, 1986 Miss. LEXIS 2438 (Miss. 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the proper management, handling, and preservation of funds of a decedent’s estate in the sum of $13,750, derived from condemnation proceedings, required the executor and life tenant to seek the aid of the chancery court and to submit the matter to its jurisdiction for proper decrees in regard to the disposition of the funds, the allowance of an attorney’s fee in the sum of $1,000 was justified. Bradley v. Bradley, 185 So. 2d 655, 1966 Miss. LEXIS 1518 (Miss. 1966).
      </p>
      <p>
       Allowance of compensation and attorney’s fees to an administrator within the limits prescribed by statute is a matter addressed to the sound discretion of the chancery court, and the supreme court will not interfere with the exercise of that discretion except in cases of its manifest and flagrant abuse. Schwander v. Rubel, 221 Miss. 875, 75 So. 2d 45, 1954 Miss. LEXIS 603 (Miss. 1954).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancery court’s allowance for attorney’s fees which was slightly less than four per cent of estate, held not abuse of discretion. King v. Wade, 175 Miss. 72, 166 So. 327, 1936 Miss. LEXIS 8 (Miss. 1936).
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead of paying attorneys and asking credit therefor, executrix may ask court to fix fees. Brown v. Franklin, 166 Miss. 899, 145 So. 752, 1933 Miss. LEXIS 328 (Miss. 1933).
      </p>
      <p>
       Amount allowable as attorney’s fee for services rendered in administration of estate rests in sound discretion of chancery court. Brown v. Franklin, 166 Miss. 899, 145 So. 752, 1933 Miss. LEXIS 328 (Miss. 1933).
      </p>
      <p>
       Time is not the only element involved in fixing attorney’s fee for services rendered executrix, since skill, responsibility, and amount involved must also be considered. Brown v. Franklin, 166 Miss. 899, 145 So. 752, 1933 Miss. LEXIS 328 (Miss. 1933).
      </p>
      <p>
       Opinions of attorneys concerning propriety of fee for services rendered to executrix were not binding on chancery court, which might act on its own knowledge. Brown v. Franklin, 166 Miss. 899, 145 So. 752, 1933 Miss. LEXIS 328 (Miss. 1933).
      </p>
      <p>
       Allowance of attorney’s fee of $750 for services rendered executrix in estate amounting to $29,104.95, where litigation was carried to supreme court, held not abuse of discretion. Brown v. Franklin, 166 Miss. 899, 145 So. 752, 1933 Miss. LEXIS 328 (Miss. 1933).

       As long as no duplication of services is shown, an executor is not prevented from seeking payment for services rendered purely in his fiduciary capacity that may not necessarily involve legal work, while, at the same time, seeking additional compensation for other work of a purely legal nature in lieu of payment for those other discrete services as the fiduciary. Thomas v. Evans (In re Estate of Thomas), 740 So. 2d 332, 1999 Miss. App. LEXIS 117 (Miss. Ct. App. 1999).
      </p>

   There is no prohibition in this section that would prevent a fiduciary who is also an attorney from petitioning for some part of his itemized services to be paid under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t91c07s91-7-299" target="_self">91-7-299</a></cite>, where his right to compensation would not necessarily be commensurate with prevailing legal fees; nor is there a prohibition for that same fiduciary, as to those separately identified services that were unquestionably performed in his capacity as an attorney, seeking compensation under this section, in lieu of being paid for those particular services under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t91c07s91-7-299" target="_self">91-7-299</a></cite>.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Unless the court or chancellor has, by order entered on the minutes, designated another annual term for that purpose, it shall be the duty of the clerk at the first term of the chancery court of his county in each year to make up a complete and impartial list of all executors and administrators and guardians who have failed to present and settle their accounts within the year preceding. In each and every such case, the clerk shall enter the same on the motion docket and thereby move the court for an order on the defaulter; and the court shall, in each and every such case, order a citation to be issued for the defaulter and for the surety or sureties on his bond, returnable forthwith or at the next term of court. On the return thereof, unless sufficient cause be shown for such failure and that the same was not the result of negligence or contumacy, the court shall proceed against the delinquent executor, administrator, or guardian for a contempt, and may also remove him from office. If there be no such defaulter, the clerk shall so report and obtain an order reciting his said report to that effect, which order shall be entered on the minutes of the term. If there be any defaulter and the clerk shall fail to fully prepare the list and to enter the motions herein required, he shall not be entitled to any allowance for attendance on the term nor to any annual compensation for ex officio services to the court. Any allowance by the court contrary to the terms of this section may nevertheless be recovered from the said clerk on his bond by the state tax commission, or by any other office similarly empowered, for the benefit of the county treasury; in addition to which, the clerk shall be liable on his bond at the suit of any party in interest who has been damaged in any case by the said failure of the clerk.

    Process for derelict fiduciary.

      Whenever it shall appear of record, or otherwise, that any executor, administrator, guardian, receiver, or fiduciary appointed by any chancery court is derelict in the performance of any duty required of him by law or the orders of the court or chancellor, or is liable to be punished or removed for any cause prescribed by law, then such court or the chancellor in vacation may, on the application of any interested party or of his or its own motion, order a citation for such executor, administrator, guardian, receiver, or other fiduciary, as the case may be, to be issued by the clerk of the court in which such cause or matter is pending, returnable forthwith or at such time and place, in term time or vacation, as may be specified in such order, to appear and show cause why he should not be removed or punished for contempt, either or both, as may be directed in such order. The citation shall be directed to the sheriff of the county of the residence of such fiduciary, if known to the clerk; otherwise, it shall be directed to the sheriff of the county where such matter or cause is pending, and shall be executed without advance payment of fees.

Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t91c07s91-7-285" target="_self">91-7-285</a></cite> and to set aside an allegedly fraudulent conveyance, a chancery court erred by dismissing based on a lack of standing because the father was an interested party due to the fact that his daughters were beneficiaries under their mother’s will.

   An administrator’s failure to file sufficiently specific accountings and inventories and his admission that he had spent or lent large sums of funds taken from the estate for which he was unable to account formed a sufficient basis for the chancellor to remove him, under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t91c07s91-7-285" target="_self">91-7-285</a></cite>, as executor of the estate.

      If the citation be returned unexecuted because such fiduciary cannot be found after diligent search by the sheriff to whom it is directed, then the clerk shall make and file among the papers in the cause an affidavit stating such information as he may have been able to ascertain after diligent inquiry concerning the whereabouts and post office address of such fiduciary. If by such affidavit it shall appear that the whereabouts of such fiduciary is unknown to the clerk or that he is a nonresident of, or absents himself from, this state, then the court or chancellor shall make an order directing the issuance and publication of an alias citation for such fiduciary to appear and show cause why he should not be removed, at a time and place specified therein, not less than thirty days from the date of such order. The sheriff of the county where such matter or cause is pending shall thereupon make publication of such citation by posting a true copy thereof at three public places in his county, one of which shall be at the courthouse, not less than twenty-one days before the return day thereof, and shall make return of the citation showing such publication and the date and places where such copies were posted. If the clerk’s affidavit shall show the post office address of such fiduciary, then the clerk shall, at the time of issuing such alias citation for publication, mail postage prepaid a true copy thereof to him at such address and note the fact on his general docket in the same manner and with the same effect as in other like cases. On the return of such alias citation, executed by publication as aforesaid, the court or chancellor shall be as fully empowered to proceed as if such fiduciary had been personally served in this state.

     <p>
      When the estate has been administered by payment of the debts and the collection of the assets, it shall be the duty of the executor or administrator, unless the court or chancellor, on cause shown, shall otherwise order, to make and file a final settlement of the administration by making out and presenting to the court, under oath, his final account, which shall contain a distinct statement of all the balances of the annual accounts, either as debits or credits, all other charges and disbursements, amounts received and not contained in any previous annual account, and a statement of the kind and condition of all assets in his hands. There shall be no requirement for filing a final account if the requirement of filing accountings is waived in the testator’s will. The court or the chancellor may also waive the requirement for filing a final account in an intestate estate upon petition to the court by the administrator. Even though the requirement of filing accountings or the final account is waived in the testator’s will or waived by the court or the chancellor upon petition to the court by the administrator in an intestate estate, the court or the chancellor may later order the executor or administrator to file a final account upon the timely petition of a beneficiary or other interested party if the court or the chancellor determines that the filing of a final account is necessary or advisable and the petition is timely filed.

Provided, however, that said bank or trust company shall produce said vouchers for inspection of any interested party or his or her attorney at any time during legal banking hours at the office of said bank or trust company; and provided, further, that the court on its own motion, or on the motion of any interested party, may require that said vouchers be produced and inspected at the time of hearing of any objections that may be filed to any final account”; and added the present last three sentences.

       In a proceeding by a widow to reopen the estate of her deceased husband more than two years after entry of a final decree on the ground that the final account had never been filed and that the final decree was therefore a nullity, the trial court properly denied the petition where the transcript was a part of the record and it indicated that, although the final account had not be stamped “Filed” until three years later, there was no dispute that it had been presented to the court, that it had been a part of the record on presentation of same, and that the decree had been based upon said account and evidence heard for the approval thereof, and where there was no specific charge of fraud against the executor which would constitute a bar to the statute of limitations.

       Trial court properly found that a law firm was not an interested party entitled to notice of an estate’s final accounting pursuant to the notice statute because the firm did not probate a claim or have a contract with the estate or otherwise show a direct pecuniary interest in the estate. Ferrell v. Cole (In re Estate of Cole), 256 So.3d 1156, 2018 Miss. LEXIS 366 (Miss. 2018).

       Similar standard used in will contests should be used to define interested parties regarding the final accounting; to be an interested party under the statute, the party must have some legal tie to the estate in the fashion of a direct pecuniary interest.

       Under this section [Code 1942, § 642] the executors are entitled to an allowance of compensation, which should be fixed within the limits of the statute on the gross personal estate actually accounted for by the executors in good faith. Schwander v. Rubel, 221 Miss. 875, 75 So. 2d 45, 1954 Miss. LEXIS 603 (Miss. 1954).
      </p>
      <p>
       Acceptance by an executor or trustee of an appointment under a will, whether under a stated compensation or where none is provided, except where a statute fixes it, is conclusive of any right to an increased compensation. Barry v. Barry, 198 Miss. 677, 21 So. 2d 922, 1945 Miss. LEXIS 239 (Miss. 1945).
      </p>
      <p>
       An executor or trustee cannot accept his appointment and reject the condition as to compensation upon which it is made. Barry v. Barry, 198 Miss. 677, 21 So. 2d 922, 1945 Miss. LEXIS 239 (Miss. 1945).
      </p>
      <p>
       In fixing amount of compensation under this section [Code 1942, § 642], there are numerous elements to be considered, such as: the mechanical work of making out the reports and of collecting the money and of disbursing it; the skill, responsibility, and amount involved; skillful, prompt and efficient service in the speedy disposition of winding up and settling the estate, responsibility and skill being important elements. Ralston v. Bank of Clarksdale, 188 Miss. 345, 194 So. 923, 1940 Miss. LEXIS 35 (Miss. 1940).
      </p>

      <p>
       The supreme court will not interfere with the chancery court’s exercise of discretion in regard to the allowance of compensation for administrator’s fees within the limits prescribed by this section [Code 1942, § 642], except in cases of its manifest and flagrant abuse. Bryan v. Quinn, 233 Miss. 366, 102 So. 2d 124, 1958 Miss. LEXIS 392 (Miss. 1958).
      </p>
      <p>
       The matter of the allowance of fees to executors and administrators for services rendered in the administration of an estate rests in the sound discretion of the chancery court, there being a minimum allowance of not less than one per cent and the maximum amount of seven per cent. Ralston v. Bank of Clarksdale, 188 Miss. 345, 194 So. 923, 1940 Miss. LEXIS 35 (Miss. 1940).
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless the record discloses an abuse of discretion vested in the chancery court, the supreme court will not disturb the chancellor’s action in fixing administrator’s fees within the limits provided by this section [Code 1942, § 642].

      <p>
       Where an executor, administrator, or guardian also acts as attorney for the estate, there is no potential for double compensation, at least in the circumstance where the fiduciary fully itemizes his services in order to show the extent and degree of difficulty of his work and any separate legal work is separately itemized. Thomas v. Evans (In re Estate of Thomas), 740 So. 2d 332, 1999 Miss. App. LEXIS 117 (Miss. Ct. App. 1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   There is no prohibition in the statute that would prevent a fiduciary who is also an attorney from petitioning for some part of his itemized services to be paid under this section, where his right to compensation would not necessarily be commensurate with prevailing legal fees; nor is there a prohibition for that same fiduciary, as to those separately identified services that were unquestionably performed in his capacity as an attorney, seeking compensation under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t91c07s91-7-281" target="_self">91-7-281</a></cite>, in lieu of being paid for those particular services under this section.

       Where heirs to an estate were unable to agree among themselves as to being appraisers and later agreed on disinterested parties to appraise the estate, the chancellor correctly allowed the administrator reimbursement of allowance of appraiser’s fees in amount of $5 each, to two appraisers.

       Where at a sale of personal property an administrator employed an auctioneer and a bookkeeper and allowed them a total of $75 on the ground that their services were necessary and were to the best interests of the estate, the expense was properly allowed.

       Where in the course of administration of an estate the heirs petitioned for sale of cotton gin property owned by decedent, and the court appointed an administrator as a special commissioner to make the sale and the administrator obtained allowances for services of a surveyor, auctioneer and bookkeeper, the total amount of these expenses being $114, and the cotton gin property brought $53,000 at a sale which far exceeded its appraised value, these items of expense were properly allowed to the administrator.

       Attorney fees granted to an executor’s attorney were not excessive because the fees were reasonable and not out of line with the fees claimed by the trustee who challenged them. Carson Family Trust v. Carson (In re Estate of Carson), 986 So. 2d 1072, 2008 Miss. App. LEXIS 434 (Miss. Ct. App. 2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       The chancery court properly denied executrix fees where the chancellor found that the estate was administered in a grossly negligent manner; in support of this finding of negligent administration, or maladministration, the chancellor cited the executrix’s noncompliance with court orders that eventually culminated in her being found guilty of civil and criminal contempt.

       An administrator’s fee, an attorney’s fee, and accounting fees were excessive where (1) the $3.1 million estate was very simple, (2) the executor, attorney, and accountant had ready access to information which made their jobs considerably easier, and (3) the fees equated to approximately $1200 per hour for the administrator and attorney and $300 per hour for the accountant.

       Absent maladministration, compensation for an executor of an estate with a gross value in excess of $229,000 should be awarded within the statutory guidelines, rather than at $1500 or 6/10 of one percent of the value of the estate. Scott v. Hollingsworth, 487 So. 2d 811, 1986 Miss. LEXIS 2438 (Miss. 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the decedent left an estate of the approximate value of $139,000, the allowance to the executrix of a fee of $5,000 was not a manifest and flagrant abuse of discretion by the chancellor. Bryan v. Quinn, 233 Miss. 366, 102 So. 2d 124, 1958 Miss. LEXIS 392 (Miss. 1958).
      </p>
      <p>
       Allowance of $3,000 to executor as compensation for his services is not excessive when total assets of estate amounted to $48,126.43, total disbursements amounted to $42,109.05 and he was successful in making sale of 500 acres of land for sum of $36,000, which was $8,000 in excess of all prior offers. Oberst v. Mullens, 43 So. 2d 560 (Miss. 1949).
      </p>
      <p>
       Allowance to administrator of $2,000 as his compensation for services rendered in an estate consisting of something over $65,000 did not indicate an abuse of discretion of the chancery court. Ralston v. Bank of Clarksdale, 188 Miss. 345, 194 So. 923, 1940 Miss. LEXIS 35 (Miss. 1940).

       Appellant’s delay in closing the estate and his other indiscretions as executor, most notably his decision to borrow thousands of dollars from the estate without court approval, provided ample reason for the chancery court to refuse to reimburse appellant for his work as executor.

       Compensation allowed executor should not be reduced on ground that he did not comply with law as to payment of unprobated claims, when amounts expended by him without authority of law were restored by him to estate although claims were actually owed by testatrix and estate would have been liable had they been duly probated in time required by law.

Upon return of summons executed or publication made, the court may order the administrator or executor to make the distribution or to pay the legacies according to the rights of the parties, as may be adjudged; but the administrator or executor shall not be compelled, before final settlement, to make distribution or to pay any legacy until bond, with sufficient sureties, be given by the distributee or legatee, conditioned to refund his proportionate part of any debts or demands that may afterwards appear against the estate, and the costs of recovering the same.

   Chancellor did not err in dismissing a nephew’s case against his uncles on the ground that his claim was time-barred pursuant to
   Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t91c07s91-7-309" target="_self">91-7-309</a></cite> because if either the two-year statute of limitations under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t91c07s91-7-309" target="_self">91-7-309</a></cite> or the three-year statute of limitations for an action to set aside a deed based on fraud was applied, the nephew’s claim was still time-barred; the statute of limitations began running against the nephew on November 26, 1999, his twenty-first birthday, but the nephew did not file his lawsuit until May 21, 2009, which was well outside of the statute of limitations.
   Walton v. Walton, 52 So.3d 468, 2011 Miss. App. LEXIS 32 (Miss. Ct. App. 2011).
      </p>
      <p>
       Decedent’s grandson, who was not an heir at law, failed to set out in his complaint basic available information, such as the time of the alleged fraud on the part of the decedent’s administrator; the allegation of fraud was not stated with the required particularity to overcome the two-year statute of limitations. McClendon v. Hudson (In re Estate of Hudson), 962 So. 2d 90, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 489 (Miss. Ct. App. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a proceeding by a widow to reopen the estate of her deceased husband more than two years after entry of a final decree on the ground that the final account had never been filed and that the final decree was therefore a nullity, the trial court properly denied the petition where the transcript was a part of the record and it indicated that, although the final account had not be stamped “Filed” until three years later, there was no dispute that it had been presented to the court, that it had been a part of the record on presentation of same, and that the decree had been based upon said account and evidence heard for the approval thereof, and where there was no specific charge of fraud against the executor which would constitute a bar to the statute of limitations. Byrd v. Page, 384 So. 2d 1038, 1980 Miss. LEXIS 2015 (Miss. 1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       The action of an administratrix of a decedent, attacking final decrees entered in her decedent’s guardianship and in settlement of the decedent’s deceased father’s estate, claiming an interest in the after-acquired property of coheirs, was barred by the section [Code 1942, § 646] where no petition was filed to falsify the settlement of the two administrations within two years after the date of the decrees. Barrett v. Turner, 229 So. 2d 563, 1969 Miss. LEXIS 1249 (Miss. 1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       This provision does not apply to one entitled to participate in the distribution who was not made a party to the administration proceeding, where there was no statutory proceeding to determine heirs. Shepherd v. Townsend, 249 Miss. 383, 163 So. 2d 746, 1964 Miss. LEXIS 401 (Miss. 1964).
      </p>
      <p>
       Petition by war veteran’s widow against administratrix and her bondsmen to review previous proceedings whereby administratrix distributed to various persons sums due to veteran under federal acts held not demurrable because distributees were not joined as parties, where money involved, under federal and state statutes, belonged to widow as sole distributee, and persons to whom administratrix distributed money were strangers to estate so far as widow’s rights were concerned. Lewis v. Jefferson, 173 Miss. 657, 161 So. 669, 1935 Miss. LEXIS 217 (Miss. 1935).
      </p>
      <p>
       Since heirs under statute could challenge administrator’s final steps until two years after final account was approved, judgment approving administrator’s sale was interlocutory, and hence court at subsequent term could require administrator to charge himself with true value of merchandise sold and subsequently repurchased by administrator after fraudulently inducing widow not to bid. Rea v. Smith, 172 Miss. 238, 159 So. 845, 1935 Miss. LEXIS 132 (Miss. 1935).

       Chancellor
   erred when he dismissed the contempt petition that the decedent’s
   granddaughter filed in the decedent’s conservatorship matter
   as her claims were not governed by the two-year statute of limitations
   as her claims were not premised on reopening or falsifying the conservator’s
   final accounting; instead, the seven-year statute of limitations governed
   her contempt claim that the conservator disregarded the chancellor’s
   order to transfer the balance of the decedent’s account to
   the decedent’s estate; and the granddaughter’s remaining
   claims, including breach of the conservator’s fiduciary duty
   and other claims related to opening the joint account, fell under
   the three-year ‘‘catch-all’’ statute of
   limitations.

     <p>
      Parties interested in an estate as legatees, distributees, or creditors may, either jointly or severally, institute proceedings upon the bond of the executor or administrator or guardian for a devastavit against the principal and his surety without first having instituted suit against the executor or administrator or guardian to establish a devastavit. When any executor, administrator or guardian is a nonresident of, or shall absent himself from, or conceal himself within this state so that personal service of summons or citation or attachment cannot be made upon him, and such nonresident, absent or concealed executor, administrator, or guardian shall fail to file his accounts and make his settlements as required by law, or shall have unlawfully removed any of the property committed to his trust, or shall have been guilty of any misappropriation or devastavit, it shall be the duty of the court, on the motion of the clerk as elsewhere provided in this chapter, or on the motion of any party in interest, to proceed against the surety or sureties on the bond of said executor, administrator, or guardian, in respect to all of which matters the said surety or sureties shall be taken and held as principal. In proceeding as aforementioned, the default of the said executor, administrator, or guardian in failing to file and settle his accounts as required by law shall be taken as prima facie evidence that the said defaulter has misappropriated the money or property, or both, which may be disclosed by the inventory, appraisement, or by any other of the official papers in the case, or which may be shown by competent evidence outside of said record, to have come into the possession of said defaulter.

     <p>
      A surety on any bond of an executor, administrator, county administrator, or any other administrator apprehending danger of loss because of his suretyship may petition the court, chancellor, or clerk to require the executor or administrator to give a new bond and that he may be discharged from further liability. The court, chancellor, or clerk, on five days’ notice to the executor or administrator, shall grant such petition and require a new bond, within a reasonable time, to be prescribed. In case of refusal or failure to give such new bond, the executor or administrator shall be removed and administration de bonis non granted. The acts done by the executor or administrator, and all proceedings that may have been instituted against him, shall be treated and conducted by or against his successor, as in case of the death of an executor or administrator. If the executor or administrator shall give new bond as required, the original bond shall from that time cease to be operative in future, but not as to previous liabilities; and the effect of such new bond shall be to bind the obligors therein for past as well as future liabilities.

         A distribution interest is classified as either a mandatory interest, a support interest or a discretionary interest; and although not the exclusive means to create each such respective distribution interest, absent clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, use of the example language accompanying the following definitions of each such respective distribution interest results in the indicated classification of distribution interest:
         <p>
          a. All income shall be distributed to a named beneficiary; or

         <p>

         </p>
         <p>
          b.

         </p>
         <ol type="i">
          <li id="t91c08s91-8-103ol14B9Bi">
           A mandatory interest means a distribution interest in which the timing of any distribution must occur within one (1) year from the date the right to the distribution arises and the trustee has no discretion in determining whether a distribution shall be made or the amount of such distribution; example distribution language indicating a mandatory interest includes, but is not limited to:
          </li>

           A support interest means a distribution interest that is not a mandatory interest but still contains mandatory language such as “shall make distributions” and is coupled with a standard capable of judicial interpretation; example distribution language indicating a support interest includes, but is not limited to:

          <li id="t91c08s91-8-103ol14B9Biii">
           A discretionary interest means any interest that is not a mandatory or a support interest and is any distribution interest where a trustee has any discretion to make or withhold a distribution; example distribution language indicating a discretionary interest includes, but is not limited to:

          c. The trustee may make distributions for health, education, maintenance, and support;
         </p>
         <p>
          d. The trustee shall make distributions for health, education, maintenance, and support; however, the trustee may exclude any of the beneficiaries or may make unequal distributions among them; or
         </p>
         <p>
          e. The trustee may make distributions for health, education, maintenance, support, comfort, and general welfare;
         </p>
         <p>
          f. A discretionary interest may also be evidenced by:

         <p>
          1. Permissive distribution language such as “may make distributions”;
         </p>
         <p>
          2. Mandatory distribution language that is negated by the discretionary distribution language contained in the trust such as “the trustee shall make distributions in the trustee’s sole and absolute discretion”;
         </p>
         <p>
          g. An interest that includes mandatory distribution language such as “shall” but is subsequently qualified by discretionary distribution language shall be classified as a discretionary interest and not as a support or a mandatory interest;

        </li>
        <li id="t91c08s91-8-103ol14B9Ci">
         <p>
          a. The trust shall be a mandatory interest only to the extent of the mandatory distribution language;
         </p>
         <p>
          b. The trust shall be a support interest only to the extent of such support distribution language; and
         </p>
         <p>
          c. The remaining trust property shall be held as a discretionary interest;
         </p>

          <li>
           To the extent a trust contains distribution language indicating the existence of any combination of a mandatory, support and discretionary interest, that combined interest of the trust shall be divided and treated separately as follows:
          </li>
          <li id="t91c08s91-8-103ol14B9Cii">
           For purposes of this subparagraph (C), a support interest that includes mandatory distribution language such as “shall” but is subsequently qualified by discretionary distribution language, shall be classified as a discretionary interest and not as a support interest.

      An organization that conducts activities through employees has notice or knowledge of a fact involving a trust only from the time the information was received by an employee having responsibility to act for the trust, or would have been brought to the employee’s attention if the organization had exercised reasonable diligence. An organization exercises reasonable diligence if it maintains reasonable routines for communicating significant information to the employee having responsibility to act for the trust and there is reasonable compliance with the routines. Reasonable diligence does not require an employee of the organization to communicate information unless the communication is part of the individual’s regular duties or the individual knows a matter involving the trust would be materially affected by the information.

     <p>
      A trustee may file an accounting of the trustee’s administration of a trust in court at any time and seek a partial or final settlement thereof or, upon petition of an interested party, a court may order a trustee to render an accounting of the trustee’s administration of a trust and require a partial or final settlement thereof. Notice of such judicial proceeding shall be provided to the trustee and each beneficiary, or representative thereof pursuant to Article 3, as provided by the applicable rules of civil procedure.
     </p>
     <p>
      A trust accounting must be a reasonably understandable report from the date of the last accounting or, if none, from the date upon which the trustee became accountable, or other such date the court may set, which provides reasonable detail of the transactions affecting the administration of the trust, and which adequately discloses the following information:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t91c08s91-8-205ol11">
       The accounting must identify the trust, the trustee furnishing the accounting, and the time period covered by the accounting.

      <li id="t91c08s91-8-205ol12">
       The accounting must show all receipts and disbursements occurring during the accounting period. Gains and losses realized during the accounting period must also be shown.
      </li>
      <li id="t91c08s91-8-205ol13">
       The accounting, to the extent feasible, must identify and value trust assets on hand at the close of the accounting period. For each asset or class of assets reasonably capable of valuation, the accounting shall contain two (2) values, (A) the asset acquisition value or carrying value, and (B) the estimated current value, if feasible. The accounting must identify each known noncontingent liability with an estimated current amount of the liability if known.
      </li>
      <li id="t91c08s91-8-205ol14">
       To the extent feasible, the accounting must show the significant noncash transactions affecting the assets of the trust, including name changes in investment holdings, adjustments to carrying value, or stock splits.
      </li>
      <li id="t91c08s91-8-205ol15">
       The accounting must reflect the allocation of receipts and disbursements between income and principal when the allocation affects the interest of any beneficiary of the trust.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      Any order or judgment of the court on such accounting and partial or final settlement shall be final and conclusive as to all matters occurring during the accounting period, and appeals therefrom shall and must be taken in the manner provided for from any other final judgment of the court.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Except as provided in subsection (b) and except as required by a statute other than this chapter, a trust need not be evidenced by a trust instrument, but the creation of an oral trust and its terms may be established only by clear and convincing evidence.
     </p>
     <p>
      (1) No trust of or in any real property can be created except by a written instrument signed by the party who declares or creates such trust (the “settlor”), or by his last will, in writing. Every writing declaring or creating a trust in real property, other than a last will, may be acknowledged and proved as other writing and filed for record with the clerk of the chancery court in which the real property, or part of it, is located, and the filing shall serve as constructive notice of the existence and terms of the trust from and after filing.
     </p>
     <p>
      In lieu of filing the trust instrument or other writing declaring or creating a trust in real property, there may be filed with the clerk of the chancery court in which the real property, or part of it, is located a memorandum of trust signed by the settlor, trustee, or successor trustee and acknowledged or proved as other writings and the filing of the memorandum of trust shall serve as constructive notice of the existence and terms of the trust from and after filing. The memorandum shall contain substantially all of the following information:
     </p>
     <p>
      The name of the trust;
     </p>
     <p>
      The street and mailing address of the office, and the name and street and mailing address and telephone number of the trustee;
     </p>
     <p>
      The name and street and mailing address and telephone number of the settlor of the trust;
     </p>
     <p>
      A legally sufficient description of all interests in real property owned by or conveyed to the trust;
     </p>
     <p>
      The anticipated date of termination of the trust or the event upon which the trust will be terminated; and
     </p>
     <p>
      The general powers granted to the trustee, which may be by reference to the statutory powers granted to the trustee under the terms of the trust instrument.
     </p>
     <p>
      The memorandum may also contain the name and street and mailing address and telephone number of any successor trustee. The memorandum of trust may be filed with the clerk of the appropriate chancery court either before or after a deed of conveyance of real property to the trust or trustee, in his capacity as such. The memorandum need not comply with subparagraph (D) if filed before or contemporaneously with a conveyance of any real property to the trust or trustee in his capacity as such, and need not be amended upon a subsequent conveyance of real property to the trust or trustee in his capacity as such, so long as the deed of conveyance is recorded in the appropriate county, and the recording of the deed of conveyance to the trust or trustee, as the case may be, shall constitute compliance with subparagraph (D). In addition, the deed of conveyance may also serve as a memorandum of trust, or an amendment to the memorandum of trust, as the case may be, so long as the deed of conveyance contains the information required for a memorandum of trust as set forth in this subsection (b).
     </p>
     <p>
      The settlor may amend the memorandum if the trust to which it relates is subject to a power of amendment or revocation by the settlor; otherwise, only the then-serving trustee may amend the memorandum. The memorandum of amendment shall set forth the amendment to the original memorandum with particularity. The amended memorandum of trust may be made effective on a future date, which must be a date certain. The memorandum of amendment may be signed by the creator, trustee or successor trustee, as the case may be, and acknowledged or proved as other writings and filed for record with the clerk of the chancery court where the original memorandum is of record. The filing of the memorandum of amendment shall serve as constructive notice of the existence and terms of the amendment from and after filing.
     </p>
     <p>
      The provision of Sections 89-5-24 and 89-5-33 shall apply to any trust instrument, memorandum, or amendment that is to be recorded under this subsection (b).
     </p>
     <p>
      The provisions of this subsection (b) shall have no application to trusts of personal property, or to any trust arising or resulting by implication of law out of a conveyance of land. The failure to file a copy of the trust instrument, memorandum or deed of conveyance shall not affect the validity of the trust or the trust instrument.
     </p>
     <p>
      A certificate of trust containing the information set forth in Section 91-9-7 that was filed before July 1, 2014, shall be considered constructive notice of the existence and terms of the trust from and after its filing, and the filing of a memorandum of trust under this subsection (b) shall not be necessary.
     </p>
     <p>
      (1) All property originally brought into the trust or subsequently acquired by purchase or otherwise, on account of the trust, is trust property.
     </p>
     <p>
      Unless the contrary intention appears, property acquired with trust funds is trust property.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any estate in real property may be acquired in the trust name. Title so acquired can be conveyed in the trust name or by the trustees, as trustees of the trust.

      A trust may be created to provide for the care of an animal alive during the settlor’s lifetime.

      Property of a trust authorized by this section may be applied only to its intended use, except to the extent the court determines that the value of the trust property exceeds the amount required for the intended use.

    Modification or termination of noncharitable irrevocable trust by consent.

     </h3>
     <p>
      During the settlor’s lifetime, a noncharitable irrevocable trust may be modified or terminated by the trustee upon consent of all qualified beneficiaries, even if the modification or termination is inconsistent with a material purpose of the trust if the settlor does not object to the proposed modification or termination. The trustee shall notify the settlor of the proposed modification or termination not less than sixty (60) days before initiating the modification or termination. The notice of modification or termination must include:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t91c08s91-8-411ol11">
       An explanation of the reasons for the proposed modification or termination;

      <li id="t91c08s91-8-411ol13">
       The date, not less than sixty (60) days after the giving of notice, by which the settlor must notify the trustee of an objection to the proposed modification or termination.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      Following the settlor’s death, a noncharitable irrevocable trust may be terminated upon consent of all of the qualified beneficiaries if the court concludes that continuance of the trust is not necessary to achieve any material purpose of the trust. A noncharitable irrevocable trust may be modified upon consent of all of the qualified beneficiaries if the court concludes that modification is not inconsistent with a material purpose of the trust.
     </p>
     <p>
      Upon termination of a trust under subsection (a) or (b), the trustee shall distribute the trust property as agreed by the qualified beneficiaries.
     </p>
     <p>
      If not all of the qualified beneficiaries consent to a proposed modification or termination of the trust under subsection (a) or (b), the modification or termination may be approved by the court if the court is satisfied that:
     </p>
     <p>
      If all of the qualified beneficiaries had consented, the trust could have been modified or terminated under this section; and
     </p>
     <p>
      The interests of a qualified beneficiary who does not consent will be adequately protected.
     </p>
     <p>
      Solely for purposes of this section, the term “noncharitable irrevocable trust” refers to a trust that is not revocable by the settlor with respect to which:
     </p>
     <p>
      No federal or state income, gift, estate or inheritance tax charitable deduction was allowed upon transfers to the trust; and
     </p>
     <p>
      The value of all interests in the trust owned by charitable organizations does not exceed five percent (5%) of the value of the trust.
     </p>

      Notwithstanding subsection (a), the trustee may seek court approval of a modification or termination.

    Combination and division of trusts.

     <p>
      After notice to the qualified beneficiaries, a trustee may combine two (2) or more trusts into a single trust or divide a trust into two (2) or more separate trusts, if the result does not impair the rights of any beneficiary or adversely affect achievement of the purposes of the trust. In addition to any other combination or division the result of which does not impair the rights of any beneficiary or adversely affect achievement of the purposes of the trust, a combination or division pursuant to subsection (d) of this section shall not be considered as impairing the rights of any beneficiary or adversely affecting the achievement of the purposes of the trust. If the trusts to be combined or divided have different trustees, the trustees may negotiate the terms of the combined or divided trusts, including which trusts will be the surviving trust or trusts, who will be the trustee or trustees of the surviving trust or trusts and any other matter relating to the operation of the surviving trust or trusts.
     </p>
     <p>
      In addition to combining two (2) or more trusts into a single trust or dividing a trust into two (2) or more separate trusts, a trustee, after notice to the qualified beneficiaries, may segregate by allocation to a separate account or trust a specific amount from, a portion of, or a specific asset included in the trust property of any trust to reflect a disclaimer, to reflect or result in differences in federal tax attributes, to satisfy any federal tax requirement, to make federal tax elections, to reduce potential generation-skipping transfer tax liability, or for any other tax planning purposes or other reasons.
     </p>
     <p>
      A separate trust created by severance or segregation must be treated as a separate trust for all purposes from the effective date in which the severance or segregation is effective. The effective date of the severance or segregation may be retroactive. In managing, investing, administering, and distributing the trust property of any separate account or trust and in making applicable tax elections, the trustee may consider the differences in federal tax attributes and all other factors the trustee believes pertinent and may make disproportionate distributions from the separate trusts or accounts created.
     </p>
     <p>
      A trust or account created by consolidation, severance, or segregation under this section shall not be considered as impairing the rights of a beneficiary if the trust is held on terms and conditions that are substantially equivalent to the terms of the trust before consolidation, severance, or segregation so that the aggregate interests of each beneficiary are substantially equivalent to the beneficiary’s interests in the trust or trusts before consolidation, severance, or segregation. In determining whether a beneficiary’s aggregate interests are substantially equivalent, the trustee shall consider the economic value of those interests to the extent they can be valued, considering actuarial factors as appropriate. If a beneficiary’s interest cannot be valued with any reasonable degree of certainty because of the nature of the trust property, the terms of the trust, or other reasons, the trustee shall base the determination upon such other factors as are reasonable and appropriate under the facts and circumstances applicable to that particular trust, including the purposes of the trust. However, the terms of any trust before consolidation, severance or segregation which permit qualification of that trust for an applicable federal tax deduction, exclusion, election, exemption, or other special federal tax status must remain identical in the consolidated trust or in each of the separate trusts or accounts created by severance or segregation.

       The capacity required to create, amend, revoke, or add property to a revocable trust, or to direct the actions of the trustee of a revocable trust, is the same as that required to make a will. To be effective as a post-death disposition of property transferred during the transferor’s life or by the transferor’s will to a trust of which the transferor is the settlor or deemed to be the settlor, neither a revocable nor an irrevocable trust existing on or executed after July 1, 2014, has to be executed with the formalities of a will.

      <p>
       Upon the death of the settlor of a trust that was revocable at the settlor’s death, the trustee may proceed to distribute the trust property in accordance with the terms of the trust. The trustee is subject to liability for doing so only if:

       A beneficiary of a trust that is determined by a court proceeding to be invalid, in whole or in part, is liable to return to the court any distribution received for proper distribution to the extent that the invalidity applies to the distribution. If the beneficiary refuses to return the distribution after being ordered by the court, the beneficiary shall be liable for all costs incurred for recovery of the distribution.

      If the terms of a trust do not specify the trustee’s, trust advisor’s, or trust protector’s compensation, and if the settlor, if living, or otherwise a majority of the qualified beneficiaries as defined in Section 91-8-103, have not otherwise agreed with the trustee, trust advisor, or trust protector, a trustee, trust advisor, or trust protector is entitled to compensation that is reasonable under the circumstances.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the terms of a trust specify the trustee’s, trust advisor’s, or trust protector’s compensation, the trustee, trust advisor, or trust protector is entitled to be compensated as specified in the trust, but the court may allow more or less compensation if:
     </p>

      Factors for the court to consider in deciding upon a trustee’s, trust advisor’s, or trust protector’s compensation shall include the size of the trust, the nature and number of the assets, the income produced, the time and responsibility required, the expertise required, any management or sale of real property or closely held business interests, any involvement in litigation to protect trust property, and other relevant factors.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subject to the court’s authority as provided in subsection (b), regardless of its form of entity, the fees set forth in the published fee schedule of a trustee, trust advisor, or trust protector that is regulated by the Mississippi Department of Banking and Consumer Finance, the equivalent regulatory agency of another state, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, or the Office of Thrift Supervision shall be presumed to be reasonable, unless otherwise provided by the terms of the trust.

     </p>
     <p>

     </p>
     <p>

     </p>
     <p>
      A transaction not concerning trust property in which the trustee engages in the trustee’s individual capacity involves a conflict between personal and fiduciary interests if the transaction concerns an opportunity properly belonging to the trust.
     </p>
     <p>
      In addition to all other permissible investments and delegatable duties listed in this title, so long as they are fairly priced and in accordance with the interest of the beneficiaries and the interests of the fiduciary’s appointment and otherwise comply with the Mississippi Uniform Prudent Investor Act or Article 12 of this chapter, a fiduciary may purchase, sell, hold or otherwise deal with an affiliate or an interest in an affiliated investment, as well as delegate to an affiliate or other agent associated with the fiduciary and, upon satisfaction of the conditions stated in subsection (g), the fiduciary may receive fiduciary compensation from the account at the same rate as the fiduciary would otherwise be entitled to be compensated. These activities shall occur without any presumption of a conflict between personal and fiduciary interests of the trustee or other fiduciary.
     </p>
     <p>
      As used in this section:
     </p>
     <p>
      “Affiliate” means any corporation or other entity that directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with the fiduciary.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Affiliated investment” means an investment for which the fiduciary or an affiliate of the fiduciary acts as adviser, administrator, distributor, placement agent, underwriter, broker or in any other capacity for which it receives or has received a fee or commission from the investment or an investment acquired or disposed of in a transaction for which the fiduciary or an affiliate of the fiduciary receives or has received a fee or commission. “Affiliated investment” also means an investment in an insurance contract purchased from an insurance agency owned by, or affiliated with, the fiduciary, or any of its affiliates.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Delegate to an affiliate or associated agent” means a proper delegation of any duty of the fiduciary to any person or entity that is affiliated with, or associated with, the fiduciary. The action of doing any of the above shall be known as a “delegation to an affiliate or associated agent.”
     </p>
     <p>
      “Fee or commission” means compensation paid to a fiduciary or an affiliate thereof on account of its services to or on behalf of an investment.
     </p>
     <p>
      For purposes of this section, “fiduciary” means any fiduciary as defined in Section 91-8-103, as well as any other fiduciary.
     </p>
     <p>
      A fiduciary seeking compensation pursuant to subsection (e) shall, as is applicable relative to the fiduciary’s particular appointment, disclose either: to those persons entitled to be kept informed about the administration of a trust under Section 91-8-813(a), subject to the provisions of Sections 91-8-813(d) and 91-8-105(d); to each principal in an agency relationship; or to all current recipients of statements of any other fiduciary account not described above; all fees or commissions paid or to be paid by the account, or received or to be received by an affiliate arising from such affiliated investment or delegation to an affiliate or associated agent. The disclosure required under this subsection (g) may be given either in a copy of the prospectus or any other disclosure document prepared for the affiliated investment under federal or state securities laws or in a written summary that includes all fees or commissions received or to be received by the fiduciary or any affiliate of the fiduciary and an explanation of the manner in which such fees or commissions are calculated, either as a percentage of the assets invested or by some other method. The disclosure shall be made at least annually unless there has been no increase in the rate at which fees or commissions are calculated since the most recent disclosure. Notwithstanding this subsection (g), no such disclosure is required if the governing instrument or a court order expressly authorizes the fiduciary to invest the fiduciary account in affiliated investments or to perform the delegation to an affiliate or associated agent.
     </p>
     <p>
      A fiduciary that has complied with subsection (g), whether by making the applicable disclosure or by relying on the terms of a governing instrument or court order, shall have full authority to administer an affiliated investment, including the authority to vote proxies thereon, without regard to the affiliation between the fiduciary and the investment or the fiduciary and delegatee, as the case may be.
     </p>
     <p>
      In voting shares of stock or in exercising powers of control over similar interests in other forms of enterprise, the trustee shall act in the best interests of the beneficiaries. If the trust is the sole owner of a corporation or other form of enterprise, the trustee shall elect or appoint directors or other managers who will manage the corporation or enterprise in the best interests of the beneficiaries.
     </p>
     <p>
      The following transactions, if fairly priced and in accordance with the interest of the beneficiaries and the purposes of the trust, are not presumed to be affected by a conflict between the trustee’s personal and fiduciary interest if any investment made pursuant to the transaction otherwise complies with the Mississippi Prudent Investor Act:
     </p>
     <p>
      An agreement between a trustee and a beneficiary relating to the appointment or compensation of the trustee, or any of its affiliates;
     </p>
     <p>
      Payment of reasonable compensation to the trustee, or any of its affiliates;
     </p>
     <p>
      A transaction between a trust and another trust, decedent’s estate, guardianship, or conservatorship of which the trustee is a fiduciary or in which a beneficiary has an interest;
     </p>
     <p>
      A deposit of trust money in a regulated financial-service institution operated by the trustee or an affiliate;
     </p>
     <p>
      An advance by the trustee of money for the protection of the trust;
     </p>
     <p>
      An investment by a trustee in securities of an investment company or investment trust to which the trustee, or its affiliates, provides services in a capacity other than as a trustee provided that any investment made pursuant to the transaction otherwise complies with the Mississippi Prudent Investor Act;
     </p>
     <p>
      The court may appoint a special fiduciary to make a decision with respect to any proposed transaction that might violate this section if entered into by the trustee.

       Other than for the three (3) circumstances listed in subsection (b) (2), a court has no jurisdiction to review the trustee’s discretion or to force a distribution; and

       Absent express language in the trust instrument to the contrary, if the distribution language in a discretionary interest permits unequal distributions between beneficiaries or distributions to the exclusion of other beneficiaries, the trustee may distribute all of the accumulated, accrued, or undistributed income and principal to one (1) beneficiary in the trustee’s discretion.

      A discretionary interest is neither a property interest nor an enforceable right; it is a mere expectancy;

      A beneficiary of a mandatory or a support interest has an enforceable right to a distribution pursuant to a court’s review;

      A trustee’s distribution decision may be reviewed for unreasonableness, dishonesty, improper motivation, or failure to act, if under a duty to do so; and
     </p>
     <p>
      In the case of a support interest, nothing in this section shall raise a beneficiary’s support interest to the level of a property interest.

      Unless otherwise provided in subsection (f), and unless the terms of the trust expressly indicate that a rule in this subsection does not apply:
     </p>
     <p>
      A person other than a settlor who is a beneficiary and trustee of a trust that confers on the trustee a power to make discretionary distributions to or for the trustee’s personal benefit may exercise the power only in accordance with an ascertainable standard; and
     </p>
     <p>
      A trustee may not exercise a power to make discretionary distributions to satisfy a legal obligation of support that the trustee personally owes another person.
     </p>
     <p>
      A power that is limited or prohibited by subsection (d) may be exercised by a majority of the remaining trustees whose exercise of the power is not so limited or prohibited. If the power of all trustees is so limited or prohibited, the court may appoint a special fiduciary with authority to exercise the power.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (d) shall not apply to:
     </p>
     <p>
      A power held by the settlor’s spouse who is the trustee of a trust for which a marital deduction, as defined in Section 2056(b) (5) or 2523(e) of the Internal Revenue Code, was previously allowed;
     </p>
     <p>
      Any trust during any period that the trust may be revoked or amended by its settlor; or

    Distribution upon termination.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Upon termination or partial termination of a trust, the trustee may send to the beneficiaries a proposal for distribution. The right of any beneficiary to object to the proposed distribution terminates if the beneficiary does not notify the trustee of an objection within thirty (30) days after the proposal was sent but only if the proposal informed the beneficiary of the right to object and of the time allowed for objection. For the purpose of determining the date a proposed distribution was sent, if exact confirmation is unavailable it can be assumed it was received five (5) days after the date of mailing.
     </p>
     <p>
      Upon the occurrence of an event terminating or partially terminating a trust, the trustee shall proceed expeditiously to distribute the trust property to the persons entitled to it, subject to the right of the trustee to retain a reasonable reserve for the payment of debts, expenses, and taxes.
     </p>
     <p>
      A release by a beneficiary of a trustee from liability for breach of trust is invalid to the extent:

      A trustee may not commence a proceeding against a cotrustee or a former trustee for breach of trust more than one (1) year after the date the trustee or a representative of the trustee was sent a report that adequately disclosed facts indicating the existence of a potential claim for breach of trust.

     </p>
     <p>
      If subsection (d) does not apply, a judicial proceeding by a trustee against a cotrustee or former trustee for breach of trust must be commenced within three (3) years after the first to occur of:

      A report adequately discloses facts indicating the existence of a potential claim for breach of trust if it provides sufficient information so that the trust advisor or trust protector or the respective representative of each knows of the potential claim or has sufficient information to be presumed to know of it, or to be put on notice to inquire into its existence.

      Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c) or unless personal liability is imposed in the contract, a trustee who holds an interest as a general partner in a general or limited partnership is not personally liable on a contract entered into by the partnership after the trust’s acquisition of the interest if the fiduciary capacity was disclosed in the contract or in a statement previously filed pursuant to the Uniform Partnership Act, Title 79, Chapter 13, Mississippi Code of 1972, or the Mississippi Limited Partnership Act, Title 79, Chapter 14, Mississippi Code of 1972.

    Certification of trust.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Instead of furnishing a copy of the trust instrument to any person to evidence the existence and validity of the trust, the trustee may furnish to the person a certification of trust, signed by the trustee or trustees having signature authority as identified in paragraph (6) of this subsection, attested by a notary public, and shall contain the following:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t91c08s91-8-1013ol11">
       An affirmation of the current existence of the trust and the date on which the trust came into existence;
      </li>
      <li id="t91c08s91-8-1013ol12">
       The identity of the settlor or settlors;
      </li>
      <li id="t91c08s91-8-1013ol13">
       The identity and address of the currently acting trustee or trustees and may contain the identity and address of the named successor trustee or trustees or a statement that no successor is named;
      </li>
      <li id="t91c08s91-8-1013ol14">
       The administrative or managerial powers of the trustee in a pending transaction or relevant to the request;
      </li>
      <li id="t91c08s91-8-1013ol15">
       The revocability or irrevocability of the trust and the identity of any person holding a power to revoke the trust;
      </li>
      <li id="t91c08s91-8-1013ol16">
       When there are multiple trustees or multiple successor trustees, the signature authority of the trustees indicating whether all or less than all of the currently acting trustees are required to sign in order to exercise various powers of the trustee;
      </li>
      <li id="t91c08s91-8-1013ol17">
       Where there are successor trustees designated, a statement detailing the conditions for their succession or a statement that a third party may rely on the authority of one or more successors without proof of their succession;
      </li>
      <li id="t91c08s91-8-1013ol18">
       The trust’s Taxpayer Identification Number, whether a social security number or Employer Identification Number, but only if the trust’s identification number is essential to the transaction for which the request for the trust document is made;
      </li>
      <li id="t91c08s91-8-1013ol19">
       The name in which title to trust property may be taken; and
      </li>

       A statement that, to the best of the trustee’s knowledge, the trust has not been revoked, modified, or amended in any manner that would cause the representations contained in the certification of trust to be incorrect.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      The certification of trust shall not be required to contain the dispositive provisions of a trust that set forth the distribution of the trust estate.
     </p>
     <p>
      The trustee offering the certification of trust may provide copies of all or any part of the trust document and amendments, if any. Nothing in this section is intended to require or imply an obligation to provide dispositive provisions of the trust or a copy of the entire trust documents and amendments.
     </p>
     <p>
      A person who acts in reliance upon a certification of trust without knowledge that the representations contained therein are incorrect is not liable to any person for so acting. A person who does not have actual knowledge that the facts contained in the certification of trust are incorrect may assume without inquiry the existence of the facts contained in the certification. Actual knowledge shall not be inferred solely from the fact that a copy of all or part of the trust instrument is held by the person relying on the trust certification. Nothing contained in this section shall limit the rights of the beneficiaries of the trust against the trustee. Any person relying on the certification of trust shall be indemnified from the assets of the trust to the extent of the share of the trust attributable to the beneficiary or beneficiaries bringing any action against the person for any costs, damage, attorney fees, or other expenses incurred in defending any action against the person arising for the transaction to which a certification of trust related.
     </p>
     <p>
      A person’s failure to request a certification of trust does not affect the protections provided that person in this section. No inference that the person has not acted in good faith or that the person was negligent may be drawn from the failure of the person to request a certification of trust. Nothing in this section is intended to create an implication that a person is liable for acting in reliance on a certification of trust under circumstances where the requirements of this section are not satisfied.
     </p>
     <p>
      Nothing in this section shall be construed to require a third party, when presented with a trust certificate, to enter into a contract with a trustee relating to trust assets or obligations, or to preclude a third party from demanding as a precondition to any contract that the trustee provide additional information in order to clarify any ambiguities or inconsistencies in the trust certificate.
     </p>

      This section does not limit the right of a person to obtain a copy of the trust instrument in a judicial proceeding concerning the trust.

     <p>
      For the purposes of this section, “no-contest provision” includes a “no-contest provision,” “in terrorem provision” or “forfeiture provision” of a trust instrument. A “no-contest provision” means a provision that, if given effect, would reduce or eliminate the interest of any beneficiary of the trust who, directly or indirectly, initiates or otherwise pursues:

      With regard to whether the beneficiary sought, received or relied upon legal counsel, a no-contest provision shall be enforceable according to the express terms of the no-contest provision without regard to the beneficiary’s good or bad faith in taking the action that would justify the complete or partial forfeiture of the beneficiary’s interest in the trust under the terms of the no-contest provision unless probable cause exists for the beneficiary taking such action on the grounds of:
     </p>

      Fraud;

      Duress;

     </p>
     <p>
      Lack of testamentary capacity;
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (b) shall not apply to:
     </p>
     <p>
      Any action brought solely to challenge the acts of the trustee or other fiduciary of the trust to the extent that the trustee or other fiduciary has committed a breach of fiduciary duties or breach of trust;
     </p>
     <p>
      Any action brought by the trustee or any other fiduciary serving under the terms of the trust, unless the trustee or other fiduciary is a beneficiary against whom the no-contest provision is otherwise enforceable;
     </p>
     <p>
      Any agreement among the beneficiaries and any other interested persons in settlement of a dispute or resolution of any other matter relating to the trust, including, without limitation, any nonjudicial settlement agreement;
     </p>
     <p>
      Any action to determine whether a proposed or pending motion, petition, or other proceeding constitutes a contest within the meaning of a no-contest provision;
     </p>
     <p>
      Any action brought by a beneficiary or on behalf of any such beneficiary for a construction or interpretation of the terms of the trust; or
     </p>
     <p>
      Any action brought by the Attorney General for a construction or interpretation of a charitable trust or a trust containing a charitable interest if a provision exists in a trust purporting to penalize a charity or charitable interest for contesting the trust if probable cause exists for instituting proceedings.
     </p>
     <p>
      Pursuant to this section, courts shall enforce the settlor’s intent as reflected in a no-contest provision to the greatest extent possible.

       Laws, 1972, ch. 423 § 6, provides as follows:
      </p>
      <p>
       “SECTION 6. Because the requirements of the Federal Tax Reform Act of 1969 require charitable nonprofit foundations, whether trusts or corporations, to change their governing instruments to comply with said federal act or the state to adopt legislation which complies in lieu of each trust or corporation changing its instrument and because failure to comply by the deadline set in said federal act will result in the loss of tax exemption by such trusts and corporations, the immediate effectiveness of this act is necessary to relieve nonprofit corporations and trusts of the concern about changing their governing instruments and retaining the tax exempt status for such Mississippi organizations; therefore, this act shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage.”

     <p>
      The prudent investor rule, a default rule, may be expanded, restricted, eliminated, or otherwise altered by the provisions of a trust. A trustee is not liable to a beneficiary to the extent that the trustee acted in reasonable reliance on the provisions of the trust.

    Delegation of investment and management.

     </h3>
     <p>
      A trustee may delegate investment and management functions that a prudent trustee of comparable skills could properly delegate under the circumstances. The trustee shall exercise reasonable care, skill, and caution in:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t91c09s91-9-617ol11">
       Selecting an agent;
      </li>
      <li id="t91c09s91-9-617ol12">
       Establishing the scope and terms of the delegation, consistent with the purposes and terms of the trust; and
      </li>
      <li id="t91c09s91-9-617ol13">
       Periodically reviewing the agent’s actions in order to monitor the agent’s performance and compliance with the terms of the delegation.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      The investment agent shall comply with the scope and terms of the delegation and shall exercise the delegated function with reasonable care, skill and caution and shall be liable to the trust for failure to do so. An investment agent who represents that he has special investment skills shall exercise those skills.
     </p>
     <p>
      A trustee who complies with the requirements of subsection (a) is not liable to the beneficiaries or to the trust for the decisions or actions of the agent to whom the function was delegated.
     </p>
     <p>
      By accepting the delegation of a trust function from the trustee of a trust that is subject to the law of this state, an agent submits to the jurisdiction of the courts of this state.
     </p>
     <p>
      A cofiduciary may delegate investment and management functions to another cofiduciary if the delegating cofiduciary reasonably believes that the other cofiduciary has greater investment skills than the delegating cofiduciary with respect to those functions. The delegating cofiduciary shall not be responsible for the investment decisions or actions of the other cofiduciary to which the investment functions are delegated if the delegating cofiduciary exercises reasonable care, skill and caution in establishing the scope and specific terms of the delegation and in reviewing periodically the other cofiduciary’s actions in order to monitor the cofiduciary’s performance and compliance with the scope and specific terms of the delegation.
     </p>
     <p>
      Investment in a mutual fund is not a delegation of investment function, and neither the mutual fund nor its advisor is an investment agent.

     <p>
      Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, no action of any kind, including, but not limited to, an action to enforce a judgment entered by a court or other body having adjudicative authority, shall be brought at law or in equity for an attachment or other provisional remedy against property that is the subject of a qualified disposition or for the avoidance of a qualified disposition, unless the action is brought pursuant to the provisions of the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act, Section 15-3-101 et seq., and unless the qualified disposition was also made with actual intent to defraud the creditor.
     </p>
     <p>
      (1) Notwithstanding Section 15-3-115, a creditor’s claim under subsection (a) shall be extinguished:
     </p>
     <p>
      If the person is a creditor when the qualified disposition to a qualified disposition trust is made, unless the action is commenced within the later of two (2) years after the qualified disposition is made or six (6) months after the person discovers or reasonably should have discovered the qualified disposition; or
     </p>
     <p>
      If the person becomes a creditor after the qualified disposition to a qualified disposition trust is made, unless the action is commenced within two (2) years after the qualified disposition is made;

     <p>
      If subsection (b) (1) applies:
     </p>
     <p>
      A person shall be deemed to have discovered the existence of a qualified disposition to a qualified disposition trust at the time any public record is made of any transfer of property relative to the qualified disposition, including, but not limited to, the conveyance of real property that is recorded in the office of the chancery clerk of the county in which the property is located or the filing of a financing statement under Chapter 9, Title 75, Mississippi Code of 1972, or the equivalent recording or filing of either with the appropriate person or official under the laws of a jurisdiction other than this state; and
     </p>
     <p>
      No creditor shall bring an action with respect to property that is the subject of a qualified disposition unless that creditor proves by clear and convincing evidence that the settlor’s transfer of the property was made with the intent to defraud that specific creditor.
     </p>
     <p>
      For purposes of this article, a qualified disposition that is made by means of a disposition by a transferor who is a trustee shall be deemed to have been made as of the time, whether before, on, or after July 1, 2014, the property that is the subject of the qualified disposition was originally transferred to the transferor acting in the capacity of trustee, or any predecessor trustee, in a form that meets the requirements of Section 91-9-703(n)(2) and (3).
     </p>
     <p>
      Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, a creditor, including a creditor whose claim arose before or after a qualified disposition, or any other person shall have only the rights with respect to a qualified disposition as are provided in this section and Section 91-9-711, and neither a creditor nor any other person shall have any claim or cause of action against the trustee, an advisor of a trust that is the subject of a qualified disposition, or against any person involved in the counseling, drafting, preparation, execution, or funding of a trust that is the subject of a qualified disposition. For purposes of this section, counseling, drafting, preparation, execution or funding of a trust that is the subject of a qualified disposition includes the counseling, drafting, preparation, execution and funding of a limited partnership or a limited liability company if interests in the limited partnership or limited liability company are subsequently transferred to the trust that is the subject of a qualified disposition.
     </p>
     <p>
      Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, no action of any kind, including, but not limited to, an action to enforce a judgment entered by a court or other body having adjudicative authority, shall be brought at law or in equity against a trustee or an advisor of a trust that is the subject of a qualified disposition, or against any person involved in the counseling, drafting, preparation, execution or funding of a trust that is the subject of a qualified disposition, if, as of the date the action is brought, an action by a creditor with respect to the qualified disposition would be barred under this section.

      <li id="t91c09s91-9-711ol11C2">
       If the court is satisfied that a beneficiary of a trust has not acted in bad faith, the avoidance of the qualified disposition shall be subject to the right of the beneficiary to retain any distribution made upon the exercise of a trust power or discretion vested in the qualified trustee or qualified trustees, which power or discretion was properly exercised prior to the creditor’s commencement of an action to avoid the qualified disposition. For purposes of this subsection (b)(2), it shall be presumed that the beneficiary, including a beneficiary who is also a transferor of the trust, did not act in bad faith merely by creating the trust or by accepting a distribution made in accordance with the terms of the trust.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      A disposition by a trustee that is not a qualified trustee to a trustee that is a qualified trustee shall not be treated as other than a qualified disposition solely because the trust instrument fails to meet the requirements of Section 91-9-703(n)(1).
     </p>
     <p>
      In the case of a disposition to more than one (1) trustee, a disposition that is otherwise a qualified disposition shall not be treated as other than a qualified disposition solely because not all of the recipient trustees are qualified trustees.

     </h3>
     <p>
      In acquiring, investing, reinvesting, exchanging, retaining, selling, and managing property held in fiduciary capacity, the fiduciary shall exercise the judgment and care under the circumstances then prevailing which men of prudence, discretion, and intelligence exercise in the management of their own affairs, not in regard to speculation, but in regard to the permanent disposition of their funds, considering the probable income as well as the probable safety of their capital.
     </p>
     <p>
      Within the limitations of the foregoing standard, a fiduciary is authorized to acquire and retain every kind of property, real, personal, or mixed, and every kind of investment, specifically including, but not by way of limitation, shares or interests in common trust funds, securities of any open-end or closed-end management type investment company or investment trust registered under the Federal Investment Company Act of 1940, as from time to time amended and, in addition, bonds, preferred stocks, or common stocks listed on a national securities exchange registered with the securities and exchange commission, which men of prudence, discretion, and intelligence acquire or retain for their own account. Within the limitations of the foregoing standard, a fiduciary may retain property properly acquired, without limitation as to time and without regard to its suitability for original purchase.

      In exercising the power to adjust under Section 91-17-104(a) or a discretionary power of administration regarding a matter within the scope of this chapter, whether granted by the terms of a trust, a will, or this chapter, a fiduciary shall administer a trust or estate impartially, based on what is fair and reasonable to all of the beneficiaries, except to the extent that the terms of the trust or the will clearly manifest an intention that the fiduciary shall or may favor one or more of the beneficiaries. A determination in accordance with this chapter is presumed to be fair and reasonable to all of the beneficiaries.

       § 91-17-104.
    Trustee’s power to adjust.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      A trustee may adjust between principal and income to the extent the trustee considers necessary if the trustee invests and manages trust assets as a prudent investor, the terms of the trust describe the amount that may or must be distributed to a beneficiary by referring to the trust’s income, and the trustee determines, after applying the rules in Section 91-17-103(a), that the trustee is unable to comply with Section 91-17-103(b).
     </p>
     <p>
      In deciding whether and to what extent to exercise the power conferred by subsection (a), a trustee shall consider all factors relevant to the trust and its beneficiaries, including the following factors to the extent they are relevant:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t91c17s91-17-104ol11">
       The nature, purpose, and expected duration of the trust;
      </li>
      <li id="t91c17s91-17-104ol12">
       The intent of the settlor;
      </li>
      <li id="t91c17s91-17-104ol13">
       The identity and circumstances of the beneficiaries;
      </li>
      <li id="t91c17s91-17-104ol14">
       The needs for liquidity, regularity of income, and preservation and appreciation of capital;
      </li>
      <li id="t91c17s91-17-104ol15">
       The assets held in the trust; the extent to which they consist of financial assets, interests in closely held enterprises, tangible and intangible personal property, or real property; the extent to which an asset is used by a beneficiary; and whether an asset was purchased by the trustee or received from the settlor;
      </li>
      <li id="t91c17s91-17-104ol16">
       The net amount allocated to income under the other sections of this chapter and the increase or decrease in the value of the principal assets, which the trustee may estimate as to assets for which market values are not readily available;
      </li>
      <li id="t91c17s91-17-104ol17">
       Whether and to what extent the terms of the trust give the trustee the power to invade principal or accumulate income or prohibit the trustee from invading principal or accumulating income, and the extent to which the trustee has exercised a power from time to time to invade principal or accumulate income;
      </li>
      <li id="t91c17s91-17-104ol18">
       The actual and anticipated effect of economic conditions on principal and income and effects of inflation and deflation; and
      </li>
      <li id="t91c17s91-17-104ol19">
       The anticipated tax consequences of an adjustment.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      A trustee may not make an adjustment:
     </p>
     <p>
      That diminishes the income interest in a trust that requires all of the income to be paid at least annually to a spouse and for which an estate tax or gift tax marital deduction would be allowed, in whole or in part, if the trustee did not have the power to make the adjustment;
     </p>
     <p>
      That reduces the actuarial value of the income interest in a trust to which a person transfers property with the intent to qualify for a gift tax exclusion;
     </p>
     <p>
      That changes the amount payable to a beneficiary as a fixed annuity or a fixed fraction of the value of the trust assets;
     </p>
     <p>
      From any amount that is permanently set aside for charitable purposes under a will or the terms of a trust unless both income and principal are so set aside;
     </p>
     <p>
      If possessing or exercising the power to make an adjustment causes an individual to be treated as the owner of all or part of the trust for income tax purposes, and the individual would not be treated as the owner if the trustee did not possess the power to make an adjustment;
     </p>
     <p>
      If possessing or exercising the power to make an adjustment causes all or part of the trust assets to be included for estate tax purposes in the estate of an individual who has the power to remove a trustee or appoint a trustee, or both, and the assets would not be included in the estate of the individual if the trustee did not possess the power to make an adjustment;
     </p>
     <p>
      If the trustee is a beneficiary of the trust; or
     </p>
     <p>
      If the trustee is not a beneficiary, but the adjustment would benefit the trustee directly or indirectly.
     </p>
     <p>
      If subsection (c)(5), (6), (7), or (8) applies to a trustee and there is more than one (1) trustee, a cotrustee to whom the provision does not apply may make the adjustment unless the exercise of the power by the remaining trustee or trustees is not permitted by the terms of the trust.
     </p>
     <p>
      A trustee may release the entire power conferred by subsection (a) or may release only the power to adjust from income to principal or the power to adjust from principal to income if the trustee is uncertain about whether possessing or exercising the power will cause a result described in subsection (c)(1) through (6) or (c)(8) or if the trustee determines that possessing or exercising the power will or may deprive the trust of a tax benefit or impose a tax burden not described in subsection (c). The release may be permanent or for a specified period, including a period measured by the life of an individual.
     </p>
     <p>
      Terms of a trust that limit the power of a trustee to make an adjustment between principal and income do not affect the application of this section unless it is clear from the terms of the trust that the terms are intended to deny the trustee the power of adjustment conferred by subsection (a).
     </p>
     <p>
      (1) For purposes of this section, and subject to subsection (c) of this section, from time to time a trustee may make a safe-harbor adjustment to increase net trust accounting income up to and including an amount equal to six percent (6%) of the trust’s value as defined in subsection (g)(2). If a trustee determines to make this safe-harbor adjustment, the propriety of this adjustment shall be conclusively presumed. Nothing in this subsection (g) prohibits any other type of adjustment authorized under any provision of this section.
     </p>
     <p>
      A trust’s value under subsection (g)(1) shall be calculated as follows:
     </p>
     <p>
      For trusts in existence for three (3) years or more, the value shall be the average fair market value of the trust assets over the past three (3) years;
     </p>
     <p>
      For trusts in existence for at least two (2) years but less than three (3) years, the value shall be the average fair market value of the trust assets over the past two (2) years; and
     </p>
     <p>
      For trusts in existence less than two (2) years, the value shall be the fair market value of the trust assets on December 31 of the preceding year.

       § 91-17-105.
    Judicial control of discretionary power.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The court may not order a fiduciary to change a decision to exercise or not to exercise a discretionary power conferred by this chapter unless it determines that the decision was an abuse of the fiduciary’s discretion. A fiduciary’s decision is not an abuse of discretion merely because the court would have exercised the power in a different manner or would not have exercised the power.
     </p>
     <p>
      The decisions to which subsection (a) applies include:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t91c17s91-17-105ol11">
       A decision under Section 91-17-104(a) as to whether and to what extent an amount should be transferred from principal to income or from income to principal.
      </li>
      <li id="t91c17s91-17-105ol12">
       A decision regarding the factors that are relevant to the trust and its beneficiaries, the extent to which the factors are relevant, and the weight, if any, to be given to those factors, in deciding whether and to what extent to exercise the discretionary power conferred by Section 91-17-104(a).
      </li>
      <li id="t91c17s91-17-105ol13">
       To the extent that the court is unable, after applying paragraphs (1) and (2), to place the beneficiaries, the trust, or both, in the positions they would have occupied if the discretion had not been abused, the court may order the fiduciary to pay an appropriate amount from its own funds to one or more of the beneficiaries or the trust or both.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      If the court determines that a fiduciary has abused the fiduciary’s discretion, the court may place the income and remainder beneficiaries in the positions they would have occupied if the discretion had not been abused, according to the following rules:
     </p>
     <p>
      To the extent that the abuse of discretion has resulted in no distribution to a beneficiary or in a distribution that is too small, the court shall order the fiduciary to distribute from the trust to the beneficiary an amount that the court determines will restore the beneficiary, in whole or in part, to the beneficiary’s appropriate position.
     </p>
     <p>
      To the extent that the abuse of discretion has resulted in a distribution to a beneficiary which is too large, the court shall place the beneficiaries, the trust, or both, in whole or in part, in their appropriate positions by ordering the fiduciary to withhold an amount from one or more future distributions to the beneficiary who received the distribution that was too large or ordering that beneficiary to return some or all of the distribution to the trust.
     </p>
     <p>
      Upon petition by the fiduciary, the court having jurisdiction over a trust or estate shall determine whether a proposed exercise or nonexercise by the fiduciary of a discretionary power conferred by this chapter will result in an abuse of the fiduciary’s discretion. If the petition describes the proposed exercise or nonexercise of the power and contains sufficient information to inform the beneficiaries of the reasons for the proposal, the facts upon which the fiduciary relies, and an explanation of how the income and remainder beneficiaries will be affected by the proposed exercise or nonexercise of the power, a beneficiary who challenges the proposed exercise or nonexercise has the burden of establishing that it will result in an abuse of discretion.

      After a decedent dies, in the case of an estate, or after an income interest in a trust ends, the following rules apply:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t91c17s91-17-201ol11">
       A fiduciary of an estate or of a terminating income interest shall determine the amount of net income and net principal receipts received from property specifically given to a beneficiary under the rules in Articles 3 through 5 which apply to trustees and the rules in paragraph (5). The fiduciary shall distribute the net income and net principal receipts to the beneficiary who is to receive the specific property.
      </li>
      <li id="t91c17s91-17-201ol12">
       A fiduciary shall determine the remaining net income of a decedent’s estate or a terminating income interest under the rules in Articles 3 through 5 which apply to trustees and by:
       <ol type="a">
        <li id="t91c17s91-17-201ol12A">

         Paying from income or principal, in the fiduciary’s discretion, fees of attorneys, accountants, and fiduciaries; court costs and other expenses of administration; and interest on death taxes, but the fiduciary may pay those expenses from income of property passing to a trust for which the fiduciary claims an estate tax marital or charitable deduction only to the extent that the payment of those expenses from income will not cause the reduction or loss of the deduction; and
        </li>
        <li id="t91c17s91-17-201ol12C">
         Paying from principal all other disbursements made or incurred in connection with the settlement of a decedent’s estate or the winding-up of a terminating income interest, including debts, funeral expenses, disposition of remains, family allowances, and death taxes and related penalties that are apportioned to the estate or terminating income interest by the will, the terms of the trust, or applicable law.

       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t91c17s91-17-201ol12C3">
       A fiduciary shall distribute to a beneficiary who receives a pecuniary amount outright the interest or any other amount provided by the will, the terms of the trust, or applicable law from net income determined under paragraph (2) or from principal to the extent that net income is insufficient. If a beneficiary is to receive a pecuniary amount outright and no interest or other amount is provided for by the will or by the terms of the trust, and if the pecuniary amount is not distributed to the beneficiary within one (1) year of the date of death of the testator or the date the income interest ends, then the fiduciary shall distribute to the beneficiary interest on any amount that remains undistributed after the one-year anniversary until the pecuniary amount is distributed in full. The interest rate shall be the IRS midterm applicable federal rate in effect on the date the interest begins to accrue.

       A fiduciary may not reduce principal or income receipts from property described in paragraph (1) because of a payment described in Section 91-17-501 or 91-17-502 to the extent that the will, the terms of the trust, or applicable law requires the fiduciary to make the payment from assets other than the property or to the extent that the fiduciary recovers or expects to recover the payment from a third party. The net income and principal receipts from the property are determined by including all of the amounts the fiduciary receives or pays with respect to the property, whether those amounts accrued or became due before, on, or after the date of a decedent’s death or an income interest’s terminating event, and by making a reasonable provision for amounts that the fiduciary believes the estate or terminating income interest may become obligated to pay after the property is distributed.

       § 91-17-202.
    Distribution to residuary and remainder beneficiaries.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Each beneficiary described in Section 91-17-201(4) is entitled to receive a portion of the net income equal to the beneficiary’s fractional interest in undistributed principal assets, using values as of the distribution date. If a fiduciary makes more than one (1) distribution of assets to beneficiaries to whom this section applies, each beneficiary, including one who does not receive part of the distribution, is entitled, as of each distribution date, to the net income the fiduciary has received after the date of death or terminating event or earlier distribution date but has not distributed as of the current distribution date.
     </p>
     <p>
      In determining a beneficiary’s share of net income, the following rules apply:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t91c17s91-17-202ol11">
       The beneficiary is entitled to receive a portion of the net income equal to the beneficiary’s fractional interest in the undistributed principal assets immediately before the distribution date, including assets that later may be sold to meet principal obligations.
      </li>
      <li id="t91c17s91-17-202ol12">
       The beneficiary’s fractional interest in the undistributed principal assets must be calculated without regard to property specifically given to a beneficiary and property required to pay pecuniary amounts not in trust.
      </li>
      <li id="t91c17s91-17-202ol13">
       The beneficiary’s fractional interest in the undistributed principal assets must be calculated on the basis of the aggregate value of those assets as of the distribution date without reducing the value by any unpaid principal obligation.
      </li>
      <li id="t91c17s91-17-202ol14">
       The distribution date for purposes of this section may be the date as of which the fiduciary calculates the value of the assets if that date is reasonably near the date on which assets are actually distributed.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      If a fiduciary does not distribute all of the collected but undistributed net income to each person as of a distribution date, the fiduciary shall maintain appropriate records showing the interest of each beneficiary in that net income.
     </p>
     <p>
      A fiduciary may apply the rules in this section, to the extent that the fiduciary considers it appropriate, to net gain or loss realized after the date of death or terminating event or earlier distribution date from the disposition of a principal asset if this section applies to the income from the asset.

     </h3>
     <p>
      An income beneficiary is entitled to net income from the date on which the income interest begins. An income interest begins on the date specified in the terms of the trust or, if no date is specified, on the date an asset becomes subject to a trust or successive income interest.
     </p>
     <p>
      An asset becomes subject to a trust:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t91c17s91-17-301ol11">
       On the date it is transferred to the trust in the case of an asset that is transferred to a trust during the transferor’s life;
      </li>
      <li id="t91c17s91-17-301ol12">
       On the date of a testator’s death in the case of an asset that becomes subject to a trust by reason of a will, even if there is an intervening period of administration of the testator’s estate; or
      </li>
      <li id="t91c17s91-17-301ol13">
       On the date of an individual’s death in the case of an asset that is transferred to a fiduciary by a third party because of the individual’s death.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      An asset becomes subject to a successive income interest on the day after the preceding income interest ends, as determined under subsection (d), even if there is an intervening period of administration to wind up the preceding income interest.
     </p>
     <p>
      An income interest ends on the day before an income beneficiary dies or another terminating event occurs, or on the last day of a period during which there is no beneficiary to whom a trustee may distribute income.

    Apportionment of receipts and disbursements when decedent dies or income interest begins.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      A trustee shall allocate an income receipt or disbursement other than one to which Section 91-17-201(1) applies to principal if its due date occurs before a decedent dies in the case of an estate or before an income interest begins in the case of a trust or successive income interest.
     </p>
     <p>
      A trustee shall allocate an income receipt or disbursement to income if its due date occurs on or after the date on which a decedent dies or an income interest begins and it is a periodic due date. An income receipt or disbursement must be treated as accruing from day to day if its due date is not periodic or it has no due date. The portion of the receipt or disbursement accruing before the date on which a decedent dies or an income interest begins must be allocated to principal and the balance must be allocated to income.
     </p>
     <p>
      An item of income or an obligation is due on the date the payer is required to make a payment. If a payment date is not stated, there is no due date for the purposes of this chapter. Distributions to shareholders or other owners from an entity to which Section 91-17-401 applies are deemed to be due on the date fixed by the entity for determining who is entitled to receive the distribution or, if no date is fixed, on the declaration date for the distribution. A due date is periodic for receipts or disbursements that must be paid at regular intervals under a lease or an obligation to pay interest or if an entity customarily makes distributions at regular intervals.

    Apportionment when income interest ends.

     </h3>
     <p>
      In this section, “undistributed income” means net income received before the date on which an income interest ends. The term does not include an item of income or expense that is due or accrued or net income that has been added or is required to be added to principal under the terms of the trust.
     </p>
     <p>
      When a mandatory income interest ends, the trustee shall pay to a mandatory income beneficiary who survives that date, or the estate of a deceased mandatory income beneficiary whose death causes the interest to end, the beneficiary’s share of the undistributed income that is not disposed of under the terms of the trust unless the beneficiary has an unqualified power to revoke more than five percent (5%) of the trust immediately before the income interest ends. In the latter case, the undistributed income from the portion of the trust that may be revoked must be added to principal.
     </p>
     <p>
      When a trustee’s obligation to pay a fixed annuity or a fixed fraction of the value of the trust’s assets ends, the trustee shall prorate the final payment if and to the extent required by applicable law to accomplish a purpose of the trust or its settlor relating to income, gift, estate, or other tax requirements.

     <p>
      Money is not received in partial liquidation, nor may it be taken into account under subsection (d)(2), to the extent that it does not exceed the amount of income tax that a trustee or beneficiary must pay on taxable income of the entity that distributes the money.

    Business and other activities conducted by trustee.

     </h3>
     <p>
      If a trustee who conducts a business or other activity determines that it is in the best interest of all the beneficiaries to account separately for the business or activity instead of accounting for it as part of the trust’s general accounting records, the trustee may maintain separate accounting records for its transactions, whether or not its assets are segregated from other trust assets.
     </p>
     <p>
      A trustee who accounts separately for a business or other activity may determine the extent to which its net cash receipts must be retained for working capital, the acquisition or replacement of fixed assets, and other reasonably foreseeable needs of the business or activity, and the extent to which the remaining net cash receipts are accounted for as principal or income in the trust’s general accounting records. If a trustee sells assets of the business or other activity, other than in the ordinary course of the business or activity, the trustee shall account for the net amount received as principal in the trust’s general accounting records to the extent the trustee determines that the amount received is no longer required in the conduct of the business.
     </p>
     <p>
      Activities for which a trustee may maintain separate accounting records include:

     <p>
      An amount received as interest, whether determined at a fixed, variable, or floating rate, on an obligation to pay money to the trustee, including an amount received as consideration for prepaying principal, must be allocated to income without any provision for amortization of premium.
     </p>
     <p>
      A trustee shall allocate to principal an amount received from the sale, redemption, or other disposition of an obligation to pay money to the trustee more than one (1) year after it is purchased or acquired by the trustee, including an obligation whose purchase price or value when it is acquired is less than its value at maturity. If the obligation matures within one (1) year after it is purchased or acquired by the trustee, an amount received in excess of its purchase price or its value when acquired by the trust must be allocated to income.

    Insubstantial allocations not required.

     <p>
      If a trustee determines that an allocation between principal and income required by Section 91-17-409, 91-17-410, 91-17-411, 91-17-412, or 91-17-415 is insubstantial, the trustee may allocate the entire amount to principal unless one (1) of the circumstances described in Section 91-17-104(c) applies to the allocation. This power may be exercised by a cotrustee in the circumstances described in Section 91-17-104(d) and may be released for the reasons and in the manner described in Section 91-17-104(e). An allocation is presumed to be insubstantial if:

      <li id="t91c17s91-17-408ol11">

     </p>

      <li id="t91c17s91-17-409ol11">
       “Payment” means a payment that a trustee may receive over a fixed number of years or during the life of one or more individuals because of services rendered or property transferred to the payer in exchange for future payments. The term includes a payment made in money or property from the payer’s general assets or from a separate fund created by the payer. For purposes of subsections (d), (e), (f), and (g), the term also includes any payment from any separate fund, regardless of the reason for the payment.
      </li>
      <li id="t91c17s91-17-409ol12">
       “Separate fund” includes a private or commercial annuity, an individual retirement account, and a pension, profit-sharing, stock-bonus, or stock-ownership plan.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      To the extent that a payment is characterized as interest, or a dividend, or a payment made in lieu of interest or a dividend, a trustee shall allocate the payment to income. The trustee shall allocate to principal the balance of the payment and any other payment received in the same accounting period that is not characterized as interest, a dividend, or an equivalent payment.
     </p>
     <p>
      If no part of a payment is characterized as interest, a dividend, or an equivalent payment, and all or part of the payment is required to be made, a trustee shall allocate to income ten percent (10%) of the part that is required to be made during the accounting period and the balance to principal. If no part of a payment is required to be made or the payment received is the entire amount to which the trustee is entitled, the trustee shall allocate the entire payment to principal. For purposes of this subsection, a payment is not “required to be made” to the extent that it is made because the trustee exercises a right of withdrawal.
     </p>
     <p>
      Except as otherwise provided in subsection (e), subsections (f) and (g) apply, and subsections (b) and (c) do not apply, in determining the allocation of a payment made from a separate fund to:
     </p>
     <p>
      A trust to which an election to qualify for a marital deduction under Section 2056(b)(7) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, has been made; or
     </p>
     <p>
      A trust that qualifies for the marital deduction under Section 2056(b)(5) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsections (d), (f), and (g) do not apply if and to the extent that the series of payments would, without the application of subsection (d), qualify for the marital deduction under Section 2056(b)(7)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
     </p>
     <p>
      A trustee shall determine the internal income of each separate fund for the accounting period as if the separate fund were a trust subject to this chapter. Upon request of the surviving spouse, the trustee shall demand that the person administering the separate fund distribute the internal income to the trust. The trustee shall allocate a payment from the separate fund to income to the extent of the internal income of the separate fund and distribute that amount to the surviving spouse. The trustee shall allocate the balance of the payment to principal. Upon request of the surviving spouse, the trustee shall allocate principal to income to the extent the internal income of the separate fund exceeds payments made from the separate fund to the trust during the accounting period.
     </p>
     <p>
      If a trustee cannot determine the internal income of a separate fund but can determine the value of the separate fund, the internal income of the separate fund is deemed to equal four percent (4%) of the fund’s value, according to the most recent statement of value preceding the beginning of the accounting period. If the trustee can determine neither the internal income of the separate fund nor the fund’s value, the internal income of the fund is deemed to equal the product of the interest rate and the present value of the expected future payments, as determined under Section 7520 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, for the month preceding the accounting period for which the computation is made.
     </p>
     <p>
      This section does not apply to a payment to which Section 91-17-410 applies.

      In this section, “liquidating asset” means an asset whose value will diminish or terminate because the asset is expected to produce receipts for a period of limited duration. The term includes a leasehold, patent, copyright, royalty right, and right to receive payments during a period of more than one (1) year under an arrangement that does not provide for the payment of interest on the unpaid balance. The term does not include a payment subject to Section 91-17-409, resources subject to Section 91-17-411, timber subject to Section 91-17-412, an activity subject to Section 91-17-414, an asset subject to Section 91-17-415, or any asset for which the trustee establishes a reserve for depreciation under Section 91-17-503.
     </p>
     <p>
      A trustee shall allocate to income ten percent (10%) of the receipts from a liquidating asset and the balance to principal.

       If received from a production payment, a receipt must be allocated to income if and to the extent that the agreement creating the production payment provides a factor for interest or its equivalent. The balance must be allocated to principal.

     </ol>
     <p>
      An amount received on account of an interest in water that is renewable must be allocated to income. If the water is not renewable, ninety percent (90%) of the amount must be allocated to principal and the balance to income.

     <p>
      This chapter applies whether or not a decedent or donor was extracting minerals, water, or other natural resources before the interest became subject to the trust.

     <p>
      If a trust owns an interest in minerals, water, or other natural resources on January 1, 2013, the trustee may allocate receipts from the interest as provided in this chapter or in the manner used by the trustee before January 1, 2013. If the trust acquires an interest in minerals, water, or other natural resources after January 1, 2013, the trustee shall allocate receipts from the interest as provided in this chapter.

      If a marital deduction is allowed for all or part of a trust whose assets consist substantially of property that does not provide the spouse with sufficient income from or use of the trust assets, and if the amounts that the trustee transfers from principal to income under Section 91-17-104 and distributes to the spouse from principal pursuant to the terms of the trust are insufficient to provide the spouse with the beneficial enjoyment required to obtain the marital deduction, the spouse may require the trustee to make property productive of income, convert property within a reasonable time, or exercise the power conferred by Section 91-17-104(a). The trustee may decide which action or combination of actions to take.

     <p>
      In this section, “derivative” means a contract or financial instrument or a combination of contracts and financial instruments which gives a trust the right or obligation to participate in some or all changes in the price of a tangible or intangible asset or group of assets, or changes in a rate, an index of prices or rates, or other market indicator for an asset or a group of assets.
     </p>
     <p>
      To the extent that a trustee does not account under Section 91-17-403 for transactions in derivatives, the trustee shall allocate to principal receipts from and disbursements made in connection with those transactions.
     </p>
     <p>
      If a trustee grants an option to buy property from the trust, whether or not the trust owns the property when the option is granted, grants an option that permits another person to sell property to the trust, or acquires an option to buy property for the trust or an option to sell an asset owned by the trust, and the trustee or other owner of the asset is required to deliver the asset if the option is exercised, an amount received for granting the option must be allocated to principal. An amount paid to acquire the option must be paid from principal. A gain or loss realized upon the exercise of an option, including an option granted to a settlor of the trust for services rendered, must be allocated to principal.

    Asset-backed securities.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      In this section, “asset-backed security” means an asset whose value is based upon the right it gives the owner to receive distributions from the proceeds of financial assets that provide collateral for the security. The term includes an asset that gives the owner the right to receive from the collateral financial assets only the interest or other current return or only the proceeds other than interest or current return. The term does not include an asset to which Section 91-17-401 or 91-17-409 applies.
     </p>
     <p>
      If a trust receives a payment from interest or other current return and from other proceeds of the collateral financial assets, the trustee shall allocate to income the portion of the payment which the payer identifies as being from interest or other current return and shall allocate the balance of the payment to principal.
     </p>
     <p>
      If a trust receives one or more payments in exchange for the trust’s entire interest in an asset-backed security in one (1) accounting period, the trustee shall allocate the payments to principal. If a payment is one of a series of payments that will result in the liquidation of the trust’s interest in the security over more than one (1) accounting period, the trustee shall allocate ten percent (10%) of the payment to income and the balance to principal.

    Transfers from income to reimburse principal.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      If a trustee makes or expects to make a principal disbursement described in this section, the trustee may transfer an appropriate amount from income to principal in one or more accounting periods to reimburse principal or to provide a reserve for future principal disbursements.
     </p>
     <p>
      Principal disbursements to which subsection (a) applies include the following, but only to the extent that the trustee has not been and does not expect to be reimbursed by a third party:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t91c17s91-17-504ol11">
       An amount chargeable to income but paid from principal because it is unusually large, including extraordinary repairs;
      </li>
      <li id="t91c17s91-17-504ol12">
       A capital improvement to a principal asset, whether in the form of changes to an existing asset or the construction of a new asset, including special assessments;
      </li>
      <li id="t91c17s91-17-504ol13">
       Disbursements made to prepare property for rental, including tenant allowances, leasehold improvements, and broker’s commissions;
      </li>
      <li id="t91c17s91-17-504ol14">
       Periodic payments on an obligation secured by a principal asset to the extent that the amount transferred from income to principal for depreciation is less than the periodic payments; and
      </li>
      <li id="t91c17s91-17-504ol15">
       Disbursements described in Section 91-17-502(a)(7).
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      If the asset whose ownership gives rise to the disbursements becomes subject to a successive income interest after an income interest ends, a trustee may continue to transfer amounts from income to principal as provided in subsection (a).

     <p>
      A tax required to be paid by a trustee based on receipts allocated to principal must be paid from principal, even if the tax is called an income tax by the taxing authority.
     </p>
     <p>
      A tax required to be paid by a trustee on the trust’s share of an entity’s taxable income must be paid:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t91c17s91-17-505ol11">
       From income to the extent that receipts from the entity are allocated only to income;

       From principal to the extent that the tax exceeds the total receipts from the entity.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      After applying subsections (a) through (c), the trustee shall adjust income or principal receipts to the extent that the trust’s taxes are reduced because the trust receives a deduction for payments made to a beneficiary.

       Laws, 1994, ch. 416, § 26, provides as follows:
      </p>
      <p>
       “SECTION 26.
   Sections 91-19-1,
   91-19-3,
   91-19-5,
   91-19-7,
   91-19-9,
   91-19-11,
   91-19-13,
   91-19-15,
   91-19-17 and
   91-19-19, Mississippi Code of 1972, entitled the ‘Mississippi Uniform Gifts to Minors Law,’ which regulate the manner of making certain gifts to minors, are repealed. To the extent that this act, by virtue of Section 23(2), does not apply to transfers made in a manner prescribed in the Mississippi Uniform Gifts to Minors Law or to the powers, duties and immunities conferred by transfers in that manner upon custodians and persons dealing with custodians, the repeal of Sections 91-19-1 through 91-19-19 does not affect those transfers or those powers, duties and immunities.”

   Cross-defendant refinancing bank was not entitled to equitable subrogation to step into the original lender’s shoes for priority over four cross-defendant judgment creditors because the property was in the debtor/borrower’s infant daughter’s name until the day of closing and if the bank had inquired of liens under the debtor’s name, the judgment creditors’ liens would have been found; the fact that the property was titled in the minor daughter’s name under the Mississippi Uniform Transfers to Minors Act would have been a “red flag” because a transfer of real property made under Miss.

       A person nominated under Section 91-20-7 or designated under Section 91-20-19 as custodian may decline to serve by delivering a valid disclaimer to the person who made the nomination or to the transferor or the transferor’s legal representative. If the event giving rise to a transfer has not occurred and no substitute custodian able, willing and eligible to serve was nominated under Section 91-20-7, the person who made the nomination may nominate a substitute custodian under Section 91-20-7; otherwise the transferor or the transferor’s legal representative shall designate a substitute custodian at the time of the transfer, in either case from among the persons eligible to serve as custodian for that kind of property under Section 91-20-19(1).

       A custodian at any time may designate a trust company or an adult other than a transferor under Section 91-20-9 as successor custodian by executing and dating an instrument of designation before a subscribing witness other than the successor.

If the minor has not attained the age of fourteen (14) years or fails to act within sixty (60) days after the ineligibility, death or incapacity, the conservator of the minor becomes successor custodian. If the minor has no conservator or the conservator declines to act, the transferor, the legal representative of the transferor or of the custodian, an adult member of the minor’s family, or any other interested person may petition the court to designate a successor custodian.

      This chapter applies to a transfer within the scope of Section 91-20-5 made after its effective date if:
     </p>
     <p>
      The transfer purports to have been made under the Mississippi Uniform Gifts to Minors Law, Sections 91-19-1 through 91-19-19; or

      The instrument by which the transfer purports to have been made uses in substance the designation “as custodian under the Uniform Gifts to Minors Act” or “as custodian under the Uniform Transfers to Minors Act” of any other state, and the application of this chapter is necessary to validate the transfer.

      Only individuals whose registration of a security shows sole ownership by one (1) individual or multiple ownership by two (2) or more with right of survivorship, rather than as tenants in common, may obtain registration in beneficiary form. Multiple owners of a security registered in beneficiary form, hold as joint tenants with right of survivorship, as tenants by the entireties, or as owners of community property held in survivorship form, and not as tenants in common.

     <p>
      A security may be registered in beneficiary form if the form is authorized by this or a similar statute of the state of organization of the issuer or registering entity, the location of the registering entity’s principal office, the office of its transfer agent or its office making the registration, or by this or a similar statute of the law of the state listed as the owner’s address at the time of registration. A registration governed by the law of a jurisdiction in which this or similar legislation is not in force or was not in force when a registration in beneficiary form was made is nevertheless presumed to be valid and authorized as a matter of contract law.

      The designation of a TOD beneficiary on a registration in beneficiary form has no effect on ownership until the owner’s death.

    Ownership on death of owner.

     </h3>
     <p>
      On death of a sole owner or the last to die of all multiple owners, ownership of securities registered in beneficiary form passes to the beneficiary or beneficiaries who survive all owners. On proof of death of all owners and compliance with any applicable requirements of the registering entity, a security registered in beneficiary form may be reregistered in the name of the beneficiary or beneficiaries who survived the death of all owners. Until division of the security after the death of all owners, multiple beneficiaries surviving the death of all owners hold their interests as tenants in common. If no beneficiary survives the death of all owners, the security belongs to the estate of the deceased sole owner or the estate of the last to die of all multiple owners.

       A registering entity is not required to offer or to accept a request for security registration in beneficiary form.

       A registering entity is discharged from all claims to a security by the estate, creditors, heirs or devisee of a deceased owner if it registers a transfer of the security in accordance with Section 91-21-15 and does so in good faith reliance (a) on the registration, (b) on this chapter, and (c) on information provided to it by affidavit of the personal representative of the deceased owner, or by the surviving beneficiary or by the surviving beneficiary’s representatives, or other information available to the registering entity. The protections of this chapter do not extend to a reregistration or payment made after a registering entity has received written notice from any claimant to any interest in the security objecting to implementation of a registration in beneficiary form. No other notice or other information available to the registering entity affects its right to protection under this chapter.

       A registering entity offering to accept registrations in beneficiary form may establish the terms and conditions under which it will receive requests (a) for registrations in beneficiary form, and (b) for implementation of registrations in beneficiary form, including requests for cancellation of previously registered TOD beneficiary designations and requests for reregistration to effect a change of beneficiary. The terms and conditions so established may provide for proving death, avoiding or resolving any problems concerning fractional shares, designating primary and contingent beneficiaries, and substituting a named beneficiary’s descendants to take in the place of the named beneficiary in the event of the beneficiary’s death. Substitution may be indicated by appending to the name of the primary beneficiary the letters LDPS, standing for “lineal descendants per stirpes.” This designation substitutes a deceased beneficiary’s descendants who survive the owner for a beneficiary who fails to so survive, the descendants to be identified and to share in accordance with the law of the beneficiary’s domicile at the owner’s death governing inheritance by descendants of an intestate. Other forms of identifying beneficiaries who are to take on one or more contingencies, and rules for providing proofs and assurances needed to satisfy reasonable concerns by registering entities regarding conditions and identities relevant to accurate implementation of registration beneficiary form, may be contained in a registering entity’s terms and conditions.
