     </h3>
     <p>
      It is hereby declared that the purpose of this chapter is to further the public interest and aeronautical progress by providing for the protection, promotion and development of aeronautics; by cooperating in effecting a uniformity of the laws relating to the development of aeronautics in the several states; by revising existing statutes relative to the development and regulation of aeronautics so as to grant to a state agency such powers and impose upon it such duties that the state may properly perform its functions relative to aeronautics and effectively exercise its jurisdiction over persons and property within the state, that the state may assist in the promotion of a statewide system of airports, and that the state may cooperate with and assist the political subdivisions of this state in order that those engaged in aeronautics of every character may so engage with the least possible restriction consistent with the safety and the rights of other persons; and by providing for cooperation with the federal authorities in the development of a national system of civil aviation and for the coordination of the aeronautical activities of those authorities and the authorities of this state by assisting in accomplishing the purposes of federal legislation and eliminating costly and unnecessary duplication of functions properly in the province of the federal agencies.

      <p>
       Where the use of the air space above the plaintiffs’ land by aircraft approaching and taking off from a municipal airport amounted to a taking for which the plaintiffs were entitled to compensation, they were not limited to recovery against the United States on the theory that federal legislation had placed navigable air spaces in the public domain and had preempted the field. Jackson Municipal Airport Authority v. Wright, 232 So. 2d 709, 1970 Miss. LEXIS 1637 (Miss. 1970).

        3. Compensation for taking of property.
       </b>
      </h4>

       Although a municipal airport had informally, without resorting to eminent domain or other legal process, acquired an overflight easement in the air space above the plaintiffs’ land there had been an actual taking for public use of private property for which the owners were entitled to compensation, where low overflights of great numbers of aircraft habitually and constantly invaded the air space and substantially impaired the plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of their property, the owners were entitled to compensation.

       In an action to recover for personal injuries sustained by the plaintiff when he was struck by an airplane used to spray cotton on a farm, owners of the airplane were liable, where they reserved the right to direct when and how the work of spraying cotton was to be carried on, and where there was no lease of any kind of airplane to pilot and where the bailment was at the will of the owners.

       Trial court properly granted a limited liability company (LLC) summary judgment in wrongful death beneficiaries’ action because the LLC could act only through a pilot since he was its sole member, and the beneficiaries were barred from recovering for the pilot’s negligence; if the pilot had survived the crash, he would have been unable to recover from the LLC for his own negligence, and the beneficiaries stood in the pilot’s shoes and also could not recover for his negligence.

       Site approvals.— Except as provided in this section, the commission is authorized to provide for the approval of airport sites and the issuance of certificates of such approvals. No charge shall be made for any such approval, and certificates of such an approval shall be issued without charge to all persons requesting them. Upon the promulgation of a rule or regulation providing for such approvals, any municipality or person desiring or planning to construct or establish an airport may, prior to the acquisition of the site or prior to the construction or establishment of the proposed airport, make application to the commission for approval of this site. The commission shall, with reasonable dispatch, grant approval of a site if it is satisfied: (a) that the site is adequate for the proposed airport; (b) that such proposed airport, if constructed or established, will conform to minimum standards of safety; and (c) that safe air traffic patterns could be worked out for such proposed airport and for all existing airports and approved airport sites in its vicinity. An approval of a site may be granted subject to any reasonable conditions which the commission may deem necessary to effectuate the purposes of this section, and shall remain in effect, unless sooner revoked by the commission, until a license for an airport located on the approved site has been issued pursuant to this section. The commission may, after notice and opportunity for hearing to holders of certificates of an approval, revoke such approval when it shall reasonably determine (1) that there has been an abandonment of the site as an airport site, or (2) that there has been a failure within the time prescribed, or if no time was prescribed, within a reasonable time, to develop the site as an airport or to comply with the conditions of the approval, or (3) that because of change of physical or legal conditions or circumstances the site is no longer usable for the aeronautical purposes for which the approval was granted. No approval shall be required for the site of any existing airport.
      </li>
      <li id="t61c01s61-1-31ol12">
       Optional public hearings.— In connection with the grant of approval of a proposed airport site or the issuance of an airport license under the provisions of this section, the commission may, on its own motion or upon the request of an affected or interested person, hold a hearing open to the public as provided in this section.
      </li>

       Exemptions.— The provisions of this section shall not apply to airports owned or operated by the United States or its agencies. The commission may, from time to time, to the extent necessary, exempt any other class of airports, pursuant to a reasonable classification or grouping, from any rule or regulation promulgated under this section or from any requirement of such a rule or regulation, if it finds that the application of such rule, regulation or requirement would be an undue burden on such class and is not required in the interest of public safety.

Violation of the duly imposed prohibition of the court may be treated as a separate offense under this section or as a contempt of court. Upon a plea of guilty or conviction hereunder in any case involving a registrant, under the provisions of this chapter, the court shall cause a notation of such plea or conviction and of the sentence imposed to be marked upon the pilot certificate or other evidence of pilot registration or receipt provided by the commission under the provisions of this chapter and the court shall cause a copy of its order or sentence to be forwarded to the commission, the cost of furnishing same to be added as a part of cost in such cause. In no event shall this paragraph be construed as warrant for the court or any other agency or person to take away, impound, hold or mark any federal airman or aircraft certificate, permit, rating or license, or to take away, impound or hold any state registration certificate or other evidence of such registration.

    Issuance of bonds; attorneys’ services.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      An authority shall have the power to borrow money for any of its corporate purposes and issue its bonds therefor, including refunding bonds, which bonds may be payable out of any revenues of the authority, including grants or contributions from the federal government or other sources. Any bonds of an authority issued pursuant to this chapter which are payable, as to principal and interest, solely from revenues of an airport or air navigation facility (and they shall so state on their face) shall not constitute a debt of any municipality, the state, or any political subdivision thereof other than the authority, and shall not constitute an indebtedness within the meaning of any constitutional or statutory debt limitation or restriction. Neither the commissioners of an authority nor any person executing such bonds shall be liable personally thereon by reason of the issuance thereof, provided the issuance is in compliance with this chapter.
     </p>
     <p>
      An authority proposing to issue bonds or notes as defined in this chapter of any kind, nature, or description shall have, prior to authorization, issuance, and subsequent validation thereof, secured the legal services of a competent practicing attorney or firm of attorneys. In no instance shall the attorney’s fees paid for the issuance or refunding of such bonds exceed the following amounts, to wit:
     </p>
     <p>
      On all such bond issues the attorney’s fees shall not exceed one percent (1%) of the first five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000.00); one-half percent (1/2%) of all over five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000.00) and not more than one million dollars ($1,000,000.00); and one-fourth percent (1/4%) of all amounts in excess of one million dollars ($1,000,000.00).

In case the bidder to whom the award is made shall fail to comply with the award, his certified or cashier’s check in the amount of two percent (2%) shall be forfeited to the authority.

     <p>
      All bonds shall bear interest at such rate or rates not to exceed that allowed in Section 75-17-103. No bond shall bear more than one (1) rate of interest. Each bond shall bear interest from its date to its stated maturity date at the interest rate specified in the bid or as agreed to by the authority. All bonds of the same maturity shall bear the same rate of interest. All interest accruing on such bonds so issued shall be payable semiannually or annually, except that the first interest coupon attached to any such bond may be for any period not exceeding one (1) year.
     </p>
     <p>
      No interest payment shall be evidenced by more than one (1) coupon and neither cancelled nor supplemental coupons shall be permitted. The lowest interest rate specified for any bonds issued shall not be less than two-thirds (2/3) of the highest interest rate specified for the same bond issue. The interest rate of any one (1) interest coupon shall not exceed the maximum interest rate allowed on such bonds.
     </p>
     <p>
      Each interest rate specified in any bid must be in multiples of one-eighth of one percent (1/8 of 1%) or in multiples of one-tenth of one percent (1/10 of 1%), and a zero rate of interest cannot be named.
     </p>
     <p>
      All bonds shall be lithographed, engraved or typewritten, shall be in denominations of not less than Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000.00), shall be registered by the authority, and shall be consecutively numbered in a regular series from one (1) upward. Each such bond shall specify on its face the purpose for which it was issued and the total amount authorized to be issued. The interest to accrue on each bond shall be evidenced by proper coupons to be attached thereto, unless the bonds are fully registered no-coupon bonds.

    Securing of bond by trust agreement.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      In the discretion of the authority, all bonds may be further secured by a trust agreement between the authority and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having powers of a trust company within or without the state. Any such trust agreement or any resolution providing for the issuance of such bonds may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as are reasonable and proper and not in violation of law.
     </p>
     <p>
      The trust agreement may contain provisions for the issuance of additional bonds under the procedures established by this chapter for any of the purposes authorized by this chapter which shall be secured by the revenues pledged thereunder for such bonds to the extent provided therein.
     </p>
     <p>
      The trust agreement may include provisions to the effect that, if there is any default in the payment of principal or interest on any of said bonds, any court of competent jurisdiction may appoint a receiver to administer the properties and facilities of the authority described in the trust agreement on behalf of the authority, including authority to sell or make contracts for the sale of any services, facilities or commodities of the authority or to renew such contracts, subject to the approval of the court appointing the said receiver, and with power to provide for the payment of such bonds outstanding, or the payment of operating expenses, and to apply the income and revenues to the payment of the said bonds and interest thereon in accordance with the resolution of the authority authorizing the issuance of such bonds and the said trust agreement. The fee for the services of any corporate trustee shall not exceed the normal charges for acting as paying agent, plus any additional amount or amounts allowed by the court as the reasonable value of services rendered by the corporate trustee.
     </p>
     <p>
      The powers herein granted may be exercised whether or not a trust agreement is entered into and, if no trust agreement is entered into, such provisions as are above authorized may be set out in the resolution authorizing the bonds.

     <p>
      All revenues pledged to the payment of bonds shall be subject to a lien in favor of the holders of such bonds, and all such revenues received by the authority shall be immediately subject to such lien without any physical delivery thereof or further act by the authority. The lien shall be effective as against all parties asserting claims against the authority, whether by way of tort, contract or otherwise, whether or not such parties may have had notice of such lien. The pledge or trust agreement creating the same need not be filed or recorded except in the official minutes of the authority. The revenues may also be pledged as security for the payment of obligations due providers of credit enhancement with respect to any bonds issued.
     </p>
     <p>
      The state does hereby covenant with the holders of any such bonds that it will not, while any such bonds shall be outstanding, limit or diminish the right and power of the authority to establish, maintain and collect rates, fees, rentals and other charges pledged to the payment of such bonds, or to fulfill any covenants with respect to rates, fees, rentals and other charges made by the authority with such bondholders.

       § 61-3-53.
    Refunding bonds.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Any authority, authorized by a statute other than this chapter to refund its outstanding bonds and permitted to do so by the terms of any resolutions and trust agreements pertaining to such bonds, may refund all, or any part of, one or more bond issues. However, the refunding bonds shall be issued in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.
     </p>
     <p>
      In no case shall any bonds be refunded whereby:
     </p>
     <p>
      The interest cost to the authority computed on the basis of the interest rates borne by the bonds refunded and by the refunding bonds, will be increased by reason of the refunding; or
     </p>
     <p>
      The average maturity of the bonds refunded, computed to their stated maturities will be increased by reason of the refunding; or
     </p>
     <p>
      The time at which bonds may be redeemed is more than twelve (12) months after the date of sale of the refunding bonds;
     </p>
     <p>
      However, if it can be clearly shown that the refunding is being accomplished to prevent default or to provide flexibility to the authority in the financing of its projects, and if the State Treasurer shall certify that the need to refund an outstanding issue to prevent default or to provide flexibility to the authority in the financing of its projects has been determined by sufficient evidence filed with the State Treasurer, the provisions of subsections (a), (b) and (c) shall not prevent refunding.
     </p>
     <p>
      It shall not be necessary for the bonds refunded to be surrendered and cancelled simultaneously with the delivery of the refunding bonds, but the proceeds of the sale of the refunding bonds, not used to pay for surrendered and cancelled bonds at the time of refunding, shall be deposited in a trust fund under conditions satisfactory to the authority and the State Treasurer.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the refunding bonds are being issued to prevent default, the authority may exchange them with bondholders under such rules and regulations as established by the State Treasurer.

       In addition to the power to borrow money pursuant to Sections 61-3-27 through 61-3-61, Mississippi Code of 1972, an airport authority may, in anticipation of the receipt of income, revenues, grants or subsidies from any source, including, but not limited to, the federal government or any federal agency, the state or any state agency, any municipality or taxing authority, or the proceeds of bonds authorized by Sections 61-3-27 through 61-3-61, Mississippi Code of 1972, borrow money to be payable over a period of time not to exceed ten (10) years, in an amount or amounts not to exceed in the aggregate Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000.00) for the purposes and under the terms and conditions set out in subsections (2), (3), (4) and (5) of this section.

      <p>
       Miss. Code Section 61-3-79 authorizes municipality which has created airport authority to lend or donate money to airport authority; therefore, city may, in its discretion, provide health insurance for employees of airport authority who in turn reimburse city for their premiums, provided insurer consents to inclusion of such nonmunicipal employees within its policy coverage. Primeaux, Apr. 7, 1993. A.G. Op. #93-0201.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (d) authorizes a municipality to lease property to an airport authority for use as airport property, but does not authorize a municipality to lease a street leading to the airport to the airport authority for purposes of maintenance or landscaping of the street by the airport authority. Faneca, Sept. 7, 2001, A.G. Op. #01-0459.
      </p>
      <p>
       The mere act of conveyance of a parcel of municipal property to an airport authority does not, without further action, operate to close public streets on the property streets, or to convey the municipality’s interest in those streets. If the facts do not support the presumption of abandonment, the mayor and city council must, pursuant to Section 21-37-7, enter an order closing the streets, or the portions that run through the property in question. Kohnke,
   Aug. 11, 2005,
   A.G. Op. 05-0383.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Every municipality is authorized, out of any appropriations or other moneys made available for such purposes, to plan, establish, develop, construct, enlarge, improve, maintain, equip, operate, regulate, protect and police airports and air navigation facilities, either within or without the territorial limits of such municipality including the construction, installation, equipment, maintenance and operation at such airports of buildings and other facilities for the servicing of aircraft or for the comfort and accommodation of air travelers, and the purchase and sale of supplies, goods and commodities as an incident to the operation of its airport properties. For such purposes the municipality may use any available property that it may now or hereafter own or control and may, by purchase, gift, devise, lease, eminent domain proceedings or otherwise, acquire property, real or personal, or any interest therein including easements in airport hazards or land outside the boundaries of an airport or airport site, as are necessary to permit safe and efficient operation of the airport or to permit the removal, elimination, obstruction marking or obstruction lighting of airport hazards or to prevent the establishment of airport hazards.
     </p>
     <p>
      The municipality may by purchase, gift, devise, lease, eminent domain proceedings or otherwise, acquire existing airports and air navigation facilities. However, it shall not acquire or take over any airport or air navigation facility owned or controlled by another municipality or public agency without the consent of such municipality or public agency.
     </p>
     <p>
      All air navigation facilities established or operated by municipalities shall be supplementary to and coordinated in design and operation with those established and operated by the federal and state governments.

      In the acquisition of property by eminent domain proceedings authorized by the Municipal Airport Law, the municipality shall proceed in the manner provided by Chapter 27 of Title 11, Mississippi Code of 1972, and as elsewhere provided by law. For the purpose of making surveys and examinations relative to any eminent domain proceedings, it shall be lawful to enter upon the land, doing no unnecessary damage. Notwithstanding the provisions of any other statute or other law, the municipality may take possession of any property to be acquired by eminent domain proceedings at any time after the commencement of such proceedings upon a specific finding by the municipality of the public necessity for the immediate acquisition of the property pursuant to Section 11-27-81 et seq., and compliance with all provisions of Section 11-27-81 et seq., including the provisions for making a deposit. The municipality shall not be precluded from abandoning such proceedings at any time prior to final order and decree of the court having jurisdiction of such proceedings. The municipality shall be liable to the owner of the property for any damage done to the property during possession thereof by the municipality.

      The cost of planning and acquiring, establishing, developing, constructing, enlarging, improving, or equipping an airport or air navigation facility, or the site therefor, including buildings and other facilities incidental to the operation thereof, and the acquisition or elimination of airport hazards, may be paid for wholly or partly from the proceeds of the sale of bonds or notes of the municipality, as the governing body of the municipality shall determine. For such purposes a municipality may issue general or special obligation bonds, revenue bonds or other forms of bonds or notes, secured or unsecured, including refunding bonds, in the manner and within the limitations prescribed by the laws of this state or the charter of the municipality for the authorization and issuance of bonds or notes thereof for public purposes generally. Such bonds may be sold at public or private sale at not less than par and shall bear interest at a rate or rates as the municipality shall determine, provided that the bonds of any issue shall not bear a greater overall maximum interest rate to maturity than that allowed in Section 75-17-101 for general obligation bonds, or Section 75-17-103 for revenue bonds, as the case may be. Any bonds or notes issued by a municipality pursuant to this section which are payable, as to principal and interest, solely from the revenues of an airport or air navigation facility (and such bonds or notes shall so state on their face), shall not constitute a debt of such municipality within the meaning of any constitutional or statutory debt limitation or restriction. In any suit, action or proceeding involving the security, or the validity or enforceability, of any bond or note issued by a municipality, which bond or note states on its face that it was issued pursuant to the provision of this section and for a purpose or purposes authorized or accomplished by this section, such bond or note shall be conclusively deemed to have been issued pursuant to this section for such purpose or purposes.

     <p>
      Any municipality having a population, according to the last federal census, in excess of ten thousand inhabitants is authorized to lease any part or all of its airport grounds and improvements to one or more private concerns for not longer than twenty-five years by awarding such contract competitively after due notice of such public letting as public contracts are made. The city may lease a part of the land included in its airport either with or without the improvements thereon, and may require the lessee to erect improvements on such land and maintain the same at its expense or the city may in the discretion of its governing authorities make such contract thereasto as may appear most advantageous and profitable to it. Any such lease contract shall be made only for the purpose of the expansion and development of such airport and its use in furtherance of the promotion of private and commercial aviation therein. The city is authorized to construct and maintain suitable airstrips and landing and take-off areas at its expense in connection with such lease thereof, and it may lease all or any part of its airport buildings and hangars to federal agencies (such as weather bureau and C. A. A.) and private and commercial airlines using such airport as a depot, but the rental thereon shall never be less than the current charges for the upkeep and maintenance thereof and the period of such contract shall not exceed twenty-five years. It is the intent and purpose of this section to vest in such municipalities within the stated class full and plenary power and authority to develop and expand its airport facilities by allowing private concerns to erect improvements thereon at their expense for repairing and servicing private and commercial airplanes and for the sale and servicing of airplanes thereat so as to assure and encourage such continued use of said property and the development thereto at the least possible expense to the public.

     </h3>
     <p>
      It is hereby found that an airport hazard endangers the lives and property of users of the airport and of occupants of land in its vicinity, and also, if of the obstruction type, in effect reduces the size of the area available for the landing, taking-off and maneuvering of aircraft, thus tending to destroy or impair the utility of the airport and the public investment therein. Accordingly, it is hereby declared: (a) that the creation or establishment of an airport hazard is a public nuisance and an injury to the community served by the airport in question; (b) that it is therefore necessary in the interest of the public health, public safety, and general welfare that the creation or establishment of airport hazards be prevented; and (c) that this should be accomplished, to the extent legally possible, by exercise of the police power, without compensation. It is further declared that both the prevention of the creation or establishment of airport hazards and the elimination, removal, alteration, mitigation, or making and lighting of existing airport hazards are public purposes for which political subdivisions may raise and expend public funds and acquire land or property interest therein.

Said board shall have the same power to adopt, administer and enforce airport zoning regulations applicable to the airport hazard in question as that vested by subsection (1) in the political subdivisions within which such area is located. Each such joint board shall have as members two representatives appointed by each political subdivision participating in its creation and, in addition, a chairman elected by a majority of the members so appointed.

      All airport zoning regulations adopted under this chapter shall be reasonable and none shall impose any requirements or restriction which is not reasonably necessary to effectuate the purposes of this chapter.

       Any airport zoning regulations adopted under this chapter may require that a permit be obtained before any new structure or use may be constructed or established and before any existing use or structure may be substantially changed or substantially altered or repaired. In any event, however, all such regulations shall provide that before any non-conforming structure or tree may be replaced, substantially altered or repaired, rebuilt, allowed to grow higher, or replanted, a permit must be secured from the administrative agency authorized to administer and enforce the regulations, authorizing such replacement, change or repair. No permit shall be granted that would allow the establishment or creation of an airport hazard or permit a non-conforming structure or tree or non-conforming use to be made or become higher or become a greater hazard to air navigation than it was when the applicable regulation was adopted or than it is when the application for a permit is made. Except as provided herein, all applications for permits shall be granted.

       Any person desiring to erect any structure, or increase the height of any structure, or permit the growth of any tree, or otherwise use his property in violation of airport zoning regulations adopted under this chapter, may apply to the board of adjustment for a variance from the zoning regulations in question. Such variances shall be allowed where a literal application or enforcement of the regulations would result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship and the relief granted would not be contrary to the public interest but do substantial justice and be in accordance with the spirit of the regulations and this chapter. Any variance may be allowed subject to any reasonable conditions that the board of adjustment may deem necessary to effectuate the purposes of this chapter.

       In granting any permit or variance under this section, the administrative agency or board of adjustment may, if it deems such action advisable to effectuate the purposes of this chapter and reasonable in the circumstances, so condition such permit or variance as to require the owner of the structure or tree in question to permit the political subdivision, at its own expense, to install, operate and maintain thereon such markers and lights as may be necessary to indicate to flyers the presence of an airport hazard.

      All airport zoning regulations adopted under this chapter shall provide for the administration and enforcement of such regulations by an administrative agency which may be an agency created by such regulations or any official, board, or other existing agency of the political subdivision adopting the regulations or of one of the political subdivisions which participated in the creation of the joint airport zoning board adopting the regulations, if satisfactory to that political subdivision, but in no case shall such administrative agency be or include any member of the board of adjustment. The duties of any administrative agency designated pursuant to this section shall include that of hearing and deciding all permits under subsection (1) of Section 61-7-17. Such agency shall not have or exercise any of the powers delegated in this chapter to the board of adjustment.

    Appeals of administrative decisions to board of adjustment.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Any person aggrieved by any decision of an administrative agency made in its administration of airport zoning regulations adopted under this chapter, or any governing body of a political subdivision, or any joint airport zoning board, which is of the opinion that a decision of such an administrative agency is an improper application of airport zoning regulations of concern to such governing body or board, may appeal to the board of adjustment authorized to hear and decide appeals from the decisions of such administrative agency.
     </p>
     <p>
      All appeals taken under this section must be taken within a reasonable time, as provided by the rules of the board, by filing with the agency from which the appeal is taken and with the board, a notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof. The agency from which the appeal is taken shall forthwith transmit to the board all the papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken.
     </p>
     <p>
      An appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from, unless the agency from which the appeal is taken certifies to the board, after the notice of appeal has been filed with it, that by reason of the facts stated in the certificate a stay would, in its opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property. In such cases proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by order of the board on notice to the agency from which the appeal is taken and on due cause shown.
     </p>
     <p>
      The board shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of appeals, give public notice and due notice to the parties in interest, and decide the same within a reasonable time. Upon the hearing any party may appear in person or by agent or by attorney.
     </p>
     <p>
      The board may, in conformity with the provisions of this chapter, reverse, affirm, wholly or partly, or modify, the order, requirement, decision, or determination appealed from and may make such order, requirement, decision, or determination as ought to be made, and to that end shall have all the powers of the administrative agency from which the appeal is taken.

    Judicial review of administrative decisions.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Any person aggrieved, or taxpayer affected, by any decision of a board of adjustment, or any governing body of a political subdivision or any joint airport zoning board which is of the opinion that a decision of a board of adjustment is illegal, may present to the circuit court of the county wherein such decision was rendered a verified petition setting forth that the decision is illegal, in whole or in part, and specifying the grounds of illegality. Such petition shall be presented to the court within 30 days after the decision is filed in the office of the board.
     </p>
     <p>
      Upon presentation of such petition the court may allow a writ of certiorari directed to the board of adjustment to review such decision of the board. The allowance of the writ shall not stay proceedings upon the decision appealed from, but the court may, on application, on notice to the board and on due cause shown, grant a restraining order.
     </p>
     <p>
      The board of adjustment shall not be required to return the original papers acted upon by it, but it shall be sufficient to return certified or sworn copies thereof or of such portions thereof as may be called for by the writ. The return shall concisely set forth such other facts as may be pertinent and material to show the grounds of the decision appealed from and shall be verified.
     </p>
     <p>
      The court shall have exclusive jurisdiction to affirm, modify, or set aside the decision brought up for review, in whole or in part, and if need be, to order further proceedings by the board of adjustment. The findings of fact of the board, if supported by substantial evidence, shall be accepted by the court as conclusive. No objection to a decision of the board shall be considered by the court unless such objection shall have been urged before the board, or, if it was not so urged, unless there were reasonable grounds for failure to do so.
     </p>
     <p>
      Cost shall not be allowed against the board of adjustment unless it appears to the court that it acted with gross negligence, in bad faith, or with malice, in making the decision appealed from.
     </p>
     <p>
      In any case in which airport zoning regulations adopted under this chapter, although generally reasonable, are held by a court to interfere with the use or enjoyment of a particular structure or parcel of land to such an extent, or to be so onerous in their application to such a structure or parcel of land, as to constitute a taking or deprivation of that property in violation of the constitution of this state or the Constitution of the United States, such holding shall not affect the application of such regulations to other structures and parcels of land.

The court shall adjudge to the plaintiff such relief, by way of injunction (which may be mandatory) or otherwise, as may be proper under all the facts and circumstances of the case, in order fully to effectuate the purposes of this chapter and of the regulations adopted and orders and rulings made pursuant thereto.

      <li id="t61c09s61-9-3ol11">
       The ordinance shall accurately describe the metes and bounds of the property of the airport or air navigational facility to be incorporated; only such portions of property constituting the airport or air navigational facility as shall be owned by the municipality and properties in which easements have been acquired by it for streets, public utilities and public roads and used in connection therewith shall be subject to such incorporation.
      </li>
      <li id="t61c09s61-9-3ol12">
       The ordinance shall provide that it shall not become operative until publication thereof shall have been made once each week for three (3) consecutive weeks in a newspaper, or newspapers, published or having a general circulation in the county or counties where both the municipality and such airport or air navigational facility shall be located.

       Subject only to the provisions hereof, and irrespective of the geographic location of the airport or air navigational facility in a county or judicial district other than the county or judicial district within which the principal office of the municipality is located, any such ordinance shall become effective upon the effective date fixed therein. On and after such effective date and on or after March 10, 1976, all laws, municipal ordinances, and local options effective in the municipality as a result of municipal, judicial district and county options exercised in the municipality, judicial district or the county within which the principal office of the municipality is located, and all other laws, orders, codes and resolutions of and applicable to the municipality availing or having availed itself of the provisions hereof as well as those of the board of supervisors of the county in which the principal office of the municipality is located, shall be applicable to such airport or air navigational facility; provided, however, that no permit for the sale of any alcoholic beverage as defined in Section 67-1-5, except an on-premises retailer’s permit as authorized by Section 67-1-51(c), shall be issued for use at such airport or air navigational facility. Venue for the trial of all offenses against such laws and ordinances shall be in the county in which the airport or air navigational facility is located.
      </li>
      <li id="t61c09s61-9-3ol14">
       Nothing in this section shall be construed to restrict the county wherein the airport or air navigational facility is geographically located from levying and collecting state, county and school district ad valorem taxes on taxable properties situated thereat; and nothing in this section shall operate to impair or restrict the detachment of territory from a municipal separate school district and the annexation thereof to a county school district under Section 37-7-609, whether occurring prior to or subsequent to March 10, 1976.

       In an action to recover for personal injuries sustained by the plaintiff when he was struck by an airplane used to spray cotton on a farm, owners of the airplane were liable, where they reserved the right to direct when and how the work of spraying cotton was to be carried on, and where there was no lease of any kind of airplane to pilot and where the bailment was at the will of the owners.

       The operator of an airplane may be found to have been negligent where his take-off from a pasture in which he had landed caused the cattle grazing therein to stampede. Brunt v. Chicago Mill & Lumber Co., 243 Miss. 607, 139 So. 2d 380, 1962 Miss. LEXIS 384 (Miss. 1962).

       Trial court properly granted a limited liability company (LLC) summary judgment in wrongful death beneficiaries’ action because the LLC could act only through a pilot since he was its sole member, and the beneficiaries were barred from recovering for the pilot’s negligence; if the pilot had survived the crash, he would have been unable to recover from the LLC for his own negligence, and the beneficiaries stood in the pilot’s shoes and also could not recover for his negligence.

       In an unsuccessful suit against an airplane company and a pilot for the wrongful death of a flagman who was struck and killed by an airplane spraying herbicides while he attempted to guide it beneath transmission wires, the trial court properly denied plaintiff’s request for a peremptory instruction where the uncontradicted testimony at trial was that the pilot had kept the best lookout possible under the circumstances; while violation of this section is negligence per se, no showing was made that the statute was indeed violated. Cannon v. Jones, 377 So. 2d 1055, 1979 Miss. LEXIS 2520 (Miss. 1979).

     <p>
      For any violation of the provisions of such sections, in addition to, or in lieu of, the penalties provided by the first paragraph of this section, or as a condition to the suspension of a sentence which may be imposed pursuant thereto, the court, in its discretion, may prohibit the violator from operating an aircraft within the state for such period as it may determine but not to exceed one year. Violation of the duly imposed prohibition of the court may be treated as a separate offense under this section or as a contempt of court. Upon a plea of guilty or conviction hereunder in any case involving a registrant, under the provisions of such sections, the court shall cause a notation of such plea or conviction and of the sentence imposed to be marked upon the pilot certificate or other evidence of pilot registration or receipt provided by the Mississippi Department of Transportation. The court shall cause a copy of its order or sentence to be forwarded to the commission, the cost of furnishing same to be added as a part of cost in such cause. In no event shall this paragraph be construed as warrant for the court or any other agency or person to take away, impound, hold or mark any federal airman or aircraft certificate, permit, rating or license, or to take away, impound or hold any state registration certificate or other evidence of such registration.
