       To accomplish goal of interfering with state policy only to that extent necessary to remedy statutory or constitutional violations, court would adhere to Mississippi’s established procedure for holding legislative elections, including party primaries, rather than using format for special elections and elections would proceed for 3-year, term of office to supplement interim elections filed in year that regular elections were required to be held under Mississippi statute.

       <p>
   Use of 1982 reapportionment plan, which had been found unconstitutional, rather than court-drawn plan or plan proposed by parties, was constitutional and could properly be used on interim basis in order that primary and general elections for state legislature could take place as scheduled prior to implementation of valid, permanent plan, despite fact that 1982 plan did not maximize members of majority black districts; because of swiftness with which population changes, and high cost of creating new election districts, and in view of lack of sufficient time to conduct full hearings and fact that proponents of one proposed plan failed to show that plan cured objections by United States Attorney General, and since possibility of corrective relief at later date existed, use was appropriate.

   House Bill No. 1290 and Senate Bill No. 2976, Mississippi Laws, 1975, Regular Session, reapportioning the state legislature, are not now and will not be effective as laws until and unless cleared pursuant to § 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, 42 USCS § 1973c. Connor v. Waller, <cite class="us_code">421 U.S. 656</cite>, <cite class="s_court">95 S. Ct. 2003</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">44 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 486, 1975 U.S. LEXIS 68 (U.S. 1975).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Mississippi statutes reapportioning the state legislature are legislative enactments that are required to be submitted for federal approval pursuant to § 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (42 USCS § 1973c), and such state statutes are not effective until and unless cleared pursuant to § 5; thus a United States District Court, after improperly concluding that § 5 is not applicable, also errs in deciding constitutional challenges to the state statute based upon claims of racial discrimination. Connor v. Waller, <cite class="us_code">421 U.S. 656</cite>, <cite class="s_court">95 S. Ct. 2003</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">44 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 486, 1975 U.S. LEXIS 68 (U.S. 1975).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   To establish a denial of equal protection by a state legislature’s multimember districting plan, it must be shown that the plan will operate to minimize or cancel out the voting strength of racial or political elements of the voting population; there must be more evidence than a simple disproportionality between the voting potential and the legislative seats won by a racial or political group; there must be evidence that the group has been denied access to the political process equal to the access of other groups, and proof of lessening or cancellation of voting strength must be offered. Chapman v. Meier, <cite class="us_code">420 U.S. 1</cite>, <cite class="s_court">95 S. Ct. 751</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">42 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 766, 1975 U.S. LEXIS 25 (U.S. 1975).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Unless there are persuasive justifications, a federal court’s reapportionment plan for a state’s legislature must avoid use of multimember districts, and must ordinarily achieve the goal of population equality with little more than de minimis variation, although such plan is not required to attain the mathematical preciseness required for congressional redistricting; where important and significant state considerations rationally mandate departure from such standards, it is the reapportioning court’s responsibility to articulate precisely why a plan of single-member districts with minimal population variance cannot be adopted. Chapman v. Meier, <cite class="us_code">420 U.S. 1</cite>, <cite class="s_court">95 S. Ct. 751</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">42 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 766, 1975 U.S. LEXIS 25 (U.S. 1975).

       To accomplish goal of interfering with state policy only to that extent necessary to remedy statutory or constitutional violations, court would adhere to Mississippi’s established procedure for holding legislative elections, including party primaries, rather than using format for special elections, and elections would proceed for 3-year term of office to supplement interim elections filed in year that regular elections were required to be held under Mississippi statute. Watkins v. Fordice, 791 F. Supp. 646, 1992 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7140 (S.D. Miss. 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Use of 1982 reapportionment plan, which had been found unconstitutional, rather than court-drawn plan or plan proposed by parties, was constitutional and could properly be used on interim basis in order that primary and general elections for state legislature could take place as scheduled prior to implementation of valid, permanent plan, despite fact that 1982 plan did not maximize members of majority black districts; because of swiftness with which population changes, and high cost of creating new election districts, and in view of lack of sufficient time to conduct full hearings and fact that proponents of one proposed plan failed to show that plan cured objections by United States Attorney General, and since possibility of corrective relief at later date existed, use was appropriate.

   House Bill No. 1290 and Senate Bill No. 2976, Mississippi Laws, 1975, Regular Session, reapportioning the state legislature, are not now and will not be effective as laws until and unless cleared pursuant to § 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, 42 USCS § 1973c. Connor v. Waller, <cite class="us_code">421 U.S. 656</cite>, <cite class="s_court">95 S. Ct. 2003</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">44 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 486, 1975 U.S. LEXIS 68 (U.S. 1975).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Mississippi statutes reapportioning the state legislature are legislative enactments that are required to be submitted for federal approval pursuant to § 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (42 USCS § 1973c), and such state statutes are not effective until and unless cleared pursuant to § 5; thus a United States District Court, after improperly concluding that § 5 is not applicable, also errs in deciding constitutional challenges to the state statute based upon claims of racial discrimination. Connor v. Waller, <cite class="us_code">421 U.S. 656</cite>, <cite class="s_court">95 S. Ct. 2003</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">44 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 486, 1975 U.S. LEXIS 68 (U.S. 1975).

   To establish a denial of equal protection by a state legislature’s multimember districting plan, it must be shown that the plan will operate to minimize or cancel out the voting strength of racial or political elements of the voting population; there must be more evidence than a simple disproportionality between the voting potential and the legislative seats won by a racial or political group; there must be evidence that the group has been denied access to the political process equal to the access of other groups, and proof of lessening or cancellation of voting strength must be offered. Chapman v. Meier, <cite class="us_code">420 U.S. 1</cite>, <cite class="s_court">95 S. Ct. 751</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">42 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 766, 1975 U.S. LEXIS 25 (U.S. 1975).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Unless there are persuasive justifications, a federal court’s reapportionment plan for a state’s legislature must avoid use of multimember districts, and must ordinarily achieve the goal of population equality with little more than de minimis variation, although such plan is not required to attain the mathematical preciseness required for congressional redistricting; where important and significant state considerations rationally mandate departure from such standards, it is the reapportioning court’s responsibility to articulate precisely why a plan of single-member districts with minimal population variance cannot be adopted. Chapman v. Meier, <cite class="us_code">420 U.S. 1</cite>, <cite class="s_court">95 S. Ct. 751</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">42 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 766, 1975 U.S. LEXIS 25 (U.S. 1975).

      </p>
      <p>
       “On April 26, 2011, the Governor returned House Bill No. 1054 to the House of Representatives with a partial veto message for Section 2 of the bill. House Bill No. 1054, which is generally known as the ‘transfer bill,’ is a bill that, among other things, provides for the transfer of state funds into certain accounts for use in the general fund appropriations process. The Governor said in his message that he was not concerned with the transfer components of the bill, but had concerns specifically with Section 2 of the bill.
      </p>
      <p>
       “
       <b>
        Applicable Law and Discussion
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       “Under the Mississippi Constitution of 1890 (hereinafter ‘Mississippi Constitution’), the powers of government are divided between and among three separate and distinct departments, to wit, the legislative department, the executive department and the judicial department.
   Miss. Const. Art. 1, Sec. 1 (1890). No person belonging to one department is authorized to exercise core powers belonging to another department.
   Miss. Const. Art. 1, Sec. 2 (1890);
   Dye v. State ex rel. Hale, 507 So. 2d 332 at 343 (Miss. 1987); and
   Alexander v. State ex rel. Alain, 441 So. 2d 1329 (Miss. 1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       “The enactment of laws is an exercise of legislative power, which is subject to the executive power of veto. The Mississippi Constitution authorizes two types of vetoes, one which is applicable to all bills and is total in nature and another which is applicable only to appropriation bills and is partial in nature.
      </p>
      <p>
       “Section 721 authorizes the Governor to approve or disapprove, by way of veto, every bill that passes both houses of the Legislature:
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless otherwise indicated all section numbers refer to sections of the Mississippi Constitution of 1890.
      </p>
      <p>
       “Every Bill which shall pass both Houses shall be presented to the Governor of the state. If he approve, he shall sign it; but if he does not approve, he shall return it, with his objections, to the House in which it originated, which shall enter the objections at large upon its Journal, and proceed to reconsider it. If after such reconsideration two-thirds (2/3) of that House shall agree to pass the Bill, it shall be sent, with the objections, to the other House, by which, likewise, it shall be reconsidered; and if approved by two-thirds (2/3) of that House, it shall become a law; but in all such cases the votes of both Houses shall be determined by yeas and nays, and the names of the persons voting for and against the Bill shall be entered on the Journal of each House respectively. If any Bill shall not be returned by the Governor within five (5) days (Sundays excepted) after it has been presented to him, it shall become a law in like manner as if he had signed it, unless the Legislature, by adjournment, prevented its return, in which case such Bill shall be a law unless the Governor shall veto it within fifteen (15) days (Sundays excepted) after it is presented to him, and such Bill shall be returned to the Legislature, with his objections, within three (3) days after the beginning of the next session of the Legislature.
      </p>
      <p>
       “In exercising the gubernatorial veto under Section 72, the Governor must veto the entire bill. There is no power to approve parts of a bill, while disapproving other parts.
      </p>
      <p>
       “It is the opinion of this office that House Bill No. 1054 of the 2011 Regular Session is not an appropriation bill and, therefore, is not subject to partial veto under Section 73.”
      </p>
      <p>
       “In contrast, Section 73 authorizes the Governor to veto parts and approve parts of any ‘appropriation bill’:
      </p>
      <p>
       “The governor may veto parts of any appropriation bill, and approve parts of the same, and the portions approved shall be law.
      </p>
      <p>
       “The power to approve parts of a bill, while vetoing or disapproving other parts of the same bill, is expressly limited to appropriation bills and may not be exercised with regard to other legislation. An attempt to partially veto any bill other than an appropriation bill would be outside the authority granted to the Governor under the Mississippi Constitution and would be an impermissible infringement of the powers of the Legislature.
      </p>
      <p>
       “ The Mississippi Supreme Court in
       <i>
        Fordice v. Bryan,
       </i>
       651 So. 2d 998 (Miss. 1995), a case involving the exercise of a partial veto, stated:
      </p>
      <p>
       “Article IV, Section 73 of the Mississippi Constitution of 1890 states: ‘The governor may veto
       <i>
        parts
       </i>
       of any
       <i>
        appropriation bill
       </i>
       , and approve parts of the same, and the portions approved shall be law.’
   Miss. Const. art. IV, Section 73 (emphasis added). Therefore, the Governor is entitled to exercise his Section 73 veto power upon ‘parts’ of ‘appropriation’ bills, and only upon ‘parts’ of ‘appropriation’ bills. The Governor may not exercise the Section 73 partial veto power on revenue raising bond bills.
      </p>
      <p>
       “In order for the bills to be susceptible to the Governor’s Section 73 partial veto power, they must fix a definite maximum amount, Section 63, and not continue to be in force withdrawing money from the state treasury longer than two months after the expiration of the fiscal year ending after the meeting of the legislature at its next regular session, Section
   64. 651 So. 2d 998, 1000.
      </p>
      <p>
       “Although there is no definition of ‘appropriation bill’ in the Mississippi Constitution, there are mandatory requirements for appropriation bills contained therein. Section 63, which requires an appropriation bill to state the maximum sum authorized to be drawn from the State Treasury, states:
      </p>
      <p>
       “No appropriation bill shall be passed by the legislature which does not fix definitely the maximum sum thereby authorized to be drawn from the treasury.

       “Section 64, which provides that bills making appropriations out of the State Treasury only be in force no more than two months after the expiration of the fiscal year, states:
      </p>
      <p>
       “No bill passed after the adoption of this Constitution to make appropriations of money out of the state treasury shall continue in force more than two months after the expiration of the fiscal year ending after the meeting of the legislature at its next regular session; nor shall such bill be passed except by the votes of a majority of all members elected to each house of the legislature.
      </p>
      <p>
       “Section 69 prescribes the contents of appropriation bills and prohibits the engrafting of other legislation therein and reads as follows:
      </p>
      <p>
       “General appropriation bills shall contain only the appropriations to defray the ordinary expenses of the executive, legislative, and judicial departments of the government; to pay interest on state bonds, and to support the common schools. All other appropriations shall be made by separate bills, each embracing but one subject. Legislation shall not be engrafted on the appropriation bills, but the same may prescribe the conditions on which the money may be drawn, and for what purposes paid.
      </p>
      <p>
       “Section 68 provides that appropriation bills (and revenue bills) have precedence in the Legislature over all other business:
      </p>
      <p>
       “Appropriation and revenue bills shall, at regular sessions of the legislature, have precedence in both houses over all other business, and no such bills shall be passed during the last five days of the session.
      </p>
      <p>
       “Under the Joint Rules of the Senate and the House, appropriation bills and revenue bills are subject to deadlines during the legislative session which are different from other bills. See Joint Rule 40 (2011).

      <p>
       “In accordance with
       <i>
        Fordice v. Bryan, supra
       </i>
       , the validity of a partial veto under Section 73 depends on the nature of the bill itself, i.e., is House Bill No. 1054 an appropriation bill subject to partial veto under Section 73 or is it a general bill subject only to the general veto provisions of Section 72? If House Bill No. 1054 is not an appropriation bill, then it is not subject to partial veto under Section 73.
      </p>
      <p>
       “To determine whether House Bill No. 1054 is an appropriation bill, it is necessary (1) to examine and compare its provisions with the constitutional sections which prescribe the mandatory provisions of an appropriations bill and (2) to examine the legislative process in which House Bill No. 1054 came to be enacted, i.e., was House Bill No. 1054 handled procedurally as an appropriation bill?
      </p>
      <p>
       “House Bill No. 1054 contains no maximum amount which may be withdrawn from the Treasury as required by Section 63. House Bill No.1054 is not limited in duration to no more than two months after the expiration of the fiscal year as required by Section 64. Its contents are not limited to appropriations defraying the expenses of State government, paying interest on state bonds, and supporting the common schools as required by Section 69.
      </p>
      <p>
       “In addition to not satisfying the constitutional requirements of appropriation bills, House Bill No. 1054 contains provisions commonly seen in general bills. For example, House Bill No. 1054
       <i>
        inter alia
       </i>
       authorizes a half dozen transfers of funds making it similar to ‘transfer bills’ in previous legislative sessions, which were also treated procedurally by the Legislature as general bills. House Bill No. 1059, 2010 Regular Session and House Bill No. 1505, 2009 Regular Session. In addition, House Bill No. 1054 authorizes the borrowing of special funds to offset any temporary cash flow deficiency in the Health Care Expendable Fund. It provides that certain funds held for veterans by the State Veterans Home shall be considered to be held in a fiduciary capacity for the benefit of the veterans. House Bill No. 1054 also revises the time limit in which a resident of the coastal counties, whose residence was destroyed by Hurricane Katrina, must begin construction in order to not be required to meet current lot size requirements. These provisions are all similar in nature to other provisions commonly found in general bills.
      </p>
      <p>
       “Section 2 of House Bill No. 1054, which was the subject of the Governor’s veto message, reads as follows:
      </p>
      <p>
       “On or before July 1 of each fiscal year, or at such other times as necessary, the Clerk of the House of Representatives or the Secretary of the Senate (‘the Legislature’) shall submit a request to the State Fiscal Officer for the funds necessary to pay (a) the expenses of the Joint Legislative Committee on Compilation, Revision and Publication of Legislation, (b) the state’s share of various assessments from legislative-related organizations, and (c) any other legislative-related expenses. The State Fiscal Officer shall transfer to the Legislature the amount or amounts as requested by the Legislature from the Secretary of State’s Fund No. 3111. The State Fiscal Officer shall transfer such obligated funds in a timely manner as determined by the Legislature. The Legislature is authorized to escalate the appropriate budgets during the fiscal year by the respective amounts transferred and to expend those sums for the purposes authorized by law.
      </p>
      <p>
       “Briefly stated, Section 2 of House Bill No. 1054 authorizes the transfer of funds from the Secretary of State’s Fund No. 31112, the escalation of the Legislature’s budget by amounts transferred from Fund No. 31112, and the payment of legislative expenses specified therein.
      </p>
      <p class="p10">
      </p>
      <p>
       Fund No. 3111 contains special funds which are generated by fees earned by the Secretary of State and the Legislature appropriates funds therefrom for some of the operations of the Secretary of State’s office.
      </p>
      <p>
       “While Section 2 of House Bill No. 1054 authorizes the expenditure of public funds, it does not do so within the framework of an appropriation bill. Appropriation bills are not the exclusive legislative vehicle for authorizing the expenditure of public funds. As you note in your letter of request, the Department of Finance and Administration is authorized by
   Section 7-1-255 of the Mississippi Code, a general law provision, to escalate its budget based on application fees it receives. Similarly, the Department of Audit is authorized by
   Section 7-7-81 (2) of the Mississippi Code, another general law provision, to escalate its budget based on funds deposited in the ‘Auditor’s Enhanced Accountability Fund.’ Upon each agency’s respective budget being escalated, these Code sections authorize the Department of Finance and Administration and the Department of Audit to expend available funds. No further action of the Legislature is necessary. You list thirteen other examples of escalation and expenditure authority by general laws in your letter.3

      </p>
      <p>
       “In addition, bond bills, specifically found not to be appropriation bills in
       <i>
        Fordice v. Bryan,
       </i>
       supra, and, therefore, not subject to partial veto, typically authorize the expenditure of public funds after bonds are issued without any further act of the Legislature. Similarly, legislation establishing revolving funds, though not appropriation bills, generally authorize the expenditure of public funds without any further act of the Legislature.
      </p>
      <p>
       “The provisions in Section 2 of House Bill No. 1054 are similar to the general law escalation provisions mentioned above and the thirteen other general law examples referenced in your letter. Once the transfer of funds is made from Fund No. 3111 and the Legislature’s budget is escalated, the Legislature is authorized to make expenditures from available funds.
      </p>
      <p>
       “With regard to its procedural treatment by the Legislature, House Bill No. 1054 was not afforded the precedence and deadlines applicable to appropriation bills. Instead, House Bill No. 1054 was subject to the deadlines applicable to general bills. The ‘transfer bills’ in previous legislative sessions, referred to above, were also treated procedurally by the Legislature as general bills.
      </p>
      <p>
       “All of the comparisons of the constitutional requirements for appropriation bills with the contents of House Bill No. 1054 and the legislative procedure employed for enactment indicate that House Bill No. 1054 is a general bill, not an appropriation bill. The Governor, in his veto message, acknowledged that House Bill No. 1054 is a general bill. However, he characterizes House Bill No. 1054 as a general bill which contains an appropriation in Section 2 and, therefore, is subject to a partial veto.
      </p>
      <p>
       “We are unable to find any authority for the proposition that any bill which authorizes the expenditure of public funds is an appropriation bill for purposes of Section 73. On the contrary, it is clear under
       <i>
        Fordice v. Bryan, supra
       </i>
       , that a bill must meet the constitutional requirements set forth for appropriation bills in order to be subject to partial veto under Section 73. While the Governor was authorized to exercise his general veto authority under Section 72 with regard to House Bill No. 1054, he was not authorized to exercise his partial veto authority under Section 73. An unconstitutional attempt of a partial veto is a nullity.

       There is created in the State Treasury a special fund to be known as the Legislative Extraordinary Session Expense Revolving Fund. This fund is established for the purpose of paying the salaries, mileage, daily expense allowance, retirement contributions, matching funds and any other expenses of the members of the Legislature that are incurred during any extraordinary session of the Legislature. All income from the investment of funds in the revolving fund shall be credited to the special fund, and any funds remaining in the revolving fund at the end of a fiscal year shall not lapse into the State General Fund.

       The State Bond Commission shall grant noninterest bearing loans to the Legislative Extraordinary Session Expense Revolving Fund from the State Treasurer’s General Fund/Special Fund Pool, upon the joint request of the Clerk of the House and the Secretary of the Senate, which loans shall be used to pay any expenses of the members of the Legislature that are incurred during any extraordinary session of the Legislature. The total amount of loans granted to the revolving fund during any fiscal year may not exceed One Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00).

The legislative oversight committee shall have no jurisdiction or vote on any matter within the jurisdiction of the State Bond Commission. When the Legislature is not in session, members of the legislative oversight committee shall be paid per diem and all actual and necessary expenses, including, without limitation, travel expenses both within and without the state, from their respective contingent expense funds at the rate authorized for committee meetings when the Legislature is not in session. The State Bond Commission is authorized to reimburse the aforementioned contingent expense funds for such per diem and all other reasonable expenses paid by such funds, but the State Bond Commission shall pay the same only from the proceeds of refunding bonds and the State Bond Commission shall treat the same as part of the cost of issuing such bonds. The terms of the members of the legislative oversight committee shall expire at the end of their terms of office.

       Pursuant to the exception in Section 5-8-7(d), staff members who are frequently requested to provide information concerning the legislative agenda of the PERS Board of Trustees, would not be required to register or report as lobbyists, provided that they do not pay, promise to pay, offer to pay, or cause to be paid, individually or on their employer’s behalf, public officials, legislative officials, or public employees any thing or things of value aggregating in value to two hundred dollars in a calendar year. Walker, March 8, 1995, A.G. Op. #95-0091.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sections 5-8-13(4) and 5-8-7 provide that a public employee who represents a legislative or public official or public employee and who, as a primary or regular function of his employment, engages in lobbying activities when acting in his official capacity would be a lobbyist and subject to the registration and reporting requirements of the Lobbying Reform Act of 1994. Hamm, May 17, 1995, A.G. Op. #95-0171.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the request for approval of an appropriation is not a primary or regular function of the employment position of the person making the request, such person would not come under the statutory definition of “lobbyist” and would not be required to register and report as such. See Section 5-8-7(d). Stennett, August 2, 1995, A.G. Op. #95-0336.
      </p>
      <p>
       If, as a matter of fact, an activity is related to law enforcement matters or the duties of that office pursuant to Section 5-8-7, the Sheriff would be exempt from the registration and reporting requirements of the Lobbying Law Reform Act of 1994. Torrence, October 11, 1995, A.G. Op. #95-0655.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the communication is made at the request, suggestion or direction of the lobbyist’s client any expenditures in connection therewith must be reported. The fact that specific expenditures may not have been directed, suggested or requested by the lobbyist’s client would not exempt the expenditures from the reporting requirements. See Section 5-8-7(d). Ford, December 20, 1995, A.G. Op. #95-0844.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the communication by a non-lobbyist employee is not suggested, directed or requested by the lobbyist-client but is done totally independently by the employee the expenditure would not be required to be reported by the lobbyist-client. It would, of course, have to be reported by the employee if such expenditures aggregate in value to $200.00 in any calendar year. See Section 5-8-7(d). Ford, December 20, 1995, A.G. Op. #95-0844.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Executive Director of the Public Employees’ Retirement System is a public employee insofar as the lobbying laws are concern. Nothing in this section excludes a public employee from the definition of “lobbyist.” Flowers, Nov. 16, 2004, A.G. Op. 04-0542.
