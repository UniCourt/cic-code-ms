     <p>
      He shall make appointments and fill vacancies as prescribed by law.

      He may bring any proper suit affecting the general public interests, in his own name for the State of Mississippi, if after first requesting the proper officer so to do, the officer refuses or neglects to do the same.

       Motion to intervene filed by the Governor of Mississippi, the Mississippi Division of Medicaid, and the Mississippi Health Care Trust Fund could not be set aside for a perceived lack of statutory or legal authority because: (1) the Governor unquestionably had not only the statutory but also the constitutional authority to intervene since the Governor was under a solemn duty to act in order to assure faithful execution of Mississippi’s laws; (2) the division had a compelling interest to see that the annual payments of $20 million were placed in the Mississippi Health Care Trust Fund because the suit was initially brought to recoup monies expended by the division; (3) the Mississippi Health Care Trust Fund was authorized to recoup funds paid to a partnership, a non-profit organization created to reduce under age smoking; and (4) the Mississippi Attorney General declined to take action.

       Requirement that Governor shall see that laws are executed means that laws shall be carried into effect, and not arbitrary enforcement by executive of what he considers law. State v. McPhail, 182 Miss. 360, 180 So. 387, 1938 Miss. LEXIS 147 (Miss. 1938).
      </p>
      <p>
       Power to enforce laws is not left as a matter of finality in local authorities or local inhabitants, but in head of executive department to act, in case of need, for whole State. State v. McPhail, 182 Miss. 360, 180 So. 387, 1938 Miss. LEXIS 147 (Miss. 1938).
      </p>
      <p>
       Governor is executive officer in every county, may set enforcement machinery in motion and thereby determine to whom civil process may be directed for execution when there is failure, neglect, or inability of local officers to act.

       National guardsmen, acting under an executive order of the governor, and a search warrant issued by the county judge, directed to any officer of the county, had authority to make a search of the accused’s premises wherein a slot machine was found. Brady v. State, 229 Miss. 677, 91 So. 2d 751, 1957 Miss. LEXIS 314 (Miss. 1957).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the recitals in the executive order, empowering the adjutant general to order out national guardsmen for the purpose of seeing that laws were faithfully executed in Jones County, made out a prima facie case justifying the governor’s actions, the duty of showing that there was not such breakdown of law enforcement conditions as to justify this action was upon the accused, who was complaining of the search of his premises wherein a slot machine was found. Brady v. State, 229 Miss. 677, 91 So. 2d 751, 1957 Miss. LEXIS 314 (Miss. 1957).
      </p>
      <p>
       What Governor does in execution of laws, and acts of militia under his authority, must be as civil officers, and in strict subordination to the general law of the land. State v. McPhail, 182 Miss. 360, 180 So. 387, 1938 Miss. LEXIS 147 (Miss. 1938).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where Governor unsuccessfully seeks law enforcement through local officers for length of time which makes it clearly apparent that no dependence can be placed in local officers, then, duty arises to send militia, not to supersede but to enforce law. State v. McPhail, 182 Miss. 360, 180 So. 387, 1938 Miss. LEXIS 147 (Miss. 1938).
      </p>
      <p>
       Governor’s decision as to whether exigency justifies calling out militia, held subject to judicial review. State v. McPhail, 182 Miss. 360, 180 So. 387, 1938 Miss. LEXIS 147 (Miss. 1938).
      </p>
      <p>
       Proclamation of Governor ordering out militia need not contain any particular recitals. State v. McPhail, 182 Miss. 360, 180 So. 387, 1938 Miss. LEXIS 147 (Miss. 1938).
      </p>
      <p>
       Statute making it obligatory on Governor to call out militia in enumerated cases, held inapplicable, in main, to constitutional and statutory sections which deal with particular and separate subject of execution of the laws. State v. McPhail, 182 Miss. 360, 180 So. 387, 1938 Miss. LEXIS 147 (Miss. 1938).

   Section<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t07c01s7-1-25ol12" target="_self">7-1-25(2)</a></cite> addresses situations where an act is committed in either Mississippi or in a third state which intentionally results in a crime in the demanding state, and applies to persons who are “non-fugitives,” i.e., persons who are not present in the demanding state when the intentional act was performed but whose acts result in a crime in the demanding state; §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t07c01s7-1-25ol12" target="_self">7-1-25(2)</a></cite> recognizes the theory of “constructive presence” wherein a person can commit a crime in a demanding state without actually being physically present in that state. State v. McCurley, 627 So. 2d 339, 1993 Miss. LEXIS 510 (Miss. 1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       Extradition is not intended as a preliminary inquiry into the merits of a criminal prosecution, but instead is a summary executive proceeding by which a criminal accused can be brought before the appropriate tribunal for adjudication. State v. McCurley, 627 So. 2d 339, 1993 Miss. LEXIS 510 (Miss. 1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       Filing of extradition proceedings and granting of extradition by asylum state constitutes prima facie case on behalf of state that it is entitled to extradition; controversy over specific date of alleged crime is question to be litigated in judiciary of demanding state. Allen v. State, 515 So. 2d 890, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2873 (Miss. 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       Introduction of Governor’s extradition warrant creates presumption that all requirements for extradition have been met. Allen v. State, 515 So. 2d 890, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2873 (Miss. 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       No particular form of authentication of extradition papers is required. Keller v. State, 246 Miss. 436, 150 So. 2d 426, 1963 Miss. LEXIS 461 (Miss. 1963).
      </p>
      <p>
       Either the indictment or judgment of conviction, properly authenticated, should be a part of the demanding papers and in the possession of the governor of the asylum state prior to the issuance of the extradition warrant. Loper v. Dees, 210 Miss. 402, 49 So. 2d 718, 1951 Miss. LEXIS 274 (Miss. 1951).
      </p>

       State statutes and decisions relating to habeas corpus and extradition are not applicable to interstate extradition except to extent that they may be in aid of, and not inconsistent with, the Constitution and laws of United States on the question.

       Decree of court in habeas corpus proceedings adjudging extradition proceedings to be insufficient both in form and substance but providing for discharge of relator unless within a stated period of time the sheriff should be served with a proper, legal and sufficient extradition warrant based upon proper, legal and sufficient papers and proceedings, violated accused’s constitutional right to have the trial judge as a judicial officer to not only pass upon the sufficiency of the extradition proceedings then before the court but also the sufficiency of any such papers that were to be thereafter supplied in their stead. Bishop v. Jones, 207 Miss. 438, 42 So. 2d 421 (1949).
      </p>
      <p>
       If the governor’s warrant of extradition and all of the requisition papers are sufficient in form and substance they may be introduced at the hearing on habeas corpus to constitute a prima facie right on the part of the respondent to surrender the alleged defendant to the demanding state, but relator may nevertheless introduce proof before the court where the habeas corpus petition is being heard to show that he was not in the demanding state at the time of the commission of the alleged crime. Bishop v. Jones, 207 Miss. 438, 42 So. 2d 421 (1949).
      </p>
      <p>
       The two indispensable prerequisites to the right of the governor of the asylum state to surrender an alleged offender to the authorities of the demanding state are: first, that such governor be furnished with a copy of an indictment found by a grand jury or an affidavit made before a magistrate of the demanding state or territory, charging the person demanded with the commission of the alleged crime, certified as authentic by the governor or chief magistrate of the state or territory from whence the person so charged has fled; and, second, that the governor of the asylum state must be satisfied, either from an inquiry conducted by him at his option or on the basis of the prima facie presumption carried by the regularity of the extradition proceedings, that the alleged offender is a fugitive from justice of the demanding state, that is, that he was in the demanding state at the time of the commission of the alleged crime and has departed therefrom into the state where he is found. Bishop v. Jones, 207 Miss. 423, 38 So. 2d 920, 42 So. 2d 421, 1949 Miss. LEXIS 353 (Miss.), op. withdrawn, different results reached on reconsid., 207 Miss. 423, 42 So. 2d 421, 1949 Miss.

       Where relator is arrested for crime committed in another state upon the warrant of the governor of this state authorizing extradition, the guilt or innocence of the relator cannot be inquired into on habeas corpus in this state.

       Where an Arkansas merchant filed criminal charges against a Mississippi defendant for theft of property, a writ of extradition was issued, and defendant’s habeas corpus petition was denied, defendant was entitled to another hearing, since he was not allowed to put into evidence the proof that he offered at the habeas hearing, to rebut the prima facie case established by the rendition warrant and the other extradition documents, in an attempt to demonstrate that the documents were not on their face in order.

       In habeas corpus proceedings questioning the sufficiency of a requisition for extradition, the admission by appellant of his indictment and conviction for rape in a sister state cures the defect of the omission of indictment or judgment of conviction being attached to the demanding papers from the governor of sister state.

       The decision of the governor of the asylum state, when holding the extradition proceedings to be sufficient in form and substance as a jurisdictional prerequisite to granting relief to the demanding state, is subject to review in a habeas corpus proceeding brought by the accused.

      <p>
       Upon judicial review on habeas corpus with respect to extradition of an alleged fugitive from justice of the demanding state, relator may introduce proof to show that he was not in the demanding state at the time of the commission of the alleged crime, and that he could not therefore be a fugitive from the justice of such state. Bishop v. Jones, 207 Miss. 438, 42 So. 2d 421 (1949).

       In respect to mileage allowances and other expenses incurred by a person appointed as agent of the Governor to return fugitives from another state, such person is not acting as an officer of the court even though he is a sheriff or deputy sheriff.

       An assistant chief inspector of the Mississippi Marine Conservation Commission whose appointment was never submitted to or confirmed by the Senate as required by statute, was at most a de facto officer for the two years he worked for the Commission in that capacity, and when he was discharged by an order of the Commission, the Commission merely terminated the de facto status which required no action by the Governor or any hearing to remove the officer from an office he did not validly hold. Mississippi Marine Conservation Com. v. Misko, 347 So. 2d 355, 1977 Miss. LEXIS 2038 (Miss. 1977).

       When the office of chancellor has been filled by appointment in vacation of the senate and the appointee accepts, the whole power of the governor is exhausted; he cannot afterward remove the appointee and leave the office vacant or make room for another person.

      </h4>
      <p>
       Failure of state Senate to affirmatively act to confirm appointment properly before it constitutes refusal to consent under applicable statute; thus, appointment is annulled, and office becomes vacant. White, April 18, 1991, A.G. Op. #91-0289.
      </p>
      <p>
       No provision in Sections 7-1-35 or 47-5-24 provide for an interim appointment of a Commissioner of Corrections. The statutes make no distinction between an interim appointment and a permanent appointment and, in fact, do not contemplate two different types of appointment. Smith, February 16, 1995, A.G. Op. #95-0067.
      </p>
      <p>
       The failure of the Senate to confirm an appointment constitutes a refusal to consent to the appointment. Under the provisions of Section 7-1-35 the appointment is therefore annulled from that date. Gordon, March 27, 1996, A.G. Op. #96-0214.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Governor cannot reappoint the same four candidates at the end of the legislative session and have them serve until the 1997 Regular Session of the Legislature. Such a course of action would run afoul of Section 7-1-35. Gordon, March 27, 1996, A.G. Op. #96-0214.
      </p>
      <p>
       Vacation appointments of members of the board of directors of the Health Care Trust Fund by the Governor, but returned by the Senate, were annulled, and these persons were no longer members of the board of directors and could not serve as such until their successors were appointed and confirmed. Bennett, Jan, 18, 2000, A.G. Op. #2000-0030.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a vacancy on the Mississippi Commission on Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks occurred during the session and not during the last five days of the session, the vacancy could not be filled by the governor’s appointment during the vacation of the senate. McArthur, III, Apr. 26, 2002, A.G. Op. #02-0241.
      </p>
      <p>
       Persons nominated for membership on the Mississippi Board of Medical Licensure, whose names were returned by the Senate to the Governor, are no longer members of the board and may not serve in any capacity as board members. Burnett, Feb. 13, 2004, A.G. Op. 04-0063.

     <p>
      The Department of Finance and Administration shall have the following powers and duties with regard to federal-state programs:
     </p>
     <p>
      Provide assistance to state departments, agencies and institutions in the development of federal programs and, whenever possible, to local agencies, so that the people of Mississippi can be assured of a fair, efficient and coordinated planning and administration of these programs. The department shall inform the Governor of the fiscal requirements of the state departments, agencies and institutions for these programs so that a comprehensive plan can be developed which will be responsive to state needs and priorities. The Department of Finance and Administration is hereby authorized to receive and expend funds that have been appropriated by the Legislature in accordance with law for coordinating federal programs and for providing technical assistance to state and local agencies administering those programs. All state departments, agencies and institutions shall cooperate with the department by providing information and assistance when requested.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Department of Finance and Administration is hereby authorized to cooperate with or, with approval of the Governor, enter into any agreements with any agency, department, official, educational institution or political subdivision of this state, any agency or official of the government of the United States of America, or any private person for and on behalf of any delivery agency, in order to carry out the provisions of Section 7-1-251 et seq. The delivery of services for the programs known as “federal-state programs” shall be carried out by the state delivery agencies as assigned by the Executive Director of the Department of Finance and Administration, or as specified by law.
     </p>
     <p>
      The department is hereby authorized, with the approval of the Governor, to charge reasonable application fees in the administration of the Federal Low-Income Housing Tax Credit Program established by Title II of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, P.L. 99-514. The department is further authorized and empowered to escalate its budget authority based on any such fees generated. In the event that the government of the state is reorganized so as to provide that an agency other than the department shall administer the Federal Low-Income Housing Tax Credit Program, the authority granted by this paragraph shall be transferred to such successor agency.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Department of Finance and Administration is authorized to promulgate such reasonable rules and regulations as may be necessary to implement the provisions of Section 7-1-251 et seq., complying with the provisions of Section 25-43-1 et seq.

      <p>
       Filing of annual reports by elected officials is not complete if an officer fails to file a copy of his report with the appropriate board of supervisors, and the Secretary of State, upon notification by a board of supervisors that an officer has failed to file the required copy, can initiate penalty proceedings. Griffin, Feb. 12, 1992, A.G. Op. #91-0957.
      </p>
      <p>
       Filing required by Section 7-3-45 is incomplete if public officer charged with filing appropriate report failed to file copy of report with his particular board of supervisors and penalties set forth in statute would apply to those who fail or refuse to file required forms with county board of supervisors. Norton, Feb. 2, 1994, A.G. Op. #93-0950.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since Section 7-3-45 requires that officer’s annual report be submitted to Secretary of State no later than April 15, it is corollary requirement that sworn and signed copy of report also be submitted to county board of supervisors no later than April 15 of each year.

       Representation of a judge as a public official was within the authority of the Attorney General of Mississippi. The trial court did not commit manifest error in finding that no evidence existed in the record to demonstrate either the existence of an actual attorney-client relationship between a conservator and the Attorney General or that a substantial relationship existed between the mishandling of a conservatorship and the Attorney General’s defense of the judge, a current public official, in the civil lawsuit brought by the conservator.

   Where the Mississippi State Board for Community and Junior Colleges (SBCJC) filed suit after the Mississippi Board of Trustees of State Institutions of Higher Learning (IHL) created a full four year university, the Mississippi Supreme Court held that the suit against the IHL was procedurally barred under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t07c05s7-5-1" target="_self">7-5-1</a></cite> because the SBCJC did not receive consent from the attorney general to file suit.

       If Attorney General declines to file suit referred to him by state agency such as State Ethics Commission, where matter is of serious concern to state government, then that agency, if it determines its duties and responsibilities to so require, is at least entitled to have some court pass upon whether it should have its full day in court; if court determines that subject matter of litigation is one which agency is called upon to protect and enforce, agency should have full day in court, including right to legal representation; Attorney General’s refusal to represent agency does not deprive court of authority to keep jurisdiction and entertain action; in event of disagreement, court and not Attorney General should make final determination as to whether or not agency is carrying out lawful functions for which it was created. Frazier v. State, 504 So. 2d 675, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2394 (Miss. 1987).

       Attorney General’s refusal to bring suit against private contractor for municipal separate school district for alleged damages resulting from the alleged faulty construction of a district’s school building does not deprive the school of the right to bring the action and the Attorney General is warranted in refusing to bring the action where the subject matter of the allegations applies solely to one isolated contract on a single school building. Grenada Municipal Separate School Dist. v. Jesco, Inc., 449 So. 2d 226, 1984 Miss. LEXIS 1707 (Miss. 1984).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   A school district was expressly and impliedly, both by statute and case law, authorized to file and pursue a claim for damages resulting from the alleged faulty construction of a school building against the contractor, the architect, the bonding company, the subcontractors, and the furnishers of building materials, under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.11.html#t11c45s11-45-11" target="_blank">11-45-11</a></cite>, since the district had responsibility for the erection, repairing and equipping of school facilities pursuant to §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.37.html#t37c07s37-7-619" target="_blank">37-7-619</a></cite> [Repealed], and since §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t07c05s7-5-1" target="_self">7-5-1</a></cite> did not require that the action be brought by the Attorney General, in that the subject matter of the allegations was an isolated contract and its alleged breach resulting in a defective school roof, which was hardly a matter of state-wide interest. Grenada Municipal Separate School Dist. v. Jesco, Inc., 449 So. 2d 226, 1984 Miss. LEXIS 1707 (Miss. 1984).

       The Attorney General was authorized to assume control of the defense of a racial discrimination suit against the Board of Trustees of State Institutions of Higher Learning and the entire state university and college system, and the Board was without power to engage private counsel to represent its interests independently.

       This section is not unconstitutional for lack of standards, nor does it vest in the attorney general arbitrary power too vague or unreviewable by courts to survive constitutional scrutiny.

       The Attorney General is clothed with full authority to represent the state in a suit against members of a county board of supervisors for the recovery of misappropriated funds. State ex rel. Patterson v. Warren, 254 Miss. 293, 180 So. 2d 293, 1966 Miss. LEXIS 1592 (Miss. 1966).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Attorney General, chairman of the Mississippi Tax Commission, the state land commissioner, the chancery clerk, and tax collector and the board of supervisors of Wayne County had the authority and the power to appear in the bankruptcy proceedings against a foreign corporation in federal district court for Arkansas district and present the tax claims for adjudication and payment, provided that the time for redeeming the land from the tax sale had not expired when these proceedings took place. Crowe v. Fotiades, 224 Miss. 422, 80 So. 2d 478, 1955 Miss. LEXIS 506 (Miss. 1955), overruled in part, PMZ Oil Co. v. Lucroy, 449 So. 2d 201, 1984 Miss. LEXIS 1676 (Miss. 1984).
      </p>
      <p>
       The attorney general is a constitutional officer possessed of all the power and authority vested in such an official at common law, and, in addition, such as have been conferred upon him by statute, including the right to institute, conduct, and maintain all suits necessary for the enforcement of the laws of the state, the preservation of order, and protection of public rights, which right is not confined to enforcement of the criminal laws but applies also to all matters of state-wide public interest in any of the courts of the state. Dunn Const. Co. v. Craig, 191 Miss. 682, 2 So. 2d 166, 3 So. 2d 834, 1941 Miss. LEXIS 127 (Miss. 1941).
      </p>
      <p>
       The attorney general was the proper officer to bring a suit on behalf of the state to recover for wrongful removal of sand and gravel from tide water lands, and judgment of dismissal in a former action involving the same subject matter brought by the state tax collector did not constitute res judicata, or estop the attorney general since the tax collector was not authorized to bring such suit. State ex rel. Rice v. Stewart, 184 Miss. 202, 184 So. 44, 1938 Miss. LEXIS 306 (Miss. 1938).
      </p>
      <p>
       State revenue agent suing on behalf of county represented county in all phases of litigation and was bound to represent it as to any offset or counterclaim unless the court authorized some other officer to appear in the county’s behalf. Robertson v. Bank of Batesville, 116 Miss. 501, 77 So. 318, 1917 Miss. LEXIS 335 (Miss. 1917).

       Representation of a judge as a public official was within the authority of the Attorney General of Mississippi. The trial court did not commit manifest error in finding that no evidence existed in the record to demonstrate either the existence of an actual attorney-client relationship between a conservator and the Attorney General or that a substantial relationship existed between the mishandling of a conservatorship and the Attorney General’s defense of the judge, a current public official, in the civil lawsuit brought by the conservator.

       To fund the Insurance Integrity Enforcement Bureau, the Workers’ Compensation Commission may assess each workers’ compensation carrier and self-insurer, in the manner provided in Section 71-3-99, an amount based upon the proportion that the total gross claims for compensation and medical services and supplies paid by such carrier or self-insurer during the preceding one-year period bore to the total gross claims for compensation and medical services and supplies paid by all carriers and self-insurers during such period. The total amount assessed and collected by the commission from all workers’ compensation carriers and self-insurers used to fund the Insurance Integrity Enforcement Bureau during each fiscal year shall be based upon the recommendation of the Insurance Integrity Enforcement Bureau, but shall not exceed One Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($150,000.00). The funds received from the assessment in this subsection (1) shall be used primarily for the purpose of investigating and prosecuting workers’ compensation fraud.

      The State Fiscal Officer shall issue disbursement warrants upon satisfactory pre-audit as prescribed by standards and procedures established by the State Fiscal Officer in consultation with the State Auditor’s office. Such standards and procedures shall include examination of the bill, invoice, account, payroll or other evidence of the claim, demand or charge and determination that the expenditure or disbursement is regular, legal and correct, and that the claim, demand or charge has not been previously paid. In order to ascertain that goods have been received or services rendered, the State Fiscal Officer may require such evidence as the circumstances may demand. If the expenditure or disbursement is proper, the State Fiscal Officer shall approve the same; otherwise, the State Fiscal Officer shall withhold approval. In order that such regularity and legality may appear, the State Fiscal Officer may return the claim to the department, institution or agency against which the same was issued for correction or amendment and may, by general rule or special order, require such certification or such evidence as the circumstances may demand.

     <p>
      A reasonable petty cash fund shall be allowed each state department, institution, board, commission or other agency if, in the judgment of the State Fiscal Officer, such is necessary for the proper operation of the fiscal affairs thereof. The amount of such petty cash fund shall be fixed by the State Fiscal Officer in each case, but these funds shall be reimbursed only upon vouchers audited by the State Fiscal Officer. It shall not be lawful for any petty cash fund to be used for cashing checks or otherwise advancing funds to any officer or employee of any state department or agency.

     <p>
      The State Fiscal Officer may by regulation provide for the establishment of commercial bank accounts by any state agency, which shall serve as the depository for self-generated funds and custodial funds not required by law to be deposited in the State Treasury. The regulations may provide for such accounts to be used for disbursements not required to be made by warrants on the State Treasury. Each such account established shall have a maximum balance to be fixed by the State Fiscal Officer. All such accounts shall bear interest. For self-generated funds, the interest shall be deposited in the General Fund and for custodial funds, the interest shall be deposited in the custodial bank account. The State Auditor shall test for compliance with this section in any postaudit, and may, after notice and hearing, levy a civil penalty not to exceed One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00) for any violation hereof. The auditor shall annually report all violations of this section to the Governor and the Legislature.

      It shall be the duty of the state auditor to investigate the books, accounts, and vouchers of all fiscal officers and depositories of the state and of every county, levee board, and taxing district of every kind, and to sue for, collect, and pay over all money improperly withheld by such fiscal officer or depository.

If he shall examine the books, accounts, and vouchers of any fiscal officer or depository of the state, county, levee board, or taxing district of any kind and find them correct, he shall give a certificate to that effect to such officer and to the board of supervisors of the proper county, or to the proper levee board, or other taxing district.

If sufficient resources are available, the State Auditor shall maintain an official Web site and provide public access to copies of audit reports of state and local government entities receiving funds from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, the federal RESTORE Act, the Gulf Environmental Benefit Fund, and fees derived from the Natural Resource Damage Assessment pursuant to the 2010 Deepwater Horizon explosion and oil spill, and their successors. The State Auditor shall have the authority to recover costs associated with auditing and investigating such projects and funds within the limits of federal law from any such entity that receives such funds. In addition, the State Auditor shall have the authority to contract with qualified certified public accounting firms to perform selected engagements under this section, if funds are made available for such contracts by the Legislature, the governmental entities covered by this section or by the federal government.

Monies deposited into the fund shall be disbursed, in the discretion of the State Auditor, to pay the allowable costs of additional preaudit, postaudit, investigative, or other allowable or accountability requirements not funded through regular appropriations or special fund billing provided in this section. Monies in the special fund may be used to reimburse reasonable actual and necessary costs incurred by the State Auditor to accomplish objectives under this section. The State Auditor shall maintain a specific accounting of actual costs incurred for each project for which reimbursements are sought and shall provide a report to the Legislature within sixty (60) days from the end of each fiscal year regarding the nature and amounts of all expenditures.

   In an action to hold county supervisors personally liable for unauthorized expenditures of county funds, the chancery court properly overruled defendants’ demurrer to the complaint where the suit, filed by virtue of this section, alleged that defendants were liable under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.19.html#t19c13s19-13-37" target="_blank">19-13-37</a></cite> [Repealed], which provides for a taxpayers suit against officials who misappropriate funds.

       No particular form of demand upon a county board of supervisors for payment into the county treasury of misappropriated funds is required by this section [Code 1942, § 3877-05], provided it notifies the persons to whom it is addressed of the alleged improper expenditures and gives them an opportunity to perform their duties as to them.

      </p>
      <p>
       The State Auditor has authority to utilize Section 7-7-211 to recover costs for the failure or refusal of a municipality to submit an annual audit if and when the payment of the cost of the audit to the Department of Audit was improperly withheld by the governing authority of the municipality.

      </p>
      <p>

In the instance of electronic transfer of funds, the Treasurer shall provide the State Fiscal Officer the same information as would be required for a requisition and issuance of a warrant. In the instance of receipt, disbursement and transfer between State Treasury accounts, the State Fiscal Officer shall maintain the same information as would be required if an application for a receipt warrant, a requisition for issuance for warrant and a warrant had been issued.

The State Treasurer is authorized and directed to receive on State Fiscal Officer’s pay warrant any and all funds above specified and to be credited, each fund to a trust account for which the donor intends it. The special trust account shall designate for what purpose it is donated, and the State Fiscal Officer’s books and Treasurer’s books shall carry it as such. All funds shall be paid out on requisition signed by the proper agent or agents, properly supported by itemized vouchers, designated so to do on a warrant issued by the State Fiscal Officer upon the State Treasurer. Funds intended to be controlled by this section are those coming from the federal government, foundations and individuals to be expended for educational purposes, roads, agriculture, for making economic or social surveys, and for similar purposes. In no way shall this section interfere with or prevent the purpose of the donor. The state agent or official best fitted or qualified to direct the expenditure of a fund for a specified purpose or the official designated by the donor shall expend the funds, and is hereby given authority in the manner outlined herein.

       Members of the board of barber examiners are state officers, and their offices are state offices, and therefore the state auditor had the right to maintain suit upon the bond of the secretary of the board for the alleged misapplication of funds of the board.

   Motion to remand was granted because under Miss. Code Ann. §§<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t07c11s7-11-11" target="_self">7-11-11</a></cite> and<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.29.html#t29c03s29-3-1" target="_blank">29-3-1</a></cite> it was without question that the Mississippi secretary of state and the public school district were necessary parties to the quiet title action that involved 16th section school lands. As such, complete diversity did not exist. Clark Techs., LLC v. Hood, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 75318 (S.D. Miss. Aug. 14, 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Secretary of State had a clear interest in the property, and pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t07c11s7-11-11" target="_self">7-11-11</a></cite>, which enumerated the duties and powers of the Secretary of State, the property was to come under the Secretary of State’s charge once the redemption period was over, and this entitled the Secretary of State to be recognized in the eminent domain proceedings; if the Department of Finance and Administration had strictly followed the procedural requirements of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.11.html#t11c27s11-27-7" target="_blank">11-27-7</a></cite>, it would have named the Secretary of State as a defendant. Smith v. Jackson State Univ., 995 So. 2d 88, 2008 Miss. LEXIS 454 (Miss. 2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       Even though the estate retained a right of possession and redemption – the fee passed to the State of Mississippi on August 28, 2000, and the State became the owner of the land, and after the sale and during the time allowed for redemption, the State possessed an inchoate title to the land, and after the redemption period was over, the Secretary of State had charge of the lands forfeited to the state for nonpayment of taxes. Smith v. Jackson State Univ., 995 So. 2d 88, 2008 Miss. LEXIS 454 (Miss. 2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       Despite the approval from the Mississippi Gaming Commission for a site for gaming, the Secretary of State’s decision to deny the public trust tidelands lease was made within the discretion granted to him; the Secretary of State had the final decision-making authority concerning the proposed public trust tidelands lease, and the Secretary of State had the responsibility of preserving the public trust tidelands for the people of the State of Mississippi. Columbia Land Dev., LLC v. Sec'y of State, 868 So. 2d 1006, 2004 Miss. LEXIS 286 (Miss. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       The policy of the state is to encourage the development of public utilities by affording them the right to place their lines along streets and highways. City Council of Greenville v. Thomas, 241 Miss. 633, 131 So. 2d 659, 1961 Miss. LEXIS 382 (Miss. 1961).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a statute granted the right to build and construct a pipeline across public lands, the phrase public lands includes sixteenth section school lands. Willmut Gas & Oil Co. v. Covington County, 221 Miss. 613, 71 So. 2d 184, 1954 Miss. LEXIS 569 (Miss. 1954).
      </p>
      <p>
       The purpose which the legislature had in granting to public utilities the right to construct pipelines across sixteenth section lands is consistent with other analogous legislative grants. Willmut Gas & Oil Co. v. Covington County, 221 Miss. 613, 71 So. 2d 184, 1954 Miss. LEXIS 569 (Miss. 1954).
      </p>
      <p>
       Sale of leasehold estate of sixteenth section lands to the state for nonpayment of taxes merged the unexpired term thereof in the greater fee simple title of the state and extinguished it, so that the state land commissioner was without power to sell such leasehold and issue a patent therefor, his power over such lands under this section [Code 1942, § 4070] being merely supervisory. McCullen v. Mercer, 192 Miss. 547, 6 So. 2d 465, 1942 Miss. LEXIS 38 (Miss. 1942).
      </p>
      <p>
       Jurisdiction over state tide-water lands to sustain an action to recover for removal of sand and gravel therefrom is vested in the state attorney-general by reason of his statutory and common-law authority to represent the sovereign in the enforcement of its laws and protection of public rights, and not in the state land commissioner. State ex rel. Rice v. Stewart, 184 Miss. 202, 184 So. 44, 1938 Miss. LEXIS 306 (Miss. 1938).

       The Secretary of State may impose regulations, consistent with other laws of the state, regarding the lease of the tidelands, and such regulations may include prohibitions against certain activities or businesses, including gaming activities, if the Secretary of State makes the determination that such activity is injurious to the tidelands at a particular site.

     <p>
      The Secretary of State shall secure a sufficient number of suitable and well bound books for each county, so that the lands now or hereafter owned by the state may be complied therein. The books, in addition to the necessary columns on which to list all necessary information with reference to the lands owned, shall contain a column on which to number all patents or contracts issued and any other information. The order of arrangement and all other matters pertaining thereto are hereby specifically left to the discretion of the Secretary of State.
     </p>
     <p>
      In addition to the foregoing records, the Secretary of State shall provide and cause to be kept a separate register of the several different classes of lands, with appropriate references to other records or documents for information concerning the whole class, and of each parcel, if need be. He may cause correct township maps to be prepared from the field notes of original surveys, with all errors in the location of natural objects, if any there be, corrected, which maps may be supplied to the several counties at reasonable prices; and he may, in like manner, have maps and plats lithographed and sold.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Secretary of State shall procure a sufficient number of forms of certificates which shall be used by the chancery clerks of each of the various counties in certifying to the Secretary of State’s office lands sold to the state for unpaid taxes in his county, and the Secretary of State shall provide such certificates in such form that they may be bond by him and used as a part of the permanent records of his office. The said chancery clerks shall use only such forms of certificates in certifying said lands to the Secretary of State’s office, and failure to do so shall subject such chancery clerk so refusing or failing to do so, and his bondsman, to a penalty of five hundred dollars ($500.00), which penalty shall be collected by the Attorney General in a suit therefor filed in the name of the State of Mississippi. Such certificates, before being filed by the Secretary of State, shall be examined by the Attorney General. The Secretary of State, with the approval of the Attorney General, shall strike from such certificates all lands which, by reason of insufficient description or other cause, in the opinion of the Attorney General are not the property of the state; and the title of the state to such lands as may be thus stricken off shall be thereby relinquished.

       § 7-17-37.
    Procedures for eliminating and filling personnel positions; benefit rights of terminated employees.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Upon the decision by a department executive director to eliminate a personnel position, the executive director shall notify the State Personnel Board and the affected employee of the intention to eliminate the position. No employee shall be required to vacate an eliminated position prior to sixty (60) days from the date notice is sent to that employee.
     </p>
     <p>
      Executive directors hiring personnel to fill existing vacant positions shall first interview persons placed on the reduction in force list maintained by the State Personnel Board to fill positions for which they are qualified. If the executive director does not hire a person on the reduction in force list for a position for which he interviewed and is qualified, the executive director shall provide justification upon request by the interviewed person or the State Personnel Board.
     </p>
     <p>
      If an employee whose position is terminated by virtue of the executive branch reorganization brought about by “the Mississippi Executive Reorganization Act of 1989 [Laws, 1989, Chapter 544]” is rehired by the State of Mississippi within three (3) years from the date of his termination, the employee shall have the same benefit date for leave accumulation purposes as he had when his position was terminated. Any accumulated leave benefits not given to the employee at the time his position was eliminated shall be restored to him upon his rehiring.
