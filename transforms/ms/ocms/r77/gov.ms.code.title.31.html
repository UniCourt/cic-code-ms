      <p>
       Subcontract was void because a subcontractor was required to have a current certificate of responsibility since the purpose of the subcontract was to clean sewer pipes to prepare for a slip-lining project, and it was a necessary part of the reconstruction, repair, maintenance, or repair work on a public project. The subcontractor could not prevail on a breach of contract case because the payment obligation under such a contract was void. Ace Pipe Cleaning, Inc. v. Hemphill Constr. Co., 134 So.3d 799, 2014 Miss. App. LEXIS 39 (Miss. Ct. App. 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       As the pipe cleaning a subcontractor performed was a necessary part of the reconstruction, repair, maintenance, or related work on a public project, it was required to have a certificate of responsibility; as it did not, its subcontract with a general contractor was void and could not support claims of breach of contract or quantuum meruit.

      </h4>
      <p>
       Since the term “public funds” defined in this section is extremely broad and includes all state and other governmental type funding, there could be instances where such commercial construction projects would be publicly funded and thus would fall within the exclusion. Brooks, December 3, 1996, A.G. Op. #96-0727.
      </p>
      <p>
       The term “commercial construction project” as used by the Legislature is intended to describe projects that when completed will be used for commerce or trade (used to make income for the businesses located or using the project) and not residential homes or buildings for governmental type activities. Brooks, December 3, 1996, A.G. Op. #96-0727.
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   The removal of damaged limbs from trees located on public property is not work which falls within the definition of a “public project” as defined in this section; thus, a licensed tree surgeon performing such work is not to be considered a “contractor” under this section and no certificate of responsibility pursuant to §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t31c03s31-3-15" target="_self">31-3-15</a></cite> is required prior to bidding on a public contract for these services.
   Bowman, April 30, 1999, A.G. Op. #99-0185.
      </p>
      <p>
       A school district is clearly a “public agency” and is thereby excluded from the definition of “person;” thus, since school districts are excluded from the definition of “person,” school districts are also excluded from the definition of “contractor.” Gifford, May 14, 1999, A.G. Op. #99-0226.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maintenance of a beach, consisting of picking up garbage, running sand sweepers to sift rubbish from the sand, and occasionally setting out plants, is analogous to janitorial work in a building and does not require a certificate of responsibility as contemplated in Sections 31-3-1 et seq. Meadows, Oct. 26, 2001, A.G. Op. #01-0663.
      </p>
      <p>
       A cabin at a publicly owned facility is not a residential project as contemplated in subsection (d). Rayner, Oct. 26, 2001, A.G. Op. #01-0672.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Port Authority does not have to require a certificate of responsibility for demolition contractors to bid on public projects; however, in its discretion, it may require contractors to have a certificate of responsibility prior to bidding on such projects. Hunter, May 3, 2002, A.G. Op. #02-0207.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the term “contractor” is used in this chapter, it includes those individuals working on public projects for fire protection systems of $ 5,000.00 or more, and on private projects for the sum of $ 10,000.00 or more; thus, those individuals would be required to obtain a certificate of responsibility. Cardin, Oct. 11, 2002, A.G. Op. #02-0581.
      </p>
      <p>
       Prior opinion (A.G.Op., Hunter, May 3, 2002), stating that a certificate of responsibility is not required for a demolition contractor, affirmed. Cardin, Nov. 15, 2002, A.G. Op. #02-0662.
      </p>
      <p>
       The requirement of Section 31-3-1 that a contractor have a valid certificate of responsibility is separate and distinct from the requirement imposed by Section 73-13-45 mandating engineering or architectural services on public construction projects. Elliot, Jan. 10, 2003, A.G. Op. #02-0768.
      </p>
      <p>
       A bidder merely offering to sell the materials for an automatic meter reading system, together with providing technical support via the telephone, email, etc., would not fall within the definition of a contractor under this section and would not be required to have a certificate of responsibility. Gabriel, Jan. 28, 2005, A.G. Op. 05-0012.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where there are multiple contracts for one project, the entire project cost as to the contractor in question should be used in determining whether that contractor is required to hold a certificate of responsibility. Thomas, Oct. 27, 2006, A.G. Op. 06-0472.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 31-3-1 does not require a certificate of responsibility be obtained by an owner performing work on a commercial building where the work is less than $100,000. Thomas, Oct. 27, 2006, A.G. Op. 06-0472.
      </p>
      <p>
       Counties and municipalities may require local licensing of contractors, regardless of whether those contractors hold state licenses or certificates of responsibility. Thomas, Oct. 27, 2006, A.G. Op. 06-0472.
      </p>
      <p>
       An owner of a commercial building may obtain a local building permit, assuming he meets the requirements for same, and serve as general contractor or perform the work himself on a private project that is under $100,000. Thomas, Oct. 27, 2006, A.G. Op. 06-0472.

       Company was not estopped from denying the existence of a contract because the contract between the company and a subcontractor had been declared void under the statute; thus, quasi-estoppel did not apply because the company did not have the right to accept or reject the transaction since the subcontract was void and unlawful. Ground Control, LLC v. Capsco Indus., 214 So.3d 232, 2017 Miss. LEXIS 93 (Miss. 2017).
      </p>
      <p>
       Subcontract was void because a subcontractor was required to have a current certificate of responsibility since the purpose of the subcontract was to clean sewer pipes to prepare for a slip-lining project, and it was a necessary part of the reconstruction, repair, maintenance, or repair work on a public project. The subcontractor could not prevail on a breach of contract case because the payment obligation under such a contract was void. Ace Pipe Cleaning, Inc. v. Hemphill Constr. Co., 134 So.3d 799, 2014 Miss. App. LEXIS 39 (Miss. Ct. App. 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although appellant’s construction contract with appellee was void due to appellant’s failure to obtain a certificate of responsibility, as appellee knew appellant lacked the certificate but solicited it to enter into the illegal contract, appellant was not barred from recovery under theories of unjust enrichment or quantum meruit. Ground Control, LLC v. Capsco Indus., 120 So.3d 365, 2013 Miss. LEXIS 327 (Miss. 2013).

   In a case in which a wastewater services company challenged a utility authority’s award of a contract to another company for the operation and management of the authority’s wastewater facility, the wastewater services company argued unsuccessfully that the contract was void because the company that was awarded the contract did not have a certificate of responsibility, as required by Miss. Code Ann. §§<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t31c03s31-3-15" target="_self">31-3-15</a></cite> and<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t31c03s31-3-21ol11" target="_self">31-3-21(1)</a></cite>. There was no authority to support the conclusion that successful company was required to have a certificate of responsibility to operate and manage a wastewater facility and interceptor system; it was evident from the Request for Proposals and the proposals submitted that the operation and management of the facility was the major component of the project, not its maintenance. Wastewater Plant Serv. Co. v. Harrison County Util. Auth., 28 So.3d 686, 2010 Miss. App. LEXIS 97 (Miss. Ct. App. 2010).

   Under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t31c03s31-3-15" target="_self">31-3-15</a></cite>, the contractor did not have the appropriate certificate for the work it contracted to perform, and therefore, the contract between the contractor and daycare center was null and void, and any contractual obligations the bank owed the subcontractors were also void.

   While employees of the contractor both claimed to have held a Florida specialty license for signs, no proof of licensing in Mississippi was forthcoming, and the record provided no insight into whether the Florida specialty license was accompanied by a certificate of responsibility or whether such a certificate, if present, would be recognized in Mississippi under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t31c03s31-3-15" target="_self">31-3-15</a></cite>; therefore, additional genuine issues of material fact existed regarding the validity of the contractor’s contracts with the subcontractors.

      <p>
       Local commission argued that it in good faith believed that the contractor which was awarded the contract possessed the requisite certificate to complete the project. The contractor submitted certificate numbers on its bid envelope but because the record did not contain adequate information on the contractor certificates submitted to the commission on the project in question, the appellate court would not consider whether or not the contractor was qualified to perform project work.

       Where the Board of Contractors, within its statutory authority, has determined that a classification of work does not require a certificate of responsibility, then the section does not prevent a contract being issued to a bidder on a public or private contract involving work in which a certificate of responsibility is not necessary.

       Federal court would not abstain from determining validity of arbitration agreement embodied in contract issued to defendant Florida contractor who had failed to obtain certificate of responsibility required by Mississippi statute, since arbitration was mandatory and no extraordinary conflicts between federal and state interests which might necessitate abstention were foreseen.

       Trial court properly limited the issue at trial to a subcontractor’s claim for quantum meruit damages because under the law of the case doctrine, it was bound to follow the mandate on remand that the subcontractor could pursue that non-barred claim; reference to “other penalties” did not open the door for the subcontractor to recover under other theories because it merely provided the trial court discretion to consider whether other statutory penalties applied.

     <p>
      There is hereby levied, in addition to any taxes otherwise provided for by law, a special privilege license tax of Two Hundred Dollars ($200.00) on each contractor who applies for a certificate of responsibility issued under this chapter; and such tax shall be paid to the executive director of the board upon making such application in this state. The board may levy an additional special privilege license tax not to exceed One Hundred Dollars ($100.00) for each additional classification for which a contractor applies and is found to be qualified. The executive director of the board shall promptly deposit all monies received under this chapter in the State Treasury. Except for the civil penalty provided in Section 31-3-21 which shall be deposited into the State General Fund and the fee provided in Section 31-3-14, all monies received under this chapter shall be kept in a special fund in the State Treasury known as the “State Board of Contractors Fund,” and shall be used only for the purposes of this chapter. Such monies shall not lapse at the end of each fiscal year, but all monies in such State Board of Contractors Fund in excess of the sum of fifty percent (50%) of the approved budget for the fiscal year shall be paid over into the General Fund of the State Treasury. All expenditures from the Board of Contractors Fund shall be by requisition to the State Auditor, signed by the executive director of the board and countersigned by the chairman or vice chairman of the board, and the State Treasurer shall issue warrants thereon.

    Editor's Notes—
   
   There appears to be a conflict in the language of §§<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t31c03s31-3-17" target="_self">31-3-17</a></cite> and<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t31c03s31-3-21" target="_self">31-3-21</a></cite> regarding the disposition of the civil penalties for violations of this chapter. Section<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t31c03s31-3-17" target="_self">31-3-17</a></cite> provides that the civil penalty provided in this section is to be deposited into the State General Fund, while subsection (4) of this section provides that the civil penalty is to be deposited into the State Board of Contractors Fund.

   In a case in which a wastewater services company challenged a utility authority’s award of a contract to another company for the operation and management of the authority’s wastewater facility, the wastewater services company argued unsuccessfully that the contract was void because the company that was awarded the contract did not have a certificate of responsibility, as required by Miss. Code Ann. §§<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t31c03s31-3-15" target="_self">31-3-15</a></cite> and<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t31c03s31-3-21ol11" target="_self">31-3-21(1)</a></cite>. There was no authority to support the conclusion that successful company was required to have a certificate of responsibility to operate and manage a wastewater facility and interceptor system; it was evident from the Request for Proposals and the proposals submitted that the operation and management of the facility was the major component of the project, not its maintenance. Wastewater Plant Serv. Co. v. Harrison County Util. Auth., 28 So.3d 686, 2010 Miss. App. LEXIS 97 (Miss. Ct. App. 2010).
      </p>
      <p>
       Local commission argued that it in good faith believed that the contractor which was awarded the contract possessed the requisite certificate to complete the project. The contractor submitted certificate numbers on its bid envelope but because the record did not contain adequate information on the contractor certificates submitted to the commission on the project in question, the appellate court would not consider whether or not the contractor was qualified to perform project work. W & W Contrs., Inc. v. Tunica County Airport Comm'n, 881 So. 2d 358, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 858 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       The statute clearly and unambiguously states that a bid may not be opened, considered or awarded to a contractor who fails to include the certificate of responsibility number on the exterior of the envelope except when a bid for a public project is not in excess of $50,000.00, or not in excess of $100,000.00 for a private project. City of Durant v. Laws Constr. Co., 721 So. 2d 598, 1998 Miss. LEXIS 391 (Miss. 1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       Federal court would not abstain from determining validity of arbitration agreement embodied in contract issued to defendant Florida contractor who had failed to obtain certificate of responsibility required by Mississippi statute, since arbitration was mandatory and no extraordinary conflicts between federal and state interests which might necessitate abstention were foreseen. Timberton Golf, L.P. v. McCumber Constr., Inc., 788 F. Supp. 919, 1992 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5291 (S.D. Miss. 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       Failure of Florida corporation to obtain certificate of responsibility in Mississippi under Mississippi law did not render invalid arbitration agreement embodied in contract to develop golf course, even though Mississippi statute provided that contract awarded without certificate of responsibility is null and void. Timberton Golf, L.P. v. McCumber Constr., Inc., 788 F. Supp. 919, 1992 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5291 (S.D. Miss. 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       In action involving contract with Florida corporation for development of golf course, plaintiff failed to establish substantial likelihood of prevailing on merits in respect to argument that no arbitration agreement existed between contracting parties, thus preliminary injunction would not be granted against arbitration. Timberton Golf, L.P. v. McCumber Constr., Inc., 788 F. Supp. 919, 1992 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5291 (S.D. Miss. 1992).

   Municipality’s minority business utilization “set-aside” plan which, by ordinance, requires non-minority-owned prime contractors awarded city construction contracts to subcontract at least 30 percent of dollar amount of contract to one or more minority business enterprises violates equal protection clause of Fourteenth Amendment because, inter alia, random inclusion of racial groups which may never have suffered from discrimination in city’s construction industry suggests city’s purpose as not to remedy past discrimination, and 30 percent set-aside is not narrowly tailored to remedy effects of any prior alleged discrimination. Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., <cite class="us_code">488 U.S. 469</cite>, <cite class="s_court">109 S. Ct. 706</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">102 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 854, 1989 U.S. LEXIS 579 (U.S. 1989).

       Trial court properly limited the issue at trial to a subcontractor’s claim for quantum meruit damages because under the law of the case doctrine, it was bound to follow the mandate on remand that the subcontractor could pursue that non-barred claim; reference to “other penalties” did not open the door for the subcontractor to recover under other theories because it merely provided the trial court discretion to consider whether other statutory penalties applied. Ground Control, LLC v. Capsco Indus., 214 So.3d 232, 2017 Miss. LEXIS 93 (Miss. 2017).

       Though appellant’s competitor, a Mississippi company, had not been entitled to a statutory preference since Alabama treated nonresident contractors in the same manner that Mississippi treated nonresident contractors, because the competitor’s residence played only a minor part in the school board’s decison to award the contract to the competitor, the award was not disturbed on appeal. Rod Cooke Constr. Co. v. Lamar County Sch. Bd., 135 So.3d 902, 2013 Miss. App. LEXIS 641 (Miss. Ct. App. 2013), cert. denied, 136 So.3d 437, 2014 Miss. LEXIS 204 (Miss. 2014).

       In a situation where requested bid bond was not included in sealed package as requested but was tendered prior to the time contractor’s bid was opened, the board of supervisors may legally waive the informality of the bid bond not being included in the sealed package and may proceed to consider the bid of that particular contractor.

       The Port Authority does not have to require a certificate of responsibility for demolition contractors to bid on public projects; however, in its discretion, it may require contractors to have a certificate of responsibility prior to bidding on such projects.

       Subsection (3) of this section concerns construction contracts and does require a nonresident bidder to attach a copy of its state’s current preference law to its bid for a relevant public project. Adams, Nov. 14, 2003, A.G. Op. 03-0618.

       If a School District determines that a foreign corporation meets the definition of a resident contractor, then that corporation would not be required to attach a copy of its state’s current bid preference law to its bid. Adams, Nov. 17, 2003, A.G. Op. 03-0596.

      <p>
       Whether bids are equal or substantially equal is a discretionary determination that the public body itself must initially make and that should be explained in the minutes. If it is determined that bids are or are not equal or substantially equal, then the statutory preference provisions in favor of Mississippi bidders apply or do not apply, respectively.

    Appeals.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Within ten (10) days after any order, judgment or action of the board, any person aggrieved thereby may appeal such order, judgment or action either to the chancery court of the county wherein the appellant resides or to the Chancery Court of the First Judicial District of Hinds County, Mississippi, upon giving bond with sufficient security in the amount of Two Hundred Fifty Dollars ($250.00), approved by the clerk of the chancery court and conditioned to pay any costs which may be adjudged against such person. In lieu of the bond, the appellant may post Two Hundred Fifty Dollars ($250.00) with the clerk of the chancery court and conditioned to pay any costs which may be adjudged against such person.
     </p>
     <p>
      Notice of appeal shall be filed in the office of the clerk of the chancery court, who shall issue a writ of certiorari directed to the board commanding it within forty-five (45) days after service thereof to certify to such court its entire record in the matter in which the appeal has been taken. The appeal shall thereupon be heard in due course by the court, and the court shall review the record and shall affirm or reverse the judgment. If the judgment is reversed, the chancery court or chancellor shall render such order or judgment as the board ought to have rendered, and certify the same to the board; and costs shall be awarded as in other cases.
     </p>
     <p>
      Appeals may be had to the Supreme Court of the State of Mississippi as provided by law from any final action of the chancery court. The board may employ counsel to defend such appeals, to be paid out of the funds in the State Board of Contractors Fund.
     </p>
     <p>
      On appeal, any order, judgment or action of the board revoking a certificate of responsibility or residential license shall remain in full force unless the chancery court or Supreme Court reverses such order, judgment or action of the board.
     </p>
     <p>
      The remedies provided under this chapter for any aggrieved person shall not be exclusive, but shall be cumulative of and supplemental to any other remedies which he may otherwise have in law or in equity, whether by injunction or otherwise.

     <p>
      When a contractor receives any payment under a public construction contract, the contractor shall, upon receipt of that payment, pay each subcontractor and material supplier in proportion to the percentage of work completed by each subcontractor and material supplier. If for any reason the contractor receives less than the full payment due under the public construction contract, the contractor shall be obligated to disburse on a pro rata basis those funds received, with the contractor, subcontractors and material suppliers each receiving a prorated portion based on the amount due on the payment. If the contractor without reasonable cause fails to make any payment to his subcontractors and material suppliers within fifteen (15) days after the receipt of payment under the public construction contract, the contractor shall pay to his subcontractors and material suppliers, in addition to the payment due them, a penalty in the amount of one-half of one percent (1/2 of 1%) per day of the delinquency, calculated from the expiration of the 15-day period until fully paid. The total penalty shall not exceed fifteen percent (15%) of the outstanding balance due.

       A contract clause, which operated to limit a contractor’s (or subcontractor’s) rights based on delay, was valid as drafted and was not void as against Mississippi public policy; the clause was not a hold-harmless clause, but rather detailed an agreement between sophisticated parties for remedying delay caused by an owner and merely allowed contractors to limit their losses from delay by seeking an extension of time. PYCA Indus., Inc. v. Harrison County Waste Water Mgmt. Dist., 177 F.3d 351, 1999 U.S. App. LEXIS 10872 (5th Cir. Miss. 1999).

       An agreement, whereby a contractor agreed to indemnify the owner of the premises against all personal injury actions incident to its performance of a construction contract at the premises, was not unenforceable under this section, which blocks indemnity for one’s own negligence, since the owner had been absolved of fault in the underlying personal injury action and thus was not seeking to recover for its own negligence.

       This section does not void paper company’s agreement to indemnify railroad where railroad did not undertake to construct or do anything for paper company regarding chip pit, and paper company was solely responsible for maintaining chip pit, where in 1979 supplemental agreement, paper company had undertaken to indemnify railroad for any loss caused by railroad’s “own negligence”.

       Contract between operator of paper mill and railroad company providing that paper mill shall maintain chippit underneath one of railroad’s sidetracks and that paper mill would indemnify railroad from any liability for personal injury that railroad might incur was not contract for railroad to construct or do anything for paper mill regarding chippit and thus this section did not void paper mill’s agreement to indemnify railroad.

       A license agreement between a cable television company which employed the injured claimant and a telephone company was not a “construction contract” within the meaning and prohibition of this section. Therefore, that section did not bar the telephone company from enforcing the indemnity provisions of its contract with the cable television company. Lorenzen v. South Cent. Bell Tel. Co., 546 F. Supp. 694, 1982 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15636 (S.D. Miss. 1982), aff'd, 701 F.2d 408, 1983 U.S. App. LEXIS 29323 (5th Cir. Miss. 1983).

       In a personal injury action brought by an insured employee against his employer, the trial court erred in dismissing the employer’s third-party complaint for indemnity against the independent contractor who had been engaged in installing a conveyer system at the time of the injury at issue, where the indemnity agreement between the parties, when read as a whole, could be read to indemnify the employer against losses incurred by it due to the contractor’s acts or negligence, a valid contract, and did not have to be read to protect only against liability because of the employer’s acts, a void contract. Ramsey v. Georgia-Pacific Corp., 597 F.2d 890, 1979 U.S. App. LEXIS 13709 (5th Cir. Miss. 1979).

       A contractual provision indemnifying defendant tire company from liability arising out of performance of work on its premises by a painting company was ineffective, in light of this statute, to shield defendant from liability to a paint company employee who was burned in a fire while painting on defendant’s premises and who alleged that defendant had provided an unsafe work place; no exception from the statute was available for parties of equal bargaining strength, there was no provision for contribution to the settlement burden by the painting company, subsection (b) of the statute, exempting insurance contracts, was not applicable since the contract at issue was an insured indemnity contract, and neither implied indemnity nor quasi contractual indemnity was available. Crosby v. General Tire & Rubber Co., 543 F.2d 1128, 1976 U.S. App. LEXIS 5864 (5th Cir. Ala. 1976).

       Where the surety was arguing that its bond obligation was discharged under the chancery court judgment, the appellate court concluded that it had no effect on the bond liability; to permit the chancery court to sub silentio nullify the surety’s bond obligation would be contrary to the very purpose of Mississippi’s Little Miller Act, which was to provide protection to subcontractors in the absence of lien rights.

       In an action by a prime contractor against the surety of another contractor, the trial court erred in sustaining the surety’s demurrur to the complaint where the complaint alleged that the second contractor had failed to coordinate its activities with the first contractor as required by their contracts with the State Building Commission and where the surety issued its performance-payment bond knowing that the second contractor had obligations to the other contractors, thus bringing the obligations of the first contractor within the terms of the bond; likewise, the court erred in sustaining the demurrer of the contractor to the surety’s counterclaim where the surety alleged that the contractor had breached its duties and obligations to the substituted prime contractor hired by the surety.

   Bankruptcy court denied an insurance company’s motion for summary judgment on a Mississippi limited liability company’s (“LLC’s) claim that it was entitled to payment of $135,766 under a bond the company issued to a general contractor because the general contractor did not pay the LLC for work it performed before it declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy.

       Statute of limitations contained in previous version of statute that guaranteed the right to file suit on payment bond within one year from date which Department of Transportation published notice of final settlement is substantive because the limitations period is “built-in” or a part of same enactment creating the right to sue on the bond; thus, the provisions could only be applied prospectively.

      Whenever any person supplying labor or material in the prosecution of the work brings an action on such payment bond and the trial judge finds that the defense raised to such action by the contractor or surety was not reasonable, or not in good faith, or merely for the purpose of delaying payment, then the trial judge may, in his discretion, award the claimant a reasonable amount to be determined by the trial judge as claimant’s attorney’s fees in bringing such successful action. Likewise, if the trial judge finds that such action was brought by claimant without just cause or in bad faith, the trial judge may, in his discretion, award the contractor or surety a reasonable amount to be determined by the trial judge as attorney’s fees for defending such action; provided, however, this section shall not affect the right of any person to recover attorney’s fees where provided by contract or bond.

   An award of “reasonable attorney’s fees” under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t31c05s31-5-57" target="_self">31-5-57</a></cite> requires proof. The court may not judicially note what is a reasonable fee and may not merely pull a figure out of thin air. Rather, the party entitled to recover a reasonable fee must furnish a evidentiary predicate therefore. Key Constructors, Inc. v. H &amp; M Gas Co., 537 So. 2d 1318, 1989 Miss. LEXIS 8 (Miss. 1989).

      </h4>
      <p>
       Award of attorneys’ fees based upon a quantum meruit claim in favor of the subcontractor was proper because the contractor delayed paying the subcontractor the remaining balance on its contract for no apparent reason. The contractor knew that the subcontractor was entitled to the money, but withheld the money and continued to do so; further, the contractor solicited and secured the subcontractor’s efforts to persuade the agency to release the retainage, inducing the subcontractor to believe that it would get its money when in fact the contractor had already assigned the entire retainage to its bank.

      <p>
       Amount of attorneys’ fees awarded in favor of the subcontractor were not excessive because the facts surrounding and concerning that portion of the subcontractor’s motion for attorneys’ fees relating to setting the amount of attorney’s fees justified the assessment of the fees in an amount that the trial judge found to have been reasonable and fair and that satisfied the requirements of law. The trial judge presided over a two-week trial in which numerous witnesses testified and more than 100 exhibits were received into evidence. Tupelo Redevelopment Agency v.

       Administration of public purchasing, administration of state employee’s group insurance program, and authority to approve rules adopted by the State Auditor for establishing a merit system for his employees, are administrative functions within the prerogative of the executive department, and thus, named legislators could not constitutionally perform any of those functions because they properly belonged to the executive department; moreover, the statutes vesting those powers in members of the legislature are unconstitutional.

In addition to its other powers and duties, the Department of Finance and Administration shall have the authority to develop a master lease-purchase program and, pursuant to that program, shall have the authority to execute on behalf of the state master lease-purchase agreements for equipment to be used by an agency, as provided in this section. Each agency electing to acquire equipment by a lease-purchase agreement shall participate in the Department of Finance and Administration’s master lease-purchase program, unless the Department of Finance and Administration makes a determination that such equipment cannot be obtained under the program or unless the equipment can be obtained elsewhere at an overall cost lower than that for which the equipment can be obtained under the program. Such lease-purchase agreements may include the refinancing or consolidation, or both, of any state agency lease-purchase agreements entered into after June 30, 1990.

       Upon final approval of an appropriation bill, each agency shall submit to the Public Procurement Review Board a schedule of proposed equipment acquisitions for the master lease-purchase program.

       Each master lease-purchase agreement, and any subsequent amendments, shall include such terms and conditions as the State Bond Commission shall determine to be appropriate and in the public interest, and may include any covenants deemed necessary or desirable to protect the interests of the lessor, including, but not limited to, provisions setting forth the interest rate (or method for computing interest rates) for financing pursuant to such agreement, covenants concerning application of payments and funds held in the Master Lease-Purchase Program Fund, covenants to maintain casualty insurance with respect to equipment subject to the master lease-purchase agreement (and all state agencies are specifically authorized to purchase any insurance required by a master lease-purchase agreement) and covenants precluding or limiting the right of the lessee or user to acquire equipment within a specified time (not to exceed five (5) years) after cancellation on the basis of a failure to appropriate funds for payment of amounts due under a lease-purchase agreement covering comparable equipment. The State Bond Commission shall transmit copies of each such master lease-purchase agreement and each such amendment to the Joint Legislative Budget Committee. To the extent provided in any master lease-purchase agreement, title to equipment leased pursuant thereto shall be deemed to be vested in the state or the user of the equipment (as specified in such master lease-purchase agreement), subject to default under or termination of such master lease-purchase agreement.
       <p>
        A master lease-purchase agreement may provide for payment by the lessor to the lessee of the purchase price of the equipment to be acquired pursuant thereto prior to the date on which payment is due to the vendor for such equipment and that the lease payments by the lessee shall commence as though the equipment had been provided on the date of payment. If the lessee, or lessee’s escrow agent, has sufficient funds for payment of equipment purchases prior to payment due date to vendor of equipment, such funds shall be held or utilized on an as-needed basis for payment of equipment purchases either by the State Treasurer (in which event the master lease-purchase agreement may include provisions concerning the holding of such funds, the creation of a security interest for the benefit of the lessor in such funds until disbursed and other appropriate provisions approved by the Bond Commission) or by a corporate trustee selected by the Department of Finance and Administration (in which event the Department of Finance and Administration shall have the authority to enter into an agreement with such a corporate trustee containing terms and conditions approved by the Bond Commission). Earnings on any amount paid by the lessor prior to the acquisition of the equipment may be used to make lease payments under the master lease-purchase agreement or applied to pay costs and expenses incurred in connection with such lease-purchase agreement. In such event, the equipment-use agreements with the user agency may provide for lease payments to commence upon the date of payment by the lessor and may also provide for a credit against such payments to the extent that investment receipts from investment of the purchase price are to be used to make lease-purchase payments.

      Bidding procedure for purchases not over $5,000.00. Purchases which do not involve an expenditure of more than Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000.00), exclusive of freight or shipping charges, may be made without advertising or otherwise requesting competitive bids. However, nothing contained in this paragraph (a) shall be construed to prohibit any agency or governing authority from establishing procedures which require competitive bids on purchases of Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000.00) or less.
     </p>
     <p>
      Bidding procedure for purchases over $5,000.00 but not over $50,000.00. Purchases which involve an expenditure of more than Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000.00) but not more than Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000.00), exclusive of freight and shipping charges, may be made from the lowest and best bidder without publishing or posting advertisement for bids, provided at least two (2) competitive written bids have been obtained. Any state agency or community/junior college purchasing commodities or procuring construction pursuant to this paragraph (b) may authorize its purchasing agent, or his designee, to accept the lowest competitive written bid under Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000.00). Any governing authority purchasing commodities pursuant to this paragraph (b) may authorize its purchasing agent, or his designee, with regard to governing authorities other than counties, or its purchase clerk, or his designee, with regard to counties, to accept the lowest and best competitive written bid. Such authorization shall be made in writing by the governing authority and shall be maintained on file in the primary office of the agency and recorded in the official minutes of the governing authority, as appropriate. The purchasing agent or the purchase clerk, or their designee, as the case may be, and not the governing authority, shall be liable for any penalties and/or damages as may be imposed by law for any act or omission of the purchasing agent or purchase clerk, or their designee, constituting a violation of law in accepting any bid without approval by the governing authority. The term “competitive written bid” shall mean a bid submitted on a bid form furnished by the buying agency or governing authority and signed by authorized personnel representing the vendor, or a bid submitted on a vendor’s letterhead or identifiable bid form and signed by authorized personnel representing the vendor. “Competitive” shall mean that the bids are developed based upon comparable identification of the needs and are developed independently and without knowledge of other bids or prospective bids. Any bid item for construction in excess of Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000.00) shall be broken down by components to provide detail of component description and pricing. These details shall be submitted with the written bids and become part of the bid evaluation criteria. Bids may be submitted by facsimile, electronic mail or other generally accepted method of information distribution.

However, if valid justification is presented, the Department of Finance and Administration or the board of a governing authority may approve a request for specific equipment necessary to perform a specific job. Further, such justification, when placed on the minutes of the board of a governing authority, may serve as authority for that governing authority to write specifications to require a specific item of equipment needed to perform a specific job.

      Lease-purchase authorization. For the purposes of this section, the term “equipment” shall mean equipment, furniture and, if applicable, associated software and other applicable direct costs associated with the acquisition. Any lease-purchase of equipment which an agency is not required to lease-purchase under the master lease-purchase program pursuant to Section 31-7-10 and any lease-purchase of equipment which a governing authority elects to lease-purchase may be acquired by a lease-purchase agreement under this paragraph (e). Lease-purchase financing may also be obtained from the vendor or from a third-party source after having solicited and obtained at least two (2) written competitive bids, as defined in paragraph (b) of this section, for such financing without advertising for such bids. Solicitation for the bids for financing may occur before or after acceptance of bids for the purchase of such equipment or, where no such bids for purchase are required, at any time before the purchase thereof. No such lease-purchase agreement shall be for an annual rate of interest which is greater than the overall maximum interest rate to maturity on general obligation indebtedness permitted under Section 75-17-101, and the term of such lease-purchase agreement shall not exceed the useful life of equipment covered thereby as determined according to the upper limit of the asset depreciation range (ADR) guidelines for the Class Life Asset Depreciation Range System established by the Internal Revenue Service pursuant to the United States Internal Revenue Code and regulations thereunder as in effect on December 31, 1980, or comparable depreciation guidelines with respect to any equipment not covered by ADR guidelines. Any lease-purchase agreement entered into pursuant to this paragraph (e) may contain any of the terms and conditions which a master lease-purchase agreement may contain under the provisions of Section 31-7-10(5), and shall contain an annual allocation dependency clause substantially similar to that set forth in Section 31-7-10(8). Each agency or governing authority entering into a lease-purchase transaction pursuant to this paragraph (e) shall maintain with respect to each such lease-purchase transaction the same information as required to be maintained by the Department of Finance and Administration pursuant to Section 31-7-10(13). However, nothing contained in this section shall be construed to permit agencies to acquire items of equipment with a total acquisition cost in the aggregate of less than Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000.00) by a single lease-purchase transaction. All equipment, and the purchase thereof by any lessor, acquired by lease-purchase under this paragraph and all lease-purchase payments with respect thereto shall be exempt from all Mississippi sales, use and ad valorem taxes. Interest paid on any lease-purchase agreement under this section shall be exempt from State of Mississippi income taxation.
     </p>
     <p>
      Alternate bid authorization. When necessary to ensure ready availability of commodities for public works and the timely completion of public projects, no more than two (2) alternate bids may be accepted by a governing authority for commodities. No purchases may be made through use of such alternate bids procedure unless the lowest and best bidder cannot deliver the commodities contained in his bid. In that event, purchases of such commodities may be made from one (1) of the bidders whose bid was accepted as an alternate.
     </p>
     <p>
      Construction contract change authorization. In the event a determination is made by an agency or governing authority after a construction contract is let that changes or modifications to the original contract are necessary or would better serve the purpose of the agency or the governing authority, such agency or governing authority may, in its discretion, order such changes pertaining to the construction that are necessary under the circumstances without the necessity of further public bids; provided that such change shall be made in a commercially reasonable manner and shall not be made to circumvent the public purchasing statutes. In addition to any other authorized person, the architect or engineer hired by an agency or governing authority with respect to any public construction contract shall have the authority, when granted by an agency or governing authority, to authorize changes or modifications to the original contract without the necessity of prior approval of the agency or governing authority when any such change or modification is less than one percent (1%) of the total contract amount. The agency or governing authority may limit the number, manner or frequency of such emergency changes or modifications.
     </p>
     <p>
      Petroleum purchase alternative. In addition to other methods of purchasing authorized in this chapter, when any agency or governing authority shall have a need for gas, diesel fuel, oils and/or other petroleum products in excess of the amount set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, such agency or governing authority may purchase the commodity after having solicited and obtained at least two (2) competitive written bids, as defined in paragraph (b) of this section. If two (2) competitive written bids are not obtained, the entity shall comply with the procedures set forth in paragraph (c) of this section. In the event any agency or governing authority shall have advertised for bids for the purchase of gas, diesel fuel, oils and other petroleum products and coal and no acceptable bids can be obtained, such agency or governing authority is authorized and directed to enter into any negotiations necessary to secure the lowest and best contract available for the purchase of such commodities.
     </p>
     <p>
      Road construction petroleum products price adjustment clause authorization. Any agency or governing authority authorized to enter into contracts for the construction, maintenance, surfacing or repair of highways, roads or streets, may include in its bid proposal and contract documents a price adjustment clause with relation to the cost to the contractor, including taxes, based upon an industry-wide cost index, of petroleum products including asphalt used in the performance or execution of the contract or in the production or manufacture of materials for use in such performance. Such industry-wide index shall be established and published monthly by the Mississippi Department of Transportation with a copy thereof to be mailed, upon request, to the clerks of the governing authority of each municipality and the clerks of each board of supervisors throughout the state. The price adjustment clause shall be based on the cost of such petroleum products only and shall not include any additional profit or overhead as part of the adjustment. The bid proposals or document contract shall contain the basis and methods of adjusting unit prices for the change in the cost of such petroleum products.
     </p>
     <p>
      State agency emergency purchase procedure. If the governing board or the executive head, or his designees, of any agency of the state shall determine that an emergency exists in regard to the purchase of any commodities or repair contracts, so that the delay incident to giving opportunity for competitive bidding would be detrimental to the interests of the state, then the head of such agency, or his designees, shall file with the Department of Finance and Administration (i) a statement explaining the conditions and circumstances of the emergency, which shall include a detailed description of the events leading up to the situation and the negative impact to the entity if the purchase is made following the statutory requirements set forth in paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of this section, and (ii) a certified copy of the appropriate minutes of the board of such agency requesting the emergency purchase, if applicable. Upon receipt of the statement and applicable board certification, the State Fiscal Officer, or his designees, may, in writing, authorize the purchase or repair without having to comply with competitive bidding requirements.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the governing board or the executive head, or his designees, of any agency determines that an emergency exists in regard to the purchase of any commodities or repair contracts, so that the delay incident to giving opportunity for competitive bidding would threaten the health or safety of any person, or the preservation or protection of property, then the provisions in this section for competitive bidding shall not apply, and any officer or agent of the agency having general or specific authority for making the purchase or repair contract shall approve the bill presented for payment, and he shall certify in writing from whom the purchase was made, or with whom the repair contract was made.
     </p>
     <p>
      Total purchases made under this paragraph (j) shall only be for the purpose of meeting needs created by the emergency situation. Following the emergency purchase, documentation of the purchase, including a description of the commodity purchased, the purchase price thereof and the nature of the emergency shall be filed with the Department of Finance and Administration. Any contract awarded pursuant to this paragraph (j) shall not exceed a term of one (1) year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Governing authority emergency purchase procedure. If the governing authority, or the governing authority acting through its designee, shall determine that an emergency exists in regard to the purchase of any commodities or repair contracts, so that the delay incident to giving opportunity for competitive bidding would be detrimental to the interest of the governing authority, then the provisions herein for competitive bidding shall not apply and any officer or agent of such governing authority having general or special authority therefor in making such purchase or repair shall approve the bill presented therefor, and he shall certify in writing thereon from whom such purchase was made, or with whom such a repair contract was made. At the board meeting next following the emergency purchase or repair contract, documentation of the purchase or repair contract, including a description of the commodity purchased, the price thereof and the nature of the emergency shall be presented to the board and shall be placed on the minutes of the board of such governing authority.

      Hospital purchase, lease-purchase and lease authorization.
     </p>
     <p>
      The commissioners or board of trustees of any public hospital may contract with such lowest and best bidder for the purchase or lease-purchase of any commodity under a contract of purchase or lease-purchase agreement whose obligatory payment terms do not exceed five (5) years.
     </p>
     <p>
      In addition to the authority granted in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph (l), the commissioners or board of trustees is authorized to enter into contracts for the lease of equipment or services, or both, which it considers necessary for the proper care of patients if, in its opinion, it is not financially feasible to purchase the necessary equipment or services. Any such contract for the lease of equipment or services executed by the commissioners or board shall not exceed a maximum of five (5) years’ duration and shall include a cancellation clause based on unavailability of funds. If such cancellation clause is exercised, there shall be no further liability on the part of the lessee. Any such contract for the lease of equipment or services executed on behalf of the commissioners or board that complies with the provisions of this subparagraph (ii) shall be excepted from the bid requirements set forth in this section.

       Circuit court erred in affirming a city’s conditional award of a contract for a public construction project to bidder whose bid exceeded the project’s allocated funds by more than 10 percent because the city’s actions in making the bid dependent upon the city obtaining additional public funds to match the bid were not provided by law, it could not be argued fairly that the city’s actions were necessarily implied by the statute, and the foundational principles underlying the statutory requirements of competitive bidding negated any inference that the city could obtain additional public funds post-bid opening.

       Trial court properly remanded to the board of supervisors to provide a caterer with a due-process hearing and to consider evidence to determine if its prior contract rescission was justified because a supplementation of the factual basis of the board’s justification after the hearing was required to allow for judicial review of the board’s decision. Howell v. Bd. of Supervisors, 179 So.3d 34, 2015 Miss. App. LEXIS 187 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 178 So.3d 729, 2015 Miss. LEXIS 566 (Miss. 2015).
      </p>
      <p>
       Circuit court properly ruled that a contractor’s appeal of the decision of a county board of supervisors to award a contract to another was moot because the circuit court gave the board an opportunity to decide that it would reject all previous bids and reopen the request-for-proposals process, and the board decided to reject all bids and reopen the request-for-proposals process; any error that resulted from the circuit court’s decision to remand for reconsideration of the matter by the board was harmless because the circuit court could have ordered the board to reject all bids and reopen the request-for-proposals process. Precision Communs., Inc. v. Hinds County, 74 So.3d 366, 2011 Miss. App. LEXIS 252 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 73 So.3d 1168, 2011 Miss. LEXIS 548 (Miss. 2011).

   In a construction company’s breach of contract action, a trial court erred in granting summary judgment to the Mississippi Transportation Commission because the last sentence of a diesel fuel and asphalt cost (FAC) provision in the parties’ completion agreement should have been stricken because it contravened the requirements of Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t31c07s31-7-13ol1i" target="_self">31-7-13(i)</a></cite> (Rev. 2008). While the FAC provision was unambiguous, and the plain meaning of the words used in the FAC supported the Commission’s interpretation of the contract, the last sentence of the FAC impermissibly locked in reimbursements to the construction company based on the price of petroleum as of the expiration of contract time. Hill Bros. Constr. Co. v. Miss. Transp. Comm'n, 42 So.3d 497, 2010 Miss. LEXIS 308 (Miss. 2010).

   Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t31c07s31-7-13ol1di" target="_self">31-7-13(d)(i)</a></cite>, did not violate the company’s due process rights, and did not act arbitrarily and capriciously in rejecting the company’s lowest bid. Because the City rejected the company’s bid for reasons that could not be reduced to “detailed calculations,” the City’s minutes provided the minimal, requisite “detailed calculations” pursuant to §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t31c07s31-7-13ol1di" target="_self">31-7-13(d)(i)</a></cite> by citing the dollar amounts of the lowest bid and the accepted bid.

       Board of supervisors’ capricious rescission of a caterer’s contract for prisoner catering services was in error because it was arbitrarily based upon consideration of matters outside of the bid specifications; the board rescinded the award of the contract despite the caterer’s compliance with bid requirements and certifications, and it based its decision upon the testimony of the sheriff, which lacked a credible basis upon which it could base its decision. Howell v. Bd. of Supervisors, 179 So.3d 34, 2015 Miss. App. LEXIS 187 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 178 So.3d 729, 2015 Miss. LEXIS 566 (Miss. 2015).

   In a 42 U.S.C.S. § 1983 case in which a contract was extended for 24 months by a former mayor and board of aldermen (board) and the contract was cancelled by the new mayor and board, the contractor and the assignee argued unsuccessfully that the cancellation violated the Contracts Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, § 10. Even if it was determined that the cancellation of the contract constituted a substantial impairment and was not justified by a legitimate public purpose, the continuance of the contract against the wishes of the successor municipal board would have violated the board’s sovereignty as provided by Mississippi common law and Miss.

   In a case in which a contractor and its assignee argued that a new mayor and board of alderman ratified the contract extension made by the former mayor and board of alderman when they modified the contract, given the disclaimer in the mayor’s letter to the contractor, the contractor and its assignee failed to create a genuine issue of material fact establishing that the successor board of aldermen ratified the former board of aldermen’s agreement to extend the term of the maintenance contract. Pursuant to Miss.

       The general purchasing statute, this section, applies to purchases by the Department of Finance and Administration and thus, arguably, to Mississippi Department of Information Technology Services (ITS) under Section 25-53-5(o), but this general statute must yield to the specific requirements of 25-53-5(n), which sets out the threshold for advertising for bids by ITS.

In no case may the agency or governing authority establish a maximum overhead rate or other payment formula designed to eliminate firms from contention or restrict competition or negotiation of fees. If the agency or governing authority is unable to negotiate a satisfactory contract with the firm that is most preferred, negotiations with that firm shall be terminated. The agency or governing authority shall then begin negotiations with the firm that is next preferred. If the agency or governing authority is unable to negotiate a satisfactory contract with that firm, negotiations with that firm shall be terminated.

      </p>
      <p>
       The 2017 amendment substituted “verifiable cost savings” for “energy efficiency as determined by the division” at the end of (1)(a)(ii); rewrote (1)(a)(iii), which read: “‘Energy performance contract’ means an agreement to provide energy services which include, but are not limited to, the design, installation, financing and maintenance or management of the energy systems or equipment in order to improve its energy efficiency. The energy savings are guaranteed by the performance contractor and savings from energy, operations, maintenance and other cost-avoidance measures can be used to repay the cost of the project”; added (1)(a)(iv) and (v), and redesignated (1)(a)(iv) through (vii) as (v) through (viii); rewrote former (1)(a)(v), which read: “‘Entity’ means the board of trustees of any public school district, junior college, institution of higher learning, publicly owned hospital, state agency or governing authority of this chapter”; added the second and third sentences of (1)(a)(viii); added (1)(a)(ix); redesignated former (1)(a)(viii) as (1)(a)(x); added (1)(a)(xi) and (xii); substituted “into an energy services contract” for “into a lease, energy services contract” in (1)(b); added (1)(b)(i) and redesignated former (i) through (iii) as (ii) through (iv); deleted former (1)(b)(iv), which required all contracts to contain an annual allocation dependency clause; rewrote (1)(b)(vi), which read: “The maximum lease-purchase term for any equipment acquired under this section shall not exceed the useful life of that equipment as determined according to the upper limit of the asset depreciation range (ADR) guidelines for the Class Life Asset Depreciation Range System established by the Internal Revenue Service under the United States Internal Revenue Code and the regulations thereunder as in effect on December 31, 1980, or comparable depreciation guidelines with respect to any equipment not covered by ADR guidelines”; substituted “subsection (1)(b)(v)” for “subsection (1)(b)(iv) and (v)” in (2)(c); in (4)(b), combined the former last two sentences into the current last sentence by deleting “The final contract shall be approved by the division” following “notify the division in writing”; rewrote (5), which read: “By September 1 of each year, each entity that receives financial assistance through the energy efficiency lease program shall annually report to the division its energy usage by meter in dollars and consumption by fuel type for the previous fiscal year,” and designated it (a), and added (b) and (c); and added (7).
      </p>
      <p>
       The 2019 amendment extended the date of the repealer for the section by substituting “July 1, 2021” for “July 1, 2019” in (7).

       In a federal prosecution for mail fraud, the district judge erred in charging the jury that, under Mississippi law, “any rebates, refunds, coupons, merit points, gratuities, or any article of value tendered or received by any agency from any vendor of materials, supplies, equipment, or other articles shall inure to the benefit of the agency making the purchase,” notwithstanding the fact that the instruction was a correct statement of the law. The court should not have given it without further explaining how Mississippi law relates to the federal offense of mail fraud, since the violation of Mississippi law did not ipso facto constitute a violation of the federal mail fraud statute.

      <p>
       It was the intent of the Legislature to bring University Medical Center within the provisions of Section 31-7-38 when it gave the Medical Center the “ . . . power necessary to enter into group purchasing arrangements . . . ” Ranck, October 11, 1996, A.G. Op. #96-0692.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under the plain language of Section 31-7-38, if the University of Mississippi Medical Center does organize or participate in a group purchase program with other hospitals, then its purchases of supplies, commodities and equipment made through such program would be exempt from the provisions of Sections 31-7-12 and 31-7-13. Ranck, October 11, 1996, A.G. Op. #96-0692.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Medical Center would not be exempt from the provisions of Sections 31-7-9 and 31-7-11 when participating in a group purchase program, since Section 31-7-38 does not so provide. Ranck, October 11, 1996, A.G. Op. #96-0692.
      </p>
      <p>
       As provided by Section 31-7-38, University Medical Center purchases of supplies, commodities and equipment made through a group purchasing program would be exempt from Section 31-7-13 requirements, including competitive bidding. Ranck, November 8, 1996, A.G. Op. #96-0755.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 31-7-38 does not exempt hospital group purchase programs from the provisions and requirements of Sections 31-7-9 and 31-7-11. These sections enumerate the duties and responsibilities of the Department of Finance and Administration with regard to purchases by state agencies, including University Medical Center. Ranck, November 8, 1996, A.G. Op. #96-0755.

       If a political subdivision of a foreign state has a bid preference law enforceable against Mississippi vendors, then Mississippi must reciprocally enforce such preference law against vendors of that political subdivision, and resident contractors domiciled anywhere in Mississippi are to be given preference over nonresidents whose home town or county gives them a preference over Mississippi bidders.

       Whether bids are equal or substantially equal is a discretionary determination that the public body itself must initially make and that should be explained in the minutes. If it is determined that bids are or are not equal or substantially equal, then the statutory preference provisions in favor of Mississippi bidders apply or do not apply, respectively.

   A board of supervisors’ liability for compensatory damages for entering into purchase contracts in violation of the method of letting contracts mandated by §§<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.19.html#t19c13s19-13-37" target="_blank">19-13-37</a></cite> [repealed] and<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t31c07s31-7-57" target="_self">31-7-57</a></cite> would be limited to the actual loss sustained by the county; thus, the supervisors would be liable for all amounts of principal payment over and above the sums that would have been required under the purchase contract submitted by the lowest bidder, all sums expended for interest, finance charges and related costs, and any other sums as would be necessary to “fully and completely compensate and repay [the county] for any actual loss caused by such unlawful expenditure.” Richardson v. Canton Farm Equipment, Inc., 608 So. 2d 1240, 1992 Miss. LEXIS 596 (Miss. 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       Remedially, statute law provides that any member of the board of supervisors who causes a contract to be let in violation of state law may be liable individually and on his official bond for compensatory damages in such sum equal to the full amount of such unlawful contract, purchases, expenditures or payment and for penal damages not in a excess of $5,000. Canton Farm Equipment, Inc. v. Richardson, 501 So. 2d 1098, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2273 (Miss. 1987).

      <p>
       A heavy equipment vendor, which in response to a county board of supervisor’s advertisement to purchase 2 backhoes had allegedly submitted the lowest and best bid, was not a mere taxpayer, but was a party claiming direct, adverse effect upon itself as a result of alleged conduct of the supervisors in purchasing the backhoes from the competitor and in arbitrarily and capriciously rejecting its bid, and as such, the vendor had a standing to maintain so much of its action as sought rescission of the purchase agreement between the supervisors and the competitor, as well as that part of its action wherein the vendor sought damages for such sale or a directive that its bid on the backhoes be accepted. Canton Farm Equipment, Inc. v. Richardson, 501 So. 2d 1098, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2273 (Miss. 1987).

      <p>
       In a case attempting to recoup payment from a former mayor, there was substantial evidence to support a finding that the mayor failed to provide itemization and documentation for credit card reimbursements; therefore, he was liable. The mayor’s argument that an auditor was required to show an “actual loss” besides the money being paid was rejected. Davis v. State ex rel. Hood, 198 So.3d 367, 2015 Miss. App. LEXIS 657 (Miss. Ct.

       Mayor had to repay expenditures charged on a city’s credit card because he failed to comply with a statute requiring receipts be given each month to a municipal clerk. Moreover, auditor was not required to show an “actual loss” beyond money being paid. Davis v. State ex rel. Hood, 198 So.3d 367, 2015 Miss. App. LEXIS 657 (Miss. Ct.

       § 31-7-101.
    Implementation of central purchase system; establishment of department of purchasing; appointment of purchase clerk and receiving clerk.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      From and after the first Monday of January 1989, the supervisors of each county in the state shall establish a central purchase system. The central purchase system shall be administered by a county department of purchasing headed by a purchase clerk who, unless the chancery clerk is appointed by the board of supervisors as purchase clerk as hereinafter authorized, shall be appointed by the county administrator, with the approval of the board of supervisors, in any county required to operate under a countywide system of road administration, or who shall be appointed by the board of supervisors in any other county. The purchase clerk shall not be a member of the board of supervisors. The purchase clerk shall be the director of the department of purchasing. No person shall serve as the purchase clerk who, within one (1) year after his appointment, does not receive certification from the State Auditor as having successfully completed the professional education program offered for purchase clerks pursuant to Section 19-3-77.
     </p>
     <p>
      The department of purchasing shall purchase all equipment, heavy equipment, machinery, supplies, commodities, materials and services used by any office or department of the county except for those offices or departments whose expenditures are not required by law to be approved by the board of supervisors. The purchase clerk may, subject to the approval of the entity which appointed him, hire personnel necessary to operate the department of purchasing efficiently. Unless the chancery clerk is appointed by the board of supervisors as receiving clerk as hereinafter authorized, the county administrator, with the approval of the board of supervisors, in any county required to operate under the countywide system of road administration, or the board of supervisors in any other county, shall appoint a receiving clerk, who shall not be a member of the board of supervisors. Assistant receiving clerks, when necessary, may be appointed by the receiving clerk subject to the approval of the entity which appointed him. No person shall serve as the receiving clerk who, within one (1) year after his appointment, does not receive certification from the State Auditor as having successfully completed the professional education program offered for receiving clerks pursuant to Section 19-3-77. The receiving clerk and his assistants shall be solely responsible for accepting the delivery of all equipment, heavy equipment, machinery, supplies, commodities, materials and services purchased by the county.
     </p>
     <p>
      The purchase clerk shall disapprove any purchase requisitions which, in his opinion, are not in compliance with the purchasing laws of the state.
     </p>
     <p>
      The board of supervisors may designate the chancery clerk, with his consent, to serve as the purchase clerk or assistant purchase clerk or as the receiving clerk or assistant receiving clerk; however a chancery clerk designated as purchase clerk or assistant purchase clerk may not also serve as receiving clerk or assistant receiving clerk, and a chancery clerk designated as receiving clerk or assistant receiving clerk may not serve as purchase clerk or assistant purchase clerk. Neither the purchase clerk nor any assistant purchase clerks shall serve as the receiving clerk or as an assistant receiving clerk.
     </p>
     <p>
      When the chancery clerk serves as county administrator and purchase clerk or assistant purchase clerk, the receiving clerk and any assistant receiving clerks shall be appointed by and serve at the will and pleasure of the board of supervisors.

       Where a county board of supervisors has advertised to purchase heavy equipment, a vendor who submits a bid has the right to expect that the board, if it accepts any bid at all, will accept the lowest and best bid and, if such vendor can prove that its bid was lowest and best and that the board’s action in accepting a competitor’s bid over its is arbitrary and capricious, such vendor is entitled to relief.

       A special act of the Legislature authorizing the board of supervisors of a designated county to reimburse a former sheriff thereof for expense incurred in purchasing disinfectants for the county jail, which claim had previously been disallowed by the board of supervisors, was void as being within the prohibition of this section [Code 1942, § 9027] in suspending the operation of a general law (Code 1942, § 9027) relating to the purchase of supplies by the county which expressly requires contracts for the purchase of supplies, etc., to be let upon competitive bids and prohibits any individual members of the board from making such purchases.

     <p>
      In addition to the required central purchase system, from and after the first Monday in January 1989, each county shall establish and maintain an inventory control system pursuant to requirements prescribed by the State Department of Audit under the authority of Section 7-7-211 and in accordance with Section 31-7-113; provided, however, that not more than a sixty (60) day inventory of supplies, commodities and materials shall be kept on hand unless otherwise approved by the board of supervisors. The inventory control clerk shall be employed or designated in the same manner and by the same entity which employs or designates the purchase clerk. The inventory control clerk shall be responsible for the maintenance of such system and such other personnel as may be required for the efficient operation of the inventory control system and shall not be a member of the board of supervisors. No person shall serve as the inventory control clerk who, within one (1) year after his appointment, does not receive certification from the State Auditor as having successfully completed the professional education program offered for inventory control clerks pursuant to Section 19-3-77. The opening entries of such system shall be compiled by the inventory control clerk from a physical inventory which the board of supervisors shall cause to be made of all property of the county by April 1, 1989, and such beginning inventory shall be recorded in the minutes of the board of supervisors. The clerk of the board of supervisors shall deliver to the inventory control clerk a certified copy of such inventory within seven (7) days after the acceptance of the beginning inventory by the board of supervisors. Following acceptance of the beginning inventory, the inventory control clerk, pursuant to regulations promulgated by the State Auditor, shall perform physical inventories of assets of the county on or before October 1 of each year and shall file with the board of supervisors, in triplicate, a written report of such inventory. The clerk of the board of supervisors shall keep the original of each inventory report so filed by the inventory control clerk as a permanent record of the county and shall forward a copy to the State Department of Audit not later than October 15. In a separate report to the clerk of the board, the inventory control clerk shall list additions to and deletions from the annual inventory report and shall also list items unaccounted for from the previous annual inventory report.

       Based on Section 31-7-13(n)(ii) and 31-7-109, there is no requirement that a separate receiving report be prepared for each and every delivery, load or shipment of gravel or other similar commodity received. Instead, statutory requirements are satisfied where a signed load ticket or receipt is issued evidencing each delivery, load or shipment received at and on the various delivery points and dates throughout each month. All of these signed tickets or receipts, in turn, are then attached to the receiving report covering the applicable period–a day, a week or any other reasonable time period not exceeding one month.

Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t31c07s31-7-309" target="_self">31-7-309</a></cite> because the corporation was not entitled to an award under Miss.

Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t31c05s31-5-25" target="_self">31-5-25</a></cite> did not provide for a statutory award of attorney fees. Southland Enters., Inc. v. Newton County, 940 So. 2d 937, 2006 Miss. App. LEXIS 101 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 939 So. 2d 805, 2006 Miss. LEXIS 739 (Miss. 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Based upon the delay in payment to the construction company by the county for a completed project, the trial court properly awarded the company interest, costs, and attorney’s fees as prescribed by Miss. Code Ann. §§<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t31c05s31-5-25" target="_self">31-5-25</a></cite> and<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t31c07s31-7-309" target="_self">31-7-309</a></cite>; such an award was supported by the record on appeal as the record contained a contract which provided for interest in the event of late payment, clearly detailed the schedule for progress payments, and clearly prescribed the manner in which final payment was to take place; the county’s deposit with the court clearly showed that the funds were present to pay the remaining portion of the contract, but for reasons unknown, the county chose not to honor the final payment provision of the contract until a lawsuit had been filed to determine each party’s rights. Humphreys County v. Guy Jones, Jr. Constr. Co., 910 So. 2d 1129, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 202 (Miss. Ct. App. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because a contractor was awarded an amount in quantum meruit, the county was not liable for statutory interest or attorney’s fees. Southland Enters. v. Newton County, 838 So. 2d 286, 2003 Miss. LEXIS 68 (Miss. 2003).

       Competitive sealed bidding is the preferred method of procurement; however, if it is not practicable and advantageous, a request for proposals or request for qualifications may be used. The terms “practicable” and “advantageous” are to be given ordinary dictionary meanings. The term “practicable” denotes what may be accomplished or put into practical application. “Advantageous” denotes a judgmental assessment of what is in the state’s best interest.

       On or before January 1 of each year, and every time a chief procurement officer is hired, each state agency shall provide to the state purchasing agent the name of the state agency’s chief procurement officer and information identifying the state agency’s central purchasing office, if applicable. If the chief procurement officer of an agency or his or her designee determines, in writing, that the use of competitive sealed bidding is either not practicable or not advantageous to the state, he or she shall submit a detailed explanation of the reasons for that determination to the Public Procurement Review Board. If the Public Procurement Review Board determines that competitive sealed bidding is either not practicable or not advantageous to the state, then a contract may be entered into for the procurement of commodities, supplies, equipment, construction, technology, personal and professional services, state agency purchased employee benefits or state agency supplemental insurance and cafeteria plans, by a request for proposals or request for qualifications. However, these procurements contracted for through a request for proposals or request for qualifications may not be combined or included in a contract with other procurements that are required to be procured through competitive sealed bidding so as to avoid the statutory obligation for procurement through competitive sealed bidding. The board may modify or revoke its determination at any time, and the determination should be reviewed for current applicability from time to time.

        In addition to determining whether a request for proposals or request for qualifications would be practicable and advantageous to the state, when making the decision to use a request for proposals or request for qualifications, the chief procurement officer shall consider the following factors:

Any such lease agreement may include, at the discretion of the governing authorities entering into the same, a pledge of the full faith and credit of such county or municipality for the payment of its monetary obligations thereunder; or may contain a provision that so long as no default of any monetary obligation of the lessee has occurred, the lessee’s obligation to pay any amounts due or perform any covenants requiring or resulting in the expenditure of money shall be contingent and expressly limited to the extent of any specific appropriation made by the governing authorities to fund such lease agreement, and that nothing contained in the lease agreement shall be construed as creating any monetary obligation on the part of the lessee beyond such current and specific appropriation. Obligations incurred by a county or municipality under the provisions of this chapter secured by a pledge of its full faith and credit shall be included within the limitation on bonded indebtedness established by law for counties and municipalities.

   In an action by a prime contractor against the Building Commission alleging breach of duty to coordinate the work between three prime contractors by failing to properly supervise the construction of a building, the trial court properly sustained the Building Commission’s demurrer to the complaint since §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t31c11s31-11-3" target="_self">31-11-3</a></cite> does not require that the Building Commission coordinate or supervise but merely authorizes it to employ independent contractors for that purpose; nor did the Building Commission have an “implied” contractual duty to coordinate the work of three prime contractors and to see that the work of each was performed properly, since the contracts with the prime contractors showed that the Building Commission relied upon the contractors to coordinate among themselves.

   In a proceeding instituted by the state building commission to enjoin the board of trustees of state institutions of higher learning from using self-generated funds, as distinguished from legislatively appropriated funds, to construct facilities at the institutions under its supervision without the approval of and control by the building commission, the chancery court properly dissolved a temporary injunction and dismissed the bill of complaint although it should have relied upon Miss Const § 213-A, which gives the board of trustees management and control of the institutions under its supervision, as well as upon §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.37.html#t37c101s37-101-15" target="_blank">37-101-15</a></cite>, which sets out the general powers and duties of the board.

       Fee holder (the State of Mississippi) was not named as a party to the condemnation proceedings, and because the condemnation was filed against the estate, the Mississippi Department of Finance and Administration (DFA) stood only to acquire that which was held by DFA, that was, the temporary rights of redemption and possession held by the estate; these rights expired on August 28, 2002, and thereafter, neither the estate nor the DFA had any interest or rights in the property.

      <p>
       A circuit court erred in reducing the acreage of a railroad right-of-way sought to be condemned by the State for a penitentiary based on its finding that the State had shown no need for more than a short stretch of the right-of-way where the circuit court found neither fraud nor clear abuse of discretion.

      <p>
       The State’s acquisition of an abandoned railroad right-of-way contiguous to the boundary of a state penitentiary was clearly for a public purpose where there was no suggestion that the State had any plan to use the property in any fashion except to be a part of the state penitentiary grounds.

     <p>
      When any county, municipality, school district, road district, drainage district, levee district, sea wall district, or any other district or subdivision authorized to issue bonds shall take steps to issue bonds for any purpose whatever, the officer or officers of such county, municipality, or district charged by law with the custody of the records of same shall, if the board issuing same so determine by order entered on its minutes, transmit to said bond attorney a certified copy of all legal papers pertaining to the issuance of said bonds, including transcripts of records and ordinances, proof of publication, and tabulation of vote, if any, and any other facts pertaining to said issuance. Said bond attorney shall thereupon as expeditiously as possible examine said legal papers, pass upon the sufficiency thereof, and render an opinion in writing, addressed to the board proposing to issue said bonds, as to the validity of same; and if any further action on the part of said board is necessary or any further data is desired, he shall indicate what is necessary to be done in the premises in order to make said bonds legal, valid, and binding. When in his opinion all necessary legal steps have been taken to make the said bond issue legal, valid, and binding, he shall render a written opinion to that effect and shall transmit all legal papers, together with his opinion, to the clerk of the chancery court of the county in which the district or municipality proposing to issue said bonds is situated, or if said district embraces more than one (1) county or parts of more than one county, then to the chancery clerk of any one of said counties. The chancery clerk shall file the same, enter the same on the docket of the chancery court, and shall promptly notify the chancellor of the district in writing that said papers are on file and the cause has been docketed. The chancellor shall then notify the chancery clerk to set the matter for hearing at some future date, not less than ten (10) days thereafter, and the clerk shall give not less than five (5) days’ notice by making at least one (1) publication in some paper published in the county where the case is docketed, addressed to the taxpayers of the county, municipality, or district proposing to issue said bonds, advising that the matter will be heard on the day named. If on the day set for hearing there is no written objection filed by any taxpayer to the issuance of said bonds, a decree approving the validity of same shall be entered by the chancellor; and if the chancellor be not present the clerk shall forward him the decree prepared by the state’s bond attorney for his signature, and shall enter the said decree upon his minutes in vacation.
     </p>
     <p>
      If no written objection is filed to the validation of the bonds, certificates of indebtedness, or other written obligations which are being validated, by any taxpayer to the issuance of same, then the validation decree shall be final and forever conclusive from its date, and no appeal whatever shall lie therefrom.
     </p>
     <p>
      If at the hearing any taxpayer of the county, municipality, or district issuing said bonds appears and files, or has filed written objection to the issuance of said bonds, then the chancellor, or the chancery clerk if the chancellor be not present, shall set the case over for another day convenient to the chancellor, not less than ten days thereafter, and shall notify the bond attorney to appear and attend the hearing. On the hearing the chancellor may hear additional competent, relevant and material evidence under the rules applicable to such evidence in the chancery court, so as to inquire into the validity of the bonds or other obligations proposed to be issued, and enter a decree in accordance with his finding.
     </p>
     <p>
      Where written objections have been filed to the validation but not otherwise, if either party shall be dissatisfied with the decree of the chancellor, an appeal shall be granted as in other cases, provided such appeal be prosecuted and bond filed within twenty (20) days after the chancellor enters his decree. However, no appeal shall lie in any case unless written objection has been filed to the validation of the bonds or other obligations by the time set for the validation hearing. The chancery clerk shall certify the record to the supreme court as in other cases, and the supreme court shall hear the case as a preference case.

       City of Hattiesburg could lawfully proceed with issuance of general obligation industrial park bonds under Chapter 886, Local and Private Laws of Mississippi, Regular Session 1984, which dispenses with the necessity for a bond issue election, except upon petition of 10 percent of the city’s registered voters.

      <p>
       Constitutionality of statute under which utility district has been organized and purports to exist may be considered at bond validation hearing, but not thereafter; on other hand, whether organization of district is lawful in sense that, in accordance with enabling legislation, all of “i’s” are dotted and “t’s” crossed is ordinarily regarded as collateral and may not be inquired into, provided there has been adequate opportunity to litigate question at earlier point in time. In re Validation of $7,800,000 Combined Utility System Revenue Bond, etc., 465 So. 2d 1003, 1985 Miss. LEXIS 1939 (Miss. 1985).

       In bond judgment and declaratory judgment actions by objectors against county utility district that proposed to issue revenue bonds to finance a water and sewage center, Mississippi Constitution, Art IV, § 87-90 did not sap the local and private act of its enabling power, where the local and private act furthered the same general purposes and policies as the general act, the differences between the two were primarily procedural or otherwise relatively minor, and the citizens of the political subdivision covered by the local and private act had alternatives in that they could proceed under either that act or the general law; notwithstanding that the objectors may not have been afforded reasonable advance notice of the meeting in which the board of commissioners formerly adopted resolutions concerning the project, the revenue bond did not violate the due process clause of the Mississippi Constitution. In re Validation of $7,800,000 Combined Utility System Revenue Bond, etc., 465 So. 2d 1003, 1985 Miss. LEXIS 1939 (Miss. 1985).

      <p>
       Defects in a certified transcript sent to the state bond attorney were not so severe as to preclude issuance of the bonds where the defects consisted of a failure to include notice of the special meeting in the transcript, the transcript’s representation of the late signing of the meeting’s minutes, the representation of the signature of a president who had resigned several months earlier, and an inaccurate statement in the bond transcript certification that “there was no litigation pending or threatened in any way involving the issuance and sale of the Bonds.” Shipman v. North Panola Consol. Sch. Dist., 641 So. 2d 1106, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 372 (Miss. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       In determining the validity of certain bonds which were issued by a city for the purpose of acquiring hospital facilities, the trial court properly declined to receive evidence on the collateral matter of the facility’s proposed location. In re Validation of $15,000,000 Hospital Revenue Bonds etc., 361 So. 2d 44, 1978 Miss. LEXIS 2343 (Miss. 1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section [Code 1942, § 4314] permits written objections only up to the time set for the validation hearing, and thereafter it was within the discretion of the chancellor to allow or overrule a motion to amend objections filed by the protestants. Ramond v. Bay St. Louis, 218 So. 2d 719, 1969 Miss. LEXIS 1613 (Miss. 1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       Objection to a validation of bonds may not be based on the fact that the president of the board of supervisors signed the minutes on the day following that specified by law, where the day specified was a legal holiday. Gordon v. Monroe County, 244 Miss. 849, 147 So. 2d 126, 1962 Miss. LEXIS 515 (Miss. 1962).

       If upon a demurrer or motion to strike, an objection is held insufficient, the objector has a right to amend at any time prior to final hearing. Mills v. Richton Municipal Separate School Dist., 236 Miss. 273, 110 So. 2d 349, 1959 Miss. LEXIS 317 (Miss. 1959).
      </p>
      <p>
       The statute clearly requires that when objections are filed a hearing must be had within ten days, at which time any competent, relevant and material evidence may be heard. Mills v. Richton Municipal Separate School Dist., 236 Miss. 273, 110 So. 2d 349, 1959 Miss. LEXIS 317 (Miss. 1959).

       In proceedings for issuance of bonds under Code of 1942, § 6370, authorizing consolidated school districts to issue bonds for improvement and repair of school buildings, allegations of objectors that signers of petition did not constitute a majority, which, if true, would render bonds void, was improperly stricken by the court, which should have heard and determined the same as required by due process. In re Savannah Special Consol. School Dist., 208 Miss. 460, 44 So. 2d 545, 1950 Miss. LEXIS 265 (Miss. 1950).
      </p>
      <p>
       While it is true that in a proceeding to validate refunding bonds, a taxpayer may appear and object if there are no bonds to be refunded, or that none will be due or can be made to be due at the time the refunding bonds will be sold, and that upon such objection the court will be obliged to decide that issue, it is still an issue solely between the board and the taxpayers, and if the questions involved be decided in favor of the bonds proposed to be issued and the bonds are validated, the bonds as validated become of unquestionable legality as between the county, the taxpayers, and the purchasers of the refunding bonds. Love v. Humphreys County, 190 Miss. 365, 200 So. 245, 1941 Miss. LEXIS 51 (Miss. 1941).
      </p>
      <p>
       An order by the Board of Supervisors after issuance of a refunding bond and validation thereof by proceedings in the chancery court, amending its original order for the issuance of such bonds by the inclusion of the clause “without option of prior payment” which as against the taxpayers the board had no right to make because of its disadvantageous purpose, was of no valid effect and could not be set up as a ground of objection by holders of bonds of the original issue against a subsequent issue of bonds to refund such original issue. Love v. Humphreys County, 190 Miss. 365, 200 So. 245, 1941 Miss. LEXIS 51 (Miss. 1941).
      </p>
      <p>
       The validation proceedings for refunding bonds do not include or preclude the holders of the older bonds which are proposed to be refunded, since they have not been made parties to the refunding validation proceedings and should they elect not to surrender their bonds but to hold them and seek to collect the interest thereon, and should sue therefor, they would be met with no more than what confronts litigants generally, that is to say, the obstacle of stare decisis, but not with any such defenses as res adjudicata or the law of the case. Love v. Humphreys County, 190 Miss. 365, 200 So. 245, 1941 Miss. LEXIS 51 (Miss. 1941).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where there has been no validation by the chancery court of a bond issue, every question which may go to the validity of the bond remains open to the taxpayer to raise an appropriate suit by him at any time when he may be called upon to contribute to the payment of the bond and his attack may question every step taken in the issuance of the original order on through the intermediate orders to and including the final order and any amendatory order. Love v. Humphreys County, 190 Miss. 365, 200 So. 245, 1941 Miss. LEXIS 51 (Miss. 1941).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where election commissioners certified to a Board of Supervisors the essential matters necessary for the issuance of bonds of a school district, and had determined all the jurisdictional facts essential to the validity of the election, and the Board of Supervisors had found all the jurisdictional facts essential to the issuance of the bonds and had directed their issuance and validation, the pendency of a mandamus suit in the circuit court was no bar to a validation proceeding in chancery court, where no appeal was taken from the order of the Board of Supervisors to the circuit court, a mandamus suit being no substitute for the appeal provided by statute. In re Validation of Bonds, 185 Miss. 864, 188 So. 318, 1939 Miss. LEXIS 168 (Miss. 1939).
      </p>
      <p>
       Supervisors must find as jurisdictional fact proposed funding bonds will not increase bonded debt beyond ten percent of assessed valuation, and set forth such fact in order. Lee v. Hancock County, 181 Miss. 847, 178 So. 790, 1938 Miss. LEXIS 124 (Miss. 1938).

       Municipality could issue bonds for purchase and maintenance of municipal waterworks payable serially over period of 25 years, and municipality’s right to contract to pay for service in aid of maintenance of sinking fund for retirement of bonds was coextensive with right to issue bonds.

       Statute held to include validation proceedings for bonds issued by municipality for purchase and maintenance of municipal waterworks, notwithstanding bonds were payable solely out of revenues from such enterprise.

       A bond validation proceeding is a case in court between the issuing district and the taxpayers. Mills v. Richton Municipal Separate School Dist., 236 Miss. 273, 110 So. 2d 349, 1959 Miss. LEXIS 317 (Miss. 1959).

       Validation proceedings are solely between the county as a governmental entity and the taxpayers of the county, and those who hold the bonds or other obligations which are to be paid or refunded are not necessary parties, or even proper parties. Love v. Humphreys County, 190 Miss. 365, 200 So. 245, 1941 Miss. LEXIS 51 (Miss. 1941).

       Since bonds for consolidated school districts may be issued on petition of majority of qualified electors under Code 1942, § 6370, and no provision is made for notice to those affected so that they may have an opportunity to be heard prior to issuance, the validating act, this section [Code 1942, § 4314], must be construed so as to give to those who have had no opportunity to protest action of board the right to hearing, when they respond to notice to taxpayers in validation proceedings, otherwise state constitutional provision against deprivation of property except by due process of law is violated. In re Savannah Special Consol. School Dist., 208 Miss. 460, 44 So. 2d 545, 1950 Miss. LEXIS 265 (Miss. 1950).

       Chancellors do not have discretion in admitting and/or considering relevant evidence in the context of the statute for determining the validity of bond issues; therefore, a chancellor erred by finding that the time had passed for the presentation of evidence as to the sufficiency of the signatures on the petition. Not only was it the correct time for presenting evidence of the sufficiency of the signatures on the petition, but it was the only time. Russell v. Humphreys Cnty.

       In action by registered voters against county board of supervisors alleging that board violated due process right by refusing to hold election on bond issues, refusal did not rise to level of constitutional deprivation, and even if board members, as alleged, improperly eliminated signatures on plaintiffs’ protest petition or viewed required number of signatures too restrictively, proper avenue for such claims was through state election procedures, not action in federal court. Thrasher v. Board of Supervisors, 765 F. Supp. 896, 1991 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7289 (N.D. Miss. 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       An appeal by taxpayers to the circuit court from orders and allowances made by the board of supervisors with respect to the issuance of county funding bonds was improper where the bill of exceptions failed to set forth the facts in full and was not signed by the president of the board as the law required, and items which should have been entered and a statement as to their correctness was left to the clerk. In re Validation of $50,000 Serial Funding Bonds, 187 Miss. 512, 193 So. 449, 1940 Miss. LEXIS 231 (Miss. 1940).
      </p>
      <p>
       An appeal to the circuit court by taxpayers from orders and allowances made by the county board of supervisors with respect to the issuance of county funding bonds was ineffective where the chancery court had acquired jurisdiction of the whole matter in a validation proceeding. In re Validation of $50,000 Serial Funding Bonds, 187 Miss. 512, 193 So. 449, 1940 Miss. LEXIS 231 (Miss. 1940).
      </p>
      <p>
       The chancery court, having acquired jurisdiction of a proceeding or validation of county funding bonds, erred in dismissing the proceedings, in view of the fact that it had the power to pass upon the legality of the bond issue in all respects, including the various claims constituting the alleged indebtednesses, and an appeal by the taxpayers to the circuit court during the pendency of such proceeding in the chancery court was improper. In re Validation of $50,000 Serial Funding Bonds, 187 Miss. 512, 193 So. 449, 1940 Miss. LEXIS 231 (Miss. 1940).
      </p>

       The right of a taxpayer to prosecute appeals from orders and allowances by a board of supervisors in connection with the issuance of funding bonds to matters in which he has no pecuniary or property interest is limited.

      </p>
      <p>
       With respect to an appeal to the circuit court by taxpayers from orders and allowances of a board of supervisors with respect to issuance of county funding bonds, a party having a claim to be allowed or having been allowed by the board is an interested party on an appeal to the circuit court, and separate appeals from all orders must be prosecuted where an appeal has been taken, and the bill of exceptions must either be filed during the court term or meeting of the board of supervisors or within such time as the law or the board might allow for filing such bill and appeal.

       In action by registered voters against county board of supervisors alleging that board violated due process right by refusing to hold election on bond issues, refusal did not rise to level of constitutional deprivation, and even if board members, as alleged, improperly eliminated signatures on plaintiffs’ protest petition or viewed required number of signatures too restrictively, proper avenue for such claims was through state election procedures, not action in federal court.

       The board cannot present one record to the taxpayers for the validation of bonds and then present to them a more burdensome or less advantageous record when they are called on to pay, and since the rights of bondholders are based on what the board has validly done, the bondholders cannot insist on any record which, as against the taxpayers, the board had no right to make.

       When there has been a validation decree that decree forecloses every question which could have been raised by any taxpayer against the legality of the issue; wherefore, it follows that when the board presents to the taxpayers a certified record for validation and gives them notice to come into court if they have any objection to what the record shows and proposes, that record must remain unchanged in all particulars which otherwise would operate adversely to the interest of the taxpayers.

       Although this section [Code 1942, § 4360] does not in express terms make the issuance of refunding bonds mandatory, it is mandatory where it applies, as where a municipality has an outstanding bonded indebtedness for which it has no funds to discharge either the principal or interest and some of the interest can be saved by issuing refunding bonds; under such conditions it is mandatory on the municipal authority to refund the bonds and they are authorized to incur the necessary expenses, including reasonable attorney’s fees, to do so. City of Louisville v. Chambers, 190 Miss. 833, 1 So. 2d 771, 1941 Miss. LEXIS 95 (Miss. 1941).
      </p>
      <p>
       It is not necessary that the board of supervisors of a county should adjudicate that the funds available from taxes would not be sufficient to pay the next maturing bonds and all accrued interest, nor that any bond was then in default, as a condition precedent to its right to issue refunding bonds. In re Validation of Road Protection Bonds, 184 Miss. 727, 184 So. 815, 1938 Miss. LEXIS 314 (Miss. 1938); Love v. Humphreys County, 190 Miss. 365, 200 So. 245, 1941 Miss. LEXIS 51 (Miss. 1941).
      </p>
      <p>
       Notwithstanding the contention that the board of supervisors of a county had unlawfully transferred a sum of money from the road protection bond fund to another county fund thereby bringing about a deficit in the funds available for meeting the amount due on the original bond issue, and that the taxpayers were entitled to have the money returned to the road protection bond fund, the board of supervisors would nevertheless have been authorized to issue refunding bonds in order to avoid default being made as to future instalments due. In re Validation of Road Protection Bonds, 184 Miss. 727, 184 So. 815, 1938 Miss. LEXIS 314 (Miss. 1938).
      </p>
      <p>
       Proposed county bonds to take up outstanding county obligations were “funding” and not “refunding” bonds, and therefore limited to ten per cent of assessed value of taxable property of county. Lee v. Hancock County, 181 Miss. 847, 178 So. 790, 1938 Miss. LEXIS 124 (Miss. 1938).
      </p>
      <p>
       “Refunding bond” is a bond issued to pay off an older issue; to “refund a debt” meaning to fund it again or anew; the word “fund” in this connection meaning to convert into a more or less permanent debt bearing regular interest. Lee v. Hancock County, 181 Miss. 847, 178 So. 790, 1938 Miss. LEXIS 124 (Miss. 1938).
      </p>
      <p>
       Supervisors must find as jurisdictional fact proposed funding bonds will not increase bonded debt beyond ten percent of assessed valuation, and set forth such fact in order. Lee v. Hancock County, 181 Miss. 847, 178 So. 790, 1938 Miss. LEXIS 124 (Miss. 1938).
      </p>
      <p>
       Clear intent of statute is that proposed bond issue shall not be permitted if there is valid objection thereto. Lee v. Hancock County, 181 Miss. 847, 178 So. 790, 1938 Miss. LEXIS 124 (Miss. 1938).

       Refunding bonds of a county were not invalid because they matured serially five years from the date of their issuance, since the words of the statute “after this date” were intended to read “after their date,” particularly in view of further language of the statute specifying what percent of the total issues should mature the first six years, “beginning in the fifth year after the date of such bonds,” and in view of the fact that if the statute had intended to require all refunded bonds issued thereunder to begin maturing in not more than five years after its passage, instead of five years from the date of their issuance, then it would necessarily follow that bonds issued immediately prior to the expiration of five years from the passage of the statute would mature before ample opportunity would be afforded the governing authority to dispose of it.

      The resolution or order providing for the issuance of such bonds may reserve unto the governing authority the right to call in, pay, and redeem such bonds in the inverse order of their numbers and maturities, prior to the maturity date or dates thereof on any interest payment date. Whenever it is desired to exercise the aforesaid right, if reserved in such resolution or order, the governing authority shall cause written notice thereof to be delivered to the bank or office at which such bonds are payable. Such notice shall be so delivered not less than thirty days prior to the interest payment date designated for the redemption of such bonds, after which date so designated, no further interest shall accrue on the bonds so called for redemption. Such refunding bonds may be sold for not less than par and accrued interest, or may be exchanged at par for bonds and interest coupons to be refunded thereby.

     <p>
      The board of supervisors may accept county bonds, consolidated school district bonds, rural separate school district bonds or separate road district bonds, as the case may be, at not more than par and interest accruing thereon at the rate fixed in the bonds to be refunded in exchange for said refunding county bonds, consolidated school district bonds, rural separate school district bonds or separate road district bonds, as the case may be. In accepting any bond in exchange for, or in payment of, any such refunding bond, no bond shall be accepted in such exchange or payment that is secured by the property of a smaller or different district, or other subdivision, than that securing the refunding bonds so issued.

       Proposed county bonds to take up outstanding county obligations were “funding” and not “refunding” bonds, and therefore limited to ten percent. of assessed value of taxable property of county. Lee v. Hancock County, 181 Miss. 847, 178 So. 790, 1938 Miss. LEXIS 124 (Miss. 1938).
      </p>
      <p>
       “Refunding bond” is a bond issued to pay off an older issue; to “refund a debt” meaning to fund it again or anew; the word “fund” in this connection meaning to convert into a more or less permanent debt bearing regular interest. Lee v. Hancock County, 181 Miss. 847, 178 So. 790, 1938 Miss. LEXIS 124 (Miss. 1938).

       Supervisors must find as jurisdictional fact proposed funding bonds will not increase bonded debt beyond ten percent of assessed valuation, and set forth such fact in order. Lee v. Hancock County, 181 Miss. 847, 178 So. 790, 1938 Miss. LEXIS 124 (Miss. 1938).
      </p>

       Clear intent of statute is that proposed bond issue shall not be permitted if there is valid objection thereto. Lee v. Hancock County, 181 Miss. 847, 178 So. 790, 1938 Miss. LEXIS 124 (Miss. 1938).

      The purpose of Sections 31-17-27 through 31-17-43 is to create a fund for the ultimate retirement of the full faith and credit bonds of the State of Mississippi issued and outstanding as of July 1, 1944, and to set aside, earmark, and irrevocably pledge from the cash now in or to be added to the general fund of the state treasury a sum sufficient to pay all outstanding full faith and credit bonds of the State of Mississippi. To that end, therefore, not less than fifteen (15) days prior to each maturity date of full faith and credit bonds authorized to be retired from funds in the state bond retirement revolving fund under the provisions of said sections, an amount sufficient to pay the principal thereof at such maturity date shall be made available by the state bond retirement commission and shall be withdrawn from the state bond retirement revolving fund upon the order of the commission for the payment thereof, as provided by law. This process shall continue and like withdrawals shall be made at each succeeding maturity date of full faith and credit bonds authorized to be retired from funds in the state bond retirement revolving fund until the said state bond retirement revolving fund shall be exhausted or until all full faith and credit bonds of the state outstanding at July 1, 1944, shall be fully paid and satisfied. When all such bonds are paid, any balance remaining in said state bond retirement revolving fund shall be transferred to the general fund of the state.

      Should the maturity dates of federal securities held by the state bond retirement commission fail to coincide with the maturity dates of the full faith and credit bonds of the state to the extent that the funds belonging to the state bond retirement revolving fund shall be inadequate to pay the principal of full faith and credit bonds on any maturity date as required by the terms of Sections 31-17-27 through 31-17-43, then in such event the commission is hereby authorized and directed to either sell a sufficient amount of its securities to realize the amount necessary to pay the principal of such maturing bonds or borrow from other sources an amount necessary to provide the funds with which to make such payment, at the lowest and best rate of interest obtainable, after having publicly advertised for bids. The commission shall not pay a higher rate of interest than two percent (2%) for such loans. Such loans shall be evidenced by notes signed in the name of the State of Mississippi by the commission. No such loan shall be made unless there are federal securities held by the commission maturing not later than two (2) years next after the date of the note evidencing the loan, which said federal securities so held, together with the interest thereon, shall be sufficient in amount to retire the said loan and the interest thereon. In no event shall any federal securities held by the commission under the terms of said sections be pledged, hypothecated, or otherwise given as security for any such loan. The chairman of the commission shall accompany each note evidencing funds borrowed with his certificate showing in detail the federal securities held by the commission, the proceeds of which are to be used for the retirement of the said loan. When such certificate shall show that as of the date of any such loan, there was then held by the commission federal securities the par value of which, together with the interest thereon, shall equal or exceed the full amount of the loan covered thereby, such loan shall be in all respects a valid, binding obligation of the State of Mississippi, and shall be promptly paid according to its tenor by the commission.

       For the purposes of offsetting any temporary cash flow deficiencies in the General Fund and to maintain a working balance in the General Fund, the commission is authorized at any time and from time to time to borrow money in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed seven and one-half percent (7-1/2%) of the total appropriation made by the State Legislature from the General Fund for the fiscal year in which such deficiency or deficiencies occur, issuing therefor notes as authorized hereunder. Notes may be issued from time to time as the proceeds thereof are needed.

Subject to the limitations contained in this section and the standards and limitations prescribed in the authorizing resolution, the commission, in its discretion, may provide for the notes to be issued and sold, in whole or in part, from time to time, and may delegate to the State Treasurer the power to determine the time or times of sale, the amounts, the maturities, the rate or rates of interest, and such other terms and details of the notes, as may be deemed appropriate by the commission, or the State Treasurer in the event of such delegation. The commission may also provide in the resolution authorizing the issuance of notes, in its discretion, but subject to the limitations contained in this section, (a) for the employment of one or more persons or firms to assist the commission in the sale of the notes, (b) for the appointment of one or more banks or trust companies, either within or without the State of Mississippi, as depository for safekeeping, and as agent for the delivery and payment, of the notes, (c) for the refunding of the notes, from time to time, without further action by the commission, unless and until the commission revokes such authority to refund, provided that in no event shall any refunding note be issued with a maturity date later than the last day of the third month following the end of the fiscal year in which the notes to be refunded were issued, (d) for the rating of the notes by one or more nationally recognized rating agencies, and (e) for such other terms and conditions as the commission may deem appropriate. In connection with the issuance and sale of notes as provided in this section, the commission may arrange for lines of credit with any bank, firm or person for the purpose of providing an additional source of repayment for notes issued pursuant to this section. Amounts drawn on such lines of credit may be evidenced by negotiable or nonnegotiable notes or other evidences of indebtedness, containing such terms and conditions as the commission may authorize in the resolution approving the same. The commission is authorized to pay all cost of issuance of the notes, including, without limitation, rating agency fees, printing costs, legal fees, bank or trust company fees, cost to employ persons or firms to assist in the sale of the notes, line of credit fees and charges and all other amounts related to the costs of issuing the notes from amounts available therefor in the General Fund or from the proceeds of the notes, in the discretion of the commission.

The State Fiscal Officer shall also submit to the State Bond Commission, if he deems the General Fund cash balance insufficient, a statement showing cash balances in all special funds in the State Treasury which appear to have cash in excess of their immediate needs.

To accomplish such transfer or loan, a requisition shall be issued by the bond commission against the special fund or funds, a copy thereof to be sent to each agency responsible for the administration of the fund or funds so utilized. The State Fiscal Officer shall issue his disbursement warrants against the fund or funds in the manner prescribed in governing statutes, and shall maintain a complete record of such transfers or loans and repayments thereof. A similar but separate record shall be maintained by the State Treasurer’s office, to afford a double check for the benefit of the bond commission and agencies administering any special funds involved. In the event any special fund has such a loan outstanding to the General Fund and needs the use of the money before the balance of the General Fund is sufficient to make repayment thereof, the bond commission is authorized and directed to effectuate a loan or transfer from other special fund or funds to the General Fund in an amount sufficient to make repayment, or if no other special fund balances are available, the bond commission shall immediately issue notes in the amount needed, as authorized in Section 31-17-103.

     <p>
      Pending the issuance of any state-supported debt, the commission is hereby authorized in accordance with the provisions of Sections 31-17-151 through 31-17-181 and on the credit of the state, to make temporary borrowings, from time to time, in anticipation of the issuance of state-supported debt in order to provide funds in such amounts as may, from time to time, be deemed advisable prior to the issuance of state-supported debt. In order to provide for and in connection with such temporary borrowings, the commission is hereby authorized in the name and on behalf of the state, to enter into agreements, which agreements may contain such provisions not inconsistent with the provisions of Sections 31-17-151 through 31-17-181, with any banks, trust companies, investment banking firms or other institutions or persons in the United States of America having the power to enter the same:

      To purchase or underwrite an issue or series of issues of notes.
     </p>
     <p>
      To enter into any purchase, loan, line of credit, credit or similar agreements, and to draw monies, from time to time, pursuant to any such agreements on the terms and conditions set forth therein and to issue notes as evidence of borrowings made under any such agreements.
     </p>
     <p>
      Such agreements may provide for the compensation of any purchasers or underwriters of such notes by payment of a fee or commission, and for all other costs and expenses, including fees for agreements related to the sale and issuance of notes. All costs and expenses of sale and issuance of notes may be paid from the proceeds of the notes or from any other lawfully available source of monies.

      All temporary borrowings made under Sections 31-17-151 through 31-17-181 shall be evidenced by notes of the state which shall be sold and issued, from time to time, at competitive or negotiated sale, for such amounts not exceeding in the aggregate the applicable statutory and constitutional debt limitation in connection with the related state-supported debt, in such form and in such denominations and subject to terms and conditions of sale and issuance, prepayment or redemption and maturity, variable and/or fixed rate or rates of interest, time of payment of interest and other applicable provisions as the commission shall authorize and direct and in accordance with Sections 31-17-151 through 31-17-181. All notes issued pursuant to Sections 31-17-151 through 31-17-181 may be secured by a pledge of: (a) the same source of security as the related state-supported debt, or (b) such other security as the state may lawfully pledge, or both, all as provided by resolution of the commission. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, notes may be issued for any otherwise authorized state-supported debt. Except as otherwise provided in Sections 31-17-151 through 31-17-181 or when in conflict with the provisions of Sections 31-17-151 through 31-17-181, such notes shall be subject to the terms and provisions of the legislation authorizing the issuance of such state-supported debt.

       The right of a taxpayer to bring suit on behalf of a county or the public is only such as is authorized by statute; the power extends only to suits for money paid to an object not authorized by law, and not for paying out money to an object authorized by law in violation of statutory directions.

      <p>
       With respect to the right of a taxpayer to bring suit on behalf of the public, the taxpayer must bring his bill on behalf of the public, and invite the other taxpayers to join in the suit, and the bill must have proper allegations showing the suit is brought on behalf of the general public, and a failure to secure action by the public officers in the public’s behalf, in which latter connection it is not sufficient merely to request public officers to bring suit, or to state that the matter was notorious and that the officer or officers knew of the fact, but the taxpayer must present to the officer sufficient facts and data to convince the legal mind that the facts warrant institution of the suit. Mississippi Road Supply Co. v. Hester, 185 Miss. 839, 188 So. 281, 1939 Miss. LEXIS 158 (Miss. 1939), but see, Canton Farm Equipment, Inc. v. Richardson, 501 So. 2d 1098, 1987 Miss.

      Whenever any county, road district, consolidated school district, rural school district, or other taxing districts controlled by the board of supervisors which has heretofore issued or shall hereafter issue bonds or other obligations of which principal and interest shall be payable at some bank or trust company, or at some office other than the county treasury, it shall be the duty of the clerk of the board of supervisors on the allowance of said board to issue a warrant against the proper fund for the amount of principal and interest due and to forward exchange to the paying agent. Said exchange shall be sufficient in amount to pay said principal and interest and a reasonable fee to said paying agent for handling same, said fee not to exceed one-half of one percent (1/2 of 1%) of the amount of coupons paid and one-eighth of one percent (1/8 of 1%) of the amount of bonds paid. Said exchange shall be forwarded in time to reach the paying agent at least five (5) days prior to the date on which said principal and interest shall become due, and the receipt of the paying agent for said remittance shall be sufficient voucher in the hands of said clerk for said remittance until the bonds or coupons shall have been paid and cancelled and returned to said clerk.

       This section [Code 1942, § 4353] does not provide for liability of drainage district commissioners on account of their failure to assess sufficient benefits for the payment of all bonds and coupons of two series, or because they caused part of the taxes against the benefits assessed to be paid to the holders of the bonds of the second series without first issuing a warrant in that behalf, especially where the bonds and coupons so paid would have been paid on an equal basis with those of the first series if sufficient benefits had been assessed. People's Bank Liquidating Corp. v. Beashea Drainage Dist., 199 Miss. 505, 24 So. 2d 784, 1946 Miss. LEXIS 220 (Miss. 1946).
      </p>
      <p>
       Neither commissioners of drainage district personally, nor the sureties on their official bonds, were liable to holders of unpaid bonds of first series issued by the district for paying bonds of the second series which were invalid because additional benefits had not been assessed against the land as a basis for the issuance of the second bond, where the commissioners acted ministerially in good faith, since the acts of the commissioners were chargeable to the board in its official capacity rather than to the members individually; Moreover, they were not liable on the theory that the funds of the district constituted trust funds exclusively for the payment of the bonds of the first issue. People's Bank Liquidating Corp. v. Beashea Drainage Dist., 199 Miss. 505, 24 So. 2d 784, 1946 Miss. LEXIS 220 (Miss. 1946).

       Assignee of holder of loan warrants issued by county under authority of special statute held not entitled to recover from members of board of supervisors for attorney’s fees incurred in action to recover amount of warrants because of board’s failure to levy tax as authorized by statute, where statute did not impose any duty upon board members as individuals or any individual liability for board’s defaults, since boards of supervisors are not mere “ministerial” agents of state, and board’s failure to levy tax was a failure in its corporate capacity.

     <p>
      All bonds issued pursuant to any laws of this state and hereafter sold by the governing authority of or on behalf of any county, road district, school district, drainage district or other political subdivision or instrumentality of this state shall be advertised for sale on sealed bids or at public auction. Such advertisement shall be published at least two (2) times in a newspaper published in the county in which the political subdivision or instrumentality is situated, and if no newspaper is published in such county, then in a newspaper published in an adjoining county; with respect to a political subdivision or instrumentality which is composed of more than one (1) county, such advertisement shall be published at least two (2) times in a newspaper having a general circulation in each county all or a portion of which is part of the political subdivision or instrumentality. The first publication in each case shall be made at least ten (10) days preceding the date fixed for the reception of bids, and such notice shall give the time and place of sale.
     </p>
     <p>
      The governing authority may reject any and all bids, whether so stated in the notice of sale or not. If the bonds are not sold pursuant to such advertisement, they may be sold by the governing authority by private sale at any time within sixty (60) days after the date advertised for the reception of bids; but no such private sale shall be made at a price less than the highest bid which shall have been received pursuant to such advertisement. If not so sold at private sale, said bonds shall be readvertised in the manner herein prescribed.
     </p>
     <p>
      Every bid for the purchase of any of such bonds shall be accompanied by a cashier’s check, certified check or exchange, payable to the proper governing authority, issued or certified by a bank located in this state in the amount of not less than two percent (2%) of the par value of the bonds offered for sale, as a guaranty that the bidder will carry out his contract and purchase the bonds if the bid is accepted. If the successful bidder fails to purchase the bonds pursuant to his bid and contract, the amount of such good faith check shall be retained by the governing authority and covered into the proper fund as liquidated damages for such failure.
     </p>
     <p>
      This section shall not apply to the sale of bonds by the State of Mississippi through the State Bond Commission or the sale of bonds or any other indebtedness incurred by a county in connection with a project as defined under Section 57-75-5(f)(xxviii) or Section 57-75-5(f)(xxix).
     </p>
     <p>
      A failure to comply with any provision of this section shall not invalidate such bonds, but any member of the governing board, commission or other governing authority who shall willfully violate any of said provisions and shall willfully fail to give the notices herein required shall be liable personally and on his official bond for a penalty in each case of Five Hundred Dollars ($500.00) and, in addition thereto, for all financial loss that may result to the county, municipality, road district, school district, drainage district or other political subdivision or instrumentality of the state or county resulting from such willful failure to comply herewith. Such penalty and damages may be recovered by suit of the Attorney General, a district attorney or of any citizen of such county or other political subdivision in any court of competent jurisdiction, for the use and benefit of the county or other such political subdivision or instrumentality.

       The town has the authority to procure and pay for necessary legal services and to sell its bonds after the same had been authorized by the qualified electors and election called for such purpose, and to enter into a contract with the purchaser of such bonds upon such terms as the town and the purchaser may have agreed upon.

     <p>
      A doubtful claim of the state, or of the county, city, town, village, or levee board is one for which judgment has been rendered and for the collection of which the ordinary process of law has been ineffectual; debts due by drainage districts or other taxing districts or sinking funds to counties under the Rehabilitation Act of 1928, being Chapter 88 of the Laws of 1928, and Chapter 16 of the Acts of the Special Session of 1931; those debts due counties by drainage districts, which the reconstruction finance corporation has heretofore refused to refinance; debts due for sixteenth section township school fund loans made to churches, where the board of supervisors finds that the value of the security given therefor is insufficient or inadequate to pay or satisfy the principal and interest of said loan, and when the church repays the principal of said loan; and debts due by counties and townships to drainage districts for drainage district assessments or taxes levied and assessed upon sixteenth section lands.

      The Governor, on the advice of the Attorney General or chairman of the State Tax Commission, may, upon application of the defendant or debtor proposing a compromise, settle and compromise any doubtful claim of the state, or of any county, city, town, or village, or of any levee board against such defendant or debtor, upon such terms as he may deem proper, the board of supervisors in the case of a county, and the municipal authorities in the case of a city, town or village, and the levee board in the case of a claim of a levee board, concurring therein. The Governor, upon application of a drainage district having obligations outstanding to a county under the provisions of Chapter 88, Laws of 1928, and Chapter 16, Laws of the Extraordinary Session of 1931, or obligations which the reconstruction finance corporation has heretofore refused to refinance, may settle and compromise any claim, debt or obligation that said drainage district may owe any county in the State of Mississippi for money loaned said district under the provisions of said Chapter 88, Laws of 1928, or any other claim, debt or obligation that said drainage district may owe the county which the reconstruction finance corporation has heretofore refused to finance, if the board of supervisors of said county concurs in the application of the drainage district. The Governor, upon application by the board of supervisors for any taxing districts of said county or sinking funds of said county under the control and supervision of said board of supervisors having obligations outstanding and due to said county under the provisions of Chapter 88, Laws of 1928, and Chapter 16, Laws of the Extraordinary Session of 1931, may settle and compromise any claim, debt, or obligation that said taxing districts or sinking funds may owe said county for money loaned said taxing districts or sinking funds under the provisions of said Chapter 88, Laws of 1928; and provided that the Governor, on the advice of the Attorney General, and upon application of a church owing a sixteenth section township school fund loan, may settle and compromise such debt or obligation if the board of supervisors of the said county concurs in the application of the said church. The Governor may, on the advice of the Attorney General, in like manner compromise and settle a claim of a drainage district for unpaid assessments or taxes upon sixteenth section lands upon application of the board of supervisors wherein such sixteenth section is situated, if the commissioners of the drainage district concur therein.

      <p>
       Laws of 1983, ch. 494, § 2, effective from and after passage (approved April 11, 1983), provides as follows:
      </p>
      <p>
       “SECTION 2. The Legislature hereby finds and determines that:
      </p>
      <p>
       “(a) On September 3, 1982, the President of the United States signed the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (‘TEFRA’);
      </p>
      <p>
       “(b) TEFRA provides, among other things, that except in very limited cases the interest income on all bonds and other securities issued by states and their political subdivisions and other public bodies shall be subject to federal income taxation unless such bonds are issued in registered form;
      </p>
      <p>
       “(c) It is imperative to the interests of the state at large that the state and all of its political subdivisions and other public bodies shall have all of those powers which may be necessary or helpful to them to comply with TEFRA and thereby reduce the cost of borrowing money for the benefit of the people of this state;
      </p>
      <p>
       “(d) The municipal bond market may develop customs, practices and requirements that bonds in registered form must be subject to certain authentication, registration, transfer, payment and similar provisions in order to be readily acceptable in the municipal bond market;
      </p>
      <p>
       “(e) In many instances, the laws of this state do not grant the state and its political subdivisions and other public bodies the power to issue bonds in registered or book-entry form and to provide bonds with execution, authentication, registration, transfer, payment and other provisions needed for ready acceptance in the municipal bond market; and
      </p>
      <p>
       “(f) It is vital to the interest of the state at large that the state and all of its political subdivisions and other public bodies be granted the additional and supplemental powers conferred herein in order to have the ability of complying with the provisions of TEFRA and of responding to changes in the customs, practices and requirements of the municipal bond market.”

     </h3>
     <p>
      Notwithstanding any law or any provision of any law to the contrary, the following additional and supplemental powers and authorizations are hereby granted to the state and each political subdivision in connection with the issuance of any bonds:
     </p>
     <p>
      Such bonds may be issued in fully registered or book-entry form;
     </p>
     <p>
      All signatures and seals appearing on such bonds as required or permitted by law may be facsimile signatures and seals;
     </p>
     <p>
      Such bonds may be made subject to such authentication, registration, transfer and payment provisions as shall be set forth in the proceedings authorizing such bonds and the same may be made in such manner as shall be provided in such proceedings;
     </p>
     <p>
      The State Treasurer, the chancery clerk of the county or the chancery clerk of the county in which the political subdivision is located or has its principal office may act as registrar, paying agent, transfer agent, agent for the delivery and payment of such bonds, authenticating agent or otherwise, and the State Treasurer may collect a reasonable fee from the political subdivision for rendering such services;
     </p>
     <p>
      Banks and trust companies located either within or without the state may be appointed to act as registrars, paying agents, transfer agents, depositories for safekeeping, agents for the delivery and payment of such bonds, authenticating agents or otherwise, and agreements may be entered into with such banks and trust companies with respect to such duties and payment therefor;
     </p>
     <p>
      Any agreements to be entered into pursuant to paragraph (e) above may be negotiated without the necessity of competitive bids, and any payments to be made pursuant to such agreements may be made from the proceeds of the bonds to which such agreements apply or from any other moneys legally available therefor; and
     </p>
     <p>
      All things may be done regarding the form, execution, authentication, transfer and payment of such bonds which may be helpful in assuring compliance with any federal law applicable to such bonds or the interest income thereon and in assuring that such bonds will be readily acceptable in the municipal bond market, provided the same is not inconsistent with the constitution of the state.

      </p>
      <p>
       “WHEREAS, the state’s public welfare demands and the state’s policy requires the balanced economic development of this state, and the present and prospective health, education, safety, morals, pursuit of happiness, right to gainful employment and the general welfare of the citizens demand as a public purpose the development within Mississippi of commercial, industrial, agricultural and manufacturing enterprises by the development of projects by public entities authorized to issue bonds; and
      </p>
      <p>
       “WHEREAS, the financing of projects by the issuance of private activity bonds has been and will continue to be an integral part of the state’s program for promoting the state’s public welfare; and
      </p>
      <p>
       “WHEREAS, Public Law 99-514, Title XIII, ‘Tax-Exempt Bonds,’ Sections 1301-1318, amending
   Title 26, Section 103, of the United States Code, referred to herein as ‘federal legislation,’ limits the issuance of certain private activity bonds in a state to an amount not exceeding a given state’s ceiling, and thereby makes private activity bonds a limited resource; and
      </p>
      <p>
       “WHEREAS, the formula for allocating a state’s ceiling among the issuers in a state provided in the federal legislation is ill-suited to the needs of the State of Mississippi and its political subdivisions; and
      </p>
      <p>
       “WHEREAS, the Governor, exercising his interim authority granted under the federal legislation, issued an Executive Proclamation on October 20, 1986, which provides a formula different than that under the federal legislation for allocating the state’s ceiling among issuers and provides for the administration of the allocation of the state’s ceiling; however, such interim authority shall terminate after the earlier of December 31, 1987, or the effective date of a state law providing for a formula for allocating the state’s ceiling among issuers; and
      </p>
      <p>
       “WHEREAS, the means and measures herein authorized to allocate fairly the state’s ceiling on the amount of private activity bonds among issuers are, as a matter of public policy, for the public purposes of the several issuers and of the state; NOW, THEREFORE,
      </p>
      <p>
       “BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI:”
      </p>
      <p>
       Laws of 1987, ch. 522, § 12, effective from and after April 21, 1987, provides as follows:
      </p>
      <p>
       “This act shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage. The Governor’s Proclamation, issued on October 20, 1986, shall be controlling with respect to the matters set forth therein and any action taken thereunder until this act shall take effect. All lawful actions taken by the board pursuant to said Executive Proclamation prior to the effective date of this act shall be deemed to have been done in conformity with this act and all such actions are hereby ratified and approved.”

       § 31-23-57.
    Ceiling for issuance of private activity bonds; records; public notice.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The state’s ceiling for the issuance of private activity bonds is hereby established, and it shall be determined annually by the board in accordance with the federal legislation. The amount of the state’s ceiling available at any time shall be the amount determined by the board, which results from: (a) subtracting from the state’s ceiling the amount of bonds issued during the year of calculation pursuant to notices of allocation issued during the year of calculation and with respect to which confirmation of issuance has been received by the board on or before the applicable expiration date; and (b) subtracting from the state’s ceiling the amount of notices of allocation issued during the year of calculation and which are outstanding but with respect to which the expiration date has not occurred. The state’s ceiling shall be divided annually, for purposes of administering the system into two (2) parts: the threshold portion and the undesignated portion. The board shall keep records of the amount of the state’s ceiling available at any given time, including the amount of the threshold portion and the undesignated portion available for notices of allocation at any given time, and shall make available to the public, by periodic news releases and such other means as the board may determine to be appropriate, information with respect to the amount of the state’s ceiling, the threshold portion and the undesignated portion. All applications shall apply for, and all notices of allocation shall be given in integrals of One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00).

       § 31-23-59.
    Threshold portion of ceiling; applications for notices of allocation; fee; notices of allocation; confirmation of issuance; transfer of funds.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The threshold portion of the state’s ceiling is hereby established in an amount equal to fifty percent (50%) of the state’s ceiling for the year of calculation. Applications for notices of allocation from the threshold portion shall be received and acted on by the board as set forth in this section:
     </p>
     <p>
      All applications shall be filed on a form promulgated from time to time by the board. The application form shall set forth and include:
     </p>
     <p>
      The name and address of the issuer and each borrower;
     </p>
     <p>
      The dollar amount of the threshold portion requested;
     </p>
     <p>
      Whether the applicant requests that a partial allocation be granted in the event the board is unable to grant a notice of allocation for the full amount of the threshold portion requested;
     </p>
     <p>
      Whether, if a partial allocation is made, the applicant wishes the allocation shortfall to be treated as a separate application;
     </p>
     <p>
      Such additional qualifying criteria as the board may establish; and
     </p>
     <p>
      An allocation fee of One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00) to be deposited in the revolving fund established in Section 57-1-66.
     </p>
     <p>
      In addition, applications filed on or after November 1 of each year shall be accompanied by either of the following (unless previously filed with the board):
     </p>
     <p>
      A certified copy of the transcript of the proceeding of the governing body authorizing the issuance of the bonds; or
     </p>
     <p>
      1. A copy of the inducement resolution or other similar official action taken by the issuer with respect to the project which is the subject of the application, certified by an officer of the issuer; and
     </p>
     <p>
      2. A written statement of legal counsel or bond counsel, addressed to the board, to the effect that the issuer is authorized under the law of the state to issue bonds for projects of the same type and nature as the project which is the subject of the application. This statement shall cite by constitutional or statutory reference the provision of the constitution or law of the state which authorizes the bonds for the project; and
     </p>
     <p>
      3. Either
     </p>
     <p>
      a. In the case of a private placement of bonds, a written commitment from a lender, financial institution, underwriter or investment banker, addressed to the board, the borrower or the issuer, stating that the lender, financial institution, underwriter or investment banker, as the case may be, has agreed to purchase the bonds upon delivery by the issuer and setting forth the rate of interest to be borne by the bonds; or
     </p>
     <p>
      b. In the case of a public offering of bonds, a letter from a lender, financial institution, underwriter or investment banker addressed to the board, the borrower or the issuer, stating that the lender, financial institution, underwriter or investment banker, as the case may be, has agreed to tender a contract for the purchase of the bonds; and
     </p>
     <p>
      The board shall stamp or otherwise designate the date and time on which it receives each application. The application shall be considered approved upon review and approval by the bond committee or its designee pursuant to rules, regulations or qualifying criteria promulgated by the board. The application shall be stamped approved when each of the items required under paragraph (a) or paragraphs (a) and (b) above, as applicable, has been received in proper form by the board and approved by the bond committee or its designee. Any application which is not in proper form and which is determined not to be an approved application may be corrected and refiled at any time. Receipt shall be deemed to occur only on a business day.
     </p>
     <p>
      Within ten (10) days or no later than the last business day of the calendar year after the board receives the application the board shall:
     </p>
     <p>
      Give its notice of allocation, approving or denying the allocation requested by such application; or
     </p>
     <p>
      Give its notice of allocation, approving or denying less than the full amount requested by such application, if the applicant has so requested a partial allocation in the event the board is unable to approve the allocation requested; in such event, if the applicant has requested that the allocation shortfall be treated as a separate application, such allocation shortfall shall be treated as though it were a separate application filed on the date and time on which the original application was filed; or
     </p>
     <p>
      Give notice to the issuer that the allocation requested by the application has not been approved or denied because the threshold portion has been exhausted or is insufficient to make the requested allocation, and request written direction from the issuer or the borrower as to whether the board should retain the application for approval in the future or whether the application should be withdrawn or otherwise. If the threshold portion is insufficient to make the requested allocation and the applicant requests the board to hold its approved application until the full amount of the requested allocation can be granted, the board shall not give notices of allocation from the threshold portion for approved applications filed later than such approved application unless the board determines that it is unlikely that the full amount requested in such approved application will be available during the calendar year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Notices of allocation shall be given with respect to approved applications in the chronological order, by date and time, in which the approved applications were received by the board (except as otherwise provided in this paragraph), shall bear an effective date beginning on the date of issuance of the notice of allocation, and shall bear an expiration date as follows:
     </p>
     <p>
      Sixty (60) calendar days from the date of issuance, if issued on or after January 1, and on or before October 15;
     </p>
     <p>
      December 15, if issued after October 15, and prior to December 9;
     </p>
     <p>
      Seven (7) calendar days from the date of issuance, if issued on or after December 9, but in no event shall the expiration date be later than December 31.
     </p>
     <p>
      If at any time none of the threshold portion remains available for notices of allocation, but additional amounts of the threshold portion become available later in the year because confirmation of issuance was not received by the board on or before the applicable expiration date for any notice of allocation, or because the board has transferred any portion of the state’s ceiling to the threshold portion pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, the board shall give a notice of allocation with respect to approved applications earlier received, including any approved applications which failed to receive a notice of allocation pursuant to paragraph (d) above or for which an allocation shortfall was treated as a separate application. Such notices of allocation shall be given, to the extent that the threshold portion becomes available at such later time, with respect to approved applications in chronological order, by date and time, in which they were received by the board (except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d)(iii) of this section).
     </p>
     <p>
      When bonds covered by a notice of allocation have been issued, confirmation of issuance shall be filed with the board on or before the expiration date.
     </p>
     <p>
      If confirmation of issuance is not received by the board on or before the applicable expiration date, the amount covered by the particular notice of allocation shall automatically be returned to, and added to, the threshold portion, and shall be available for use in other notices of allocation; provided, if confirmation of issuance is received after the applicable expiration date, the board may, in its discretion and provided amounts are available for such project, treat such bonds as though confirmation of issuance had been received on or before the applicable expiration date.
     </p>
     <p>
      If confirmation of issuance is not received by the board on or before the applicable expiration date with respect to a notice of allocation, the issuer may file additional applications after the expiration date with respect to all or any part of the issue of bonds covered by such notice of allocation, but such applications shall be treated as filed on the next day after actually filed (and at the time of day such application was filed) for purposes of determining which applications shall receive a notice of allocation where the amount of approved applications on the actual day of filing exceeds the amount of the threshold portion available at that time for notices of allocation.
     </p>
     <p>
      If, and to the extent that, amounts requested pursuant to approved applications from the undesignated portion exceed the unused amount of the undesignated portion, the board may, at any time and from time to time between July 1 and October 31 of each year, transfer to the undesignated portion all or any part of the unused amount of the threshold portion in excess of the following percentages of the original threshold portion for that year:

    Undesignated portion of ceiling; applications for notices of allocation; fee; notices of allocation; confirmation of issuance.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The undesignated portion of the state’s ceiling is hereby established in an amount equal to fifty percent (50%) of the state’s ceiling. The undesignated portion shall include any amounts transferred to the undesignated portion by the board pursuant to this chapter. All allocations for bonds other than exempt small issue bonds shall be granted from the undesignated portion. Applications for notices of allocation from the undesignated portion shall be received and acted upon as follows:
     </p>
     <p>
      All applications shall be filed on a form promulgated from time to time by the board. The application form shall set forth: (i) the name and address of the issuer and each borrower; (ii) the dollar amount of the undesignated portion requested; (iii) whether the applicant requests that a partial allocation be granted in the event the board is unable to grant a notice of allocation for the full amount of the undesignated portion requested.
     </p>
     <p>
      In addition, applications filed on or after November 1 of each year shall be accompanied by the following:
     </p>
     <p>
      The items which are required to accompany applications for notices of allocation from the threshold portion set forth in Section 31-23-59(b)(i) or Section 31-23-59(b)(ii), except that such items shall specify amounts as to the undesignated portion.
     </p>
     <p>
      A written opinion of bond counsel, addressed to the board to the effect that the bonds which are covered by the application will, based upon the information available at that time to such bond counsel, qualify as tax-exempt bonds under applicable federal law when issued.
     </p>
     <p>
      An allocation application fee of One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00) to be deposited in the revolving fund provided for in Section 57-1-66.
     </p>
     <p>
      The board shall stamp or otherwise designate the date and time on which it receives each application. The application shall be considered approved upon review and approval by the bond committee or its designee pursuant to rules, regulations or qualifying criteria promulgated by the board. The application shall be stamped approved when each of the items required under paragraphs (a) and (b) above, as applicable, has been received in proper form by the board and approved by the bond committee or its designee. Any application which is not in proper form and which is determined not to be an approved application may be corrected and refiled at any time. Receipt shall be deemed to occur only on a business day.
     </p>
     <p>
      Within ten (10) days or no later than the last business day of the calendar year after the board receives the approved application the board shall:
     </p>
     <p>
      Give its notice of allocation, approving the allocation requested by such application; or
     </p>
     <p>
      Give its notice of partial allocation, approving less than the full amount of the allocation requested by such application, if the applicant has so requested a partial allocation in the event the board is unable to approve the allocation requested. In such event, if the applicant has requested that the allocation shortfall be treated as a separate application, such allocation shortfall shall be treated as though it were a separate application filed on the date and time on which the original application was filed; or
     </p>
     <p>
      Give notice to the issuer that the allocation requested by the application has not been approved because the undesignated portion has been exhausted, or is insufficient to make the requested allocation and request written direction from the issuer or the borrower as to whether the board should retain the application for approval in the future or whether the application should be withdrawn or otherwise.
     </p>
     <p>
      Such notices of allocation shall be given with respect to approved applications in chronological order, by date and time, in which the approved applications were received by the board, shall bear an effective date beginning on the date of issuance of the notice of allocation, and shall bear an expiration date as follows:
     </p>
     <p>
      Sixty (60) calendar days from the date of issuance, if issued on or after January 1, and on or before October 15.
     </p>
     <p>
      December 15, if issued after October 15 and prior to December 9.
     </p>
     <p>
      Seven (7) calendar days from the date of issuance, if issued on or after December 9, but in no event shall an expiration date be later than December 31.
     </p>
     <p>
      If at any time none of the undesignated portion remains available for notices of allocation, but additional amounts of the undesignated portion become available later in the year because confirmation of issuance was not received by the board on or before the applicable expiration date for any notice of allocation or because the board has transferred any portion of the state’s ceiling to the undesignated portion pursuant to this chapter, the board shall give a notice of allocation with respect to approved applications earlier received, including any approved applications which failed to receive a notice of allocation pursuant to paragraph (d) above or for which an allocation shortfall was treated as a separate application. Such notices of allocation shall be given to the extent that the undesignated portion becomes available at such later times, with respect to approved applications in chronological order, by date and time, in which they were received by the board.
     </p>
     <p>
      When bonds covered by a notice of allocation have been issued, confirmation of issuance shall be filed with the board on or before the expiration date.
     </p>
     <p>
      If confirmation of issuance is not received by the board on or before the applicable expiration date, the amount covered by the particular notice of allocation shall automatically be returned to, and added to, the undesignated portion, and shall be available for use in other notices of allocation; provided, if confirmation of issuance is received after the applicable expiration date, the board may, in its discretion and provided amounts are available for such project, treat such bonds as though confirmation of issuance had been received on or before the applicable expiration date.
     </p>
     <p>
      If confirmation of issuance is not received by the board on or before the applicable expiration date with respect to a notice of allocation from the undesignated portion, the issuer may file additional applications after the expiration date with respect to all or any part of the issue of bonds covered by such notice of allocation, but such applications shall be treated as filed on the next day after actually filed (and at the time of day such application was filed) for purposes of determining which applications shall receive a notice of allocation where the amount of approved applications on the actual day of filing exceeds the amount of the undesignated portion available at that time for notices of allocation.

       The student loan portion of the state’s ceiling is hereby established, and an allocation thereto is hereby made from the undesignated portion in the amount of Thirteen Million Dollars ($13,000,000.00) (excluding carry-forward elections) in calendar year 1987. For the 1989 calendar year a total of Thirty-five Million Dollars ($35,000,000.00), less the aggregate of all carry-forward allocations to student loan projects from the state’s ceiling for 1987 and 1988 (other than any carry-forward of all or part of the Thirteen Million Dollars ($13,000,000.00) allocation for 1987 described above), is hereby allocated from the undesignated portion to the student loan portion. Additional amounts may be allocated to the student loan portion pursuant to the provisions of Section 31-23-61, and such notices of allocation shall remain valid from the date of issuance until the last business day of that year, notwithstanding the provisions of Section 31-23-61(e).

Any amount of the student loan allocation which the issuer does not certify that it reasonably expects to utilize, and which another issuer may utilize in accordance with the federal legislation, may be transferred from time to time by the board, in whole or in part, to the threshold portion or the undesignated portion. If such a transfer is made, an amount equal to that transferred shall be allocated from the undesignated portion of the state’s ceiling to the student loan portion in the succeeding calendar year in addition to the amounts allocated to the student loan portion for that year as set forth above.

      Any written statements or opinions of bond counsel and legal counsel and the commitment from a lender, financial institution, underwriter or investment banker accompanying any applications shall be dated no more than thirty (30) days prior to the date on which the application is filed. Such opinions, commitments and any other items accompanying an application shall be in substantially the form or forms promulgated or required by the board from time to time.

     <p>
      The board shall maintain a record of the notices of allocation issued and the amount of the state’s ceiling available from time to time and related data in a register thereof. Notices of allocation shall be deemed to be issued when such allocation is registered in the register. Other notices and written communications from the board shall be deemed to have been given when duly deposited in the United States mail, first class, with all postage prepaid. Notices of allocation may, at the request of the applicant, be picked up by hand at the offices of the board or be delivered by courier or other delivery service at the expense of the applicant. Notices and other written communications to, and filings with, the board shall be deemed given or made when actually received by the board, whether by actual delivery to the offices of the board or by United States mail, first class, with all postage prepaid.
     </p>
     <p>
      Notwithstanding anything in this act to the contrary, the board may give a notice of its intention during any year to issue a notice of allocation during the next year. Such notice of intention shall be for informational purposes only, and shall not be binding upon the board.

     <p>
      It is hereby determined and declared to be the policy of the state that, for the benefit of the people of the State of Mississippi, it is essential to foster and promote by all reasonable means the provision of adequate access to capital markets and facilities for borrowing money to finance infrastructure improvements and other public purposes from the proceeds of bonds and to the extent possible to reduce costs of indebtedness to taxpayers and residents of the state through the encouragement of investor interest in the purchase of such bonds as sound and preferred securities for investment. It is further found and declared that the state should exercise its powers to further and implement these policies by authorizing an independent public body to be created and to have full power to borrow money and to issue its bonds and notes to make funds available at reduced rates and on more favorable terms for borrowing as provided in this act. This act shall be liberally construed to accomplish the intentions, purposes and objects expressed herein.

Whenever any such loan is made to a local governmental unit, such local governmental unit may use available revenues for the repayment of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on such loan, and pledge such available revenues or monies for the repayment of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on such loan. It is the intention of the Legislature that any such pledge of revenues or other monies shall be valid and binding from the date the pledge is made; that such revenues or other monies so pledged and thereafter received by the local governmental unit shall immediately be subject to the lien of such pledge without any physical delivery thereof or further act, and that the lien of any such pledge shall be valid and binding as against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract or otherwise against the local governmental unit irrespective of whether such parties have notice thereof; and neither the resolutions, contracts or any other instrument by which a pledge is created need be recorded.

Such resolution shall be published once a week for at least three (3) consecutive weeks in at least one (1) newspaper published in such local governmental unit. The first publication of such resolution shall be made not less than twenty-one (21) days before the date fixed in such resolution for the authorization of the loan and the last publication shall be made not more than seven (7) days before such date. If no newspaper is published in such local governmental unit, then such notice shall be given by publishing the resolution for the required time in some newspaper having a general circulation in such local governmental unit and, in addition, by posting a copy of such resolution for at least twenty-one (21) days next preceding the date fixed therein at three (3) public places in such local governmental unit. If fifteen percent (15%) of the qualified electors of the local governmental unit or fifteen hundred (1500), whichever is the lesser, file a written protest against the authorization of such loan on or before the date specified in such resolution, then an election on the question of the authorization of such loan shall be called and held as otherwise provided for in connection with the issuance of general obligation indebtedness of such local governmental unit. Notice of such election shall be given as otherwise required in connection with the issuance of general obligation indebtedness of such local governmental unit. If three-fifths (3/5) of the qualified electors voting in the election vote in favor of authorizing the loan, then the governing authority of the local governmental unit shall proceed with the loan; however, if less than three-fifths (3/5) of the qualified electors voting in the election vote in favor of authorizing the loan, then the loan shall not be incurred. If no protest be filed, then such loan may be entered into by the local governmental unit without an election on the question of the authorization of such loan, at any time within a period of two (2) years after the date specified in the resolution. However, the governing authority of any local governmental unit in its discretion may nevertheless call an election on such question, in which event it shall not be necessary to publish the resolution declaring its intention to authorize such loan as provided in this subsection.

Bonds issued by the bank shall not constitute or become an indebtedness, or a debt or liability of the state or of any local governmental unit nor shall any such entity other than the bank (in the case of its general obligations) be liable thereon, nor shall bonds or any powers granted herein to the state or agency thereof or local governmental unit constitute the giving, pledging or loaning of the faith and credit of the state or such agency thereof or of such local governmental unit. The issuance of bonds hereunder shall not directly, indirectly or contingently obligate the state to levy or collect any form of taxes or assessments therefor or to create any indebtedness payable out of taxes or assessments or make any appropriation for their payment nor to pledge the taxing power of the state and such levy or pledge is prohibited; however, notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit any local governmental unit (including the state or any agency thereof) from assuming obligations in accordance with and subject to the limitations of this act or from issuing and selling municipal securities to the bank in accordance herewith. Nothing in this act shall be construed to authorize the bank to create a debt of the state within the meaning of the constitution or statutes of the state or authorize the bank to levy or collect taxes or assessments and bonds issued by the bank pursuant to the provisions of this act are payable and shall state plainly on their face that they are payable solely as general obligations of the bank, or solely from the funds pledged for their payment in accordance with the resolution authorizing their issuance or in any trust indenture or mortgage or deed of trust executed as security therefor, as the case may be, and are not a debt or liability of the state. The state shall not in any event be liable for the payment of the principal or interest on any bonds of the bank or for the performance of any pledge, mortgage, obligations or agreement of any kind whatsoever which may be undertaken by the bank. No breach of any such pledge, mortgage, obligation or agreement shall impose any pecuniary liability upon the state or any charge upon its general credit or against its taxing power. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to prohibit any local governmental unit (including the state or any agency thereof) from assuming obligations in accordance with and subject to the limitations of this act or from issuing and selling any security to the bank in accordance with this act.

The bonds and coupons appertaining thereto may be executed in such manner as shall be determined by the bank. In case any of the members or officers of the bank whose signatures appear on any bonds or coupons shall cease to be such members or officers before the delivery of such bonds, such signatures shall, nevertheless, be valid and sufficient for all purposes, the same as if such members or officers had remained in office until such delivery.

The board of the bank may also provide in the resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds, in its discretion, (a) for the employment of one or more persons or firms to assist the bank in the sale of the bonds, (b) for the appointment of one or more banks or trust companies, either within or without the State of Mississippi, as depository for safekeeping, and as agent for the delivery and payment, of the bonds, (c) for the refunding of such bonds, from time to time, without further action by the board of the bank, unless and until the board of the bank revokes such authority to refund, and (d) other terms and conditions as the board of the bank may deem appropriate. In connection with the issuance and sale of such bonds, the board of the bank may arrange for lines of credit with any bank, firm or person for the purpose of providing an additional source of repayment for bonds issued pursuant to this section. Amounts drawn on such lines of credit may be evidenced by negotiable or nonnegotiable bonds or other evidences of indebtedness, containing such terms and conditions as the board of the bank may authorize in the resolution approving the same, and such notes or other evidences of indebtedness shall constitute bonds issued under their act.

      In the discretion of the bank, the bonds may be secured by a trust indenture by and between the bank and a corporate trustee. Such trust indenture may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the duties of the bank in relation to the exercise of its corporate powers and the custody, safeguarding and application of all moneys. The bank may provide by such trust indenture for the payment of the proceeds of the bonds and revenues to the trustee under such trust indenture or other depository, and for the method of disbursement thereof with such safeguards and restrictions as it may determine. All expenses incurred in carrying out such trust indenture may be treated as a part of the operating expenses of the bank. If the bonds shall be secured by a trust indenture, the bondholders shall not have the right to appoint a separate trustee to represent them.

      Bonds issued by the bank under Section 31-25-21(k) for the purposes provided in Section 31-25-20(g) shall be general obligations of the State of Mississippi, and for the payment thereof the full faith and credit of the State of Mississippi is irrevocably pledged.

      Upon the adoption of a resolution by the Board of Directors of the Institute for Technology Development declaring the necessity for the issuance of any part or all of the general obligation bonds authorized by this chapter, the board shall deliver a certified copy of its resolution to the State Board of Economic Development, the Chairmen of the Appropriations Committees of the Senate and the House of Representatives, the Chairman of the Finance Committee of the Senate and the Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee of the House of Representatives. Upon receipt of the resolution, the Board of Economic Development may approve such bond issuance by resolution and certify such resolution to the State Bond Commission. Upon the receipt of same, the State Bond Commission shall issue and sell bonds in an amount requested, and do any and all things necessary and advisable in connection with the issuance and sale of such bonds. For the payment of such bonds and the interest thereon, the full faith, credit and taxing power of the State of Mississippi are hereby irrevocably pledged. If the Legislature shall find that there are funds available in the General Fund of the Treasury of the State of Mississippi in amounts sufficient to pay maturity, principal and accruing interest of such general obligation bonds and if the Legislature shall appropriate such available funds for the purpose of paying such maturity, principal and accruing interest, then the principal, maturity and accruing interest of such bonds shall be paid from appropriations made from the General Fund of the Treasury of the State of Mississippi by the Legislature thereof; but if there are not available sufficient funds in the General Fund of the Treasury of the State of Mississippi to pay the maturity, principal and accruing interest of such bonds, or if such funds are available and the Legislature should fail to appropriate a sufficient amount thereof to pay such principal and accruing interest as the same becomes due, then, and in that event, there shall annually be levied upon all taxable property within the State of Mississippi an ad valorem tax at a rate sufficient to provide the funds required to pay the bonds at maturity and the interest thereon as the same accrues. Such bonds shall bear such date or dates, be in such denomination or denominations, bear interest at such rate or rates (not to exceed that rate established in Section 75-17-101, Mississippi Code of 1972), be payable at such place or places within or without the State of Mississippi, shall mature absolutely at such time or times, be redeemable prior to maturity at such time or times and upon such terms, with or without premium, shall bear such registration privileges, and shall be substantially in such form, all as shall be determined by resolution of the State Bond Commission. Such bonds shall be signed by the Chairman of the State Bond Commission or by his facsimile signature, and the official seal of the State Bond Commission shall be affixed thereto, attested by the Secretary of the State Bond Commission. The interest coupons to be attached to such bonds may be executed by the facsimile signatures of such officers. Whenever any such bonds shall have been signed by the officials herein designated to sign the bonds who were in office at the time of such signing but who may have ceased to be such officers prior to the sale and delivery of such bonds, or who may not have been in office on the date such bonds may bear, the signatures of such officers upon such bonds and coupons shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes and have the same effect as if the person so officially signing such bonds had remained in office until the delivery of the same to the purchaser or had been in office on the date such bonds may bear.
