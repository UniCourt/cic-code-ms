     <p>
      The governor of the state is authorized to accept gifts of land to the state, not to exceed ten percent (10%) of the area of any county, to be held, protected, and administered by the State Forestry Commission as state forests and parks and to be used to demonstrate their practical utility for reforestation and as breeding places for wild game, and he is authorized to accept gifts of land to be used and administered by the commission as state parks. Such gifts must be absolute, except for the reservation of any or all mineral rights, and in no case shall exceed ten percent (10%) of the area of any county wherein such lands may be situated. The Attorney General is directed to see that all deeds to the state are properly executed and that the titles thereto are free and clear of all encumbrances before the gift is accepted. When any donation exceeding six hundred acres is made, the name of the donor or any name he may suggest, on the approval of the commission shall be given such donation as the designation of such forest or park.

       Power of a county which has purchased and conveyed land to the state for a state park under authority of Code 1942, § 6037, to reserve to itself all the minerals therein under this section [Code 1942, § 6024], does not confer implied power upon the county to convey to private party the minerals in such land. Pike County v. Bilbo, 198 Miss. 775, 23 So. 2d 530, 23 So. 2d 672, 1945 Miss. LEXIS 246 (Miss. 1945).

       Land which was never used for county purposes until purchased by county for purpose of immediate conveyance to the state for a state park under authority of Code 1942, § 6037, and which thereafter was used by the county as contemplated in its purchase, did not “cease” to be used for county purposes within the meaning of Code 1942, § 2892 authorizing board of supervisors to sell real estate belonging to the county when it shall “cease to be used for county purposes,” and consequently board of supervisors did not have express authority to convey to private party the oil and other minerals in part of such land, even though in the conveyance to the state the county had reserved to itself all the oil and other mineral rights in such lands.

    Transfer and dedication of lands for use as state forests, parks, etc.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The commission shall investigate and determine whether or not the public interests may be served by the utilization of any lands owned by the State of Mississippi, for state forests, parks, game and fish preserves, recreation centers, and for other public purposes, and the findings of the commission shall be submitted to the board of supervisors of the county wherein such lands lie. Thereupon the clerk of the board of supervisors shall post, or cause to be posted, in three (3) public places in said county, one (1) of which shall be the courthouse of said county, a notice setting out the findings of the commission and describing the lands involved and reciting that a hearing will be had before said board at its first regular meeting held after the expiration of twenty-one (21) days from the date of posting such notice, and that at such meeting any objections to the proposed transfer and dedication will be heard. Furthermore, the chancery clerk shall send by registered mail, with a return receipt requested, a copy of such notice to each person shown by the assessment rolls to have been the owner or of any of the lands concerned should such lands have been sold for taxes. However, any irregularity in the giving of such notice, either by posting or by mail, shall not invalidate any transfer or dedication made. After such hearing, the board of supervisors shall spread its findings upon its minutes, and if the transfer and dedication be approved, a certified copy of such findings shall be forwarded to the commission. The commission upon receipt of such resolution shall forward the same, together with its findings as to the description of such transfer and dedication, to the Governor. If he finds that the board of supervisors of the county wherein such lands lie has approved such transfer and dedication, he may, in his discretion, set aside and dedicate any lands owned by the state for such purposes above mentioned. After the Governor has proclaimed, set aside and dedicated any lands for such purposes, the same shall not thereafter be sold. However, no lands forfeited to the state for nonpayment of taxes thereon shall be so transferred and dedicated until after the expiration of eighteen (18) months after the date of maturity of such tax titles in the state.

      There is hereby established in the State Treasury a revolving fund to be used by the State Forestry Commission to carry out the provisions of the will of William W. Kurtz, dated July 12, 1940, which donated one thousand seven hundred sixty (1,760) acres of forestland in Greene County to the State of Mississippi to be held, protected, administered and improved by the State Forestry Commission as a state forest. The fund shall be called the Kurtz State Forest Revolving Fund, and money for the fund shall accrue from any revenues derived from the Kurtz State Forest including, but not limited to, timber sales, hunting leases, permit fees, and stump and naval stores operations. The State Forestry Commission is authorized to expend a portion of the moneys in the fund to purchase in the name of the State of Mississippi other lands, not to exceed five hundred (500) acres, which are contiguous to or located near the lands donated by the Kurtz will, for the purpose of expanding the Kurtz State Forest. The State Forestry Commission also may expend moneys in the fund for the purposes described in Section 55-3-23. The State Treasurer shall invest all moneys in the fund, and interest earned on the investments shall be paid back into the fund and not into the General Fund. The fund shall be audited annually by the State Auditor.

       In order to carry out its management responsibilities over all state park lands which are now or which may hereafter come under its jurisdiction, the Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks is hereby authorized to lease, and to grant easements and rights-of-way over and across, any part of such state park lands. Such leases, easements and rights-of-way may be granted for such consideration, and upon such terms and conditions, as the department may deem to be in the best interest of the state, consistent with the use of said lands for recreational purposes, and subject to the following limitations: The department shall lease such lands for a term not exceeding twenty-five (25) years and shall grant in the original lease contract a nonnegotiable option to renew such lease for an additional term not to exceed twenty-five (25) years. Both the original lease contract and the option to renew such lease shall be transferable contracts. Further, the department shall not lease such lands for purposes which are incompatible with recreational use and may place such terms, limitations, restrictions and conditions in such leases as are deemed necessary to ensure the proper utilization of such lands. Any easement for a utility line shall be granted for that period of time which the department deems to be in the best interest of a state park.
      </li>
      <li id="t55c03s55-3-47ol12">
       The department is further authorized to enter into such agreements as may be required, upon such terms as may be found to be in the best interest of the state, in settlement of disputes or litigation regarding the title to or boundaries of any state park lands within the jurisdiction of the department, provided such settlement agreements shall be negotiated and drafted with the advice, counsel and assistance of the Attorney General and shall be approved by the Department of Finance and Administration.
      </li>
      <li id="t55c03s55-3-47ol13">
       In case any of the real estate within any state park under the jurisdiction of the department shall cease to be used or useful for state park purposes, or becomes the subject of boundary or title disputes or litigation, the department may sell and convey the same, with the approval of the Department of Finance and Administration, upon such terms as the Department of Finance and Administration may elect and may, in addition, exchange the same, with the approval of the department, for real estate belonging to any other political subdivision or state, county or local governmental agency or department. The department is authorized to sell and convey or otherwise transfer any state park or historical site as described in subsection (2) of Section 55-3-33. Before any such sale or transfer, except as may occur in settlement of title or boundary disputes or litigation, the department shall publish notice of its intention to sell the park land by public sale to the highest and best bidder at least once each week for three (3) consecutive weeks in at least one (1) public newspaper of general circulation in the county where such land is located and also in at least one (1) newspaper of general circulation throughout the state. Prior to any such sale, the department shall obtain at least two (2) separate and independent appraisals of the land to be sold and may not accept any bid lower than the average of all appraisals made. The department may reject any and all bids. The owner or any co-owner of record next preceding the state in title to any lands sold hereunder by public bid, excluding any entity which may have exercised the power of eminent domain to assist the state in acquiring said lands, shall have the opportunity to reacquire such lands by matching the successful bid therefor. If the owner or any co-owner of record next preceding the state in title, or the heirs or estate of such owner or co-owner, acquires said lands, then the department shall not reserve unto the state any minerals owned by the state underlying the conveyed lands. However, if anyone other than such owner or co-owner, or his heirs or estate, acquires said lands, then the department shall reserve unto the state one-half (1/2) of the minerals owned by the state underlying the conveyed lands, except for lands sold in settlement of title or boundary disputes or litigation, in which case the department may, in its discretion, reserve said minerals. Appraisal fees shall be shared equally by the department and purchaser.

       In exercising the authority granted in this section, the department may act by and through its executive director in the execution of any document or instrument prepared hereunder. Any lease, deed or settlement agreement executed under the provisions of this section shall bear the seal and attest of the Secretary of State, with whom said instrument or document shall be filed and recorded in addition to any other recording requirements of state law.

       Laws of 2007, ch. 310, §§ 1 and 2, provide as follows:
      </p>
      <p>
       “SECTION 1. The Legislature finds that in 2004 several state parks were requiring substantial subsidies from the General Fund, and the Mississippi Commission on Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks was directed to promptly dispose of those parks through closure, lease, sale or transfer. The Nanih Waiya State Park was one of those state parks to be promptly disposed of by the commission. Nanih Waiya is the site of a sacred mound of the Choctaw Nation and on lands ceded to the United States by the Choctaw Nation under the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek. The Nanih Waiya Mound is venerated by the Choctaws and the site is considered to be the birthplace of the Choctaws. The Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians desires to have this site of great historical significance to the Choctaws returned to them. The Legislature finds that it is in the public interest to return this historical site of the Choctaw Indians to the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians.
      </p>
      <p>
       “SECTION 2. The Commission on Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks and the Department of Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks shall take any and all actions necessary to donate and to convey the Nanih Waiya State Park to the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians. The executive director of the department is authorized to execute any document or instrument to accomplish the donation and conveyance of the park.”

       The Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks is hereby authorized and empowered to sell and dispose of timber, trees, deadwood and stumps standing, growing and being upon the lands of state parks. Such timber shall be sold and disposed of under the direction and specifications of the Department of Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks in accordance with sound and efficient principles of selective cutting, forestry management and conservation.
       <p>
        Before any such timber, trees, deadwood and stumps shall be sold, the Department of Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks shall select and mark the trees to be cut and disposed of. No trees or timber shall be marked for cutting when the cutting thereof would destroy or mar the scenic views from the tourist observation points in said park. The purchaser shall pay double price on sale basis for all trees, timber or stumps cut that had not been marked for removing by the Department of Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks.
       </p>
       <p>
        Before any such timber, trees, deadwood or stumps standing, growing or being upon such land shall be sold, the department shall advertise its intention so to do by publication in a newspaper published or having general circulation in the county or counties where parks are located, such notice to be published at least once a week for three (3) consecutive weeks preceding the sale and by posting one (1) notice in the courthouse in such county. The notice shall specify that such bids shall be filed with the superintendent of the state park involved, who shall transmit same to the Department of Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks for rejection or approval. Said department shall accept the bid of the highest and best bidder for cash, but shall have the right to reject any and all of such bids.
       </p>
       <p>
        Provided, however, in the case of damage by fire, windstorm, insects or other natural causes which would require immediate sale of the timber, because the time involved for advertisement as prescribed herein would allow decay, rot or destruction substantially decreasing the purchase price to be received had not such delay occurred, the advertisement provisions of this section shall not apply. The State Park Director, upon a written recommendation from the county forester of the county wherein said state park is located, shall determine when immediate sale of the timber is required. When the State Park Director shall find an immediate sale necessary for the causes stated herein, he shall, in his discretion, set the time for receipt of bids on the purchase of said timber, but shall show due diligence in notifying competitive bidders so that a true competitive bid shall be received.
       </p>
       <p>
        Whenever any timber, trees, deadwood or stumps are sold under the provisions of this section, the purchaser thereof shall have all necessary rights of ingress and egress to enter upon said land and cut and remove such timber, trees, deadwood or stumps.
       </p>
       <p>
        The proceeds derived or received from all sales under the provisions of this section shall be placed in the State Parks Timber Management Endowment Fund created under Section 55-3-54.

      As supplemental to and in addition to all other power and authority which may now be vested in the Governor of the State of Mississippi by the constitution or statutes, or both, or any power or authority which may be vested in him by common law as Governor, as such, the Governor of the State of Mississippi is hereby vested with the authority to close any or all state parks in the State of Mississippi when, in his discretion, he determines such closure would be to the best interest of the county or counties in which any state park or parks may be situated, or whenever he so determines such to be to the best interest of the State of Mississippi. The said Governor, as such, is also vested with such supplemental and additional authority to close any or all state parks in the State of Mississippi when, in his discretion, he determines such closure will promote or preserve the public peace, order or tranquility of the county or counties in which such park or parks may be situated, or that such closure will promote or preserve the public peace, order or tranquility in and of the State of Mississippi.

     <p>
      The board of supervisors of any county within the State of Mississippi through which or adjoining which the United States government or any of its agencies desires to construct a roadway or a roadway and parkway in connection therewith, shall have full power to donate such rights of way, together with scenic easements of such additional lands as may be required by the United States government, for the purpose of constructing such roadway or roadway and parkway. Any and all counties in the State of Mississippi are authorized to receive by donation, gift, will or purchase with county funds, any and all necessary lands, rights of way or scenic easements, and after the acquisition of such lands, rights of way or scenic easements may, by resolution or deed or other authorization of the board of supervisors of such county, convey same to the United States or to such subordinate agency of the United States as may be required for the establishment of such roadway or roadway and parkway.
     </p>
     <p>
      The board of supervisors of any county in the State of Mississippi is hereby expressly vested with the power of eminent domain to condemn for public use as a public park and for scenic easement all lands adjoining such public park or parkway and for road or roadways and to acquire title to all or any part of the lands which such board of supervisors may deem necessary for the purposes of complying with the requirements of the United States government in the establishment of any national roadway or roadway and parkway through the State of Mississippi. Such right of condemnation shall include the right to condemn houses, outbuildings, orchards, yards, gardens and other improvements on such lands. Said board of supervisors is authorized to acquire all or any right, title or interest in and to all or any part of such lands and the improvements thereon by the right of eminent domain in condemnation proceedings or by gift, devise, purchase or any other lawful means for the transfer of title. Such condemnation proceedings shall be carried out and executed as are condemnation proceedings by the highway department of the State of Mississippi as authorized under the laws of the State of Mississippi.
     </p>
     <p>
      The United States government, or any of its subsidiary agencies, shall have complete control and supervision, severally or in connection with any county or counties in the State of Mississippi or with the highway department of the State of Mississippi, with full power and authority to locate, relocate, widen, alter, change, straighten, construct or reconstruct roads or rights of way, parkways or lands covered by scenic easements on any federal parkway, highway or trace being constructed by the United States government or any of its subsidiary subdivisions or severally or jointly with any county or counties in the State of Mississippi or with the state highway department of the State of Mississippi and shall have full and complete authority for the making of all contracts, surveys, plans and specifications and estimates for the location, laying out, widening, straightening, altering, changing, constructing, reconstructing and maintaining and securing rights of way therefor of any and all such highways, parkways, and scenic easements and shall further have the right to authorize its employees and agents to enter upon property for such purposes. The said United States government severally and any county or counties in the State of Mississippi and the said highway department, either jointly or severally, is further authorized and empowered to obtain and pay for rights of way to such width and extent as may be necessary to meet the requirement of the United States government for the construction and building of new parkway or roadway or scenic highway in the State of Mississippi. Such political authorities, either jointly or severally shall have the right to condemn or acquire by gift or purchase lands necessary for the building and maintenance of said roadway, parkway or trace.
     </p>
     <p>
      In event that said political authority or authorities so acting, either jointly or severally, shall be unable to agree with the owners of land necessary for widening any existing public highways which shall be used as a part of said national roadway or parkway or for the building of said roadway or parkway or for the laying out of any public highway or parkway in connection therewith or changing the route of an existing public highway, then the said political authority or authorities, either jointly or severally, aforesaid, shall be authorized to condemn any land needed for any of said purposes. The proceedings to acquire such lands by condemnation shall be in conformity with the statute on the subject of eminent domain under the laws of the State of Mississippi, the power of eminent domain being hereby expressly conferred upon said political subdivision or authorities for that purpose.
     </p>
     <p>
      Such proceedings shall take precedence over all other causes not involving the public interest in all courts and shall be given preference to the end that construction and reconstructions of highways and parkways may not be unreasonably delayed, but the same may be fully expedited. The amount of such compensation and damages, if any, awarded to the owner in such proceedings shall be paid by the respective counties in which the lands obtained for such highway or parkway may be located unless funds are otherwise provided by the State of Mississippi for the acquisition of such lands.

      The United States of America is authorized to acquire by deed or conveyance, gift, will or otherwise lands for the purpose of roadways and parkways as set forth in Sections 55-5-1 through 55-5-17, but this consent is given upon condition that the State of Mississippi shall retain a concurrent jurisdiction with the United States in and over such lands so far that civil process in all cases and such criminal process as may issue under the authority of the State of Mississippi against any person charged with the commission of any crime, without or within said jurisdiction, may be executed thereon in like manner as if this consent had not been given. Power is hereby conferred on the Congress of the United States to pass such laws as it may deem necessary for the acquisition of the said lands and for their incorporation in national roadways, parkways or national parks, and to pass such laws and make or provide for the making of such rules and regulations, of both civil and criminal nature, and to provide punishment therefor as in its judgment may be necessary for the management, control and protection of such lands as may be acquired by the United States under the provisions of the aforesaid sections, including such lands as are acquired not only for highway and parkway and park purposes but also those lands over which scenic easements are acquired for such purposes. Nevertheless, such jurisdiction shall not vest in the United States of America unless and until it, through the proper officer or officers, notifies the governor and, through him, the State of Mississippi that the United States of America assumes concurrent police jurisdiction over the land or lands thus deeded and conveyed. There is saved to the State of Mississippi the right to tax sales of gasoline and other motor vehicle fuels and oils for use in motor vehicles and to tax persons and corporations, their franchises and properties, on all land or lands deeded or conveyed as aforesaid. There is saved to persons residing in or on any of the land or lands deeded or conveyed as aforesaid, the right to vote at all elections within the county in which said land or lands are located, upon like terms and conditions and to the same extent as they would be entitled to vote in such county had not such lands been deeded or conveyed as aforesaid to the United States of America.

     <p>
      The intent of this section is to assent to any act of the United States Congress authorizing the development of any national parkway located wholly or partly within the State of Mississippi, to the full extent that is necessary to secure any benefits under such act, provided that the hunting of migratory water fowl and other game and fishing shall not be prohibited or otherwise restricted by the United States government or any of its designated agencies in control of said project. It is the further intent of this section to authorize the appropriate state boards, commissions, and departments, and especially the state highway commission, and the governing bodies of counties, cities, towns and villages, to cooperate in the planning and development of all national parkways that may be proposed for development in Mississippi, with any agency or department of the government of the United States in which is vested the necessary authority to construct or otherwise develop such national parkways. Whenever authority shall exist for the planning and development of any national parkway, of which any portion shall be located in this state, it shall be the duty of the state highway commission to make such investigations and studies in cooperation with the appropriate federal agency, and such state boards, commissions and departments as shall have an interest in such parkway development, to the extent that shall be desirable and necessary in order to provide that the state shall secure all advantages that may accrue through such parkway development and that the interests of the counties, cities, villages and towns along the route shall be conserved.

      The bridge and park commission shall have the power, among others, in the case of the municipal agency, to acquire for park, recreational, harbor development and other similar purposes, by the exercise of eminent domain or otherwise, and by gift, grant or purchase, for any purpose of this chapter, an island or islands, in whole or in part, situated in the Gulf of Mexico or in the Mississippi Sound, and lying within three leagues of the nearest point of the corporate limits of the municipality involved; and, in the case of the county agency, to acquire for park, recreational, harbor development and other similar purposes by the exercise of eminent domain or otherwise, and by gift, grant or purchase, for any purpose of this chapter, an island or islands, in whole or in part, situated in the Gulf of Mexico or in the Mississippi Sound, and lying within the boundaries of the county involved.
     </p>
     <p>
      Said commission shall have the power to acquire, by eminent domain, gift, grant or purchase, such portion or portions of such island or islands as it may find to be needed for use in developing and financing the public improvements set forth in this chapter. Prior to the acquisition of any such real estate, the commission shall, by resolution spread upon its minutes, find, determine and adjudicate that the property to be so acquired is needed to aid in the financing of the improvements under this chapter.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any such commission which has acquired an island or islands, in whole or in part, adjacent to any submerged lands belonging to the State of Mississippi may purchase from the State of Mississippi a sufficient amount of such submerged lands to be reclaimed and added to such island or islands to be used, and developed for the purposes provided in this chapter. The state land commissioner, with the approval of the attorney general and the governor, is hereby authorized and empowered to sell and convey such submerged lands to such commission and to issue the state’s patent thereto. Said commission shall have the power to dredge, fill in and reclaim submerged lands adjacent to any such island or islands and to develop and utilize the same for any of the purposes set forth in this chapter, including the financing of the authorized public improvements. However, no normal or natural channel shall be obstructed so as to interfere with the normal navigation therein, it being the purpose and intention of this chapter to authorize the use and development of shallow bottoms and shoal waters in the areas herein set out for the purpose of filling and reclaiming same for the purposes herein set forth and where said bottoms are not susceptible to reasonable navigation at all times as a practical matter.

    Acquisition of lands by commission; confirmation of title to submerged lands.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The bridge and park commission which has acquired submerged lands, and before such lands have been reclaimed, shall bring its suit in the chancery court of the county in which such lands lie, against the state and all the world for confirmation of the commission’s title to such submerged lands, as provided by law for the confirmation of patents issued by the state. Upon the hearing of such cause, if the court shall find that the reclamation of the said lands does not constitute an obstruction of the navigable waters of the state and does not interfere with the rights of the public generally to use the navigable waters of the state for fishing, boating, and other public uses, and that the reclamation and sale of said lands has or will, in whole or in part, contribute toward the deepening of a channel or channels for boats and improvement of navigation of any of the navigable waters of this state, and that a fair and adequate consideration has been paid or is to be paid for such property, then the court shall confirm the title to the property and forever set at rest any claims by the State of Mississippi in its sovereign capacity as proprietor of said lands.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any of the parties of the suit may appeal as in other proceedings in chancery, provided any interlocutory appeal is taken within ten (10) days after the rendition of the decree from which the appeal is desired and provided that any final appeal is taken within sixty (60) days from the date of the rendition of the final decree. Any title perfected by a decree in a suit under this section shall forever estop and preclude the state and other parties from thereafter questioning the validity of the patent and deed involved in such proceedings.

       The conveyance in fee simple by the State of Mississippi of 150 acres of submerged lands lying adjacent to Deer Island in Mississippi Sound in the Gulf of Mexico to a municipal bridge and park commission was valid and not a violation of the common law trust under which the state holds title to all submerged lands within its boundaries, where the proposed filling and development of such lands by the grantee would not interfere with the public rights of fishing and navigation, and would in fact constitute an aid to navigation.

     <p>
      If the bridge and park commission shall determine by order entered upon its minutes and the governing authorities of the municipality or county concerned concur in the findings of the commission by order entered upon its minutes that in order to render the bonds to be issued under Section 55-7-33 salable or to obtain a more favorable rate of interest, that the tax levy hereby authorized is required, then the governing authorities of the municipality or county are authorized to provide for an annual levy during the life of the bonds issued hereunder, not to exceed four mills, upon all of the taxable property within the municipality or county in order to provide additional funds for the payment of the principal and interest of said bonds, and for the sinking funds as may be provided for by the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds.
     </p>
     <p>
      However, before the governing authorities of the municipalities or counties shall make any tax levy as authorized in this section, such levy shall be authorized by a sixty percent (60%) majority of the qualified electors of the municipality or county voting in a special election held in the manner provided by law.
     </p>
     <p>
      If bonds are issued payable partially from ad valorem taxes, it shall be the duty of the governing authorities of the municipality or county to levy a tax sufficient each year, together with pledged revenues other than the taxes authorized hereunder, to pay the bonds and interest thereon as such bonds and interest become due, and to provide the sinking funds set forth in the order authorizing the issuance thereof. However, in no event shall a tax levied exceed the amount authorized in the first instance by the governing authorities of the municipality or county. Any part of this tax levy lost through homestead exemption shall not be reimbursed by the state.
     </p>
     <p>
      If during any year all or any portion of the levy authorized hereby is not necessary to pay the principal and interest of the bonds falling due during the succeeding calendar year and to provide the sinking fund or funds required, and the commission and governing authorities of the municipality or county so find, by order entered upon their minutes, such levy shall not be made for that year to the extent that it is not necessary for such purposes.
     </p>
     <p>
      As used in this section the word “taxes” shall include, but without limitation, all levies on an ad valorem basis upon land or real property.

      Whereas the United States government is about to undertake the construction of the Natchez Trace, which will be a highway in the State of Mississippi, and have in conjunction therewith a parkway, which highway will extend through the State of Mississippi for approximately three hundred miles and will entail an expenditure on the part of the federal government of not less than twelve million dollars ($12,000,000.00) provided that the United States government is supplied by the state or counties through which said Natchez Trace highway and parkway extends free rights-of-way, together with certain scenic easements along said right-of-way and parkway, the State Highway Commission of the State of Mississippi is hereby authorized and empowered to make use out of any available funds which it may have on hand or obtain such moneys as may be necessary for the purchase of lands and lease scenic easements for the Natchez Trace Parkway in the State of Mississippi or any other United States parkway project in the State of Mississippi which may be undertaken by the United States government. Said lands, when obtained by the state highway department either through purchase, gift or otherwise, may be given free to the United States or some of its subsidiary subdivisions on such terms and conditions as the United States government may demand and the State of Mississippi accede to.

     <p>
      It is hereby declared, as a matter of legislative determination: that East Central Mississippi is almost totally lacking in public parks, playgrounds, campgrounds, and related recreational facilities for citizens of the area to enjoy; that the area has therein a natural setting for the creation of all such recreational needs, particularly is this so in the Bienville National Forest comprising approximately one hundred ninety thousand (190,000) acres lying and being situated in four (4) East Central Mississippi counties; that by creation of this district, counties in East Central Mississippi will be empowered to acquire the use of this beautiful forest for regular use by all of the citizens of this state and frequent use by tourists who heretofore have had to seek their outdoor recreational pleasures in other places in distant states; that the creation of the Bienville Recreational District, with adequate but reasonable powers, with local assistance, cooperation and taxation, will greatly enhance the economic development and growth of the area; and that as a matter of public policy, the general welfare of the state warrants the enactment of this chapter.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Bienville Recreational District may hereafter be created in East Central Mississippi under authority of this chapter and in the manner hereinafter provided. The counties eligible to become member counties of the district are those four (4) counties in which any part of the Bienville National Forest lies and other counties in Mississippi that are contiguous or nearly contiguous to said four (4) counties. Once created, the Bienville Recreational District shall be an agency of the state and a body politic and corporate.

      By July 10, 1972, the boards of supervisors of those counties eligible to become member counties of the Bienville Recreational District shall hold a public hearing at their respective courthouses or at some other appropriate hearing rooms whereby local citizens may have the opportunity to express their sentiments on the question of the county’s becoming a member and a participant in the activities and objectives of the district. If a board of supervisors finds and determines that public sentiment substantially favors the purposes contained in this chapter, the board shall adopt a resolution declaring its intentions to become a member county of the Bienville Recreational District.

      The Legislature hereby finds and determines:
     </p>
     <p>
      That the Fifty Cents (50¢) per ticket charge and the one-fourth (1/4) of the amusement tax provided in Section 7 of Chapter 360, Laws of 1979, as amended by Chapter 456, Laws of 1985, have been insufficient in recent years to fully provide for the payment of the principal of and interest on bonds issued under said Chapter 360; that the proceeds of the charge and tax are, upon their deposit to the Mississippi Memorial Stadium Fund, commingled with other amounts intended for the payment of stadium operating costs; that in recent years amounts intended to pay operating costs have been diverted to pay said bonds; and that the imposition of such charge and tax at current levels is causing events not to be conducted at the Mississippi Veterans Memorial Stadium, thereby jeopardizing the continued viability of said stadium; and
     </p>
     <p>
      That it is the intent of the Legislature, by the enactment of this chapter, to provide a reasonable procedure for the payment of the bonds from the General Fund of the state, without adversely affecting the security interests of the holders of the bonds, in order to provide for the continued viability of the stadium.

     </p>
     <p>
      Terms of members shall begin on May 1, 1987, as follows: Of the members appointed by the Governor, one (1) shall serve for a term of one (1) year, one (1) for a term of two (2) years and one (1) for a term of three (3) years; the member appointed by the Mayor of the City of Jackson shall serve for a term of four (4) years; and the member representing the Board of Trustees of State Institutions of Higher Learning shall serve for a term of five (5) years. Upon the expiration of the foregoing terms, members shall serve for terms of five (5) years each. The appointing authority shall fill any vacancy in the above terms by appointment of a member for the unexpired term. Members shall be eligible for reappointment. An appointed member serving on the commission on April 30, 1987, shall be eligible for appointment to the commission for a term beginning May 1, 1987, of either one (1), two (2), three (3), four (4) or five (5) years, if such member is otherwise qualified. One (1) member of the commission appointed by the Governor shall be a person knowledgeable in marketing with at least three (3) years actual experience therein and one (1) member appointed by the Governor shall be a person of recognized ability in a trade or business with at least five (5) years actual experience therein. From and after May 1, 1987, the name of the commission shall be the “Mississippi Veterans Memorial Stadium Commission” and any references in Sections 55-23-3 through 55-23-11 to the Mississippi Memorial Stadium Commission or commission shall mean the Mississippi Veterans Memorial Stadium Commission unless the context clearly indicates a different meaning. From and after May 1, 1987, the stadium shall be known as the “Mississippi Veterans Memorial Stadium.” The commission is authorized to accept donations of money, property or services from any public or private source to accomplish any physical replacement or alterations of stadium property necessary to accomplish the renaming of the stadium.
     </p>
     <p>
      The members of the commission shall serve without compensation except that members shall be paid their actual and necessary expenses in connection with the performance of their duties as members of the commission, including mileage, as authorized in Section 25-3-41, Mississippi Code of 1972, plus a per diem as is authorized by Section 25-3-69, Mississippi Code of 1972, while engaged in the performance of their duties. The expenses, mileage and per diem allowance shall be paid out of the Mississippi Veterans Memorial Stadium Fund.
     </p>

     </p>
     <p>
      The commission shall appoint a director who shall have at least a bachelor’s degree from an accredited university or college. The director shall have the responsibility for insuring the marketing of tickets to events conducted in the stadium, in addition to such other duties as the commission may designate.

    Powers of the Mississippi Coast Coliseum Commission.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The Mississippi Coast Coliseum Commission, a political subdivision of the State of Mississippi, shall have jurisdiction and authority over matters relating to promoting, developing, maintaining and operating a multipurpose coliseum and related facilities within Harrison County, Mississippi. Multipurpose coliseum and related facilities shall include a multipurpose coliseum or arena facility, a convention center and facility grounds, as well as any lands purchased by or on the behalf of the commission. From and after July 1, 2016, any development and/or any land acquired by or on behalf of the commission, shall be subject to the Land Development Ordinances of the City of Biloxi. Such commission is authorized to acquire lands by purchase, gift or the exercise of eminent domain as provided by Section 11-27-1 et seq., above or below mean high-water mark subject to the approval of the Harrison County Board of Supervisors. The acquisition of lands below mean high-water mark by the commission for the purposes authorized herein are declared to be in all respects for the benefit of the people of the State of Mississippi, a public purpose, and an essential governmental function in the exercise of the powers conferred upon them by such act.
     </p>
     <p>
      The commission, acting on behalf of the State of Mississippi, shall have the right to reclaim submerged lands for the purpose of constructing a multipurpose coliseum and related facilities, and to acquire in its name on behalf of the state any estate or property right therein or in other land necessary to the purpose of this chapter by purchase, gift, deed or other transfer, subject to the approval of the Harrison County Board of Supervisors. Title to all oil, gas and other minerals in, on or under any lands, title to which is held by the State of Mississippi on August 8, 1968, shall be reserved unto the State of Mississippi, and all income derived from the sale or lease of such minerals shall inure to the benefit of the State of Mississippi for such purposes as the Legislature may direct. Provided, that prior to utilization of lands in which title vests in the State of Mississippi, a description of such land shall be submitted to the Department of Finance and Administration and said utilization shall not be commenced until or unless approval of such utilization is given by the Department of Finance and Administration.
     </p>
     <p>
      The commission is authorized to own, furnish, equip and operate the multipurpose coliseum and facilities and equipment necessary or useful in the operation of such multipurpose coliseum and related facilities; to receive and expend, subject to the provisions of this chapter and the approval of the commission’s annual budget by the Harrison County Board of Supervisors, revenues from any source, including the operation of the multipurpose coliseum and related facilities; and to do all other things necessary to carry out the purposes of this chapter.
     </p>
     <p>
      The commission is authorized and directed to adopt uniform rules and regulations regarding the granting of contracts that are less than one hundred eighty (180) days for franchises, licenses, contracts or lease agreements, or the granting of contracts that are less than one hundred eighty (180) days for the use, operation and maintenance of the premises, and to publish the uniform rules and regulations for three (3) consecutive weeks in a newspaper having a general circulation in the county and fixing a time and place not more than ten (10) days after the last publication to receive and hear objections to such rules and regulations. The commission shall also publish such information on commission and county websites during the same time period as the newspaper publication. In addition, a copy of such rules and regulations or any revisions or amendments thereto shall be filed with the Clerk of the Harrison County Board of Supervisors. The commission may revise or amend such rules and regulations but such revisions shall be uniform and shall not be adopted unless the commission shall publish the proposed change and hold a public hearing as required by this section.
     </p>
     <p>
      Before any contract that is more than one hundred eighty (180) days for a franchise, license, contract or lease agreement may be granted, the commission shall notify the Harrison County Board of Supervisors and publish its intent to grant such franchise, license, contract or lease agreement and the conditions upon which same shall be granted. Such publication shall be made for three (3) consecutive weeks in a newspaper having a general circulation in Harrison County. Such publication shall also be made on the commission and county websites during the same time period as the newspaper publication. All bids received shall be sealed, and shall be opened at a date, time and place set forth in the publications, which date shall not be less than five (5) days nor more than ten (10) days after the last day of such publications.
     </p>
     <p>
      Unless the commission shall find that the successful bidder cannot demonstrate financial responsibility to comply with the terms and conditions of the franchise, license, contract or lease agreement or cannot perform the services required thereunder, it shall, subject to the limitations set forth under this chapter, recommend the granting of the franchise, license, contract or lease agreement to the bidder whose proposal shall be in the best financial interest of the commission.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any person aggrieved by any action of the commission may appeal to the Circuit Court of Harrison County in the manner provided for appeals from orders of the board of supervisors.
     </p>
     <p>
      The commission is granted the power to sue and be sued in its own name, and the commission is authorized to take liability insurance on the operation of the facilities in an amount equal to the extent of its liability for claims or causes of action arising from acts or omissions as provided in Section 11-46-15; provided, however, that immunity from suit is only waived to the extent of such liability insurance carried, and a judgment creditor shall have recourse only to the proceeds or right to proceeds of such liability insurance. No attempt shall be made in the trial of any case to suggest the existence of any insurance which covers in whole or in part any judgment or award rendered in favor of a claimant, but if the verdict rendered by the jury exceeds the limit of applicable insurance, the court on motion shall reduce the amount of said judgment to a sum equal to the applicable limit stated in the insurance policy.
     </p>
     <p>
      The commission shall prepare an annual budget specifically describing the proposed receipt and expenditure of all funds from any source whatsoever, and such budget shall be approved by the Harrison County Board of Supervisors. If the commission desires to take any action associated with the receipt or expenditure of funds which deviates from the annual budget, such individual action shall be subject to the approval of the Harrison County Board of Supervisors.
     </p>

      The commission is granted the power to invest funds credited to the Mississippi Coast Coliseum Commission Operating Fund, the commission is vested with authority to designate depositories of its funds, and to deposit the funds in interest-bearing accounts. Provided, however, all funds in excess of ninety (90) days’ operating expenses, to the extent practicable, shall be invested in Treasury bills or in interest-bearing accounts or approved securities to include, but not limited to, U.S. Treasury bills and U.S. Treasury notes and bonds, federal agency securities or mortgage-backed securities guaranteed as to repayment of principal by the government or an agency of such government, certificates of deposit fully covered by insurance administered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or covered by pledged securities, repurchase agreements and short-term money market funds invested in United States government and United States government agencies.

      The commission is authorized to contract with any agency of the United States or the State of Mississippi for a loan or grant, subject to the approval of the Harrison County Board of Supervisors and to give such agency any assurances of compliance with federal or state laws which are not in conflict with the laws of the State of Mississippi. It is the intent and purpose of this chapter that the Coliseum Commission cooperate with agencies administering the National Seashore Act of 1970.
     </p>
     <p>
      Whenever any real or personal property belonging to the commission shall cease to be used or needed for the commission’s purposes, the commission may recommend to the Harrison County Board of Supervisors that it sell, exchange or lease the property on such terms as the commission may propose. No lease of surplus real property may exceed a term of ninety-nine (99) years. The deed of conveyance in such transactions shall be executed in the name of the commission by the Harrison County Board of Supervisors pursuant to order issued on the minutes of its meetings. In any sale, exchange or lease of real property, the commission shall retain all mineral rights that it owns, together with the right of ingress and egress to remove same. Before any sale, exchange or lease is made, the commissioners shall publish at least once each week for three (3) consecutive weeks, in a public newspaper of Harrison County, Mississippi, and on the commission and county websites the intention to sell, exchange or lease, as the case may be, the real or personal property and to accept sealed competitive bids for the sale, exchange or lease. The commissioners shall thereafter accept bids for the sale, exchange or lease, and the property shall be sold, exchanged or leased to the highest and best bidder in the manner provided by law. However, whenever the commissioners shall find and determine, by resolution duly and lawfully adopted and spread upon its minutes: (a) that any commission-owned real property is no longer needed for commission purposes and is not to be used in the operation of a multipurpose coliseum and related facilities, (b) that the sale, exchange or lease of such property in the manner otherwise provided for herein is necessary or desirable for the financial welfare of a multipurpose coliseum and related facilities, and (c) that the use of such property for the purpose for which it is to be sold, exchanged or leased will promote and foster the development and improvement of the multipurpose coliseum and related facilities, the commissioners may recommend to the Harrison County Board of Supervisors that it sell, exchange or lease the property without having to advertise for and accept competitive bids. In any case in which the commission proposes to sell or exchange real property under the provisions of this section without advertising for and accepting competitive bids, the Harrison County Board of Supervisors must approve such proposal, and consideration for the sale or exchange of the real property shall be not less than the average of the fair market price for the property as determined by three (3) professional property appraisers selected by the commission and approved by the purchaser or devisee and the Harrison County Board of Supervisors. Appraisal fees shall be shared equally by the commission and the purchaser or devisee.

      The enumeration of any specific rights and powers contained herein or elsewhere in this chapter where followed by general powers shall not be construed in the restrictive sense but rather in as broad and comprehensive sense as possible to effectuate the purposes and intent of this chapter.

    Levy of tax by county or municipality for support and maintenance of district.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The board of supervisors of any county or the governing authorities of any municipality which become a part of a district may levy a tax upon all taxable property in the county or municipality for the support and maintenance of the district in an amount not to exceed one-fourth (1/4) mill. Any county or municipality which desires to remain a part of such district shall levy each year beginning the second year after joining the district a tax for the support and maintenance of the district of not less than one-fourth (1/4) mill or such county or municipality will not remain a part of the district. Should any county or municipality desire to appropriate an equivalent sum from the general fund, or other available funds, the levying of the tax provided herein shall not be mandatory.
     </p>
     <p>
      Should the board of directors of any such district determine that a tax levy of less than one-fourth (1/4) mill on the property of the counties and municipalities comprising the district would be sufficient to maintain and operate the district for the forthcoming fiscal year, such determination shall, by resolution, be spread upon the minutes of the board and shall recite the amount of tax levy which will suffice. A certified copy of such resolution shall be delivered to the clerks for the board of supervisors of the counties and municipal authorities affected thereby; and, thereafter, the board of supervisors and the governing authorities may for the forthcoming year levy a tax of no less than that declared to be sufficient in such resolution without losing their qualifications as members of the district.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any tax levy made under the provisions of this section shall be used exclusively for the support and maintenance of the district and shall be made by the board of supervisors and municipal governing authorities at the time and in the manner that other tax levies are made. The revenues provided for in this chapter shall not, under any circumstances, be commingled with other funds of counties or municipalities.
