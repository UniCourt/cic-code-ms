     </h3>
     <p>
      The commissioner shall employ such assistants, to be known as state banking examiners, as may be necessary for the efficient operation of the department, to aid him in the discharge of the duties and responsibilities imposed upon him by law. The minimum qualifications for such employment shall be possession of a bachelor’s degree from a recognized college or university, or three (3) years’ experience as a bank examiner, bank officer or employee, small loan company officer or employee, or other consumer finance officer or employee and such other qualifications set out for banking examiners in the plan for the state personnel system. However, notwithstanding any provisions to the contrary, any person who is serving as a state banking examiner in the former Department of Bank Supervision on March 21, 1980, shall be qualified to serve as a state banking examiner in the department. The state bank examiners shall not, directly or indirectly, be connected with any banking business in Mississippi or elsewhere during their respective terms of office, after four (4) months from the time of qualifying as an examiner.
     </p>
     <p>
      The commissioner may employ such additional employees as may be necessary to carry out those duties and responsibilities imposed upon him by law, who shall possess such qualifications set out for their particular position in the plan for the state personnel system.
     </p>
     <p>
      No examiner or other employee related by consanguinity or affinity to the commissioner within the third degree computed according to the civil law shall be employed by him.
     </p>
     <p>
      The examiners and all other persons employed by the commissioner under the provisions of this section shall be compensated as provided in the compensation plan for the state personnel system, unless otherwise provided by law. The compensation for such employees shall be payable monthly out of the funds of the department.
     </p>
     <p>
      The commissioner shall be responsible for all acts of the examiners and the other employees. Any examiner or other employee may be dismissed only in accordance with the laws, rules and regulations applicable to the state personnel system.
     </p>
     <p>
      As a condition of employment with the department, the commissioner shall require all employees and applicants for employment with the department to be fingerprinted to determine their suitability for employment as examiners or assistants as needed. If no disqualifying record is identified at the state level, the Department of Public Safety shall forward the fingerprints to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for a national criminal history record check. The Department of Banking and Consumer Finance shall pay all of the costs in connection with the criminal history record check procedure. These record checks shall not be used by the Department of Banking and Consumer Finance for any purpose other than to determine suitability for employment with the department.

       It shall be the duty of the commissioner to apportion the work of examining banks among the examiners in such a way that each bank, under the provisions of law, shall be examined at least once during an eighteen-month period and more often, if necessary, in the discretion of the commissioner, at irregular intervals and without prior notice. However, neither the commissioner nor any examiner shall examine one (1) bank twice in succession unless the commissioner, for cause, so determines. In the event the commissioner’s office, because of workload or other good sufficient cause, is unable to conduct an examination of a bank as provided for in this section, the commissioner is hereby authorized to accept the examination of any state bank performed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or the Federal Reserve Bank in lieu of the examination provided for in this section. However, in no case shall the commissioner be authorized to accept any such examination of any state bank performed by either the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or the Federal Reserve Bank for any two (2) consecutive eighteen-month periods.

       The commissioner may join an examination and/or issue a joint report of examination with the Federal Reserve Bank of any bank holding company, including any foreign-owned bank holding company, with more than One Billion Dollars ($1,000,000,000.00) in assets that owns a Mississippi state-chartered bank. The commissioner shall not perform an examination independent of the Federal Reserve Bank. The commissioner may accept any examination report of a bank holding company performed solely by the Federal Reserve Bank in lieu of conducting a joint examination. Further, the commissioner may join in related supervisory orders issued by the Federal Reserve Bank. There shall be no cost to a bank or a bank holding company as a result of the commissioner’s participation in a joint examination of a bank holding company as authorized by this subsection. The provisions of this subsection (2) shall stand repealed on July 1, 2022.

       § 81-1-85.
    Witnesses’ attendance may be compelled; penalty for false statements.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The commissioner or an examiner shall have the authority to issue subpoenas for witnesses and compel their attendance before him in any and all matters connected with the duties of his office, and for failure to attend or testify, witnesses may be fined by him for contempt. He may invoke the process of the appropriate chancery court to compel such testimony and the production of all necessary papers, and orders therefor may be had either in termtime or vacation upon two (2) days’ notice to the opposite party.
     </p>
     <p>
      Sheriffs, constables and marshals holding commissions in this state shall serve, and be entitled to regular fees for serving such subpoenas. For failing to execute or return such process they shall be liable for the same penalties prescribed by law for failure to execute any like process issued by the courts of this state.
     </p>
     <p>
      The commissioner or an examiner shall have the authority to administer oaths and to examine under oath the officers, agents, clerks, employees and stockholders of any bank, or any other person touching the matters into which he is directed to examine by law. Any person who willfully makes any false statement under oath in such examination shall be deemed guilty of perjury, and upon conviction thereof shall be punished as provided by law. If any officer, agent, clerk or stockholder of any bank, when under oath, willfully misrepresents in any manner to the commissioner, an examiner, or his assistant, the condition of the bank, or any of its property, or purposely misleads the commissioner or any examiner, or makes false statements regarding the condition of the bank, or any part of its business, such person shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof in any court of competent jurisdiction, shall be fined not less than One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00) nor more than Two Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($2,500.00) or imprisoned in the county jail not less than six (6) months nor more than one (1) year, or by both such fine and imprisonment.

      The commissioner or an examiner, in all cases where the testimony of witnesses is to be preserved, shall have the right to have the case taken down and transcribed by a stenographer, and the stenographer so employed shall be duly sworn. The stenographer’s certificate that the transcript of such evidence is correct, together with the official certificate of the commissioner or examiner that he has read the same and that it is, in his opinion, correct, shall entitle such transcript, or a certified copy thereof, to be received in evidence as relevant, material and competent. Such stenographer shall be paid at the same rates as that then currently in effect for similar duties performed by the chancery court reporter for the county in which the testimony of the witnesses is to be taken and preserved. The stenographer shall be paid out of the department maintenance fund on voucher approved by the commissioner or examiner employing such stenographer, accompanied with an itemized statement of services rendered.

      In all bank examinations no bank shall be allowed credit in excess of its sound value for a note or security of which the principal and interest is over twelve (12) months past due; nor for any bond in excess of the real value thereof; nor for any stock of its own held more than twelve (12) months; nor for any unsecured overdrafts that may have existed for a greater period than thirty (30) days next preceding it, except that the period shall be ninety (90) days for unsecured overdrafts upon which interest is being charged if the bank has a written policy authorizing such overdrafts for not more than ninety (90) days.

      The commissioner may make special examinations or render special services to banks, either at the request of banks desiring same, or at his own instance. The commissioner shall have discretion to decide whether any examinations or services are sufficiently urgent, out of routine, or extraordinary to be denominated special examinations or services. When any special examination or services are rendered and so denominated by the commissioner he shall charge the bank so examined or served the cost based on the average daily cost of all examiners of the department plus actual and necessary expenses. The bank so receiving such special examination or services shall pay the per diem and expenses of each appointed examiner performing the work to the commissioner, who in turn will pay the amount into the department maintenance fund and disburse to the examiner directly the amount of his services. An examiner who is on the state payroll may perform such services but the funds so derived from his services shall be paid into the department maintenance fund, and no examiner shall be allowed to draw from a salary and expenses from both the bank and the state.

      The commissioner shall call upon each state bank for the reports required in this section.

The commissioner shall prescribe the forms for such reports. The reports shall be sworn to by either the president, vice president or cashier of the bank making them, attested by not less than two (2) of the board of directors, and shall exhibit in detail, under appropriate heads, the total resources and total liabilities of the bank on the day specified by the commissioner. Banks shall transmit to the department such call reports within a time limitation established by regulation by the commissioner; however, such time limitation cannot exceed that set by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation for state insured banks. For any failure or delay in furnishing this report, the president, vice president or cashier of any such bank, so in default, and the members of the board of directors of the bank refusing to attest the report, shall be subject to an administrative fine, which may be imposed by the commissioner, of Fifty Dollars ($50.00) a day for each day while in such default.

    Investigation of proposed federal cease and desist, suspension or removal orders to state chartered banks.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      If the commissioner receives notice from the United States or any agency or instrumentality thereof having authority to issue cease and desist, removal or suspension orders to state-chartered banks supervised by the department, of its intention to issue any such cease and desist, removal or suspension order to any state-chartered bank, then the commissioner is hereby authorized and empowered to investigate the act, cause or basis asserted for the issuance of such proposed order.
     </p>
     <p>
      If such investigation shall disclose, in the opinion and judgment of the commissioner, that the act, cause or basis complained of has occurred, and that it is detrimental to the safety and welfare of the depositors or stockholders of the bank and contrary to the public interest, and if the act, cause or basis complained of shall not be remedied immediately, then the commissioner may give notice to the board of directors of the bank of the charges together with his concurrence or exceptions thereto and the remedies for the same. Failure of the board of directors to comply with the requirements of the commissioner within thirty (30) days from the date of notice shall render the board of directors in default thereupon. Thereafter the commissioner may remove any officer, director or other person responsible for the noncompliance, or he may notify the appropriate federal agency or instrumentality to proceed under the federal statute or regulation.

    Assessment against banks for maintenance fund.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Every bank organized under the laws of this state engaging in the business of a commercial bank, trust company or any combination thereof, is assessed for each year the sum of Seventy-five Dollars ($75.00) and every such corporation whose total assets exceed One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000.00) shall further pay in addition to the minimum assessment of Seventy-five Dollars ($75.00), Fifty Cents (50¢) for each One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00) or fraction thereof of assets in excess of One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000.00). All money accruing from such assessment shall be used for the maintenance of the department.
     </p>
     <p>
      The commissioner shall, during the month of January in each year, or as soon thereafter as practicable, prepare a statement of the assessments due under this section based upon the total assets of each such corporation, as shown by its last report, which shall be paid as called for by the commissioner. He shall send to each such corporation a statement of the amount due by it, which shall specify how the same shall be payable. The assessment shall be due and payable in accordance with the statement so furnished and the installments thereof shall be paid within ten (10) days after the date fixed for their payment. Such assessment shall constitute a lien on the assets of each bank until paid. Any such corporation failing to make payment within ten (10) days as herein provided shall be liable to a penalty of ten percent (10%) of the amount in default for each day thereafter. All assessments and penalties provided in this section shall be payable to the commissioner and when collected by him shall be delivered to the State Treasurer to be placed to the credit of the maintenance fund of the department. The commissioner shall give a receipt for all money received by him and shall take a receipt from the State Treasurer for all money delivered to him. In making any call for the assessment levied by this section the commissioner shall estimate the cost of maintaining the department for the current year, and if the assessments hereby levied shall appear to produce more than such estimate, he shall reduce accordingly the Fifty Cents (50¢) per One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00) of assets assessment provided in this section. The cash balance remaining in the maintenance fund of the department at the end of any one (1) fiscal year shall be credited to and reduce the assessments of the following fiscal year on a pro rata basis.

    Capital stock and surplus required.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <ol>
      <li id="t81c03s81-3-11ol11">
       No banking corporation shall be permitted to operate in the State of Mississippi under the provisions of this chapter unless it has the minimum capital of Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000.00) or any additional amounts required by the supervising federal regulatory agencies. However, this requirement of capital shall not apply to banks in operation in this state before July 1, 1994. At any time that the commissioner finds that an operating bank has an insufficient amount of capital, it shall be his duty to call upon such bank to restore the capital to an amount to be determined to be adequate to safeguard the depositors of the bank.
      </li>
      <li id="t81c03s81-3-11ol12">
       For the purpose of strengthening its capital structure, every banking corporation organized under the laws of this state shall, except as otherwise provided herein, at the close of business each year set aside to the credit of a separate surplus account, to be denominated on its books “Earned Surplus,” an amount not less than twenty-five percent (25%) of its net earnings, after providing for the payment of dividends on its preferred stock, if any, until the “Earned Surplus” account on its books shall amount to a sum equal to three (3) times the total of its common and preferred stock. However, any bank having at the close of the business year a ratio of total deposits to total capital, surplus and earned surplus not in excess of a ratio of Ten Dollars ($10.00) of deposits to One Dollar ($1.00) of total capital (such deposits to be the average of the deposits shown by all of the calls for the business year and such capital to include all stock, surplus and earned surplus) shall be required to set aside twenty-five percent (25%) of its earnings only to the extent necessary to cause its “Earned Surplus” account to equal its total capital. When such ratio of total deposits to total capital of any bank at the close of business any year does not exceed that specified above and the “Earned Surplus” account is equal to or more than the amount of its total capital, then such bank shall not be required to set aside twenty-five percent (25%) of its earnings for that year to the credit of its “Earned Surplus” account, but may so set aside any part of its earnings until its “Earned Surplus” account is equal to three (3) times its total capital. The net earnings of every bank set aside to its “Earned Surplus” account shall be exempt from all state, county, municipal, levee district and other ad valorem taxes. Every national banking association doing business in this state which shall comply with the provisions hereof, shall be entitled to the same exemption from taxation on its earned surplus and to the same rights and privileges hereby given to state banks.
       <p>
        “Earned Surplus” as referred to in this chapter shall be construed to mean only the earned surplus account as shown on the books of the bank on the effective date of this chapter and such earnings as may thereafter be credited to such account. Surplus actually carried on the books of the bank on April 2, 1934, shall remain taxable, and if charged off for any purpose other than to transfer it to taxable common stock, it shall be restored either out of the earned surplus account or from earnings. But if the state comptroller, or in the case of a national bank, the comptroller of the currency, shall determine that on April 2, 1934, there were actually existing losses among the assets of a bank and that the surplus shown on the books of such bank was not actually worth the amount at which it was then being carried, he may issue his certificate to the bank showing the actual value of its surplus on April 2, 1934, and the bank may reduce the amount thereof to the actual value as shown by such certificate and shall not be required to restore it.
       </p>
       <p>
        The paid-in surplus of any bank derived from sale of shares of its capital stock after January 1, 1961, shall be considered as earned surplus in an amount not to exceed the common stock and shall be treated as earned surplus for the purpose of ad valorem taxation.
       </p>
       <p>
        In rendering the annual statement required by section 27-35-35, Code of 1972, banks may exclude from the value of their shares the total “earned surplus” as shown on their books, and such earned surplus shall not be taken into consideration by the assessing officers or equalizing authority, in arriving at the amount of the personal assessment.

    Certificate to incorporate and organize.

     <ol>
      <li id="t81c03s81-3-13ol11">
       Before any bank may be organized and formed, the prospective incorporators shall give notice to the Commissioner of Banking and Consumer Finance of their desire to engage in banking and apply for a certificate of authority to incorporate, and shall at the time file with the commissioner a copy of the proposed articles of incorporation, duly sworn to by one (1) of the prospective incorporators. The commissioner shall promptly give consideration to the application and make an examination of the proposed articles of incorporation to determine if they meet all requirements of law. The commissioner shall then make an investigation of the number of parent banks, branch banks, branch offices and branch facilities, and location thereof then serving the area in which the proposed new bank is to be located, the ratio of capital funds to total deposits therein, the record of earnings and condition of existing banks and what effect, if any, a new unit bank would have on them, the number of previous bank failures in the area and their liquidation record and banking history generally in the area, the population of the area wherein the proposed bank will be located and relation to number of banks operating therein, reasonable prospects of growth of the area and its financial resources and whether the same are static, progressive or retrogressive, expectation of profitable operation of the proposed new bank, and the morals and business character of the prospective incorporators and such further investigation to determine whether the public necessity requires that the proposed new bank should be chartered and permitted to operate.
       <p>
        When the commissioner has completed the examination and made his investigation, he shall record his findings in writing and shall draw up his recommendations to the State Board of Banking Review, established in Section 81-3-12. At the request of the chairman, he shall thereupon, in writing, call a meeting of the board to give consideration to his findings and recommendations, such call to be issued at least ten (10) days in advance of the meeting. Such meetings shall be held within one hundred twenty (120) days from the date on which the prospective incorporators gave notice to the commissioner of their desire to engage in banking, applied for a certificate of authority to incorporate, and filed with the commissioner a copy of the proposed articles of incorporation. The commissioner shall at the same time give notice of the meeting of the board to the prospective incorporators of the proposed new bank and to any and all other interested persons and shall extend to them an invitation to be heard in writing or in person by the board.
       </p>
       <p>
        The board, at its meeting, shall consider the findings and recommendations of the commissioner and shall hear such oral testimony as he may wish to give, and shall also receive information and hear testimony from the prospective organizers of the proposed bank and from any and all other interested persons bearing upon the public necessity for the organization and operation of the new bank.
       </p>
       <p>
        After considering the record submitted to it by the commissioner and his oral testimony and considering such other information and evidence, either written or oral, which has come before it, the board shall decide if it has before it sufficient information and evidence upon which it can dispose of the application to form the new bank. If it is determined that evidence and information is not sufficient, then the board shall order the commissioner to secure such additional information and evidence as it may prescribe or shall request from the prospective incorporators and from other interested persons. The board shall thereupon set a date for a future meeting to be held before the expiration of the aforementioned one hundred twenty (120) day time limit and shall give to the prospective incorporators and other interested persons notice of such meeting, and shall recess the meeting then being held until such future date. The board shall have and is hereby vested with the power to compel attendance of witnesses just as is the commissioner or examiner as provided for in Section 81-1-85, and all testimony given before said board shall be taken down and transcribed by a stenographer in the manner prescribed in Section 81-1-87.
       </p>
       <p>
        If the board, or a majority thereof, shall determine that it has before it sufficient evidence and information upon which to base a decision, then it shall render a written opinion and decision in the matter within sixty (60) days after the conclusion of the final board hearing. If its decision is favorable, then the board shall order the commissioner to give to such prospective incorporators a certificate under his hand and official seal of the Department of Banking and Consumer Finance authorizing the prospective incorporators to proceed to incorporate and organize as is provided in Section 81-3-7.
       </p>
       <p>
        When a certificate of incorporation is sought in order to effect the acquisition of an insolvent bank sold pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 9, Title 81, Mississippi Code of 1972, any constraints of time imposed by this subsection shall not apply if the commissioner determines that an emergency exists which requires expedition of the procedure for granting a certificate in order to protect the interests of the public and the interests of depositors and creditors of the insolvent bank.

       Appeal from unfavorable decision of State Board of Banking review. If the decision of the board, or a majority thereof, is unfavorable to the organization of the proposed new bank, it shall render a written opinion and decision giving its reason for rejection within sixty (60) days after the conclusion of the final board hearing in the matter, and the commissioner shall so advise the prospective incorporators, giving them a copy of the written decision and opinion of the board. If the prospective incorporators be aggrieved at the unfavorable decision of the board in denying a certificate authorizing them to proceed with the incorporation of the proposed new bank and the organization thereof, they shall have the right of appeal to the chancery court of the county in which the proposed bank shall be located, which appeal shall be taken and perfected within sixty (60) days from the date of the denial of such certificate. The denial of said certificate by the board shall be construed as a judicial finding and appealable as such. All such appeals shall be taken, perfected, heard and determined either in termtime or vacation, and such appeals shall be heard and disposed of promptly by the court. Appeals from the board shall be taken and perfected by the filing of a bond in the sum of Two Hundred Fifty Dollars ($250.00), with two (2) sureties, or with a surety company qualified to do business in Mississippi as surety, conditioned to pay the costs of the appeal, the bond to be approved by the clerk of the chancery court, and such bond shall be payable to the state and may be enforced in its name as other judicial bonds filed in the chancery court, and judgment may be entered upon such bonds and process and execution shall issue upon such judgments as provided by law in other cases. Appeals may be taken from the chancery court to the Supreme Court in the manner now provided by law. Upon approval of the bond by the clerk of the chancery court the clerk shall give notice to the commissioner of the appeal from the decision of the board, and it thereupon shall be the duty of the commissioner to promptly transmit to the clerk of the chancery court in which the appeal is pending the original or a certified copy of the application, proposed charter of incorporation, and his findings or decision thereon together with the opinion and decision of the board, including a transcript of pleadings and testimony, both oral and documentary, which shall be docketed by the clerk and shall be tried by the court. In perfecting such appeals, the provisions of law respecting notice to reporters and allowance of bills of exception, now or hereafter in force respecting appeals from the chancery court to the Supreme Court shall be applicable thereto. If the prospective incorporators of the proposed new bank shall prevail, a decree shall be entered requiring the issuance by the commissioner of the certificate authorizing applicants to incorporate and organize in the same manner as if the application therefor had been approved by the board, and the costs therein incurred shall be paid by the commissioner out of the maintenance fund of the Department of Banking and Consumer Finance. If, however, the action of the board be affirmed by the court, a decree shall be entered to that effect taxing costs of the proceedings to the applicants. The commissioner or the applicants shall have the right of appeal from the decision of the chancery court. During the time the cause is pending in the office of the commissioner or before the board or the court, the commissioner shall not issue a certificate to a subsequent applicant to incorporate and organize a new bank or authorize any bank then existing to establish a branch bank, or branch office within the area wherein the proposed new bank is to be domiciled, and neither shall he consent to the removal of the domicile of an existing bank from another place into the area where the proposed new bank will be domiciled. A cause shall not be considered as pending in the office of the commissioner or before the board if the prospective incorporators or their representative have only given notice to the commissioner of their desire to engage in banking and apply for a certificate of authority to incorporate, but have not filed with the commissioner a copy of the proposed articles of incorporation and other documents required by statute or administrative regulation.
       <p>
        If the decision of the board, or a majority thereof, is favorable to the organization of the proposed bank, it shall in like manner as above render a written opinion and decision within sixty (60) days after the conclusion of the final board hearing on the matter, and an appeal in the manner herein set forth shall be available to any interested organizations, person or persons who have participated in the proceedings and feel aggrieved by the decision of the board.

       Certificate to begin business. When a bank has been incorporated and the capital stock thereof has been paid in full, the incorporators shall notify the commissioner of such fact, whereupon the commissioner himself or through an examiner shall make a special examination of the proposed new bank and, finding the capital stock to have been paid in full, he shall under his hand and seal of the Department of Banking and Consumer Finance issue to the bank a certificate authorizing it to commence business, and when such business has been commenced the bank shall notify the commissioner to that effect. Upon completion of such special examination, the bank shall pay to the Department of Banking and Consumer Finance as an assessment an amount sufficient to reimburse for the actual costs and expenses incurred during such special examination. The commissioner or examiner shall give a receipt therefor in duplicate, and the assessment shall be turned over by the Department of Banking and Consumer Finance to the State Treasurer for credit to the maintenance fund of the Department of Banking and Consumer Finance. The proposed new bank shall not transact any business except as is necessarily preliminary to its incorporation and organization until it has been authorized by the commissioner to begin business. However, in the event the board shall reject any application for a certificate of convenience and necessity, all costs incurred by this board in making a survey or holding a hearing on such application shall be borne by the petitioners.

Provided, however, the State Board of Banking Review may extend for good cause shown said two-year period a maximum number of two (2) times for periods not exceeding six (6) months each.

       Where the state banking board’s reason for refusing the request of an objecting bank for the right to examine the report or the examiner who made the investigation for the comptroller on an application for a new bank was that the report was prepared for the benefit of the comptroller as a basis on which his finding and recommendations were made to the banking board as required by statute, the board’s statement negated the assumption by the objecting bank that the board had before it and did in fact consider evidence that was not introduced at the hearing before the board. Britton & Koontz First Nat'l Bank v. Biglane, 285 So. 2d 181, 1973 Miss. LEXIS 1287 (Miss. 1973).
      </p>
      <p>
       It is apparent from Code 1942, § 5160 that the legislature intended for the comptroller to make an investigation in sufficient depth to determine whether in his opinion a bank should be chartered, although there is no opposition to the application. Britton & Koontz First Nat'l Bank v. Biglane, 285 So. 2d 181, 1973 Miss. LEXIS 1287 (Miss. 1973).
      </p>
      <p>
       Code 1942, § 5160 does not contemplate that the reports of those employed by the comptroller to assist in his investigation on the application of a proposed bank should be a part of the evidence in a hearing before the board. Britton & Koontz First Nat'l Bank v. Biglane, 285 So. 2d 181, 1973 Miss. LEXIS 1287 (Miss. 1973).
      </p>
      <p>
       Proper procedure requires that a copy of the report and recommendation of the comptroller in respect to the application for a new bank be furnished to interested parties at the outset of the hearing before the state banking board so that the interested parties will have an opportunity to rebut the same by evidence.

      <p>
       In denying an application for a certificate to incorporate and organize a new bank, the banking board is not required to make an express or specific detailed findings of the facts, for under this section [Code 1942, § 5160] it was only required that the board render a written opinion and decision giving its reasons for rejection. First Nat'l Bank v. Martin, 238 So. 2d 856, 1970 Miss. LEXIS 1514 (Miss. 1970).

      <p>
       The state banking board is not required to make express findings of fact in support of its conclusion that public necessity warranted the granting of leave to establish a new bank. Planters Bank v. Garrott, 239 Miss. 248, 122 So. 2d 256, 1960 Miss. LEXIS 283 (Miss. 1960).

      <p>
       Banking board’s approval of application to incorporate new bank and trust company was supported by substantial evidence and applicants met their burden of showing of public necessity where no new unit bank had come to the area since 1944, there were only three unit banks in the area and each was enjoying a steady growth of capital and deposits, and the area itself was growing at an unusual rate. Hancock Bank v. Gaddy, 328 So. 2d 361, 1976 Miss. LEXIS 1800 (Miss. 1976).
      </p>
      <p>
       The word “necessity” as used in this section [Code 1942, § 5160] means a substantial obvious need justifying the chartering of a new bank in view of the disclosed relevant circumstances, and mere convenience is not sufficient to satisfy the statutory requisite of “necessity”. First Nat'l Bank v. Martin, 238 So. 2d 856, 1970 Miss. LEXIS 1514 (Miss. 1970).
      </p>
      <p>
       The burden of showing “public necessity” rested upon the parties applying for the certificate to organize a new bank. First Nat'l Bank v. Martin, 238 So. 2d 856, 1970 Miss. LEXIS 1514 (Miss. 1970).
      </p>
      <p>
       In determining whether “necessity” warrants the granting of application for lease to establish a new bank, mere convenience is not of itself sufficient, but may be taken into consideration. Planters Bank v. Garrott, 239 Miss. 248, 122 So. 2d 256, 1960 Miss. LEXIS 283 (Miss. 1960).

       On appeal from an order based upon a factual finding by a trier of facts, such as the banking board, the supreme court accepts the evidence which supports or tends to support the conclusion upon which the order is based, together with all inferences favorable to it which reasonably may be drawn from the evidence.

       The findings of the banking board are prima facie correct, and the chancery court cannot substitute its judgment for that of the board and disturb its findings where there is any substantial basis in the evidence for such findings, or where the ruling of the board is not capricious or arbitrary. First Nat'l Bank v. Martin, 238 So. 2d 856, 1970 Miss. LEXIS 1514 (Miss. 1970).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section [Code 1942, § 5160] fully provides what the transcript on appeal must contain. Hernando Bank v. Davidson, 250 Miss. 23, 164 So. 2d 403, 1964 Miss. LEXIS 447 (Miss. 1964).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the appellant did not raise the question of improper notice at the hearing before the banking board, and was silent on the subject of notice until the case was advanced to the appellate court, appellant failed to preserve the technical error complained of for review and was estopped from raising the question of notice on appeal. Hernando Bank v. Davidson, 250 Miss. 23, 164 So. 2d 403, 1964 Miss. LEXIS 447 (Miss. 1964).
      </p>
      <p>
       A decision of the banking board will not be reversed on appeal where only technical errors are committed, but in order for there to be reversible error there must be a clear showing that the error complained of is substantially prejudicial to the appellant and the public. Hernando Bank v. Davidson, 250 Miss. 23, 164 So. 2d 403, 1964 Miss. LEXIS 447 (Miss. 1964).
      </p>
      <p>
       Failure of the state banking board to require witnesses testifying upon the hearing of an application for leave to organize a new bank, that they had been told that officers of the existing bank used the granting of loans to further their personal and political interests, to disclose the names of their informants, held not prejudicial error. Planters Bank v. Garrott, 239 Miss. 248, 122 So. 2d 256, 1960 Miss. LEXIS 283 (Miss. 1960).
      </p>
      <p>
       On an application to the state banking board for leave to organize a new bank, the findings of the state comptroller showing the results of his investigation of the application should be filed and made available to the interested parties as part of the record during the hearing; but failure to do so may be waived. Planters Bank v. Garrott, 239 Miss. 248, 122 So. 2d 256, 1960 Miss. LEXIS 283 (Miss. 1960).
      </p>
      <p>
       Judicial review of a determination of the state banking board under this section is limited to the question of procedural due process, and the question whether the determination is supported by substantial evidence. Planters Bank v. Garrott, 239 Miss. 248, 122 So. 2d 256, 1960 Miss. LEXIS 283 (Miss. 1960).

     <p>
      The charter or articles of incorporation of banking corporations heretofore created or that may hereafter be created, may be renewed or amended in the following manner:
     </p>
     <p>
      The stockholders in a special or regular meeting, shall first, by a vote of a majority in amount of all stock outstanding, adopt a resolution setting forth the proposed renewal or amendment, subject to the approval of the state comptroller. Three copies of such resolution duly certified by the president or vice-president of such bank shall be forwarded to the state comptroller for his approval, together with the fee required by statute. If the proposed amendment is approved by the state comptroller, he shall attach his certificate of approval to each of the copies and forward all three copies to the Attorney General for his approval, and shall forward the fee required by statute to the Secretary of State. If and when approved by the Attorney General, all three copies of said amendment shall be forwarded to the Governor for his approval, and when approved by him shall be forwarded by the Governor to the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State shall retain one copy and file and record the same in his office. He shall forward one copy thereof to the state comptroller, who shall retain and file the same in his office. The remaining copy shall be returned to the bank, and the bank shall immediately record the same in the office of the chancery clerk of the county in which the bank is domiciled. Said copy after being so recorded, shall be returned to the bank and retained by it in its files. It shall not be necessary to publish such renewal or amendment.

      Every active officer and employee of any bank or trust company in this state shall furnish a fidelity bond to the bank by which he is employed for the faithful performance of his duties, executed by some surety company authorized to do business in the State of Mississippi, as surety. The conditions of such bond, whether the instrument so describes the conditions or not, shall be that the principal shall protect the obligee against any loss or liability that the obligee may suffer or incur by reason of the acts of dishonesty of the principal or by reason of the violation of any of the provisions of the banking laws of Mississippi. The amount of such bond shall be fixed by the board of directors, subject, however, to approval of the state comptroller and the same shall be inspected upon the examination of the bank or trust company.
     </p>
     <p>
      Every banking corporation shall provide adequate insurance protection and indemnity against robbery and burglary and other similar insurable losses. Whenever any bank refuses or fails to comply with this requirement the state comptroller may contract for such protection and indemnity and add the cost thereof to the assessment otherwise payable by such bank for the support of the department of bank supervision.

       Financial institution bond’s criteria for covering loan-related losses were consistent with this section in defining dishonesty as requiring intent to cause loss to the bank and requiring receipt of a financial benefit outside the employee’s normal compensation; thus, absent evidence that a former employee who approved allegedly improper transactions received any financial benefit other than normal commissions or intended to share in loan proceeds, the bank could not recover on the bond.

      Banks may, with the approval of the state comptroller, and by a vote of stockholders owning a majority of the stock of such bank, upon not less than five (5) days’ notice, given by registered mail, pursuant to action taken by their boards of directors, issue preferred stock of one or more classes in such amount and with such par value as shall be approved by the said comptroller, and may make such amendments to their charters as may be necessary for this purpose; but, in the case of a newly organized bank which has not yet issued common stock, the requirement of notice to and vote of stockholders shall not apply.
     </p>
     <p>
      The holders of such preferred stock shall be entitled to receive such cumulative dividends at a stipulated rate and shall have such voting and conversion rights and such control of management, and such stock shall be subject to retirement in such manner and upon such conditions as may be provided in the charter, with the approval of the state comptroller. The holders of such preferred stock shall not be held individually responsible as such holders for any debts, contracts or engagements of such bank, and shall not be liable for assessments to restore impairments in the capital of such bank as provided by law with reference to the holders of common stock.
     </p>
     <p>
      Preferred stock issued by any bank in this state shall be exempt from all state, county, municipal, levee district, and other ad valorem taxes so long as the same shall be held by an agency of the federal government.

     <p>
      No dividend shall be declared or paid on common stock until the cumulated dividends on the preferred stock shall have been paid in full; and, if the corporation is placed in either voluntary or involuntary liquidation, no payment shall be made to the holders of the common stock until the owners of the preferred stock shall have been paid in full the par value of such preferred stock plus all accumulated dividends.

    Liability of stockholders.

     <p>
      The stockholders of every bank shall be individually liable, actually and ratably, and not for one another, for the benefit of the depositors in said bank at the amount of their stock at the par value thereof, and in addition to said stock. However, persons holding stock as executors, administrators, guardians or trustees shall not be personally liable as stockholders, but the assets and funds in their hands constituting the trust shall be liable to the same extent as the testator, intestate, ward, or person interested in such trust fund would be, if living or competent to act. Persons holding stock as collateral security shall not be personally liable as stockholders, but the person pledging such stock shall be deemed the stockholder and liable under this section. Such double liability may be enforced in a suit at law or in equity by the receiver of any bank in process of liquidation. Such suit, however, shall be brought within six years from the date the bank went into liquidation and not thereafter. Such double liability shall not apply, however, to stock in any bank organized, after April 2, 1934, nor to stock in any bank open for business on April 2, 1934, provided such bank is a member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or any other similar agency created by the laws of the United States.

       § 81-5-33.
    Powers in regard to trusts.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Banks may accept and execute all such trusts and perform such duties of every description as may be committed to them by any person or corporation or that may be committed or transferred to them by order of any court of record. They may receive money in trust, take and accept by grant, assignment, transfer, devise or bequest, and hold any real or personal estate or trusts created according to the laws of this or any other state or of the United States, and execute those legal trusts in regard to the same, on such terms as may be directed or agreed upon. They may act as agent for the investment of money or the management of property for other persons, and as agent for persons and corporations for the purpose of issuing, registering, transferring or countersigning the certificates of stock, bonds or other evidences of debt of any corporation, association, municipality, state, county or public authority on such terms as may be agreed upon. They also may act as guardian for any minor or person with mental illness under the appointment of any court of record having jurisdiction of the person or estate of the minor or person with mental illness and may act as administrator or executor of the estate of any deceased person. They may act as agent or attorney in fact and as commissioner for the sale of property, both real and personal, and may act as assignee or receiver, or as trustee in mortgages or bond issues, or in any other fiduciary capacity authorized by law. They may accept trust funds or other property upon specially agreed terms and pay or deliver the same to the owners, beneficiaries or others, as the case may be, when and as the same should be paid or delivered according to the terms of the trust agreement under which it is held. Whenever under the laws of this or any other state or under the rule or order of any court, the execution of a bond for the protection of a private or court trust is required, a trust company shall be authorized to execute the bond for the protection of any trust or trust estate being administered by it.
     </p>
     <p>
      Banking corporations created, organized and doing business under the laws of the State of Mississippi may exercise, without amendment of their charters, and under their charter authority to engage in the general business of banking, all or any of the foregoing powers. However, before any bank whose charter merely authorizes the exercise of general banking functions may exercise those powers, the previous written consent of the Commissioner of Banking and Consumer Finance shall be obtained.
     </p>
     <p>
      Banks exercising any or all of those powers shall segregate all assets held in any fiduciary capacity from the general assets of the bank and shall keep a separate set of books and records showing in proper detail all transactions engaged in under the authority of this section or under the authority granted to them in their charter or otherwise. Those books and records shall be inspected and examined by the state bank examiners at each and every examination of the bank.
     </p>
     <p>
      No bank shall receive in its trust department deposits of current funds subject to check or the deposit of checks, drafts, bills of exchange or other items for collection or exchange purposes. Funds deposited or held in trust by the bank awaiting investment or distribution shall be carried in a separate account and shall not be used by the bank in the conduct of its business, unless it first sets aside in the trust department United States bonds or bonds of the State of Mississippi or any subdivision of the state, the market value of which shall at all times be not less than ten percent (10%) in excess of the total funds so held, exclusive of the portion of funds insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the event of the failure or liquidation of the bank, the owners of the funds held in trust for investment or distribution shall have a prior lien on the bonds or other securities so set apart in addition to their claim against the assets of the bank.
     </p>
     <p>
      In any case in which the laws of this state require that one acting as trustee, executor, administrator or in any fiduciary capacity must take an oath or make an affidavit, the president, vice president, cashier or trust officer of a bank may take the necessary oath or execute the necessary affidavit.
     </p>
     <p>
      In making investments of trust funds, it shall be unlawful for any bank to purchase securities from itself or to purchase securities in which it may be interested, directly or indirectly. However, any bank, including a national bank, authorized to do business in this state in a fiduciary capacity may, unless prohibited or otherwise limited by the instrument governing the fiduciary relationship, in the exercise of its investment discretion or at the direction of another person authorized to direct the investment of funds held by the bank as fiduciary, invest and reinvest in the securities of, or other interests in, any open-end or closed-end management type investment company or investment trust registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, 15 USCS Section 80a-1, et seq., as amended, notwithstanding that the banking institution or affiliate of the banking institution provides services to the investment company or investment trust, such as that of an investment advisor, custodian, transfer agent, registrar, sponsor, distributor, manager or otherwise, and receives reasonable remuneration for those services, so long as the total compensation paid by the trust or custodial estate as trustee’s fees and mutual fund fees is reasonable, taking into account the nature and extent of the trustee’s duties, the nature and extent of the services provided to the investment company or investment trust, and the total compensation, costs and fees that would otherwise be paid, directly or indirectly, by the trust or custodial estate if the investment were made in an investment company or investment trust for which the bank or its affiliates provided no services. With respect to any funds so invested, the banking institution shall make available by statement, prospectus or otherwise to all current income beneficiaries of an account the basis, expressed as a percentage of asset value or otherwise, upon which the remuneration is calculated. No bank shall lend to any officer, director or employee of the bank any funds held in trust by it, and any officer, director or employee making a loan, or to whom such a loan is made, shall be guilty of a felony and, upon conviction, may be fined not more than Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000.00) or imprisoned in the State Penitentiary for not more than five (5) years, or by both that fine and imprisonment, in the discretion of the court.

However, before” for “foregoing powers, but before,” and in the second sentence, substituted “banking functions may exercise” for “banking functions, shall exercise”; in the next-to-last paragraph, substituted “fiduciary capacity must take an oath” for “fiduciary capacity, shall take an oath”; and made minor stylistic changes.

       § 81-5-34.
    Accounts of administrators, executors, guardians, trustees, and other fiduciaries.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Any bank, including a national bank, may accept accounts in the name of any administrator, executor, guardian, trustee or other fiduciary in trust for a named beneficiary or beneficiaries including the authority to exercise all rights and powers granted to a fiduciary under the Revised Uniform Fiduciary Access to Digital Assets Act created under Chapter 23, Title 91. Any such fiduciary shall have the power to make payments upon and to withdraw any such account, in whole or in part. The withdrawal value of any such account or other rights relating thereto may be paid or delivered, in whole or in part, to such fiduciary, without regard to any notice to the contrary, as long as such fiduciary is living. The payment or delivery to any such fiduciary or a receipt of acquittance signed by any such fiduciary to whom any such payment or any such delivery of rights is made shall be valid and sufficient release and discharge of any bank for the payment or delivery so made. Whenever a person holding an account in a fiduciary capacity dies, and no written notice of the revocation or termination of the trust relationship has been given to a bank and the bank has no notice of any other disposition of the trust estate, the withdrawal value of such account or other rights relating thereto may, at the option of a bank, be paid or delivered, in whole or in part, to the beneficiary or beneficiaries of such trust. Whenever an account shall be opened by any person describing himself in opening such account as trustee for another, and there is no other or further notice of the existence and terms of a legal and valid trust, then such description shall be given in writing to such bank. In the event of the death of the person so described as trustee, the withdrawal value of such account or any part thereof may be paid to the person for whom the account was thus stated to have been opened, and such account and all additions thereto shall be the property of such person, unless prior to payment the trust agreement is presented to the bank showing a contrary interest. When made in accord with this section, the payment or delivery to any such beneficiary, beneficiaries or designated person, or a receipt or acquittance signed by any such beneficiary, beneficiaries or designated person for any such payment or delivery, shall be valid and sufficient release and discharge of a bank for the payment or delivery so made. Trust accounts permitted by this section shall not be required to be acknowledged and recorded. When an account is opened in a form described in this section, the right set forth in Section 81-5-62 shall apply. No bank paying any beneficiary in accordance with the provisions of this section shall thereby be liable for any estate, inheritance or succession taxes which may be due this state. The term “accounts” or “account” as used in this section shall include, but not be limited to, any form of deposit or account, such as a savings account, checking account, time deposit, demand deposit or certificate of deposit, whether negotiable, nonnegotiable or otherwise.

      No state or national bank domiciled in this state and duly authorized by law to act in a fiduciary capacity shall be required to make or file any bond or other security for the faithful performance of its duty when acting as executor, administrator, guardian, conservator, trustee, or in any other fiduciary capacity, unless the instrument creating any such trust or the court having jurisdiction thereof shall specifically direct that such bond or other security shall be given for the performance of such trust and shall fix the amount thereof. The chancery court or chancellor in vacation, having jurisdiction over any such estate or trust existing at the time of the enactment of this statute may, in its discretion, cancel any such bond or release any such security and discharge the surety or sureties thereon. However, the retroactive effect of this section shall not apply to the release of any such bond or security or surety on any estate, guardianship, or trust on which a bond or security or surety was required as a result of the failure of a probated will to waive bond, security, or surety.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Whenever any bank or trust company organized under the laws of this state or any national bank doing business in this state is acting as trustee, guardian, executor, administrator, or other fiduciary and has a nominee, whether an individual, a corporation or a partnership, in whose name stocks, bonds, debentures, or any other corporate securities in registered form, may be registered, it shall be lawful and any such fiduciary is hereby authorized to register any such securities in the name of such nominee without disclosure of the trust or other fiduciary relationship on the face of the instrument evidencing such securities or in the bond registry or on the books of the corporation issuing the same, provided that:
     </p>
     <p>
      the books and records kept by the fiduciary and the accounts rendered by it shall clearly reflect the ownership of such securities by the fiduciary,
     </p>
     <p>
      the securities registered in the name of the nominee shall at all times be retained in the possession of the fiduciary and the nominee shall have no access thereto except under the immediate supervision of the fiduciary, and
     </p>
     <p>
      the fiduciary shall be personally liable for any loss to the trust or estate resulting from any act or neglect of such nominee with respect to any securities registered in the name of the nominee.
     </p>
     <p>
      Whenever any such bank or trust company is acting jointly with others as trustee or executor of a trust or estate it shall be lawful by agreement with such other fiduciary to register the securities of such trust or estate in the name of such bank or trust company’s nominee; and in the event two such banks or trust companies shall be acting as co-fiduciaries it shall be lawful to register the securities of the trust or estate in the name of the nominee of either fiduciary or by agreement to register a proportionate part thereof in the name of the nominee of each fiduciary.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Every director of every state bank must be the owner, in his or her own right, of unencumbered stock therein to the amount of at least Two Hundred Dollars ($200.00) par value. He shall take and subscribe an annual oath that he will faithfully and diligently perform the duties of his office and will not knowingly violate or permit to be violated any provision of law. Such oath shall be immediately transmitted to the Department of Banking and Consumer Finance and filed in its office. Every executive officer, as defined in Regulation O promulgated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, of every bank doing business under the laws of this state shall subscribe to a similar annual oath and immediately transmit the same to the Department of Banking and Consumer Finance. The board of directors of every banking corporation shall meet at least once each quarter in each calendar year and shall at such times consider generally the affairs of the bank. An executive and auditing committee selected by a majority of the board of directors shall meet at least in those months when the board of directors does not meet and shall at such times consider generally the affairs of the bank. However, if the board of directors of any bank meets every month, the executive and auditing committee of that bank shall meet at least two (2) times annually. The Commissioner of Banking and Consumer Finance, in his discretion, may prescribe such forms as he may deem necessary, which, when properly executed, shall reflect the activities of the board of directors or the executive and auditing committee. It shall be the responsibility of the board of directors and the executive and auditing committee at such meetings to complete the forms prescribed and furnished by the Department of Banking and Consumer Finance, and to file same in its office when required by the commissioner.
     </p>
     <p>
      The results of the examinations by the board of directors and the executive and auditing committee shall be entered in the minutes of the bank.

    Loans to directors and executive officers.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Loans aggregating fifteen percent (15%) of the unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus may be made by any state bank to any director or executive officer thereof, as defined in Regulation O promulgated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, less existing direct and indirect liabilities thereto, upon affirmative approval of a majority of all directors spread on the minutes of a directors’ meeting held before such loan is made, provided, such loan is made on substantially the same terms and conditions extended to other borrowers for comparable transactions. Any state bank may lend to any such director or executive officer thereof, upon affirmative approval of a majority of all directors spread on the minutes of a directors’ meeting held before such loan is made, not more than twenty percent (20%) of the unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus of the bank, less the amount of existing direct and indirect liabilities, when secured; or when the portion thereof in excess of any amount loaned under the first provision hereof is secured by obligations of the United States government, the State of Mississippi, and the levee districts, counties, road districts, school districts, and municipalities of the State of Mississippi, obligations of any other state of the United States and other bonds of recognized character and standing, which are the subject of daily newspaper market quotations, provided such loan shall not exceed eighty percent (80%) of the market or par value (whichever is less) of the bonds or obligations offered as security. Any state bank may lend to any executive officer or director thereof upon affirmative approval of a majority of all directors spread on the minutes of a directors’ meeting held before such loan is made, such amount as is safe and proper, when secured by warehouse receipts or shippers’ order bills of lading representing actual existing values, provided the amount loaned shall not exceed eighty percent (80%) of the market value of the commodities representing the actual existing values, and loans of this nature shall be made payable on demand so that the security held therefor may be sold on any date and the proceeds thereof applied to the payment of the loan. However, a bank’s board of directors may, as shown in its minutes, give to a bank officer the authority to make secured or unsecured loans to an executive officer or director of such bank, without receiving the board’s prior approval, in an amount that, when aggregated with the amount of all other extensions of credit to that person and to all related interests of that person, does not exceed the greater of Twenty-five Thousand Dollars ($25,000.00) or five percent (5%) of the bank’s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus. However, no state bank shall extend credit to any director or executive officer thereof, in an amount that, when aggregated with all other extensions of credit to that person and to all related interests of that person, exceeds Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000.00) without documented prior affirmative approval of a majority of its directors.
     </p>
     <p>
      Loans and discounts by a state bank to a director or executive officer thereof secured in full by funds on deposit in time or savings accounts with the lending bank to the credit of the borrower shall not be restricted to the fifteen percent (15%) or twenty percent (20%) limitations herein prescribed.
     </p>
     <p>
      The limitations of this section shall not apply where an executive officer or director shall bona fide purchase from the bank at a reasonable price real or personal property acquired by the bank in payment of debts due the bank, provided such transactions are approved by a majority of the board of directors, such approval to be shown in their minutes; and, in cases where loans are made by branch banks, the sum total of loans made by any branch or branches and its parent bank to such executive officer or director shall be computed as against the total capital stock and surplus of the parent bank and its branch or branches. Loans heretofore made to executive officers or directors may be renewed or extended if in accord with sound banking practice.

       § 81-5-62.
    Accounts payable at death.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      [Effective from and after January 1, 2020]
     </p>
     <p>
      Accounts payable at death may be established under the following conditions:
     </p>
     <p>
      An account in a bank, including a national bank, may be opened by any person or persons with directions to make such an account payable on the death of the person or persons opening such an account to the named beneficiary or beneficiaries. When an account is so opened, the bank shall pay any monies to the credit of the account from time to time to, or pursuant to the order of, the person or persons opening such an account during his or their lifetime in the same manner as if the account were in the sole name or names of such person or persons. The term “accounts” or “account” as used in this section shall include, but not be limited to, any form of deposit or account, such as a savings account, checking account, time deposit, demand deposit or certificate of deposit, whether negotiable, nonnegotiable or otherwise.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the named beneficiary or one (1) of the beneficiaries so named is an individual beneficiary and the individual beneficiary or beneficiaries survive the death of the person opening such an account, and the individual beneficiary or all of the individual beneficiaries so named are sixteen (16) years of age or over at the death of the person opening such an account, the bank shall pay the monies to the credit of the account, less all setoffs and charges, to the named individual beneficiary or beneficiaries or upon his or their order, as hereinafter provided, and such payment by the bank shall be valid, notwithstanding any lack of legal age of the named beneficiary or beneficiaries; provided, however, where such an account is opened or subsequently held by more than one (1) person, the death of one (1) of such persons shall not terminate the account and the account shall continue as to the surviving person or persons and the named beneficiary or beneficiaries subject to the provisions of paragraphs (c) through (j) of this section. For purposes of this section, the term “individual beneficiary” shall refer to a living person who is the named beneficiary of a payable on death account.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the named individual beneficiary or all of the individual beneficiaries so named survive the death of the person or persons opening such an account and are under sixteen (16) years of age at such time, the bank shall pay the monies to the credit of the account, less all setoffs and charges:
     </p>
     <p>
      When or after the named individual beneficiary becomes sixteen (16) years of age, to the named beneficiary or upon his order; or
     </p>
     <p>
      When more than one (1) individual beneficiary is named, the bank shall pay to each individual beneficiary so named his proportionate interest in such account as each severally becomes sixteen (16) years of age; or
     </p>
     <p>
      To the legal guardian of the named individual beneficiary, wherever appointed and qualified, or where more than one (1) beneficiary is named, the bank shall pay such individual beneficiary’s proportionate interest in such account to his legal guardian wherever and whenever appointed and qualified; or
     </p>
     <p>
      If no guardian is appointed and qualified, payment may be made in accordance with the provisions of Section 93-20-209 or 93-20-431 in situations to which such section or sections are applicable.
     </p>
     <p>
      Where the death of the person or persons opening such an account terminates the account under the provisions of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, and where one or more of the named individual beneficiaries are under sixteen (16) years of age and the remainder of the named individual beneficiaries are sixteen (16) years of age or over, the bank shall pay the monies, less all setoffs and charges, to:
     </p>
     <p>
      The named individual beneficiaries sixteen (16) years of age or over at the time of termination of such account pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section; and
     </p>
     <p>
      The named individual beneficiaries under sixteen (16) years of age at the time of termination of such account pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the named beneficiary or one (1) of the beneficiaries so named is a revocable trust, evidenced by a written trust agreement, which trust is still in existence at the death of the person opening such an account, the bank shall pay the monies to the credit of the account, less all setoffs and charges, to the trustee of the named revocable trust or upon his or their order, as hereinafter provided, upon being presented an affidavit by the trustee stating that the name of the trust, the names of the current trustees, and that the trust is still in existence at the time of presentment of the affidavit. Such payment by the bank shall be valid, notwithstanding any lack of actual authority by the trustee, and the bank shall be discharged and released to the same extent as if the bank had dealt with the personal representative of the decedent. Such bank shall not be required to see to the proper application of the monies or evidence thereof or to inquire into the truth of any statement presented in the affidavit by the trustee.
     </p>
     <p>
      Where such account is opened or subsequently held by more than one (1) person, the bank, in the absence of any written instructions to the contrary which are consented to by the bank, shall accept payments made to such account and may pay any monies to the credit of such account from time to time to, or pursuant to the order of, either or any of such persons during their life or lives in the same manner as if the account were in the sole name of either or any of such persons.
     </p>
     <p>
      When a person or persons open an account in a bank in the form set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, and makes a payment or payments to such account or causes a payment or payments to be made to such account, it shall be conclusively presumed that such person or persons intend to vest in the named beneficiary or beneficiaries a present beneficial interest in such payment so made and in the monies to the credit of the account from time to time, to the end that, if the named beneficiary or beneficiaries survive the person or persons opening such an account, all the right and title of the person or persons opening such an account in and to the monies to the credit of the account at the death of such person or persons, less all setoffs and charges, shall, at such death, vest solely and indefeasibly in the named beneficiary or beneficiaries subject to the conditions and limitations of paragraphs (b) through (j) of this section.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the named individual beneficiary predeceases the person opening such an account, or if the named beneficiary is a revocable trust that is terminated, the present beneficial interest presumed to be vested in the named beneficiary pursuant to paragraph (g) of this section shall terminate at the death of the named individual beneficiary or upon the termination of the revocable trust named as a beneficiary. In such case, the personal representatives of the named individual beneficiary, the beneficiaries of the revocable trust, and all others claiming through or under the named beneficiary, shall have no right in or title to the monies to the credit of the account, and the bank shall pay such monies, less all setoffs and charges, to the person opening such an account or pursuant to his order in the same manner as if the account were in the sole name of the person opening such an account; provided, however, where such an account names more than one (1) beneficiary, the death of one (1) of the individual beneficiaries or the termination of a revocable trust beneficiary so named shall not terminate the account and the account shall continue as to the surviving beneficiary or beneficiaries subject to the provisions of paragraphs (b) through (j) of this section.
     </p>
     <p>
      A bank which makes any payment pursuant to paragraphs (b) through (h) of this section, prior to service upon the bank of an order of court restraining such payment, shall, to the extent of each payment so made, be released from all claims of the person or persons opening such an account, the named beneficiary or beneficiaries, their legal representatives, and all others claiming through or under them.
     </p>
     <p>
      When an account is opened in a form described in paragraph (a) of this section, the right of the named beneficiary or beneficiaries to be vested with sole and indefeasible title to the monies to the credit of the account on the death of the person or persons opening such an account shall not be denied, abridged or in anyway affected because such right has not been created by a writing executed in accordance with the law of this state prescribing the requirements to effect a valid testamentary disposition of property.

      <p>
       A testator cannot, by will, dispose of property which he or she placed, during his or her lifetime, in a validly created joint tenancy account with rights of survivorship. A subsequent will does not destroy the joint tenancy and does not terminate that tenancy and divest the corpus of it into the estate of the testator. In re Will & Estate of Strange, 548 So. 2d 1323, 1989 Miss. LEXIS 431 (Miss. 1989).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section [Code 1942, § 5205] does not limit right to create joint tenancy, with right of survivorship in personal property. Stewart v. Barksdale, 216 Miss. 760, 63 So. 2d 108, 1953 Miss. LEXIS 691 (Miss. 1953).

       <p>
   When three individuals jointly owned four certificates of deposit (CDs), and the word “or” was listed in between the owners’ names on the CDs, any one of the owners were entitled to treat the CDs as their own, pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t81c05s81-5-63ol11" target="_self">81-5-63(1)</a></cite>, and each had an equal right to withdraw the CDs; thus, the bank holding the CDs was not allowed to favor one owner over another. Epperson v. SOUTHBank, 2011 Miss. App. LEXIS 350 (Miss. Ct. App. June 14, 2011), rev'd, 93 So.3d 10, 2012 Miss. LEXIS 248 (Miss. 2012).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a case where a certificate of deposit (CD) was jointly owned, a bank was properly found not liable when one owner unilaterally withdrew the funds for placement into another CD; either of the co-owners were able to withdraw the funds. DeJean v. DeJean, 982 So. 2d 443, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 730 (Miss. Ct. App. 2007), cert. denied, 981 So. 2d 298, 2008 Miss. LEXIS 236 (Miss. 2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Trustee was granted summary judgment against the debtors’ children for the value of the proceeds from certificates of deposit (CDs), pursuant to <cite class="us_code">11 U.S.C. § 550(a)</cite>(1), and avoided, pursuant to <cite class="us_code">11 U.S.C. § 548(a)</cite>(1)(B), the debtor wife’s transfers of the proceeds into bank accounts for the children because the CDs vested in the debtor, the designated payable on death beneficiary, when the owner died and the transfers were made within one year of the bankruptcy filing, were made while the debtors were insolvent, and were made for no consideration or less than reasonably equivalent value. Applewhite v. Akin (In re Akin), 366 B.R. 619, 2007 Bankr. LEXIS 1385 (Bankr. N.D. Miss. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a confidential relationship existed, the law governing inter vivos gifts, rather than testamentary dispositions, applied in determining the validity of the establishment of joint accounts, even though the beneficiary did not exercise control over the assets in the accounts until after the depositor’s death, and therefore proof of mental incompetence or an abuse of the confidential relationship was not required to raise a rebuttable presumption of undue influence accompanying the establishment of the joint accounts; thus, the beneficiary of the establishment of the joint accounts had the burden of proving, by clear and convincing evidence, the absence of undue influence. Madden v. Rhodes, 626 So. 2d 608, 1993 Miss. LEXIS 412 (Miss. 1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       A person may make a gift in joint tenure by making a deposit of the subject of the gift in a bank in such a manner that it will stand to the credit of the donor and the donee as joint owners. Leverette v. Ainsworth, 199 Miss. 652, 23 So. 2d 798, 1945 Miss. LEXIS 285 (Miss. 1945).
      </p>
      <p>
       Precise form is not essential to create a joint bank account with right of survivorship when formal deficiencies are supplied by definite proof. Leverette v. Ainsworth, 199 Miss. 652, 23 So. 2d 798, 1945 Miss. LEXIS 285 (Miss. 1945).
      </p>
      <p>
       To create a joint bank deposit or account with right of survivorship, it must be either in the form of a deposit to the credit of depositor or another named person, or in similarity thereto, or else the intention to create a joint account for deposit must be well proved aliunde. Leverette v. Ainsworth, 199 Miss. 652, 23 So. 2d 798, 1945 Miss. LEXIS 285 (Miss. 1945).
      </p>
      <p>
       Mere fact that bank account is made subject to the checks of two or more persons does not in itself constitute evidence of joint ownership. Leverette v. Ainsworth, 199 Miss. 652, 23 So. 2d 798, 1945 Miss. LEXIS 285 (Miss. 1945).
      </p>
      <p>
       Deposit in bank to the credit of depositor or another named person raises a presumption under this section that the deposit was intended to be in joint ownership, and subject to withdrawal by either of the joint owners. Leverette v. Ainsworth, 199 Miss. 652, 23 So. 2d 798, 1945 Miss. LEXIS 285 (Miss. 1945).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where proven facts sufficiently disclose a clear intention to create a right which embraces the essential elements of joint ownership and survivorship in respect to a particular bank deposit or account, the intention so proved will be given effect and the survivor will be held entitled to the fund. Leverette v. Ainsworth, 199 Miss. 652, 23 So. 2d 798, 1945 Miss. LEXIS 285 (Miss. 1945).
      </p>
      <p>
       Transaction whereby depositor made a bank deposit to the credit of his mother but subject to check by the depositor at any time, did not create a joint account or deposit with right of survivorship in the absence of proof that the depositor clearly intended to create such an account, so that upon the depositor’s death the deposit belonged to his estate. Leverette v. Ainsworth, 199 Miss. 652, 23 So. 2d 798, 1945 Miss. LEXIS 285 (Miss. 1945).

   Section<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t81c05s81-5-63" target="_self">81-5-63</a></cite> and §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t81c12s81-12-137" target="_self">81-12-137</a></cite>, which deal, respectively, with joint deposits in a bank checking account and in a savings account in a savings association, create a presumption of joint tenancy ownership with the right of survivorship. On the other hand, such presumption does not apply to bank issued certificates of deposit held in the names of 2 or more persons, in the absence of express intent on the certificate to create such joint tenancy. Delta Fertilizer, Inc. v. Weaver, 547 So. 2d 800, 1989 Miss. LEXIS 366 (Miss. 1989).
      </p>
      <p>
       A presumption arises that a bank account either in the name of “Mr. or Mrs. J. H. Barrow” or in the name of “Mr. or Mrs. J. H. Barrow, payable to the order of either or survivor” created joint ownership with the right of survivorship. Shearin v. Coleman, 201 Miss. 193, 28 So. 2d 841, 1947 Miss. LEXIS 384 (Miss. 1947).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where deposit is made in name of two persons, payable to either, statutory presumption, in absence of evidence to the contrary, is sufficient to establish right to deposit in the survivor. In re Lewis' Estate, 194 Miss. 480, 13 So. 2d 20, 1943 Miss. LEXIS 89 (Miss. 1943).

      <p>
       In an action by an administrator with will annexed against the daughter of the decedent to recover money in a joint bank account of the decedent and the daughter upon the grounds that the decedent was induced to create the joint account by undue influence and fraud practiced upon him by the daughter, and that the decedent did not have the mental capacity to create the account, the evidence sustained the chancellor’s findings contrary to the administrator’s contentions. Edwards v. Jefcoat, 230 Miss. 56, 92 So. 2d 342, 1957 Miss. LEXIS 344 (Miss. 1957).
      </p>
      <p>
       The presumption created by this statute was not overcome by evidence that one of two persons in whose names certificates of deposit were issued in the alternative bequeathed a considerable cash legacy to another. Shearin v. Coleman, 201 Miss. 193, 28 So. 2d 841, 1947 Miss. LEXIS 384 (Miss. 1947).

       Daughter was a joint owner of the funds at issue when the conservatorship for her father was established, and the formal transfer of the funds from joint accounts to conservatorship accounts did not destroy her survivorship interest in those funds; during the father’s life, the funds in the joint accounts were properly used to pay for his necessary care and living expenses, but the daughter retained her survivorship interest in the unused funds following his death. Jackson v. Touchstone (In re Addison), 242 So.3d 926, 2018 Miss. App. LEXIS 15 (Miss. Ct. App. 2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       The joint owner of three certificates of deposit was entitled to them by right of survivorship where the decedent’s attorney in fact under a power of attorney placed the joint owner’s name on the certificates of deposit, the attorney in fact and the joint owner never shared a confidential relationship while the attorney in fact acted for the decedent, there was no evidence that the attorney in fact acted in bad faith, and the joint owner and the decedent did not share a confidential relationship until after the joint owner’s name was placed on the certificates of deposit. In re Dunn v. Reilly, 784 So. 2d 935, 2001 Miss. LEXIS 126 (Miss. 2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       The 1988 amendment to this section, which created a conclusive presumption of survivorship, applied to certificates of deposit procured in 1986 and renewed in 1992. McNeil v. Hester, 753 So. 2d 1057, 2000 Miss. LEXIS 23 (Miss. 2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       Certificates of deposit issued to the decedent and her son as joint tenants and a personal checking account registered jointly in her name and her son’s name did not pass under the decedent’s will, but passed pursuant to the banking documents, notwithstanding a prior will which instructed that her estate be shared by her children equally. Horn v. Horn (Estate of Huddleston), 755 So. 2d 435, 1999 Miss. App. LEXIS 16 (Miss. Ct. App. 1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       Joint bank account in Mississippi was not product of the depositor’s business colleague’s undue influence, so as to overcome presumption that funds belonged to colleague, as survivor; although depositor and colleague had close relationship, colleague was not in position to exercise dominant influence over depositor when account was opened, and there was no showing that colleague did not act in good faith or that depositor did not act independently in his actions. Cantrell v. Pat O'Brien's Bar, La. App. 97-0545, 705 So. 2d 1205, 1998 La. App. LEXIS 8 (La.App. 4 Cir. 1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       A certificate of deposit payable to the decedent and her heir, which was renewed by the decedent in 1981, created a right of survivorship in the heir. Estate of Stamper v. Edwards, 607 So. 2d 1141, 1992 Miss. LEXIS 544 (Miss. 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Funds represented by a 1981 certificate of deposit made “payable on death” to the decedent’s heir did not constitute any part of the decedent’s estate, but rather, by reason of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t81c05s81-5-63" target="_self">81-5-63</a></cite>, the funds became vested in the heir upon the decedent’s death. Estate of Stamper v. Edwards, 607 So. 2d 1141, 1992 Miss. LEXIS 544 (Miss. 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a proceeding to determine the husband’s right to renounce his wife’s will, where a certificate of deposit in the bank was payable to the wife or the wife’s brother, upon the death of the wife, this deposit became the property of the brother, and was no portion of the wife’s estate. Myers v. Laird, 230 Miss. 675, 93 So. 2d 828, 1957 Miss. LEXIS 409 (Miss. 1957).

   Deposits in a savings account in the name of a customer or her nephew, who was the executor of her estate, were presumptively intended to be in joint ownership and subject to withdrawal by either of the joint owners pursuant to §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t81c05s81-5-63" target="_self">81-5-63</a></cite>, and therefore the bank had a right to set off the balance in the account against the nephew’s debt to the bank where the nephew did not give notice to the bank that the funds were an asset of the estate of his deceased aunt rather than his alone as survivor, and some of the nephew’s dealings with the account prior to and after his aunt’s death concerned his individual interests unrelated in any way to his aunt.

      <p>
       Reversion of certificates of deposit (CDs) to their status prior to amendments by the decedent’s adult child through a durable power of attorney was appropriate because the decedent and the adult child maintained a confidential relationship, failed to rebut the presumption of undue influence, and abused the adult child’s authority under the power of attorney by amending the parties to the CDs. Because the decedent retained an ownership interest in the CDs, neither the original conveyance, nor the subsequent transfers were inter vivos gifts. In re Estate of Johnson, 237 So.3d 698, 2017 Miss. LEXIS 457 (Miss. 2017).

       § 81-5-77.
    Limit of loans and extensions of credit to single borrower.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The liability to a bank by a person, company, corporation or firm for all loans and extensions of credit, including in the liability of such person, company or firm, where a partnership, the liabilities of the several members thereof, shall not exceed twenty percent (20%) of the aggregate unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus of the bank.
     </p>
     <p>
      The following shall not be restricted to or considered as coming within the limitations of twenty percent (20%) prescribed in subsection (a):
     </p>
     <p>
      Loans and discounts secured by warehouse receipts or shippers’ order bills of lading representing actually existing values, provided the amount of such loans and discounts shall not exceed eighty-five percent (85%) of the market value of the commodities representing the actually existing values.
     </p>
     <p>
      Loans and discounts secured by bonds, certificates or notes constituting direct obligations of the United States government, or bonds fully guaranteed by the United States government, or by full faith and credit obligations of the State of Mississippi; however, the Commissioner of Banking and Consumer Finance shall from time to time determine and fix the maximum percentage of the par value of all such securities that may be loaned.
     </p>
     <p>
      Loans and discounts to the extent that they are secured or covered by guaranties, or by commitments, or agreements to take over or purchase the same, made by any federal reserve bank, or by the United States, or any department, bureau, board, commission or establishment of the United States, including any corporation wholly owned directly or indirectly by the United States; provided that such guaranties, agreements or commitments are unconditional and are to be performed by payment within sixty (60) days after demand; provided, further, that the Commissioner of Banking and Consumer Finance is authorized to define the terms used in this section and may by regulation control the making of loans under this paragraph (iii).
     </p>
     <p>
      Loans and discounts secured in full by funds on deposit in time or savings accounts with the lending bank to the credit of the borrower.
     </p>
     <p>
      The limit on loans and extensions of credit applicable to any one (1) person, company, corporation, or firm under this section shall take into consideration credit exposure arising from derivative transactions between the bank and the party. For purposes of this section, the term “derivative transaction” includes any transaction that is a contract, agreement, swap, warrant, note, or option that is based, in whole or in part, on the value of, any interest in, or any quantitative measure or the occurrence of any event relating to, one or more commodities, securities, currencies, interest or other rates, indices, or other assets.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any officer or director who approves or makes loans prohibited in this section shall be liable individually for the full amount of the principal and interest of any such loan or extension of credit. If the Commissioner of Banking and Consumer Finance discovers, in any examination of any open bank that there is a loss on any loan or extension of credit made in violation of this section, he shall make demand of all directors and officers approving or making such loan or extension of credit for payment of the entire unpaid balance on any such loan or extension of credit. Like demand shall be made and suit brought by the receiver of any bank in liquidation.
     </p>
     <p>
      However, this section shall not apply to loans or extensions of credit to the State of Mississippi, or to any political subdivision thereof, nor to any levee district.

This statute relates to deposits and loans which are not related in the customary function of business but are manipulated and procured by third parties (by whatever name known) for profit and the withdrawal or attempt to withdraw said deposit before said loan is sufficiently satisfied shall be sufficient authority for any state or federal supervising authority to act promptly on evidence presented to it or obtained by said agency. If any bank in the State of Mississippi shall be put into liquidation and such deposit and loan arrangements have made any contribution whatsoever to the insolvency of said bank, then the state or federal agency, the duly appointed liquidating agency or receiver, or the appropriate chancery court in charge of the liquidation of said bank shall have the right and duty to withhold any liquidating dividends or payments for said deposit or deposits until the loan or loans which the deposits have influenced are fully satisfied, and the liquidating agent or receiver shall have the right upon the approval of the chancery court to assign said loan or loans so influenced to the depositor or depositors in satisfaction of said deposit or deposits claimed against the assets of the bank in liquidation.

Any violation of this provision by a bank shall authorize the state comptroller to deal with it as a bank being operated in violation of the laws, provided, however, that this section shall in no wise impair any obligation of banks for payment of loans and rediscounts in excess of the limit herein provided, nor shall any bank owing money heretofore borrowed in excess of this limit be held to be acting in violation of the law as to such existing loans.

    Consolidation, conversion or merger of state or state and national banks, state or federal savings and loan associations and state-chartered banks, and state or federal savings banks and state-chartered banks.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Any two (2) or more state-chartered banks, or any national bank and any state-chartered bank, or any state or federal savings and loan association and any state-chartered bank, or any state or federal savings bank and any state-chartered bank, may, with the approval of the commissioner, consolidate with or merge into one (1) state-chartered bank, under the charter of the existing state bank, on such terms and conditions, as may be lawfully agreed upon, adopted and approved in a merger plan in accordance with Article 11, Chapter 4 of Title 79, Mississippi Code of 1972. Following receipt of the required corporate approvals and approval of the merger plan by the commissioner, the resulting amendments to charters of any state-chartered bank that is a party to the merger plan shall be approved and filed with other state officials in accordance with Section 81-3-15. The capital stock of such consolidated bank shall not be less than that required under the Mississippi banking laws for the organization of a bank in the place in which it is located. And all the rights, franchises and interests of the institutions so consolidated in and to every species of property, personal and mixed, and choses in action thereto belonging, shall be deemed to be transferred to and vested in such bank into which they are consolidated without any deed or other transfer, and the said consolidated bank shall hold and enjoy the same and all rights of property, franchises and interests in the same manner and to the same extent as were held and enjoyed by the institutions so consolidated therewith.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any national bank, state or federal savings and loan association, or state or federal savings bank may apply for conversion into a state-chartered bank upon the affirmative vote of the shareholders owning at least two-thirds (2/3) of its capital stock outstanding, or of fifty-one percent (51%) or more of the total number of the members, at a meeting called by the directors, notice of which, specifying the purpose, shall be given the manner required by the bylaws, or in the absence of such bylaw, then by sending the notice to each shareholder of record by registered mail at least ten (10) days before the meeting. Upon such affirmative vote, the converting institution may apply for a certificate of authority by filing with the commissioner a certificate signed by its president and cashier which sets forth the corporate action herein prescribed and asserts that the institution has complied with the provisions of the laws of the United States. The converting institution shall also file with the commissioner the plan of conversion and the proposed amendments to its articles of incorporation as approved by the stockholders for the operation of the institution as a state bank. Upon receipt of the prescribed application, the commissioner shall examine all facts associated with the conversion. The expenses and cost incurred for such special examination shall be paid by the institution applying for permission to convert. The commissioner shall present his findings and recommendations to the State Board of Banking Review for consideration. Upon approval by the State Board of Banking Review, the commissioner shall issue a certificate of authority to the applicant allowing the conversion to proceed.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any bank, savings and loan association or savings bank chartered by the State of Mississippi is hereby authorized to convert into, consolidate with, or merge with a national bank domiciled in the State of Mississippi, with the national bank charter surviving, without approval of the Department of Banking and Consumer Finance, the Commissioner of Banking and Consumer Finance, or any state authority whatsoever.

       § 81-5-87.
    Holding of real estate by bank.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Any banking corporation doing business in this state may purchase, hold and convey real estate for the following purposes and no others:
     </p>
     <p>
      Such real estate as shall be necessary in which to transact the business of any such bank, including with its banking offices, premises in the same building to rent as a source of income, also such real estate and improvements necessary for the operation and conduct of its branch banks, branch offices, drive-in windows and parking facilities not connected to the main office, branch banks or branch offices. The book value of the bank’s real estate shall not exceed fifty percentum (50%) of its net capital funds as published by the last preceding call statement as of December 31, and this shall be without regard to population but subject to the approval of the state comptroller; however, the book value of such real estate and improvements shall be reduced each year the amount that is allowable for depreciation by the Internal Revenue Service until such book value shall be reduced to at least twenty-five percentum (25%) of the net capital funds as shown by its last published statement as of December 31. None of the facilities, main banking quarters, branch banks, branch offices, drive-in windows or parking facilities not connected to the main office, branch banks or branch offices shall be purchased or commenced without first having the approval of the state comptroller.
     </p>
     <p>
      Such real estate as shall be purchased by or conveyed to such bank in satisfaction of or on account of debts previously contracted in the usual course of its business.
     </p>
     <p>
      Such real estate as shall be purchased at sale under judgments, decrees or mortgages, or deeds of trust, foreclosure under securities held by such bank or under any security or lien which is a superior lien to that held by said bank.
     </p>
     <p>
      Upon approval of the state comptroller, a bank may purchase additional real estate for future expansion or future new quarters but if said real estate is not developed for the purpose intended and purchased, the said real estate shall be disposed of within a period of five (5) years or reduced to a book value of one dollar ($1.00).
     </p>
     <p>
      Any real estate acquired as provided in subsections (b) and (c) of this section shall be carried in the bank statement at such sound values as may be approved by the state comptroller, not to exceed its cost to the bank, and shall be sold within five years after the title thereto is acquired; unless the consent of the state comptroller is obtained in writing, extending such period; provided, however, no such extension shall be for more than five years. If any such real estate is not sold within the time herein limited, or within the time as extended by the state comptroller, it shall not thereafter be carried as a book asset of the bank in excess of one dollar ($1.00). It is not the purpose of other real estate acquired under subsections (b) and (c) of this section to be treated as part of the fifty percentum (50%) of net capital recited in the first paragraph of this section.

       § 81-5-101.
    Dissolution of solvent banks.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      When the owners of two-thirds of the capital stock of any solvent corporation engaged in a banking business shall have determined and voted to dissolve the corporation, they shall proceed in the following manner, to-wit:
     </p>
     <p>
      The corporation shall advise the department of bank supervision by registered mail, over the signature of the board of directors of said corporation, of their intention to liquidate, accompanied by a certified copy of the minutes of the stockholders meeting authorizing the liquidation, and shall cause notice to be published once each week for three consecutive weeks in some newspaper published within the county in which the corporation is domiciled, giving the date of the proposed liquidation, and calling on all creditors and depositors to present for payment their claims against such corporation not later than sixty days after said date of liquidation. With said notice to the department of bank supervision the corporation shall file a detailed statement of its assets and liabilities.
     </p>
     <p>
      The stockholders of the corporation shall, by and with the approval of the state comptroller appoint a special agent who shall have charge of said liquidation and shall be responsible to the creditors and stockholders of such corporation and to the department of bank supervision for the proper liquidation of the affairs of the corporation. The special agent shall furnish bond to be approved by the state comptroller for the faithful performance of his duties as special agent and shall receive as salary not more than $200.00 per month out of the assets of the liquidating bank while actively engaged in the liquidation of the affairs of the bank and shall be at all times under the supervision of the department of bank supervision. The certificate of appointment of the special agent shall be filed in the office of the department of bank supervision, and a certified copy filed in the office of the chancery clerk of the county in which the bank is domiciled.
     </p>
     <p>
      Upon the date set for the liquidation of the bank as per published notice the special agent shall take charge and file with the department of bank supervision a sworn detailed statement of the assets and liabilities of the bank as shown by the books of the same, a certified copy to be filed in the office of the chancery clerk of said county. He shall proceed to pay in full as presented all claims of creditors and depositors and shown by the books of the bank and all claims which may be proven against the bank.
     </p>
     <p>
      A sufficient bond to be approved by the state comptroller in such amount as he may require shall be furnished by the stockholders of the bank made and conditioned to insure the payment of all liabilities as shown by the books of the bank and all proven claims against the bank. The said bond shall be filed in the office of the department of bank supervision. Suit may be brought upon this bond by any creditor claimant, and such suit shall be filed in the chancery court of the county in which the corporation is domiciled. No suit may be brought upon such bond except within four months after date of liquidation as provided in paragraph (a) of this section. When any such suit shall be brought on said bond, notice shall be given by publication in a newspaper published in the county of the domicile of the bank, requiring all creditors and claimants to intervene in order to determine in one proceeding all claims of creditors.
     </p>
     <p>
      At the expiration of sixty days from the date of the liquidation as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, the special agent shall file with the department of bank supervision a detailed report of all his proceedings, collections and disbursements and list of all assets remaining and of all liabilities still unpaid or unclaimed, a certified copy of which shall be filed in the office of the chancery clerk of the county. A list of all unclaimed deposits or creditors as shown by the books together with the amounts due them, shall be delivered in cash, to the department of bank supervision to be deposited by the state comptroller in some bank subject to their order for payment upon presentation of claims by said depositors or creditors. The remaining assets of the bank may be distributed among the stockholders, provided the stockholders shall make sufficient bond approved by the state comptroller in amounts of the capital, surplus and undivided profits of the banks, payable to the State of Mississippi, said bond to expire four months from the date of liquidation as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, if no claim or suit has been filed against such bond. At the expiration of this bond the state comptroller shall give notice by publication for three consecutive weeks in some local or county newspaper of the expiration of said bond, and the said bond shall be relieved from further liability, and the stockholders of the corporation shall be relieved from further liability as stockholders of such corporation.

Such agreement to preserve confidentiality need not be in writing and may be evidenced by an indication of confidentiality on the face of any such self-assessment report, or by a verbal agreement regarding its confidentiality.
     </p>

       Banks may establish branch banks under the restrictions prescribed in this chapter, but no branch bank may be established unless the parent bank shall have first obtained from the commissioner a certificate that the public convenience and necessity will be promoted by the establishment of such branch bank. Applications seeking permission for the establishment of branch banks shall be filed with the commissioner and shall be in such form and contain such information as the commissioner by regulation may require. A separate application shall be filed for each branch bank proposed to be established, and each application shall be accompanied by the fee required by statute, which shall be transferred by the commissioner into the maintenance fund of the Department of Banking and Consumer Finance.
      </li>
      <li id="t81c07s81-7-1ol12">
       Upon receipt of such application, the commissioner shall immediately give written notice of the filing of said application to all banks having their domicile or a branch bank or branch office in the county in which the applicant bank maintains its principal office, together with all banks, branch banks or branch offices located in the county in which the proposed branch bank is to be located, and to such other banks and interested parties that, in the opinion of the commissioner, may have an interest in the application; and the commissioner shall also at the same time publish such notice once in a newspaper having a general circulation in the county in which the proposed branch bank is to be located. Any interested party may file a written protest to said application with the commissioner within thirty (30) days from the date of the mailing and publishing of said notice. Any protest shall specify the interest of the protestant in the application and state the grounds for the protest.
      </li>
      <li id="t81c07s81-7-1ol13">
       If no protest is filed within the time prescribed, the commissioner shall investigate the facts and render a final decision within sixty (60) days after receipt of the application as to whether the public convenience and necessity requires the establishment of the proposed branch bank, said decision to be based upon the results of the commissioner’s investigation, the contents of the application and any additional evidence which the commissioner may request the applicant to furnish. If his decision is favorable to the applicant, he shall immediately grant the applicant a certificate to establish and operate the branch bank. If the commissioner’s decision shall be unfavorable to the applicant, he shall immediately furnish the applicant bank a copy of his final decision.
       <p>
        Appeals from an unfavorable final decision may be taken by the applicant bank to the State Board of Banking Review by filing a notice of appeal with the commissioner within ten (10) days after the commissioner has rendered his final decision. The commissioner shall inform the board of such appeal, and the board shall hold a hearing on the matter within sixty (60) days after such notice is filed. At the hearing the board shall consider the findings and decision of the commissioner, shall hear such oral testimony as the commissioner may wish to give and shall also receive information and testimony from the applicant bank. The board may also consider such other information and evidence as it deems necessary to dispose of the application. The board shall render a decision within sixty (60) days after the conclusion of the final hearing on the matter. If the board’s decision is favorable to the applicant, the commissioner shall immediately grant to the applicant a certificate to establish and operate the branch bank. If the board’s decision is unfavorable to the applicant, the commissioner shall immediately furnish the applicant a copy of the board’s final decision.

       <p>
        Appeals from an unfavorable board decision may be taken by the applicant bank within ten (10) days from the date of the board’s order to the chancery court of the county in which the proposed branch bank is to be located. Except as otherwise provided herein, appeals by an applicant bank from the State Board of Banking Review to a chancery court shall be taken in the manner set forth in Section 81-3-13(2), which governs appeals from the State Board of Banking Review in regard to the incorporation of a new bank.

The board shall hold a hearing on the matter within one hundred twenty (120) days after the application is received and render a final decision thereon within sixty (60) days after the conclusion of the final board hearing.

      <p>
       It is not the purpose of the Mississippi statute to deter competition or foster monopoly, but to guard the public and public interests against imprudent banking, and if the public need will be served by the establishment of a branch bank, commendable activities in community development by other bankers will not act to defeat its establishment. Grenada Bank v. Watson, 361 F. Supp. 728, 1973 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12915 (N.D. Miss. 1973), aff'd, 488 F.2d 1056 (5th Cir. Miss. 1974).

      <p>
       The decision of the comptroller of banks of Mississippi under Code 1942, § 5226 to permit the establishment of a branch bank in an unincorporated community within 100 miles of the parent bank is amply substantiated by the facts and circumstances. First Nat'l Bank v. Camp, 471 F.2d 1322, 1973 U.S. App. LEXIS 12125 (5th Cir. Miss. 1973).
      </p>
      <p>
       The granting of permission to open a branch bank does not depend upon a showing that the existing banks are not rendering adequate service to their customers, or that a branch bank will be in a position to render better service to the public than the banks already in existence, but the finding must be that there is a public need for the establishment of the branch bank, or that the public convenience and necessity will be promoted by its establishment. Grenada Bank v. Watson, 361 F. Supp. 728, 1973 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12915 (N.D. Miss. 1973), aff'd, 488 F.2d 1056 (5th Cir. Miss. 1974).

       In considering a national bank’s simultaneous applications to relocate its main office and create a branch at its present main office the comptroller of currency could consider branching statutes to test the bank’s good faith, but he was neither bound by state laws nor required to ignore them; His decision denying the applications was not capricious, arbitrary, or an abuse of discretion in the light of the facts of the case. First Nat'l Bank v. Camp, 333 F. Supp. 682, 1971 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11039 (N.D. Miss. 1971), aff'd, 467 F.2d 944 (5th Cir. Miss. 1972).
      </p>
      <p>
       A bank which, after consolidation with two smaller banks each serving communities of less than 3,500 population, maintained branch offices in the towns which the consolidated banks had previously served, could not maintain a bill for an injunction to restrain a second bank located in another city from opening branch offices in the towns. Coahoma Bank & Trust Co. v. Bowen, 218 So. 2d 868, 1969 Miss. LEXIS 1627 (Miss. 1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       When a state bank acquired all of the assets and liabilities of two smaller banks and consolidated them with it, the effect was that the charters of the smaller banks were extinguished, and thereafter the surviving bank had no right to carry on a general banking business in the communities of less than 3,500 population where the smaller banks had previously existed. Coahoma Bank & Trust Co. v. Bowen, 218 So. 2d 868, 1969 Miss. LEXIS 1627 (Miss. 1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the action of the comptroller of the currency approving the establishment of a branch of a national bank complied with the federal statutory requirement that its establishment must be one which is expressly authorized to state banks by the law of the state, it will not be declared void. Citizens Bank of Hattiesburg v. Camp, 279 F. Supp. 824, 1967 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11607 (S.D. Miss. 1967).

       The power to permit a bank to establish branch offices in the county in which it is domiciled is not limited to establishment within the corporate boundaries of municipalities. First Nat'l Bank v. Canton Exchange Bank, 247 Miss. 757, 156 So. 2d 580, 1963 Miss. LEXIS 353 (Miss. 1963).

       In considering a national bank’s simultaneous applications to relocate its main office and create a branch at its present main office the comptroller of currency could consider branching statutes to test the bank’s good faith, but he was neither bound by state laws nor required to ignore them; His decision denying the applications was not capricious, arbitrary, or an abuse of discretion in the light of the facts of the case. First Nat'l Bank v. Camp, 333 F. Supp. 682, 1971 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11039 (N.D. Miss. 1971), aff'd, 467 F.2d 944 (5th Cir. Miss. 1972).

      <li id="t81c07s81-7-8ol11">
       A bank chartered after October 16, 1985, may neither establish a branch by merger, consolidation or purchase as provided in Section 81-7-7(2)(b) nor become a branch as the result of such a transaction, unless such bank has been in continuous operation as a state or federally chartered bank, savings association or savings bank for at least its previous five (5) years of existence. For purposes of the five-year requirement, a bank which has been involved in an interim bank merger shall be deemed to have been in operation from the date it began operation under the original charter. “Interim bank merger” means the technique by which a bank holding company obtains a new bank charter solely for the purpose of merging an existing bank into the bank for which the charter is sought or solely for the purpose of merging the bank for which the charter is sought into an existing bank.
      </li>
      <li id="t81c07s81-7-8ol12">
       A bank is prohibited from establishing a branch by merger, consolidation or purchase, as provided for in Section 81-7-7(2)(b), if upon such merger, consolidation or purchase the surviving bank and all of its branch banks and branch offices located in Mississippi would have combined deposits which exceed twenty-five percent (25%) of the total deposits of all offices located in Mississippi of commercial banks, savings banks, savings and loan associations and credit unions. Determination of the percentage of total deposit concentration limited by this subsection shall be made based on data contained in the most recent call reports or reports of condition furnished immediately prior to the merger, consolidation or purchase to the appropriate regulatory officials by the banks involved in the merger, consolidation or purchase. “Appropriate regulatory officials” means, for any national bank in Mississippi, the Comptroller of the Currency of the United States or the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System of the United States; “appropriate regulatory officials” means, for any state-chartered bank in Mississippi, the Commissioner of Banking and Consumer Finance. In determining total deposits of all offices located in Mississippi of commercial banks, savings banks, savings and loan associations and credit unions, data shall be used as furnished by the Department of Banking and Consumer Finance as of the most recent calendar quarter for which complete data are available. For the purpose of furnishing such data, the department shall obtain from appropriate federal regulatory agencies the most recent data available regarding the deposits of federally chartered institutions. For purposes of this subsection and subsection (4) of this section, “deposits” mean all individual, partnership, corporate and government deposits (including, without limitation, all demand, savings, time, certificates of deposit and other similar depository accounts of individuals, partnerships, corporations and governmental bodies).
      </li>
      <li id="t81c07s81-7-8ol13">
       In the sale of any insolvent bank made pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 9, Title 81, Mississippi Code of 1972, or pursuant to federal banking laws, the restrictions contained in subsections (1) and (2) of this section shall not apply to prevent the acquisition of such insolvent bank by another bank; and, additionally, neither restriction shall apply to prohibit any purchasing bank from retaining any established branches of the insolvent bank which the purchasing bank would otherwise be prohibited from establishing.
      </li>
      <li id="t81c07s81-7-8ol14">
       For branching purposes, a parent bank is considered to be located where it was domiciled on June 30, 1986. For any bank opening for business after that date, a parent bank shall be considered for branching purposes to be located where it is first domiciled. Upon a merger, consolidation or purchase as provided for in Section 81-7-7(2)(b), the parent bank for branching purposes of the surviving bank shall be considered to be at the location of the parent bank for branching purposes of the bank involved in such transaction which had the greater amount of deposits based on data contained in the most recent call reports or reports of condition furnished immediately prior to the merger, consolidation or purchase to the appropriate regulatory officials referred to in subsection (2) of this section.

       In order for a parent bank to establish a branch bank through de novo branching, merger, consolidation or purchase after June 30, 1986, the parent bank shall have prior to the approval of any such branch application, and shall be expected to maintain, primary capital and total capital ratios equal to or above the minimum acceptable ratios established by the federal bank regulatory agency which primarily regulates and examines such bank. The components of capital and the method of computing the capital ratios shall be those defined by the applicable federal bank regulatory agency.

     <p>
      Subject to the provisions of subsections (2), (3) and (4) of Section 81-7-8, a bank may annex actively operating unit banks as branch banks by exchanging its own increase of common or preferred capital shares, issued for such annexation purpose, for the capital shares of the bank proposed to be annexed as a branch. Also a bank may annex branch banks by issuing additional common or preferred shares to be exchanged for the assets of closed banks, including assets other than cash. All transactions authorized by this section shall first be submitted in writing in full detail to the commissioner, and shall not be effective until he shall have made a careful analysis and investigation of the soundness of the proposed transaction, and shall have approved the same in writing. In no instance, however, shall the bank building and fixtures of the operating or closed bank, proposed to be annexed as a branch bank, represent in value more than one-third (1/3) of the amount of stock issued by the parent bank for the purpose of such annexation. For purposes of applying the restrictions of subsections (2) and (3) of Section 81-7-8, the annexation of an actively operating unit bank described herein shall be considered the establishment of a branch by merger.

    Capital stock impaired; how restored.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      When it shall be brought to the attention of the state comptroller that the capital stock of any bank is impaired to such an extent as to render a further continuance of its business hazardous to its creditors, depositors, or the public, he shall immediately request the stockholders to pay into the bank a sufficient sum to restore the capital or to execute to him, for the use and benefit of all creditors whether then existing or thereafter created, a bond for such sum as may be required to fully restore the capital stock with good and sufficient sureties to be approved by him, conditioned that all just debts and liabilities, whensoever created, shall be paid in full. Such requests on the part of the state comptroller shall not be compulsory, and any stockholder may refuse to accede to such request. If the stockholders shall fail, within a time to be fixed by the state comptroller, to restore the capital stock or to give such bond, the state comptroller shall close such bank and submit the same to the proper chancery court for liquidation as provided in this chapter. However, when the state comptroller finds the capital stock of any bank to some extent impaired, but considers that a further continuance of its business will not be hazardous to its creditors, depositors, or the public, he may grant any such bank a reasonable time, to be determined by the state comptroller, to overcome or restore such impairment. If the impairment is not overcome or restored within the time allowed for this purpose, the state comptroller shall then proceed to deal with any such bank as provided for above.
     </p>
     <p>
      If stockholders owning one-third (1/3) or more of the total outstanding capital stock of said bank shall refuse to accede to the comptroller’s request, as above provided, for additional capital and if the cause of the comptroller’s request shall have been in part the result of bad management as evidenced by unsatisfactory loans or investments, then any three (3) or more minority stockholders, representing one-third (1/3) or more of the total outstanding capital and surplus, if any, may petition the state comptroller for liquidation of the bank and, if satisfactory action be not taken by the state comptroller within ten days, as set out in said petition of the minority stockholders, then the said minority stockholders, representing one-third or more of the outstanding capital stock, shall have the right to petition the appropriate chancery court for liquidation of the bank and such other relief as the court may render. In such cases, the examination reports of the department of bank supervision and proper federal supervisory agencies shall be prima facie evidence of the cause to be heard.

      After the state comptroller has taken charge of an insolvent bank as herein provided, he shall have power and authority, by and with the consent of the chancery court, or of the chancellor in vacation, to whose jurisdiction the affairs of the insolvent bank have been submitted, (and also of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation if the deposits of such bank be to any extent insured by said corporation) to sell the assets of such insolvent bank to any going bank at such price as may be deemed fair and reasonable value for such assets, allowing the purchasing bank to assume all or a certain percentage of the liabilities of the insolvent bank in payment for the assets so sold or taken over by the purchasing bank. Such sale when approved by the chancery court or chancellor shall have the effect of a quit claim of all the right, title and interest of the comptroller and of the insolvent bank in and to the property and assets so sold and transferred. In such cases the title to all assets other than real estate shall pass to the purchasing bank by delivery, and a conveyance of the real estate of the insolvent bank may be made by the comptroller in the form of a deed of conveyance which shall operate as a special warranty deed against the comptroller and the insolvent bank.

       § 81-9-13.
    Reopening banks under “freezing of deposits” agreements.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The comptroller of banks of the State of Mississippi is authorized to reopen any closed bank, with the approval of the chancery court of the county in which the bank is situated, or of the chancellor thereof in vacation, when at least three-fourths of the general depositors and creditors therein holding unsecured deposits, or any number of the general depositors and creditors therein, provided they own at least three-fourths of the unsecured deposits in or claims against such bank, agree to the reopening thereof and sign what is commonly termed a “freezing-of-deposits” agreement, under which they agree to accept repayment of their deposits and claims in deferred installments, for the full amount thereof or in reduced amounts, with or without interest, the period over which the deposits and claims are to be repaid and the rate of payment, together with the interest rate, if any, to be determined by the comptroller of banks, if the comptroller is convinced that such bank as reopened will be in a solvent condition and can repay the depositors and creditors the amounts of their deposits and claims in accordance with the terms of the agreement for the repayment of same.
     </p>
     <p>
      Before any such bank shall be reopened, the entire plan for the reopening of the same, and all material facts in connection there with, shall be submitted by the comptroller to the chancery court of the county in which the bank is situated, or the chancellor in vacation, by proper petition, duly verified, such petition to contain a statement of the assets and liabilities of the bank and such other information as may be necessary to convey to the court or chancellor the true facts with reference to the condition of such bank, and a decree of the court or chancellor in vacation obtained approving the plan agreed upon and submitted by the comptroller for the reopening of such bank and authorizing the same to be reopened. The hearing of such petition shall be had at such time and place as shall be fixed by the court or chancellor, after ten days’ notice is given of such hearing by publication in some newspaper having a general circulation in the county in which the closed bank is located. The filing of a petition by any closed bank submitted to the jurisdiction of the chancery court of the county of its domicile and publishing of notice to creditors as otherwise provided by law shall vest in said court jurisdiction over all of the assets of said bank and of its creditors and empower it to so act hereunder.
     </p>
     <p>
      When any closed bank has been reopened as herein provided, the general depositors and creditors thereof who have not expressly agreed to accept repayment of their deposits and claims in accordance with the freezing-of-deposits plan shall be bound to accept repayment of their deposits and claims according to the terms of the decree of the court or chancellor in vacation and on the same basis and at the same rate as those general depositors and creditors who have signed the freezing-of-deposits agreement, except that this paragraph shall not apply to deposits of public moneys or to depositors and creditors holding preferred claims, or secured claims, nor to correspondent banks holding bills payable of the closed bank to the extent that same are adequately secured by the collateral held therefor.
     </p>
     <p>
      Proper provision shall be made in the plan for the reopening of such bank to pay public depositors, depositors, and creditors holding preferred and secured claims and correspondent banks holding bills payable to the extent which they are adequately secured by collateral held, on terms acceptable to them, but any arrangement so made shall not operate prejudicially to the rights of the general depositors and creditors of the bank.
     </p>
     <p>
      This section shall not be construed to give the comptroller the right to diminish the assets of a closed bank to the prejudice of the depositors and creditors thereof, and any assets that may be charged out as doubtful or as losses and not carried into the reopened bank as an asset, shall be held by the reopened bank in trust for payment pro rata of such parts of the claims of the depositors and creditors as under the decree authorizing the reopening of the bank are provided shall not be a charge against the assets of the reopened bank. The reopened bank shall be accountable to the said chancery court for the proper handling of such assets not taken into the reopened bank and the payment of the proceeds thereof to the creditors entitled thereto; but without restriction upon the public in dealing with the reopened bank relative thereto nor obligation upon the public so dealing to see that such bank properly accounts therefor.
     </p>
     <p>
      This section is to be liberally construed as an exercise of the police power of the state as a sovereign to legislate with reference to banks as public utilities to promote the public welfare, and shall apply to all closed banks whether heretofore, now or hereafter closed.

   Previous similar provision (Laws 1932, ch. 251) was held merely to change the method of liquidation, making the resumption of business a means of payment of creditors, and therefore not to impair contractual rights or to annul rights of property in violation of Art. I § 10, or of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution.Doty v. Love, <cite class="us_code">295 U.S. 64</cite>, <cite class="s_court">55 S. Ct. 558</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">79 L.

     <p>
      At the end of ninety days, if the state comptroller has not sold the assets of the bank as provided in Section 81-9-11 above, the state comptroller shall file a petition in the proper chancery court in a cause to be entitled “In the matter of the receivership of (name of bank).” Such petition shall recite the taking of the bank into custody under the provisions of this chapter, the failure to sell the assets as provided in Section 81-9-11 above, and shall pray for the appointment of a receiver. The chancellor shall enter an order upon such petition, appointing a receiver of his own selection who shall not have been an officer, director or employee of the bank for a period of five years prior to the closing thereof. However, upon petition signed by the owners and holders of a majority in amount of the deposit liability of the bank, the chancellor may appoint such an officer, director or employee as receiver.

     <p>
      Where a bank chartered under the laws of the State of Mississippi has failed, or may hereafter fail, and in the process of liquidation or after reorganization or reopening of such failed bank certain assets are placed in a separate fund for the benefit of creditors of such bank, it is found that said bank, or the owner of such trust assets, owns stock in, has a lien on, or is in any way interested in the stock of a corporation, organized and doing business under the laws of the State of Mississippi, and such bank, or owners of such trust assets, is unable to sell such stock at its reasonable fair value, and such stock is less than ten percent of the outstanding stock of said corporation, and the remainder of the stock of such corporation is owned by a small number of persons, then the chancery court of the county in which said bank is located is authorized and empowered in a suit brought for that purpose, to fix the value of said stock. In the event the holders of the majority of the stock will not pay the value as fixed by the court then the court shall order the assets of said corporation, or a sufficient amount thereof, to be sold to pay the value of said stock as fixed by the court, if the surplus undivided profits and other accumulations of said corporation are sufficient to take care of the value of said stock as fixed by the court without seriously interfering with the continued operation of said corporation.

      The receiver appointed under Section 81-9-17 shall cause notice to be given in such newspaper as the court may direct, once a week for four consecutive weeks, calling on all persons who may have claims against the bank to present the same and make proof thereof upon forms to be furnished by the receiver, at a place and within a time specified in the notice, which shall be approximately ninety days from the date of the first publication. A copy of the notice shall be mailed to all depositors and creditors as shown by the books of the bank, at their last known post-office address. If the receiver doubts the justice or validity of any claim he shall reject the same by serving notice upon the claimant in writing, and such rejection shall be final unless the claimant shall, within ninety days from the date of such rejection, petition the chancellor in the receivership cause for a review of the action of the receiver. Claims presented more than ninety days after the first publication of the above recited notice shall be entitled to share only in dividends thereafter paid.

       Where receiver is merely custodian of fund for distribution to beneficiaries of proceeds of law suit which has been compromised and settled, it is within discretion of trial court to permit a beneficiary to intervene and file claim to portion of the fund after the expiration of the time allowed by order of the court for that purpose.

       A claim should be admitted at any time before actual distribution, or even after partial distribution if there is surplus in hands of receiver so as not to interfere with payments already made, even though not filed within the time specified in an order given for the publication of notice, where reasonable excuse for such delay is shown.

The notice shall direct that said parties call for said dividends prior to the day set for the filing of written objections, otherwise, their claim thereto shall be forfeited. On the day of the final hearing if there are dividends on hand which have not been called for, the receiver shall not be discharged, but the chancellor, by order entered on the minutes of the court, shall direct the receiver to make distribution of such unclaimed dividends to the known depositors and creditors pro rata. In the event the known depositors and creditors have already been paid in full, or if any are unpaid an amount in cash equal to that requisite to pay every such person, as shown to be due to them by the books of the bank is set apart and paid over in accordance herewith to the state comptroller as herein provided, the amount, if any, remaining shall be distributed to the stockholders pro rata.

Should written objections be filed to the discharge of the receiver within the time above provided, the chancellor shall set the matter for hearing in vacation or in term time as he may deem proper, and the same shall be proceeded with as any other action in chancery.

    Liquidation of solvent bank.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Any bank found to be solvent may be liquidated, if desired by the bank, in accordance with this section.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is the purpose of this section to require that the claims of all depositors and creditors as reflected by the books of the bank, be paid, whether proven or not, provided they are called for within the period stipulated in this section. The bank shall continue as a corporation until that authorized hereunder to be done has been accomplished whereafter its charter shall be surrendered as provided by law.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the receiver shall have heretofore paid, or shall hereafter pay, or have assets readily convertible for payment to each and every depositor, creditor and claimant of such bank whose claim or claims shall have been filed, whether duly proven and allowed or undisposed of, the principal amount, with additions, if any, shown by the books of the bank to be due by the bank, or if every such unpaid depositor, creditor or claimant for whom no such provision has been made as above, if any there be, consents thereto in writing, and the receiver shall have paid all expenses of the liquidation, all out of the assets of the failed bank, upon petition of a board of directors to be selected by the stockholders of the bank at a special meeting to be held therefor on call of any of the former officers of the bank, and with the consent of all claimants or creditors who have filed claims which have not been finally disposed of or which are disputed, and with the consent of every person, firm or corporation having a lien on the assets of the bank, if any there be, the receiver shall deliver to any such agent or agents of said bank, selected by the board of directors as hereinabove provided, upon a decree therefor made by the chancery court or the chancellor in vacation, all undivided and uncollected or other assets of said bank then remaining in his hands or under his control subject to any liens thereupon. On such delivery, the receiver and the surety on his bond shall be discharged from any and all liability to the bank, its creditors and all other persons, provided that (1) before making such delivery, the receiver shall have turned over to the state comptroller for depositors the principal amount, with additions, if any, shown by the books of the bank to be due by the bank to such depositors, and provided, (2) that the receiver shall file a final report showing all such matters and things as should be embraced in the final report hereinabove required for complete liquidation. Thereupon the chancellor shall by order entered direct that the clerk of the court cause a notice to be run in a newspaper published in the county where the receivership is pending, or if none is so published, in some newspaper having a general circulation therein, which notice shall state that the liquidation of the bank by the receiver is to be terminated and the assets remaining delivered to the bank as herein provided, and that the final report of the receiver has been filed and an application made to transfer the remaining assets in accordance herewith to an agent of the bank, and unless written objection is filed with the clerk within thirty days from the first publication of the notice, all persons shall be forever precluded from filing any claim against the receiver or from questioning any of the acts of the receiver except for fraud, or claims, demands and rights which are to be assumed by the bank and subject to which the transfer is to be made. Said notice shall be published once a week until the expiration of said thirty day period.
     </p>
     <p>
      All unpaid deposits, debts and dividends hereunder paid over to the state comptroller of banks shall be held in trust for the parties rightfully entitled thereto, to whom payment thereof shall be made, less any costs lawfully deductible therefrom. In case the state comptroller shall be in doubt as to the person or amount, he may file in regard thereto a bill of interpleader and thereupon be finally discharged, paying from such amount so deposited in court, the requisite costs for filing such bill.
     </p>
     <p>
      Within one year after receipt of any amount from a receiver, the state comptroller shall give notice of unclaimed amounts by publication in some newspaper having a general circulation in the county where such banking corporation was domiciled, once a week for three consecutive weeks, notifying such unpaid persons to come forward and claim the amounts due, and in said notice stating the amount of money received, the name of the party who is entitled to any portion thereof according to the books of the bank, but without specifying the amount, and shall command said parties to call for such amounts prior to the date fixed for payment to the state treasurer, and stating that unless they shall do so, the amounts will be paid over to the state treasurer in trust on or after a day therein to be named. After the expiration of said time, the state comptroller shall pay over such amounts held by him to the state treasurer, less any publication or other costs incurred in connection therewith and give to the state treasurer a list of all persons entitled to any amount together, if possible, with the amount thereof and the residence, if possible, of such person. Thereupon the state treasurer shall be required to place the amount so paid over to him in a special trust fund in the state treasury for the benefit of any and all persons rightfully entitled thereto, and thereafter when said funds are so paid over, there shall be no further liability on the bank, its receiver, the state comptroller, his bond or any other agent or employee, for any amount so thus paid over to the state treasurer under this section. Persons rightfully entitled to any such amounts so paid over into this trust fund shall be paid the amount thereof direct from such trust fund by the state treasurer without specific appropriation therefor, such payment to be made by the state treasurer upon requisition drawn by the state comptroller on the written approval of the attorney general. The state comptroller and the state treasurer shall have power to pay from such amount on hand the cost of any publication and other expense items properly incurred chargeable thereto, which amounts shall be deducted from the amount to be paid over. The state comptroller or the state treasurer may apply the interest earned by the money so held by either of them, if any, towards defraying the expenses of the payment and the distribution to the persons entitled.
     </p>
     <p>
      After the expiration of fifteen (15) years from the date of the receipt of such amount by the state treasurer, the deposits and amounts then unclaimed shall be placed by the state treasurer in the general fund of the State of Mississippi, and such fund shall belong to the State of Mississippi, free from the claims of all persons whatsoever.
     </p>
     <p>
      The delivery of such assets to such agent of said bank, selected as aforesaid, and the discharge of such receiver shall not release, discharge or affect any right, claim or action which any creditor or claimant consenting to such transfer and discharge might then or thereafter have against said bank, or the stockholders of the bank on account of their double liability, if any, if the assets of the bank are insufficient to pay said creditors’ or claimants’ claims in full, with interest, if any is due; it being the intention hereof that the liability of the bank and its stockholders, if any, shall not be affected or released by the discharge of the receiver. The court having jurisdiction of the receivership shall retain jurisdiction over any suit, petition or proceeding brought pursuant hereto, and especially involving a contested claim for depositor or creditor, and such suit, or suits, may be as fully and completely determined and adjudicated by said court as if had under the receivership.
     </p>
     <p>
      Such agent or agents under the direction of the board of directors of said bank shall convert the assets coming into his or their possession into cash, if so directed, and after paying all taxes and any and all unpaid claims, lawfully established, and the expenses of said liquidation, shall distribute the assets in cash or kind pro rata among the stockholders of the bank in proportion to the stock held by each and every stockholder. Such bank may from time to time hold meetings of its stockholders in accordance with its by-laws for the election of boards of directors and such other corporate business as may properly come before the meeting looking towards its liquidation, and such directors may, from time to time, replace such agent or agents in charge of such liquidation, paying such agent or agents such compensation as they may determine. All expenses of such liquidation by such agent or agents shall be subject to approval by the board of directors of the bank.
     </p>
     <p>
      Prior to or contemporaneously with the delivery of said assets to the agent or agents of said bank, it shall be a condition thereto that all persons having a direct lien on the assets of the trust and also all persons having an undisposed of disputed claim, if any there be, pending in the receivership, be required to give their consent in writing to the release of the assets in the hands of the receiver to the bank. When the court is satisfied of compliance with all requirements hereinbefore contained, a decree shall be entered which shall have the effect (1) to discharge the receiver and his surety from all liability to all persons; (2) to revest title to all assets withheld by the receiver in the old banking corporation and to vest such corporation with full authority to receive and deal with such property for purposes only of effective liquidation.

    Procedure to obtain depositors’ liquidation.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Proceedings to accomplish depositor liquidation of banks shall be begun by the filing of a petition in the chancery court of the county in which such bank shall be domiciled within the ninety day period in which the state comptroller remains in charge of the closed bank. Each petition shall be signed by depositors owning sixty percent in amount of deposits not preferred and totally unsecured, and the allegations thereof shall be sworn to by at least one of the signers of the petition, either as true and correct upon personal knowledge, or upon information and belief. If any signer be a corporation the signature thereof by the president or vice-president shall be sufficient, and the signature of any partnership or similar firm by any member thereof shall be sufficient. The state comptroller shall be the only necessary party respondent to such petition. The petition may be heard by the chancellor in vacation or in term time, at such place in his district as he may direct, upon certificate of the chancery clerk that he has sent, at least five days before such hearing, by registered mail, to the respondent at the city of Jackson, Mississippi, a true copy of the petition, with time and place of hearing designated thereon. The cause in which such petition shall be filed shall be entitled “In the matter of the depositor liquidation of (name of bank proposed to be liquidated) by (naming here the liquidating corporation proposed to be formed).”

      Each director shall make bond, conditioned to perform faithfully his duties as director, payable to the corporation, with such surety or sureties as the chancellor may approve, and in such sum as the chancellor may, from time to time, direct, but in no case less than $2,000.00 for any one director. Such bonds shall serve generally the same purposes and be of the same general effect as a receiver’s bond, and action upon such bonds may be brought by any party aggrieved. No action shall lie, however, against any director or upon any director’s bond because of the exercise of any power recited in Section 81-9-61, excepting only instances of actual abuse of discretion.

     <p>
      No director shall be entitled to compensation as such, but the chancellor, may, in his discretion, allow conservative compensation on a salary basis for designated period of time, in instances where an unreasonable amount of any director’s time shall be required for the faithful performance of his duties.

Such report shall include the gross amount of collections and the total amount of all disbursements to common creditors, depositors, or other claimants, and the amount of all dividends on hand belonging to common creditors, stockholders, or others, which for any reason have not been distributed and they shall also file as part of such report the following books and records of said corporation, to wit: The journal and the general ledger kept by the corporation and the minute book of the corporation and also the ledger showing the amount due each depositor and other creditors at the time the corporation was created and upon which dividends were paid, or such other books, set of books, or records used by or that were set up by said corporation which reveal the above enumerated facts, and if available the audit of the department of bank supervision showing all assets and liabilities of the bank in liquidation.

       The directors shall file a petition for their discharge and a dissolution of the corporation with their report, and the final report together with said petition shall remain on file subject to the inspection of any person interested for the time and in the manner hereinafter provided. Upon the filing of said petition and report in the chancery clerk’s office in the county in which the corporation is domiciled, the clerk shall immediately notify the chancellor by registered mail of the filing of said petition and report whereupon the chancellor by order entered upon the minutes of the court shall direct the clerk of the court to have a notice published in some newspaper in the county wherein the corporation is domiciled, or if none is so published, then in some newspaper having a general circulation therein, which notice shall state that the liquidation of the bank has been completed and that the final report of the directors and petition for their discharge and dissolution of the corporation are on file; that unless written objection is filed with the clerk of the court within forty-five (45) days from the date of the first publication of the notice, all persons shall be forever precluded from filing any claim against the bank, corporation, or the directors and officers, and from questioning any of the acts of the directors or officers except for fraud. Said notice shall be published once a week for four successive weeks.

The notice shall direct that said parties call for said dividends prior to the day set for the filing of written objections, otherwise their claim thereto shall be forfeited. On the day of the final hearing if there are dividends on hand which have not been called for, the directors shall not be discharged, or the corporation dissolved, but the chancellor by order entered on the minutes of the court shall direct the directors to make distribution of such unclaimed dividends to the known depositors and creditors pro rata; provided, that in the event the known depositors and creditors have already been paid in full, such unclaimed dividends shall be distributed to the stockholders pro rata.

If there are dividends on hand, the chancellor shall direct their distribution as above provided. Should written objections be filed to the discharge of the directors and the dissolution of the corporation within the time above provided, the chancellor shall set the matter for hearing in vacation or term time as he may deem proper, and the same shall be proceeded with as any other action in chancery. In no event shall anyone be permitted to file objections after the time specified in the notice above provided for.

       Should there be any dividends not called for at the expiration of forty-five (45) days from the date the chancellor orders the distribution as provided in subsection (3) hereof, the directors shall pay the same to the state comptroller who shall hold the same for parties entitled thereto for a period of one year from the date of the order of the chancellor directing the distribution. If said funds are not called for before the expiration of said period, the owners shall lose all right thereto, and the state comptroller shall pay the same, or so much thereof as remains in his hands, into the state treasury. Upon the directors making the distribution provided for in subsection (3) hereof, either by paying said funds to the parties entitled thereto, or by paying the same or a part thereof to the state comptroller, they shall report such fact to the chancellor, who shall enter his decree granting the discharge of the directors and the dissolution of the corporation, and the court or chancellor in vacation, shall have the power and authority during the course of proceedings under this section to make all such orders as he may deem right and proper to fully carry out the purposes of this section.

      <p>
       In granting or denying the right to establish a savings and loan association or a branch office, the board exercises a licensing power which is essentially a legislative function, so that the scope of judicial review in such cases is to determine whether the order granting or denying the license is supported by substantial evidence, is arbitrary or capricious, is beyond the board’s power, or violates some constitutional or statutory right of an interested party. Bankers Trust Sav. & Loan Asso. v. Bank of Winona, 243 So. 2d 415, 1971 Miss. LEXIS 1513 (Miss. 1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       A state chartered savings and loan association, by substantial compliance with the provisions of the former Code 1942, § 5310, obtained a charter amendment, which became effective prior to the effective date of Code 1942, §§ 5288-01 et seq., authorizing it to move its principal office or place of business from North Mississippi Sav. & Loan Asso. v. Confederate States Sav. & Loan Asso., 250 Miss. 463, 166 So. 2d 119, 1964 Miss. LEXIS 475 (Miss. 1964).
      </p>
      <p>
       The right given to a state chartered savings and loan association by Code 1942, § 5319, prior to the 1962 amendment, to choose or elect to maintain an office in the county of its domicil was one which the Board of Savings and Loan Associations could not impair or modify in a proceeding to prevent the savings and loan association from changing the location of its home office from one city to another within the state. North Mississippi Sav. & Loan Asso. v. Confederate States Sav. & Loan Asso., 250 Miss. 463, 166 So. 2d 119, 1964 Miss. LEXIS 475 (Miss. 1964).
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the rights vested in a state chartered savings and loan association by virtue of its charter amendment, changing its domicil from Columbus to Oxford, including the right to establish and maintain an office in Oxford, were rights created prior to the effective date of Code 1942, §§ 5288-01 et seq., the Board of Savings and Loan Associations could not precipitately annul or modify such rights in view of Code 1942, §
   North Mississippi Sav. & Loan Asso. v. Confederate States Sav. & Loan Asso., 250 Miss. 463, 166 So. 2d 119, 1964 Miss. LEXIS 475 (Miss. 1964).
      </p>
      <p>
       A savings and loan association seeking to prevent another savings and loan association from changing its home office from one city to another within the state could not, in that proceeding, attack the validity or legality of the stockholders’ meeting at which the charter amendment, authorizing the other savings and loan association to make the change of location, was approved by its stockholders. North Mississippi Sav. & Loan Asso. v. Confederate States Sav. & Loan Asso., 250 Miss. 463, 166 So. 2d 119, 1964 Miss. LEXIS 475 (Miss. 1964).

      <li id="t81c12s81-12-24ol11">
       If, in the commissioner’s opinion, after an examination, audit, or investigation, it is determined that any director or officer or any employee or controlling stockholder of any association has knowingly participated in or consented to any violation of this chapter, or any other law, rule, regulation or order, or any repeated violation of or failure to comply with any association’s bylaws, and that as a result, a situation exists requiring immediate corrective action, the commissioner shall give notice to the board of directors of the association setting forth the violations and the remedies for same. Failure of the board of directors to comply with the requirements of the commissioner within ten (10) days from the date of the notice shall render the board of directors in default thereupon. Upon the expiration of such ten (10) days and upon continuation of such noncompliance and default, the commissioner may issue an order temporarily removing such person or persons cited for improper conduct as above described pending a hearing before the commissioner. In regard to a controlling stockholder, the commissioner may order the stockholder to place all his voting stock in a voting trust, the trustee of the voting trust to be designated by the commissioner. Any temporary order of removal shall state its duration on its face and the words “Temporary Order of Removal” and shall be effective upon issuance for a period of thirty (30) days and may be extended once upon written notice by the commissioner for an additional period of fifteen (15) days. A hearing upon such “Temporary Order of Removal” shall be held by the commissioner within the thirty-day period, or any extension thereof, upon not less than fifteen (15) days’ notice to the removed person or persons by certified United States mail, restricted delivery, at which hearing the commissioner may dissolve the temporary order or make the same permanent. No removed person or persons shall receive any salary, compensation or remuneration from the association as an officer or director after the order is made permanent. Any temporary order of removal by the commissioner shall not be subject to judicial review in any form. Any final order of the commissioner may be appealed as provided in Section 81-12-205.
      </li>
      <li id="t81c12s81-12-24ol12">
       Any removal pursuant to subsection (1) of this section shall be effective in all respects as if such removal had been made by the board of directors or the shareholders of the association in question.
      </li>
      <li id="t81c12s81-12-24ol13">
       Without the prior written approval of the commissioner, no director or officer removed pursuant to this section shall be eligible to be elected or reelected to any position as an officer or director of that association nor shall such an officer or director be eligible to be elected to or retain a position as an officer or director of any other association or financial institution.

       The commissioner may appoint a director or officer to fill any vacancy caused by a removal pursuant to this section, but such appointed director or officer, should such removal be permanent, shall be appointed only to serve the balance of the term of the vacant position. The commissioner may waive the requirements of Section 81-12-83(3) of a director appointed under the provisions of this section. Such director shall be eligible to be elected by the shareholders thereafter. Such officer shall be eligible to be elected by the board of directors of an association.

      The board, at its meeting, shall consider the findings and recommendation of the commissioner and shall hear such oral testimony as he may wish to give or be called upon to give, and shall also receive information and hear testimony from the prospective incorporators of the proposed association and from any and all other interested persons bearing upon the approval of the petition and the operation of the new association. All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by any of the parties who are incorporators or objectors or by the board. After considering the findings, and recommendation submitted to it by the commissioner and his oral testimony, if any, and considering such other information and evidence, either written or oral, which has come before it, the board shall decide if it has before it sufficient information and evidence upon which it can dispose of the petition for a certificate of incorporation to form an association. If it is determined that evidence and information is not sufficient, then the board shall order the commissioner to secure such additional information and evidence as it may prescribe or shall request such from the prospective incorporators and from other interested persons. The board shall thereupon set a date for a future meeting to be held in not less than forty-five (45) nor more than sixty (60) days and shall give to the prospective incorporators, financial institutions and other interested persons the same notice of such meeting prescribed above and shall recess the meeting then being held until such future date. The board shall have and is hereby vested with the power to compel attendance of witnesses, just as is the commissioner, and all testimony given before said board shall be taken down and may be transcribed by a reporter at the request of any interested party. If the board, or a majority thereof, shall determine that it has before it sufficient evidence and information upon which to base a decision, then it shall render a written opinion and decision in the matter within sixty (60) days of the last meeting. If its decision is favorable, then the board shall issue a certificate of approval of incorporation of the association.

     <p>
      A capital stock association shall be organized in accordance with this section. The incorporators shall appoint one (1) of their number as chairman of the incorporators. The capital of a capital stock association shall be the sum of the par value of all shares of voting capital stock. The minimum required capital shall be: (a) in municipalities having not more than twenty-five thousand (25,000) inhabitants, the minimum sum of Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000.00); (b) in municipalities having more than twenty-five thousand (25,000), but not more than one hundred thousand (100,000) inhabitants, the minimum sum of One Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00); (c) in municipalities having more than one hundred thousand (100,000) inhabitants, the minimum sum of One Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($1,500,000.00). The population of the municipality shall be determined by the commissioner based upon the latest federal census. No commissions, fees or other remuneration shall be paid for the sale of shares of capital stock necessary to meet the minimum capital and paid-in surplus requirements of this section. No incentive stock shall be issued. All stock shall be sold at not less than par value.
     </p>
     <p>
      In addition to the minimum capital required above, the subscribers shall pay an additional amount equal to not less than twenty-five percent (25%) of the par value of the stock subscribed, which shall be credited to paid-in surplus and may be used to offset losses from operations. Such minimum capital and surplus may be used for the reserves required by law as may be permitted by the board.
     </p>
     <p>
      After organization or conversion, each capital stock association shall maintain an adequate net worth appropriate for the conduct of its business and the protection of its savings account holders. The net worth adequacy of a capital stock association shall be determined by the commissioner on a regular basis but not less than one (1) time per year after evaluating the character of management, the liquidity or quality of assets, history of earnings and the retention thereof, the potential volatility of the deposit structure, and the association’s capacity to furnish the broadest service to the public. A written report of such finding and determination shall be made and filed. Such report shall include actions recommended to be taken. A copy of such report shall be sent to each member of the board and considered by the board at its next meeting.

     </p>
     <p>
      To become a member of, deal with or make reasonable payments or contributions to any organization to the extent that such organization assists in furthering or facilitating the association’s purposes, powers or community responsibilities, and to comply with any reasonable conditions of eligibility;

    Additional powers of capital stock associations.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      A capital stock savings and loan association (hereinafter referred to as a “capital stock association”) shall have the powers enumerated in the preceding section, and shall have the following additional powers:
     </p>
     <p>
      Capital stock may be issued as follows:
     </p>
     <p>
      A capital stock association may issue the shares of stock authorized by its articles of incorporation and none other. Capital stock shall have the par value as stated in the articles of incorporation and, with the prior approval of the commissioner, may consist of common stock and preferred stock, which may be divided into classes and classes into series. Each kind, class and series may have such distinguishing characteristics, including designations, preferences, or restrictions as regards dividends, redemption, voting powers or restrictions or qualifications of voting powers as are imposed in the articles of incorporation. Restrictions and qualifications of voting powers so imposed shall control in any case in which any vote or consent of stockholders is now or hereafter required by statute unless such statute shall expressly provide a voting procedure to the contrary.
     </p>
     <p>
      With the prior approval of the commissioner, shares of preferred or special stock of any class may be divided by number from time to time into, and issued in, designated series. Such shares of preferred or special stock of any class or series thereof shall have such relative rights and preferences with regard to dividend rates, redemption rights, conversion privileges, voting powers and other distinguishing characteristics, as shall be stated and expressed with respect to such class or series, either in the articles of incorporation or in the resolution or resolutions providing for the issue of such stock adopted by the board of directors of the corporation.
     </p>
     <p>
      Except for stock issued pursuant to a plan of merger, consolidation or conversion from a mutual to a stock association or other type of reorganization which has been approved as provided herein, the consideration for the issuance of voting capital stock, the par value of which shall be maintained as the permanent capital of the association, except as otherwise provided in subparagraph (a)(iv) of this section, shall be paid in cash, and any excess shall be credited to paid-in surplus which shall not be available for dividends or other distribution to stockholders, except upon liquidation.
     </p>
     <p>
      Except as provided herein, the total of the par values of all outstanding shares of voting capital stock shall be the permanent capital of the association and shall not be retired until final liquidation of the association. Notwithstanding the foregoing limitation, a capital stock association may reduce its permanent capital through a reduction of its outstanding voting capital stock pursuant to a plan adopted by its board of directors, and approved by an affirmative vote of a majority of the shares eligible to vote, and by an affirmative vote of two-thirds (2/3) of those shares present and voting, in person or by proxy, at an annual or special meeting of the stockholders of the association. In the event approval of any such plan for the reduction of stock as herein provided shall result in fractional shares, the association may acquire such fractional shares of its own stock by tender of payment of the price per share prior to such reduction as stipulated in the plan. Such tender may be made by bank check drawn upon association funds payable to the record holders of such fractional shares and mailed United States postage prepaid to such holders at the last address of record with the association. Pursuant to such plan, a capital stock association may purchase or redeem whole shares of its own stock at the price per share stipulated in the plan upon written assent of the holders thereof prior to such reduction. No plan for the reduction of the permanent capital or outstanding voting capital stock of an association shall be effective without first obtaining the written consent of the commissioner.
     </p>
     <p>
      Unless otherwise provided by the articles of incorporation, every stockholder, upon the sale for cash of any new stock of the same kind, class or series as that which he already holds, shall have the right to purchase his pro rata share thereof, as nearly as may be done without issuance of fractional shares, at the price at which it is offered to others, which price must be in excess of par.
     </p>
     <p>
      An association shall not make a loan secured by the pledge of its capital stock.
     </p>
     <p>
      A capital stock association may sell any authorized but unissued shares of capital stock for cash at a price which must be in excess of par. No incentive stock shall be issued. Subject to the requirements of Section 81-12-51(a)(v), an association may employ an agent to sell those shares of authorized capital stock not necessary to meet the minimum capital and paid-in surplus requirements of Section 81-12-37, provided that the proposed agreement with the agent for the sale of such stock is approved by the commissioner before the association enters into such agreement.
     </p>
     <p>
      No capital stock savings and loan association shall declare or pay any dividend upon its common stock unless such association has received written approval by the Commissioner of Banking and Consumer Finance. Directors declaring a dividend in violation of the provisions of this section shall be personally liable to the full amount of the dividend so declared and it shall be the duty of the commissioner, upon discovering the payment of any such dividend, to forthwith make demand upon the directors that the same be restored to the association, and upon their failure so to do he shall cause suit to be brought against them in the chancery court of the county in which the association is located, either in his name or in the name of the association, to recover the same for the benefit of the association.

       § 81-12-53.
    Conversion of association organized under state law into federal association.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      At an annual meeting or at any special meeting of the members called to consider such action, any mutual association as defined in this chapter may convert itself into a federal mutual savings association or federal mutual savings and loan association, hereinafter in this subsection called “federal association,” in accordance with the provisions of the laws of the United States, as now or hereafter amended, upon an affirmative vote of fifty-one percent (51%) or more of the total number of votes of the members eligible to be cast. A copy of the minutes of the proceedings of such meeting of the members, verified by the affidavit of the secretary or an assistant secretary, shall be filed in the office of the commissioner within ten (10) days after the date of such meeting. A sworn copy of the proceedings of such meeting, when so filed, shall be presumptive evidence of the holding and action of such meeting. Any member challenging the accuracy of such minutes by sworn objection may appeal to the commissioner. Within three (3) months after the date of such meeting, the association shall take such action in the manner prescribed and authorized by the laws of the United States as shall make it a federal association. There shall be filed with the commissioner a copy of the charter issued to such federal association by the appropriate federal regulatory authority or a certificate showing the organization of such association as a federal association, certified by the secretary or assistant secretary of the appropriate federal regulatory authority. A similar copy of the charter, or of such certificate, shall be filed by the association with the Secretary of State. No failure to file any such instruments with either the commissioner or the Secretary of State shall affect the validity of such conversion. Upon the grant to any association of a charter by the appropriate federal regulatory authority, the association receiving such charter shall cease to b e an association incorporated under this chapter and shall no longer be subject to the supervision and control of the commissioner. Upon the conversion of any association into a federal association, the corporate existence of such association shall not terminate, but such federal association shall be deemed to be a continuation of the entity of the association so converted and all property of the converted association, including its rights, titles and interests in and to all property of whatever kind, whether real, personal or mixed, and things in action, and every right, privilege, interest and asset then existing, or pertaining to it, or which may inure to it, shall immediately by operation of law and without any conveyance or transfer and without any further act or deed remain and be vested in and continue and be the property of such federal association into which the association has converted itself, and such federal association shall have, hold and enjoy the same in its own right as fully and to the same extent as the same was possessed, held and enjoyed by the converting association, and such federal association, as of the time of the taking effect of such conversion, shall continue to have and succeed to all the rights, obligations and relations of the converting association. All pending actions and other judicial proceedings to which the converting association is a party shall not be deemed to have abated or to have discontinued by reason of such conversion, but may be prosecuted to final judgment, order or decree in the same manner as if such conversion into such federal association had not been made and such federal association resulting from such conversion may continue such action in its corporate name as a federal association, and any judgment, order or decree may be rendered for or against it which might have been rendered for or against the converting association theretofore involved in such judicial proceedings. Any association or corporation which has heretofore converted itself into a federal association under the provisions of the laws of the United States and has received a charter from the appropriate federal regulatory authority shall hereafter be recognized as a federal association, and its federal charter shall be given full recognition by the courts of this state to the same extent as if such conversion had taken place under the provisions of this section; however, there shall have been compliance with the foregoing requirements with respect to the filing with the commissioner of a copy of the federal charter or a certificate showing the organization of such association as a federal association.

     <p>
      At an annual meeting or at any special meeting of the members or stockholders called to consider such action, any federal mutual or capital stock savings association or federal mutual or capital stock savings and loan association, hereinafter in this subsection called “federal association,” may apply for conversion into a state-chartered association under this chapter upon an affirmative vote of fifty-one percent (51%) or more of the total number of votes of the members eligible to be cast or an affirmative vote of sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66-2/3%) or more of all the issued and outstanding stock of such federal association. Upon such affirmative vote, the federal association may apply for a certificate of authority by filing with the commissioner a certificate signed by its president or secretary which sets forth the corporate action herein prescribed and asserts that the institution has complied with the provisions of the laws of the United States. The federal association shall also file with the commissioner the plan of conversion and the proposed amendments to its articles of association as approved by the members or stockholders for the operation of the association as a state-chartered association. Upon receipt of such application, the commissioner shall examine all facts associated with the conversion. The expenses and costs incurred for such special examination shall be paid by the institution applying for permission to convert. The commissioner shall present his findings and recommendations to the State Board of Banking Review for consideration. Upon approval by the State Board of Banking Review, the commissioner shall issue a certificate of authority to the applicant allowing the conversion to proceed.

     <p>
      If the board of directors determines, and the commissioner concurs, that substantial business benefit to the association will or may result, and if federal law, regulations or administrative rulings authorize federal associations to convert to capital stock associations, the voting members of a mutual association organized pursuant to this chapter, or otherwise subject to the provisions of this chapter or a federal mutual savings or savings and loan association (hereinafter in this subsection referred to as a “federal association”) located in this state may vote to convert the association into a total or partial capital stock association by adopting a plan of conversion which is approved by the commissioner.
     </p>
     <p>
      The plan of conversion must be approved at a meeting of voting members called to consider such action by an affirmative vote of fifty-one percent (51%) or more of the total number of votes eligible to be cast. The commissioner may approve or disapprove the plan of conversion in his discretion, but he shall not approve the plan unless he finds that the plan is fair and equitable to members of the association and that the interests of the savings account holders and the public are adequately protected. Notice of the meeting, giving the time, place and purpose thereof, together with a proxy statement and proxy form approved by the commissioner, covering all matters to be brought before the meeting, shall be mailed at least thirty (30) days prior thereto to the commissioner and to each voting member at his last address as shown on the books of the association. The notice shall advise the savings account holders of their right to the public hearing provided in Section 81- 12-59.
     </p>
     <p>
      Copies of the minutes of the meeting of members, verified by the affidavit of the secretary or assistant secretary of the association, shall be filed in the office of the department and with the appropriate federal regulatory authority within a reasonable time after the meeting. When so filed, the verified copies of the minutes are presumptive evidence of the holding of the meeting and of the action taken. Any member or stockholder challenging the accuracy of such minutes by sworn objection may appeal to the commissioner.
     </p>
     <p>
      The directors of the association shall execute and file with the supervisory authority proposed articles of incorporation as provided for in Section 81-12-25, together with an application for conversion and a firm commitment for, or evidence of, insurance of deposits and other accounts of a withdrawable type. The articles shall contain a statement that the corporation resulted from the conversion of a mutual or federal association to a capital stock association. If approved by the commissioner, he shall affix the same to the articles of incorporation. An authenticated copy of the articles of incorporation shall be filed with the Secretary of State and one (1) copy of the articles of incorporation and the certificate of incorporation shall be returned to the association. The association shall cease to be a mutual association at the time and on the date specified in the approved articles of incorporation.
     </p>
     <p>
      All the provisions regarding property and other rights contained in Section 81-12-53 shall apply to the conversion of a mutual or federal association to a capital stock association, so that the capital stock association shall be a continuation of the corporate entity of the mutual or federal association and continue to have all of its property and rights.

      <li id="t81c12s81-12-61ol11">
       A capital stock association organized under this chapter may vote to convert itself into a federal mutual or capital stock savings or savings and loan association, hereinafter in this subsection referred to as a “federal association,” at any legal meeting called to consider the action. The required affirmative vote to effect the conversion shall be not less than sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66-2/3%) of the issued and outstanding stock of such association. Notice of the meeting giving the time, place and purpose thereof, together with a proxy statement and proxy form covering all matters properly brought before the meeting shall be mailed at least thirty (30) days prior thereto to the commissioner and the appropriate federal regulatory authority and to each stockholder at his last address as shown on the books of the association. A copy of the minutes of the proceedings of the meeting, verified by the affidavit of the secretary or an assistant secretary of the association, shall be filed in the office of the commissioner within ten (10) days after the date of the meeting. When filed, a verified copy of the proceedings of the meeting is presumptive evidence of the holding of the meeting and of the action taken. Any stockholder challenging the accuracy of such minutes by sworn objection may appeal to the commissioner. Within three (3) months after the date of the meeting, the association shall take such further action, in the manner prescribed and authorized by the laws of the United States, as shall make it a federal association. Three (3) copies of the charter issued by the appropriate federal regulatory authority, or three (3) copies of a certificate showing the organization of the association as a federal association, certified by the secretary or an assistant secretary of the appropriate federal regulatory authority shall be filed with the commissioner. Upon the payment of the fees prescribed by law, the commissioner shall note the filing upon each of the copies and shall retain one (1) copy in his office, file one (1) copy with the Secretary of State, and return one (1) copy to the association. The failure to file the instruments with the commissioner shall not affect the validity of the conversion. Upon the grant to any association of a charter by the appropriate federal regulatory authority, the association shall cease to be an association incorporated under this chapter and shall no longer be subject to the supervision and control of the department. All provisions regarding property and other rights contained in Section 81-12-53 above apply to the conversion of a capital stock association into a federal association.

Upon completion of liquidation, the board of directors shall file with the commissioner a final report and accounting of such liquidation and shall surrender the charter of the association. If such report is approved, the commissioner shall promptly cancel said charter. The approval of such report by the commissioner shall operate as a discharge of the board of directors and each member thereof in connection with the liquidation of such association. No such dissolution or any action of the board of directors in connection therewith shall impair any contract right between such association and any borrower or other person or persons or the vested rights of any member or savings account holder of such association.

       § 81-12-87.
    Fiduciary relationship of directors and officers; disclosure of personal interests; restrictions governing conduct; penalty.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Directors and officers occupy a fiduciary relationship to the association of which they are directors or officers, and no director or officer shall engage or participate, directly or indirectly, in any business or transaction conducted on behalf of or involving the association, which would result in a conflict of his own personal interests with those of the association which he serves. Without limitation by any of the specific provisions of any of the subsections hereof, the commissioner may require the disclosure by directors, officers and employees of any personal interest, directly or indirectly, in any business or transactions on behalf of or involving the association and of their control of or active participation in enterprises having activities related to the business of the association. The following restrictions governing the conduct of directors and officers expressly are specified, but such specification is not to be construed in any manner as excusing such persons from the observance of any other aspect of the general fiduciary duty owed by them to the association which they serve:
     </p>
     <p>
      From and after January 1, 1979, no officer or director of an association shall hold office as a director or officer of another thrift institution the principal office of which is located in the association’s primary lending area.
     </p>
     <p>
      No director of an association shall receive remuneration as director except reasonable fees for service as a director or for service as a member of a committee of directors, except that nothing herein contained shall be deemed to prohibit or in any way to limit any right of a director who is also an officer or employee of or attorney for the association to receive compensation for service as an officer, employee or attorney.
     </p>
     <p>
      Loans aggregating fifteen percent (15%) of the unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus may be made by any association to any director or executive officer thereof, as defined in Regulation O promulgated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, less existing direct and indirect liabilities thereto, upon affirmative approval of a majority of all directors spread on the minutes of a directors’ meeting held before such loan is made, provided, such loan is made on substantially the same terms and conditions extended to other borrowers for comparable transactions. Any association may lend to any such director or executive officer thereof, upon affirmative approval of a majority of all directors spread on the minutes of a directors’ meeting held before such loan is made, not more than twenty percent (20%) of the unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus of the association, less the amount of existing direct and indirect liabilities, when secured; or when the portion thereof in excess of any amount loaned under the first provision hereof is secured by obligations of the United States government, the State of Mississippi, and the levee districts, counties, road districts, school districts, and municipalities of the State of Mississippi, obligations of any other state of the United States and other bonds of recognized character and standing, which are the subject of daily newspaper market quotations, provided such loan shall not exceed eighty percent (80%) of the market or par value (whichever is less) of the bonds or obligations offered as security. Any association may lend to any executive officer or director thereof upon affirmative approval of a majority of all directors spread on the minutes of a directors’ meeting held before such loan is made, such amount as is safe and proper, when secured by warehouse receipts or shippers’ order bills of lading representing actual existing values, provided the amount loaned shall not exceed eighty percent (80%) of the market value of the commodities representing the actual existing values, and loans of this nature shall be made payable on demand so that the security held therefor may be sold on any date and the proceeds thereof applied to the payment of the loan. However, an association’s board of directors may, as shown in its minutes, give to an association officer the authority to make secured or unsecured loans to an executive officer or director of such association, without receiving the board’s prior approval, in an amount that, when aggregated with the amount of all other extensions of credit to that person and to all related interests of that person, does not exceed the greater of Twenty-five Thousand Dollars ($25,000.00) or five percent (5%) of the association’s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus.
     </p>
     <p>
      Loans and discounts by an association to a director or executive officer thereof secured in full by funds on deposit in time or savings accounts with the lending association to the credit of the borrower shall not be restricted to the fifteen percent (15%) or twenty percent (20%) limitations herein prescribed.
     </p>
     <p>
      The limitations of this section shall not apply where an executive officer or director shall bona fide purchase from the association at a reasonable price real or personal property acquired by the association in payment of debts due the association, provided such transactions are approved by a majority of the board of directors, such approval to be shown in their minutes; and, in cases where loans are made by branch offices, the sum total of loans made by any branch or branches and its parent association to such executive officer or director shall be computed as against the total capital stock and surplus of the parent association and its branch or branches. Loans heretofore made to executive officers or directors may be renewed or extended if in accord with sound banking practice.
     </p>
     <p>
      However, no association shall extend credit to any director or executive officer thereof, in an amount that, when aggregated with all other extensions of credit to that person and to all related interests of that person, exceeds Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000.00) without documented prior affirmative approval of a majority of its directors.
     </p>
     <p>
      No director or officer shall have any interest, directly or indirectly, in the proceeds of a loan or investment or of a purchase or sale made by the association, unless such loan, investment, purchase or sale is authorized expressly by resolution of the board of directors, and unless such resolution is approved by vote of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the directors authorized by the association, any interested director taking no part in such vote.
     </p>
     <p>
      No director or officer shall have any interest, directly or indirectly, in the purchase at less than its face value of any evidence of a savings account, deposit or other indebtedness issued by the association.
     </p>
     <p>
      No director, association or officer thereof shall require, as a condition to the granting of any loan or the extension of any other service by the association, that the borrower or any other person undertake a contract of insurance or any other agreement, or understanding with respect to the furnishing of any other goods or services, with any specific company, agency or individual.
     </p>
     <p>
      No officer or director acting as proxy for a member or stockholder of record of an association shall exercise, transfer or delegate such vote or votes in any consideration of a private benefit or advantage, direct or indirect, accruing to himself, nor shall he surrender control or pass his office to any other for any consideration of a private benefit or advantage, direct or indirect. The voting rights of members, stockholders and directors shall not be subject to sale, barter, exchange or similar transaction, either directly or indirectly. Any officer or director who violates the provisions of this section shall be held accountable to the association for any increment and subject to the criminal penalty below.
     </p>
     <p>
      No director or officer shall solicit, accept or agree to accept, directly or indirectly, from any person other than the association any gratuity, compensation or other personal benefit for any action taken by the association or for endeavoring to procure any such action.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any violation of the provisions of this section shall be punishable by not more than five (5) years’ imprisonment or a fine of not more than Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000.00).

Any such fiduciary shall have power to vote as a member as if any membership account were held absolutely, to make payments upon, and to withdraw any such account, in whole or in part. The withdrawal value of any such account, or other rights relating thereto may be paid or delivered, in whole or in part, to such fiduciary, without regard to any notice to the contrary, as long as such fiduciary is living. The payment or delivery to any such fiduciary or a receipt of acquittance signed by any such fiduciary to whom any such payment or any such delivery of rights is made shall be valid and sufficient release and discharge of any association for the payment or delivery so made. Whenever a person holding an account in a fiduciary capacity dies and no written notice of the revocation or termination of t he trust relationship shall have been given to an association and the association has no notice of any other disposition of the trust estate, the withdrawal value of such account, or other rights relating thereto may, at the option of an association, be paid or delivered, in whole or in part, to the beneficiary or beneficiaries of such trust. Whenever an account shall be opened by any person describing himself in opening such account as trustee for another and there is no other or further notice of the existence and terms of a legal and valid trust, then such description shall be given in writing to such association. In the event of the death of the person so described as trustee, the withdrawal value of such account or any part thereof may be paid to the person for whom the account was thus stated to have been opened, and such account and all additions thereto shall be the property of such person, unless prior to payment the trust agreement is presented to the association showing a contrary interest. When made in accord with this section, the payment or delivery to any such beneficiary, beneficiaries or designated person, or a receipt or acquittance signed by any such beneficiary, beneficiaries or designated person for any such payment or delivery shall be valid and sufficient release and discharge of an association for the payment or delivery so made. Trust accounts permitted by this chapter shall not be required to be acknowledged and recorded. When an account is opened in a form described in this section, the right set forth in Section 81-12-145 shall apply. No association paying any beneficiary in accordance with the provisions of this section shall thereby be liable for any estate, inheritance or succession taxes which may be due this state.

Upon payment or delivery to such representative after receipt of the affidavit and authenticated copies, the association is released and discharged to the same extent as if the payment or delivery had been made to a legally qualified resident executor or administrator, and is not required to see to the application or disposition of the property.

       § 81-12-145.
    Accounts payable at death.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      [Effective from and after January 1, 2020, this section will read as follows:]
     </p>
     <p>
      Accounts payable at death may be established under the following conditions:
     </p>
     <p>
      An account in an association may be opened by any person or persons with directions to make such an account payable on the death of the person or persons opening such an account to the named beneficiary or beneficiaries. When an account is so opened, the association shall pay any monies to the credit of the account from time to time to, or pursuant to the order of the person or persons opening such an account during his or their lifetime in the same manner as if the account were in the sole name or names of such person or persons.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the named beneficiary or one (1) of the beneficiaries so named survive the death of the person opening such an account and the beneficiary or all of the beneficiaries so named are sixteen (16) years of age or over at the death of the person opening such an account, the association shall pay the monies to the credit of the account, less all proper setoffs and charges, to the named beneficiary or beneficiaries or upon his or their order, as hereinafter provided, and such payment by the association shall be valid, notwithstanding any lack of legal age of the named beneficiary or beneficiaries; provided, however, where such an account is opened or subsequently held by more than one (1) person, the death of one (1) of such persons shall not terminate the account and the account shall continue as to the surviving person or persons and the named beneficiary or beneficiaries subject to the provisions of subsections (c) through (i) of this section.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the named beneficiary or all of the beneficiaries so named survive the death of the person or persons opening such an account and are under sixteen (16) years of age at such time, the association shall pay the monies to the credit of the account, less all proper setoffs and charges:
     </p>
     <p>
      When or after the named beneficiary becomes sixteen (16) years of age, to the named beneficiary or upon his order; or
     </p>
     <p>
      When more than one (1) beneficiary is named, the association shall pay to each beneficiary so named his proportionate interest in such account as each severally becomes sixteen (16) years of age; or
     </p>
     <p>
      To the legal guardian of the named beneficiary, wherever appointed and qualified, or where more than one (1) beneficiary is named, the association shall pay such beneficiary’s proportionate interest in such account to his legal guardian wherever and whenever appointed and qualified; or
     </p>
     <p>
      If no guardian is appointed and qualified, payment may be made in accordance with the provisions of Section 93-20-209 or 93-20-431 in situations to which such section or sections are applicable.
     </p>
     <p>
      Where the death of the person or persons opening such an account terminates the account under the provisions of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section and where one or more of the named beneficiaries are under sixteen (16) years of age and the remainder of the named beneficiaries are sixteen (16) years of age or over, the association shall pay the monies to the credit of the trust, less all proper setoffs and charges, to:
     </p>
     <p>
      The named beneficiaries sixteen (16) years of age or over at the time of termination of said account pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, and
     </p>
     <p>
      The named beneficiaries under sixteen (16) years of age at the time of termination of said account pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section.
     </p>
     <p>
      Where such account is opened or subsequently held by more than one (1) person, the association, in the absence of any written instructions to the contrary, consented to by the association, shall accept payments made to such account and may pay any monies to the credit of such account from time to time to, or pursuant to the order of, either or any of said persons during their life or lives in the same manner as if the account were in the sole name of either or any of such persons.
     </p>
     <p>
      When a person or persons opens an account in an association, in the form set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, and makes a payment or payments to such account, or causes a payment or payments to be made to such account, such person or persons shall be conclusively presumed to intend to vest in the named beneficiary or beneficiaries a present beneficial interest in such payment so made, and in the monies to the credit of the account from time to time, to the end that, if the named beneficiary or beneficiaries survive the person or persons opening such an account, all the right and title of the person or persons opening such an account in and to the monies to the credit of the account at the death of such person or persons, less all proper setoffs and charges, shall, at such death, vest solely and indefeasibly in the named beneficiary or beneficiaries subject to the conditions and limitations of paragraphs (c) through (i) of this section.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the named beneficiary predeceases the person opening such an account, the present beneficial interest presumed to be vested in the named beneficiary pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section shall terminate at the death of the named beneficiary. In such case, the personal representatives of the named beneficiary, and all others claiming through or under the named beneficiary, shall have no right in or title to the monies to the credit of the account, and the association shall pay such monies, less all proper setoffs and charges, to the person opening such an account, or pursuant to his order, in the same manner as if the account were in the sole name of the person opening such an account; provided, however, where such an account names more than one (1) beneficiary, the death of one (1) of the beneficiaries so named shall not terminate the account and the account shall continue as to the surviving beneficiary or beneficiaries subject to the provisions of paragraphs (c) through (i) of this section.
     </p>
     <p>
      An association which makes any payment pursuant to paragraphs (c) through (g) of this section, prior to service upon the association or an order of court restraining such payment, shall, to the extent of each payment so made, be released from all claims of the person or persons opening such an account, the named beneficiary or beneficiaries, their legal representatives, and all others claiming through or under them.
     </p>
     <p>
      When an account is opened in a form described in paragraph (a) of this section, the right of the named beneficiary or beneficiaries to be vested with sole and indefeasible title to the monies to the credit of the account on the death of the person or persons opening such an account shall not be denied, abridged or in anywise affected because such right has not been created by a writing executed in accordance with the law of this state prescribing the requirements to effect a valid testamentary disposition of property.

      An association may pay earnings on its savings accounts from sources available for payment of earnings at such rate and at such times and for such time or notice periods as shall be determined by resolution of its board of directors subject to such rules and regulations promulgated by the commissioner. Except for accounts which shall be classified according to a specified contractual time or notice period, earnings shall be declared on the withdrawal value of each savings account at the beginning of the accounting period, plus additions thereto made during the period (less amounts previously withdrawn and noticed for withdrawal, which for earnings purposes shall be deducted from the latest previous additions thereto) computed at the declared rate for the time the funds have been invested, which time shall be fixed by the bylaws of the association. No earnings shall be declared or paid for an accounting period unless the allocation to the general reserve for the pre ceding accounting period required herein has been made. The board of directors, by resolution, may determine that earnings shall not be paid on any savings account which has a withdrawal value of a specified amount less than Fifty Dollars ($50.00) or which by written agreement is intended to be closed within a specified period less than fifteen (15) months after the date on which such savings account is opened, provided that an exception may be made and earnings paid on savings accounts opened pursuant to Sections 81-12-129 and 81-12-131. The directors shall determine by resolution the method of calculating the amount of any earnings on savings accounts as herein provided, and the time or times when earnings are to be declared, paid or credited.

     <p>
      Any savings account holder or other account holder or his authorized representative may at any time present a written application for withdrawal of all or any part of his savings account or other account. Every association shall pay, except as provided below, every withdrawal application in the amount stated thereon in the form of cash or one or more checks or similar instruments payable to the order of the account holder. However, if a federal savings and loan association located in this state acquires the right and power to pay withdrawal applications in the form of checks or similar instruments payable to the order of others than the account holder as directed, or by the transfer of credits to the account or accounts of others in an institution as directed, then an association incorporated pursuant to or operating under the provisions of this chapter may have and possess the same rights and powers if prescribed by the board pursuant to subsection (r) of Section 8 1-12-49. No withdrawal shall be made in excess of the withdrawal value of such savings account or accounts, together with any earnings which may have been declared and may have accrued thereon for the current period. The payment of withdrawals from savings accounts shall be subject to the right of the association to require notice not to exceed thirty (30) days and shall be subject to such rules and procedures as may be prescribed by regulations of the commissioner, but any association which, except as authorized in writing by the commissioner, fails to make full payment of any withdrawal when due shall be deemed to be in an impaired condition to transact business within the meaning of Section 81-12-183 of this chapter.

    Redemptions.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      At any time funds are on hand for the purpose, the association shall have the right to redeem by lot as the board of directors may determine, all or any part of any of its savings accounts on an earnings date by giving thirty (30) days’ notice by registered mail addressed to each affected account holder at his last address as recorded on the books of the association. No association shall redeem any of its savings accounts when the association is in an impaired condition or when it is unable to pay its applications for withdrawal. The redemption price of savings accounts redeemed shall be the full value of the account redeemed, as determined by the board of directors, but in no event shall the redemption price be less than the withdrawal value. If the aforesaid notice of redemption shall have been duly given, and if on or before the redemption date the funds necessary for such redemption shall have been set aside so as to be and continue to be available therefor, earnings upon the accounts called for redemption shall cease to accrue from and after the earnings date specified as the redemption date; and all rights with respect to such accounts shall forthwith, after such redemption date, terminate, except only for the right of the account holder of record to receive the redemption price with interest to the redemption date. All savings account books or certificates evidencing former savings accounts which have been validly called for redemption must be tendered for payment within ten (10) years from the date of redemption designated in the redemption notice, otherwise they shall be cancelled. After the expiration of the period of ten (10) years, the association in which the funds are located shall, within six (6) months, pay the funds to the commissioner, who shall deposit such funds to the department’s account with the State Treasurer.

    Payment of expenses in connection with closing of loan; borrower to pay only his own attorney’s fee; notice of right to select attorney; right of association to require title insurance.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Every association may require borrowers to pay all reasonable expenses incurred in connection with the making, closing, disbursing, extending, readjusting or renewing of real estate loans as shall be authorized by the commissioner. If an attorney’s fee is charged the borrower in connection with any loan, the borrower shall have the right to select an attorney of his choice to close the loan and to look after his interests in connection with the loan and the fee shall be paid to the attorney selected. It is the intention of the Legislature to insure that the borrower shall not be required to pay any attorney’s fee to any attorney other than the attorney selected by the borrower to close the loan. The borrower shall be advised by the association in writing of his right to select an attorney, provided that such attorney is on an approved list of a title insurance company acceptable to the association, and authorized to do business in the State of Mississippi. Title insurance is used herein as a criterion for qualifications of attorneys only, and nothing in this chapter shall be construed as requiring any association to require a borrower to secure a title insurance policy in addition to the regular attorney’s certification of title. However, an association may, if it desires, require title insurance policies on loans, but if policies are required from one (1) attorney they shall be required from all attorneys used in connection with loans under this section. No association shall discriminate as to any charges, fees or discounts, or make any different charges whatsoever between loans closed by an attorney selected or recommended by, or representing the association and loans closed by an attorney selected by the borrower under the provisions of this subsection. It is the intent of the Legislature that borrowers shall be free to select attorneys of their choice to close all loans under the authority of this paragraph, without incurring any additional charge or expense whatsoever. The commissioner shall have the authority to adopt reasonable rules and regulations to promulgate the provisions of this subsection. Any association, or any officer or employee of any such association willfully violating the provisions of this subsection shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be fined not less than One Hundred Dollars ($100.00) nor more than Five Hundred Dollars ($500.00).

     </h3>
     <p>
      If the commissioner, as a result of any examination or from any report made to him, shall find that any association is violating the provisions of its certificate of incorporation or bylaws, or the laws of this state or of the United States, or any lawful order or regulation of the commissioner, he shall, by a formal written order delivered to the association as aforesaid, state any alleged violation, together with a statement of the facts alleged to be such violation, and order discontinuance of such violation and conformance with all requirements of law. Such order shall specify the effective date thereof, which may be immediate or may be at a later date, and such order shall remain in effect until withdrawn by the commissioner or until terminated by a court order. Such order of the commissioner, upon application made on or after the effective date thereof by the commissioner to the chancery court in the county in which the home office of the association is located, shall be enforced ex parte and without notice by an order to comply entered by the court. Such proceedings shall be given precedence over all cases pending in such court, and shall in every way be expedited. Any association affected by such order of the commissioner shall, after receipt thereof, have the right to apply within thirty (30) days to any such court for an immediate hearing and order suspending the order of the commissioner upon such conditions as may be prescribed by the court until such time as the hearing has been completed. The hearing of such application to the court shall be upon such notice to the commissioner as the court shall provide. Whether upon application by the commissioner or by the association, such court shall have power to and shall adjudicate the question and enter the proper order or orders and enforce the same.

Such proceedings shall be given precedence over other cases pending in such court, and shall in every way be expedited. Such court shall confirm such appointment if it shall find that one or more of such grounds exist, and a certified copy of the order of the court confirming such appointment shall be evidence thereof. Such conservator shall have the power and authority provided in this chapter and such other power and authority as may be expressed in the order of the court. Such conservator shall endeavor promptly to remedy the situations complained of by the commissioner in his application for confirmation of such appointment. Within six (6) months of the date of such appointment, or within twelve (12) months if the court shall extend such period of six (6) months, such association shall be returned to the board of directors thereof and thereafter shall be managed and operated as if no conservator had been appointed, or a receiver shall be appointed as hereinafter provided. If the commissioner or examiner is appointed conservator, he shall receive no additional compensation, but if another person is appointed, then the compensation of the conservator, as determined by the court, shall be paid by the association. A certified copy of the order of the court discharging such conservator and returning such association to the directors thereof shall be sufficient evidence thereof.

The conservator shall have power to accept savings accounts and additions to savings accounts, but any such amounts received by the conservator may be segregated if the commissioner shall so order in writing; if so ordered, such amounts shall not be subject to offset and shall not be used to liquidate any indebtedness of such association existing at the time the conservator was appointed for it or any subsequent indebtedness incurred for the purposes of liquidating the indebtedness of any such association existing at the time such conservator was appointed. All expenses of the association during such conservatorship shall be paid by the association.

       § 81-12-193.
    Fees.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The department shall charge and collect for:
     </p>
     <p>
      Filing articles of incorporation and issuing a certificate of incorporation, a minimum fee of Five Hundred Dollars ($500.00) up to a maximum fee of Two Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($2,500.00) as fixed by the commissioner.
     </p>
     <p>
      For filing annual reports, the commissioner shall assess every association organized under the laws of this state engaging in the business of an association, and every foreign association qualified to do business in this state under the provisions of Section 81-12-187, in accordance with the following schedule, setting forth the maximum that may be assessed:
     </p>
     <p>
      Seventy-five Dollars ($75.00).
     </p>
     <p>
      Every such association whose total assets exceed One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000.00) shall further pay in addition to the minimum assessment of Seventy-five Dollars ($75.00), Fifty Cents (50¢) for each One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00) or fraction thereof of assets in excess of One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000.00). All money accruing from such assessment shall be used for the maintenance of the department.
     </p>
     <p>
      The commissioner shall, during the month of January in each year, or as soon thereafter as practicable, prepare and send to each association a statement of the assessments due under this section, based upon the total assets of each association as of December 31 of the preceding year. The assessment shall be payable in accordance with the statement so furnished and shall be paid within ten (10) days after the date fixed for their payment. Such assessment shall constitute a lien on the assets of each association until paid. Any association failing to make payment of an installment within ten (10) days as provided in this section shall be liable for a penalty of ten percent (10%) of the amount in default for each day thereafter. All assessments and penalties provided in this section shall be payable as set forth in this section, and when collected by the commissioner shall be delivered to the State Treasurer to be placed to the credit of the account of the department.
     </p>
     <p>
      If it appears to the commissioner that the fees assessed under this section shall produce more than the requirements of the estimated operating budget approved for the department for the ensuing assessment period, the commissioner shall authorize a uniform percentage reduction to be applied to the fees to be paid by the individual associations.
     </p>
     <p>
      Associations organized and in existence as of June 30, 1994, shall not be billed or liable for the annual report assessment due for the close of this period only. The next annual report assessment shall be due based upon assets as of December 31, 1994, and annually thereafter.
     </p>
     <p>
      Filing articles of merger when the resulting association is a state association, a minimum fee of Five Hundred Dollars ($500.00) up to a maximum fee of Two Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($2,500.00), as fixed by the commissioner.
     </p>
     <p>
      Filing an application for conversion from a national association to a state association, a minimum fee of Five Hundred Dollars ($500.00) up to a maximum fee of Two Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($2,500.00) as fixed by the commissioner.
     </p>
     <p>
      Filing an application for a branch bank, branch office, or drive-in teller window, a minimum fee of Two Hundred Fifty Dollars ($250.00) up to a maximum fee of One Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($1,500.00), as fixed by the commissioner.
     </p>
     <p>
      The commissioner shall publish a schedule of fees applicable to all associations within his jurisdiction.

    Appeal from final rule, regulation or order of commissioner or board.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Any interested person aggrieved by any final rule, regulation or order of the commissioner or the board, shall have the right, regardless of the amount involved to appeal to the Circuit Court of the First Judicial District of Hinds County, except that if the appellant is an applicant for a charter the appeal shall be taken to the circuit court of the county in which the institution sought to be chartered would be domiciled, and if the appellant is seeking to establish a branch office, the appeal shall be taken to the circuit court of the county in which the branch is proposed to be located. Such appeal shall be taken and perfected as hereinafter provided, within thirty (30) days from the date of such final rule, regulation or order; and the circuit court may affirm such rule, regulation or order, or reverse same for further proceedings as justice may require. All such appeals shall be taken and perfected, heard and determined either in termtime or in vacation on the record, including a transcript of pleadings and testimony, both oral and documentary, filed and heard before the commissioner or the board, and such appeal shall be heard and disposed of promptly by the court as a preference cause. In perfecting any appeal provided by this section, the provisions of law respecting notice to the reporter and the allowance of bills of exception, now or hereafter in force respecting appeals from the circuit court to Supreme Court shall be applicable. However, the reporter shall transcribe his notes and file the transcript of the record with the commissioner or the board within thirty (30) days after approval of the appeal bond. Upon the filing with the commissioner or the board of a petition for appeal to the circuit court, it shall be the duty of the commissioner or the board, as promptly as possible, and in any event within sixty (60) days after approval of the appeal bond, to file with the clerk of the circuit court to which the appeal is taken, a copy of the petition for appeal and of the rule, regulation or order appealed from, and the original and one (1) copy of the transcript of the record of proceedings in evidence before the commissioner or the board. After the filing of the petition, the appeal shall be perfected by the filing of bond in the sum of Five Hundred Dollars ($500.00) with two (2) good and sufficient sureties or with a surety company qualified to do business in Mississippi as the surety, conditioned to pay the cost of such appeal; the bond to be approved by the commissioner or by the clerk of the court to which such appeal is taken. The perfection of an appeal shall not stay or suspend the operation of any rule, regulation or order of the commissioner or the board, but the judge of the circuit court to which the appeal is taken may award a writ of supersedeas to any rule, regulation or order of the commissioner or the board after five (5) days’ notice to the commissioner or the board and after hearing. Any order or judgment staying the operation of any rule, regulation or order of the commissioner or the board shall contain a specific finding, based upon evidence submitted to the circuit judge and identified by reference thereto, that great or irreparable damage would result to the appellant if he is denied relief, and the stay shall not become effective until a supersedeas bond shall have been executed and filed with and approved by the clerk of the court payable to the state. The bond shall be in an amount fixed by the circuit judge and conditioned as the circuit judge may direct in the order granting the supersedeas.

       Whenever the commissioner determines that a solvent association is conducting its business in an unsafe or unsound manner, or in any fashion which threatens the financial integrity or sound operation of the association, the commissioner may serve a notice of charges on the association, requiring it to show why it should not be placed under supervisory control. Such notice of charges shall specify the grounds for supervisory control, and set the time and place for a hearing. A hearing before the commissioner pursuant to such notice shall be held within fifteen (15) days after issuance of the notice of charges.

       If the order taking supervisory control becomes final, the commissioner may appoint an agent to supervise and monitor the operations of the association during the period of supervisory control. During the period of supervisory control, the association shall act in accordance with such instructions as may be given by the commissioner, directly or through his supervisory agent, and shall not fail to act, except when to do so would violate an outstanding cease and desist order.

     <p>
      The liability to an association by a person, company, corporation or firm for money loaned, including in the liability of such person, company or firm, where a partnership, the liabilities of the several members thereof, shall not exceed twenty percent (20%) of the aggregate unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus of said association.

     <p>
      The following shall not be restricted to or considered as coming within the limitations of twenty percent (20%) herein prescribed:
     </p>
     <p>
      Loans and discounts secured by warehouse receipts or shippers’ order bills of lading representing actual existing values, provided the amount of such loans and discounts shall not exceed eighty-five percent (85%) of the market value of the commodities representing the actual existing values.
     </p>
     <p>
      Loans and discounts secured by bonds, certificates or notes constituting direct obligations of the United States government, or bonds fully guaranteed by the United States government, or by full faith and credit obligations of the State of Mississippi; provided, however, the commissioner shall from time to time determine and fix the maximum percentage of the par value of all such securities that may be loaned.
     </p>
     <p>
      Loans and discounts to the extent that they are secured or covered by guaranties, or by commitments, or agreements to take over or purchase the same, made by any federal reserve bank, or by the United States, or any department, bureau, board, commission or establishment of the United States, including any corporation wholly owned directly or indirectly by the United States; provided that such guaranties, agreements or commitments are unconditional and are to be performed by payment within sixty (60) days after demand; provided, further, that the commissioner is hereby authorized to define the terms herein used and may by regulation control the making of loans under this paragraph (c).
     </p>
     <p>
      Loans and discounts secured in full by funds on deposit in time or savings accounts with the lending bank to the credit of the borrower.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any officer or director who shall approve or make loans prohibited in this section shall be liable individually for the full amount of the principal and interest of any such loan. If the commissioner shall discover, in any examination of any open bank that there is a loss on any loan made in violation of this section, he shall make demand of all directors and officers approving or making such loan for payment of the entire unpaid balance on any such loan.
     </p>

       Any seven (7) persons who are residents of the State of Mississippi of full age and of good moral and sound business character eligible under this chapter to become members of a credit union may prepare in duplicate articles of association and incorporation, and sign the same and cause the same to be acknowledged by one (1) of the signers before an officer competent to take acknowledgments to the effect that the same has been signed and executed by all of the signers. Before any credit union may be organized and formed, the prospective incorporators shall give notice to the Department of Banking and Consumer Finance by petition to the Commissioner of Banking and Consumer Finance of their desire to engage in business as a credit union and shall at the time file with the commissioner two (2) copies of the proposed articles of incorporation, duly sworn to by one (1) of the prospective incorporators.

       Upon receipt of a petition for a certificate of incorporation to form a credit union and such additional information as may be required by the commissioner, the commissioner shall promptly give consideration to the petition and make an examination of the proposed articles of incorporation to determine if they meet all requirements of the law. The commissioner shall then make an investigation to determine that the prerequisites of this chapter have been complied with and that:

When the commissioner has completed the examination and investigation, the commissioner shall record the findings in writing and render a decision as to whether or not said credit union should be authorized to do business. If the decision is favorable, the incorporators shall then present one (1) of said copies of the articles of association and incorporation, with a recording fee of Ten Dollars ($10.00) to the Secretary of State of the State of Mississippi who shall receive and file the same, whereupon said persons entering into said articles shall be and become an incorporated credit union association under the laws of the State of Mississippi, without individual liability for debts, obligation or other liabilities of said association, in ex cess of such membership fees as remain due and unpaid by said members, respectively, and may sue and be sued in the name of said association.

For the purpose of compelling the attendance of witnesses at such hearing the commissioner shall have the power to issue subpoenas therefor in the same manner as subpoenas are issued in circuit courts.

If the application for the charter shall be denied as a result of such hearing, the applicant may obtain a review of such denial by filing a petition for the review of such denial within thirty (30) days from the date of such denial to the circuit court of the county in which it is sought to organize such credit union. The review by said court shall be on the record made before the commissioner and copies of all applications, bonds and other papers and documents of every kind filed with the commissioner in connection with the application and said hearing shall be included in said record along with the transcript of the evidence.

    Examination by Commissioner of Banking and Consumer Finance; powers of Commissioner; fees; acceptance of examination performed by National Credit Union Administration.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Each credit union shall be examined at least once per eighteen-month period by the Commissioner of Banking and Consumer Finance. The commissioner may conduct other examinations and the commissioner or examiners of the Department of Banking and Consumer Finance shall at all times be given free access to all the books, papers, securities and other sources of information in respect to the credit union. For that purpose he shall have the power to subpoena and examine personally or through one (1) of his deputies, or examiners, duly authorized, witnesses on oath and documents pertaining to the business of the credit union. The fees for examination shall be determined by the commissioner by assessing the association according to the cost based on the average daily cost of all examiners of the department, plus actual and necessary expenses. The commissioner shall have the authority to prescribe supervision fees at the rate of Ten Cents (10¢) per One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00) of assets, and not be less than Twenty Dollars ($20.00) nor more than Two Hundred Dollars ($200.00) a year for overhead expenses of the department in supervising the credit union. The commissioner shall send each such credit union a statement of the amount due by it and shall specify how the same shall be paid. The fees shall be due and payable in accordance with the statement so furnished and shall be paid within ten (10) days after the date fixed for their payment. Such fees shall constitute a lien on the assets of the credit union until paid. Any such credit union failing to make payment within ten (10) days as herein provided shall be liable to a penalty of ten percent (10%) of the amount in default for each day thereafter.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the event the commissioner’s office, because of work load or other good sufficient cause, is unable to conduct an annual examination of a credit union as provided for in this section, the commissioner is hereby authorized to accept the examination of any credit union performed by the National Credit Union Administration or by any succession thereto. However, in no case shall the commissioner be authorized to accept any such examination of any credit union performed by the NCUA or its successor for any two (2) consecutive eighteen-month periods.

The making of a deposit in that form, or the making of additions thereto, shall create a presumption in any action or proceeding to which either the credit union or any survivor is a party of the intention of all the persons named on the deposit to vest title to the deposit and the additions thereto and all interest or dividends thereon in the survivor or survivors. Any credit union may pay to the successor of a deceased depositor, as defined in Section 91-7-322(2), without necessity of administration, any sum to the credit of the decedent not exceeding Twelve Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($12,500.00), without liability to any other persons, relatives or beneficiaries, and the receipt of acquittance of the person so paid shall be a valid and sufficient release and discharge to the credit union for any payment so made. This section shall apply to all credit unions, including state and federal credit unions within the state. The term “deposit” as used in this section shall include, but not be limited to, any form of deposit or account, such as a savings account, checking account, time deposit, demand deposit or certificate of deposit, whether negotiable, nonnegotiable or otherwise.

      Any state or federal thrift institution or state or national bank may apply for conversion into a state-chartered savings bank upon the affirmative vote of fifty-one percent (51%) or more of the total number of votes of the members eligible to be cast or an affirmative vote of sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66-2/3%) or more of all the issued and outstanding stock of such institution, at an annual meeting or at any special meeting of the members or stockholders called to consider such action. Upon such affirmative vote, the institution may apply for a certificate of authority by filing with the commissioner a certificate signed by its president or cashier and secretary which sets forth the corporate action herein prescribed and asserts that the institution has complied with the provisions of the laws of the United States. The institution shall also file with the commissioner the plan of conversion and the proposed amendments to its articles of incorporation or articles of association as approved by the members or stockholders for the operation of the institution as a state-chartered savings bank. Upon receipt of the prescribed application, the commissioner shall examine all facts associated with the conversion. The expenses and cost incurred for such special examination shall be paid by the institution applying for permission to convert. The commissioner shall present his findings and recommendations to the State Board of Banking Review for consideration. Upon approval by the State Board of Banking Review, the commissioner shall issue a certificate of authority to the applicant allowing the conversion to proceed.

       § 81-14-103.
    Conversion from state to federal charter.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Any state savings bank, stock or mutual, organized and operated under the provisions of this chapter, may convert to a federal charter in accordance with the provisions of the laws and regulations of the United States and with the same force and effect as though originally incorporated under such laws. The procedure to convert shall be as follows:
     </p>
     <p>
      The savings bank shall submit a plan of conversion to the commissioner, and he may approve the plan, with or without amendment, or reject the plan. If he approves, the plan shall be submitted to the members or stockholders as hereinafter provided. If the commissioner rejects the plan, he shall state his objections in writing and give the converting savings bank an opportunity to amend the plan.
     </p>
     <p>
      A meeting of the members or stockholders shall be held after fifteen (15) days’ notice to each member or stockholder. The board of directors may provide notice of the meeting to each member or stockholder either by mail, postage prepaid, or by publication of notice, once a week for two (2) weeks preceding such meeting, in a newspaper of general circulation in the county where such savings bank has its principal office. The notice may contain the following statement: “The purpose of this meeting is to consider the conversion of this state-chartered savings bank to a federal charter, pursuant to the laws of the United States.” An appropriate officer of the savings bank shall make proof by affidavit at such meeting of due service of the notice for such meeting.
     </p>
     <p>
      At the meeting of the members or stockholders of such savings bank, such members or stockholders may by affirmative vote of a majority of votes or shares present, in person or by proxy, resolve to convert said savings bank to a federal charter. A certified copy of the minutes from such meeting shall be filed in the office of the commissioner and shall be prima facie evidence of the holding of the meeting.
     </p>
     <p>
      Within a reasonable time after the receipt of a certified copy of the minutes, the commissioner shall either approve or reject the proceedings of the meeting for compliance with the procedure set forth in this section. If the commissioner approves the proceedings, he shall issue a certificate of his approval of conversion. Such certificate shall be recorded by the savings bank in the office of the Secretary of State. If the commissioner rejects the proceedings, he shall provide a written explanation of his disapproval and notify the savings bank of his disapproval.
     </p>
     <p>
      The savings bank shall file an application, in the manner prescribed or authorized by the laws and regulations of the United States, to consummate the conversion to a federal charter. A copy of the charter or authorization issued to the savings bank by the appropriate federal regulatory authority shall be filed with the commissioner. Upon filing with the commissioner, the savings bank shall cease to be a state savings bank and shall be a federal depository institution.
     </p>
     <p>
      Whenever any savings bank shall convert to a federal charter, it shall cease to be a savings bank under the laws of this state; provided, however, that its corporate existence shall be extended for the purpose of prosecuting or defending suits, enabling such savings bank to close its business affairs as a state savings bank, and disposing of and conveying its property. At the time when such conversion becomes effective, all the property of the state savings bank, including all its rights, title and interest in and to all property of whatever kind, and every right, privilege, interest and asset of any conceivable value or benefit then existing, belonging or pertaining to it, or which would inure to it, shall immediately by act of law and without any conveyance or transfer, and without any further act or deed, be vested in and become the property of the federal depository institution which shall have, hold and enjoy such property in its own right as fully as such property was possessed, held and enjoyed by the savings bank; and the federal depository institution as of the effective time of such conversion shall succeed to all the rights, obligations and relations of the state savings bank.

       § 81-14-109.
    Conversion of stock savings bank to mutual savings bank.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Any stock savings bank organized and operating under the provisions of this chapter may, subject to the approval of the commissioner, convert to a mutual savings bank under the provisions of this section. The commissioner may promulgate rules and regulations governing the conversion of stock savings banks to mutual savings banks. Such rules and regulations shall include, but shall not be limited to requirements that:
     </p>
     <p>
      The conversion neither impair the capital of the converting savings bank nor adversely affect its operations;
     </p>
     <p>
      The conversion shall be fair and equitable to all stockholders of the converting savings bank;
     </p>
     <p>
      The public shall not be adversely affected by the conversion;
     </p>
     <p>
      Conversion of a savings bank shall be accomplished only pursuant to a plan approved by the commissioner. Such plan must have been approved by an affirmative vote of two-thirds (2/3) of the members of the board of directors of the converting savings bank, after a full and fair disclosure to the stockholders, and by an affirmative vote of a majority of the votes which stockholders of the savings bank are entitled to cast;
     </p>
     <p>
      The plan of conversion provides that:
     </p>
     <p>
      Deposit accounts will be issued in connection with the conversion to the stockholders of the converting savings bank;
     </p>
     <p>
      A uniform date will be fixed for the determination of the stockholders to whom, and the amount to each stockholder of which, deposit accounts shall be made available;
     </p>
     <p>
      Deposit accounts made available to stockholders will be based upon a fair and equitable formula approved by the commissioner and fully and fairly disclosed to the stockholders of the converting savings bank.

       § 81-14-111.
    Merger of like savings banks.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Any two (2) or more mutual savings banks, or any two (2) or more stock savings banks, organized and operating, may merge or consolidate into a single savings bank. The procedure to merge shall be as follows:
     </p>
     <p>
      The directors, or a majority of them, of such savings banks may, at separate meetings, enter into a written agreement of merger. Such agreement shall be signed by the majority of the directors under the corporate seals of the respective savings banks and shall specify each savings bank to be merged and the savings bank which is to receive into itself the merging savings bank or banks. Such agreement shall prescribe the terms and conditions of the merger and the mode of carrying it into effect. The merger agreement may provide such other provisions with respect to the merger as appear necessary or desirable, or as the commissioner may require to enable him to discharge his duties with respect to such merger.
     </p>
     <p>
      A meeting of the members or stockholders of each of the savings banks shall be held separately upon written notice of not less than fifteen (15) days to members or stockholders of each savings bank. The notice shall specify the time, place and purpose for the meeting. Notice shall be made by personal service or postage prepaid mail to the last address of each member or stockholder appearing upon the records of the savings bank, or by publication of notice, at least once a week for two (2) weeks preceding the meeting, in one or more newspapers of general circulation in the county or counties where each savings bank has its principal or a branch office, or in a newspaper of general circulation in an adjoining county if none is available in the county. An appropriate officer of the savings bank shall make proof by affidavit at such meeting of the due service of the notice for such meeting.
     </p>
     <p>
      At separate meetings of the members or stockholders of the respective savings banks, the members or stockholders may adopt, by an affirmative vote of a majority of the votes or shares present, in person or by proxy, a resolution to merge into a single savings bank upon the terms of the merger agreement as agreed upon by the directors of the respective savings banks and as approved by the commissioner. Upon the adoption of the resolution, a copy of the minutes of the proceedings of the meetings of the members or stockholders of the respective savings banks certified by an appropriate officer of the merging savings banks shall be filed in the office of the commissioner. Within fifteen (15) days after the receipt of a certified copy of the minutes of such meeting the commissioner shall either approve or disapprove the proceedings for compliance with this section. If the proceedings are approved by him, he shall issue a certificate of his approval of the merger. The certificate shall be filed and recorded in the office of the Secretary of State. When the certificate is so filed, the merger agreement shall take effect according to its terms and shall be binding upon all the members or stockholders of the merging savings banks, and it shall be deemed to be the act of merger of such constituent savings banks under the laws of this state. The certificate or certified copy thereof shall be evidence of the agreement and act of merger of such constituent savings banks under the laws of this state and the observance and performance of all acts and conditions necessary to have been observed and performed precedent to such merger. Within sixty (60) days after its receipt from the Secretary of State, the certified copy of the certificate shall be filed with the registrar of deeds of the county or counties in which the respective savings banks so merged have recorded their original certificates of incorporation. Failure to file shall subject the savings bank to a penalty of One Hundred Dollars ($100.00) to be collected by the Secretary of State. If the commissioner disapproves the proceedings, he shall issue a written statement of the reasons for his disapproval and notify the savings bank to that effect.
     </p>
     <p>
      Upon the merger of any savings bank:
     </p>
     <p>
      Its corporate existence shall be merged into that of the receiving savings bank; and all its right, title, interest in and to all property of whatsoever kind, and every right, privilege, interest or asset of any conceivable value or benefit then existing belonging or pertaining to it, or which would inure to it under an unmerged existence, shall immediately by act of law and without any conveyance or transfer, and without any further act or deed, be vested in and become the property of such receiving savings bank which shall have, hold and enjoy such property in its own right as fully as if such property were possessed, held or enjoyed by the savings banks so merged; and such receiving savings bank shall absorb fully and completely the savings bank or banks so merged.
     </p>
     <p>
      Its rights, liabilities, obligations and relations to any person shall remain unchanged and the savings bank into which it has been merged shall succeed to all the relations, obligations and liabilities as though it had assumed or incurred the same. No obligation or liability of a member, customer or stockholder in a savings bank shall be affected by the merger, but obligations and liabilities shall continue as they existed before the merger, unless otherwise provided in the merger agreement.
     </p>
     <p>
      A pending action or other judicial proceeding to which any merging savings bank is a party shall not be deemed to have abated or to have discontinued by reason of the merger, but may be prosecuted to final judgment, order or decree as if the merger had not occurred; or the receiving savings bank may be substituted as a party to such action or proceeding, and any judgment, order or decree may be rendered for or against the receiving savings bank as if the merger had not occurred.
     </p>
     <p>
      Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the commissioner may waive any of the foregoing requirements upon finding that such waiver would be in the best interest of the members or stockholders of the merging savings banks.

    Voluntary dissolution by stockholders or members.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      At any annual or special meeting called for such purpose, a savings bank may, by an affirmative vote in person or by proxy of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the total number of shares or votes which all members or stockholders of the association are entitled to cast, resolve to dissolve and liquidate the savings bank and adopt a plan of voluntary dissolution. Upon adoption of such resolution and plan of voluntary dissolution, the members or stockholders shall proceed to elect not more than three (3) liquidators who shall post bond as required by the commissioner. The liquidators shall have full power to execute the plan. The procedure thereafter shall be as follows:
     </p>
     <p>
      A copy of the resolution certified by an appropriate officer of the savings bank, the minutes of the meeting of members or stockholders, the plan of liquidation and an itemized statement of the savings bank’s assets and liabilities sworn to by a majority of its board of directors, shall be filed with the commissioner. The minutes of the meeting of members or stockholders shall be certified by an appropriate officer of the institution and shall set forth the notice given and the time of mailing thereof, the vote on the resolution and the total number of shares or votes which all members of the savings bank were entitled to cast thereon, and the names of the liquidators elected.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the commissioner finds that the proceedings are in accordance with the provisions of this chapter and that the plan of liquidation is not reasonably unfair to any person affected, he shall attach his certificate of approval to the plan and shall forward one (1) copy to the liquidators and one (1) copy to the savings bank’s federal deposit account insurance corporation. Once the commissioner has approved the resolution and the plan of liquidation, it shall thereafter be unlawful for such savings bank to accept any additional deposit accounts or additions to deposit accounts or make any additional loans. All of the income and receipts in excess of actual expenses of liquidation of the savings bank shall be applied to the discharge of its liabilities.
     </p>
     <p>
      The liquidator or liquidators so appointed shall be paid a reasonable compensation by the liquidating savings bank subject to the approval of the commissioner.
     </p>
     <p>
      The plan shall become effective upon the recording of the commissioner’s certificate of approval in the manner required by this chapter for the recording of the certificate of incorporation.
     </p>
     <p>
      The liquidation of the savings bank shall be subject to the supervision and examination of the commissioner.

    Appeal from final rule, regulation or order of commissioner or board.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Unless otherwise provided in this chapter, any interested person aggrieved by any rule, regulation or order of the commissioner and/or the board, as applicable, shall have the right, regardless of the amount involved, to appeal to the Circuit Court of the First Judicial District of Hinds County. However, if the appellant is an applicant for a charter, the appeal shall be taken to the circuit court of the county in which the proposed institution is domiciled; or if the appellant is seeking to establish a branch office, the appeal shall be taken to the circuit court of the county in which the proposed branch is located. Such appeal shall be taken and perfected as hereinafter provided, within thirty (30) days from the date of such final rule, regulation or order. The circuit court may affirm such rule, regulation or order, or remand for further proceedings as justice may require. All such appeals shall be taken and perfected, heard either in termtime or in vacation, and shall be heard and disposed of promptly by the court as a preference cause. In perfecting any appeal provided by this section, the provisions of law respecting notice to the reporter and the allowance of bills of exception, now or hereafter in force, and those provisions respecting appeals from the circuit court to supreme court shall be applicable. However, the reporter shall transcribe his notes and file the transcript of the record with the commissioner or board within thirty (30) days after approval of the appeal bond. Upon the filing with the commissioner or board of a petition for appeal to the circuit court, it shall be the duty of the commissioner or board, within sixty (60) days after approval of the appeal bond to file with the clerk of the circuit court to which the appeal is taken a copy of the petition for appeal, the rule, regulation or order appealed from, and the original and one (1) copy of the transcript of the record of proceedings in evidence before the commissioner or board. After the filing of such petition, the appeal shall be perfected by filing of bond in the sum of Five Hundred Dollars ($500.00) with two (2) sufficient sureties, or with a surety company qualified to do business in Mississippi as the surety, conditioned to pay the cost of such appeal. Such bond shall be approved by the commissioner or by the clerk of the court to which such appeal is taken. The perfection of an appeal shall not stay or suspend the operation of any rule, regulation or order of the commissioner or board, but the judge of such circuit court may award a writ of supersedeas to any rule, regulation or order of the commissioner or board after five (5) days’ notice to the commissioner or board. Any order or judgment staying the operation of any rule, regulation or order of the commissioner or board shall contain a specific finding, based upon evidence submitted to the circuit judge and identified by reference thereto, that irreparable damage would result t o the appellant if he is denied relief. Such stay shall not become effective until a supersedeas bond shall have been executed and filed with and approved by the clerk of the court payable to the state. The bond shall be in an amount fixed by the circuit judge and conditioned as said circuit judge may direct.

     <p>
      In all examinations no savings bank shall be allowed credit in excess of its sound value for a note or security of which the principal and interest is over twelve (12) months past due; nor for any bond in excess of the real value thereof; nor for any stock of its own held more than twelve (12) months; nor for any unsecured overdrafts that may have existed for a greater period than thirty (30) days next preceding it, except that the period shall be ninety (90) days for unsecured overdrafts upon which interest is being charged if the savings bank has a written policy authorizing such overdrafts for not more than ninety (90) days. Only such overdrafts shall be considered as secure as are advanced against products or actual existing values evidenced by warehouse receipts or bills of lading, against bills of exchange drawn in good faith against actual existing values, or against funds on deposit by the depositor whose account is overdrawn, and who has pledged those funds as security for such overdraft, and in making up the statement of the condition of such savings bank any such item shall be charged off (but if desired a note shall be appended giving details thereof). But the discretion of the commissioner or examiner may be exercised in cases of estates in litigation or administration, and in pending suits, if the security affected thereby is ample, in the opinion of the commissioner or examiner making such examination.

However, this section shall not be construed to prevent any officer of the savings bank from furnishing to anyone a statement of such savings bank.

       Whenever the commissioner determines that a solvent savings bank is conducting its business in an unsafe or unsound manner, or in any fashion which threatens the financial integrity or sound operation of the savings bank, the commissioner may serve a notice of charges on the savings bank, requiring it to show why it should not be placed under supervisory control. Such notice of charges shall specify the grounds for supervisory control, and set the time and place for a hearing. A hearing before the commissioner pursuant to such notice shall be held within fifteen (15) days after issuance of the notice of charges.

       If, after the hearing provided above, the commissioner determines that supervisory control of the savings bank is necessary to protect the savings bank’s members, customers, stockholders or creditors, or the general public, the commissioner shall issue an order taking supervisory control of the savings bank.

       If the order taking supervisory control becomes final, the commissioner may appoint an agent to supervise and monitor the operations of the savings bank during the period of supervisory control. During the period of supervisory control, the savings bank shall act in accordance with such instructions as may be given by the commissioner, directly or through his supervisory agent, and shall not fail to act, except when to do so would violate an outstanding cease and desist order.

      <li id="t81c14s81-14-207ol14">
       Within one hundred eighty (180) days of the date the order taking supervisory control becomes final, the commissioner shall issue an order approving a plan for the termination of supervisory control. The plan may provide for:

Such notice shall specify the alleged conduct of such director, officer or employee and shall state the place for a hearing before the commissioner. A hearing shall be held no earlier than fifteen (15) days, but no later than thirty (30) days, after the notice of charges is served. If, after the hearing, the commissioner determines that the charges asserted have been proven by a preponderance of the evidence, the commissioner may issue an order removing the director, officer or employee in question. Such an order shall be effective upon issuance and may include the entire board of directors or all of the officers of the savings bank.

Such an order shall state its duration on its face and the words “Temporary Order of Removal” and shall be effective upon issuance for a period of fifteen (15) days. Such order may be extended once for a period of fifteen (15) days.

         The net worth of the savings bank is impaired to the extent that the realizable value of its assets is insufficient to pay in full its creditors and holders of deposit accounts; or

         The business of the savings bank is being conducted in a fraudulent, illegal or unsafe manner, or that the savings bank is in an unsafe or unsound condition to transact business; (any savings bank which, except as authorized in writing by the commissioner, fails to make full payment of any withdrawal when due is in an unsafe or unsound condition to transact business, notwithstanding such provisions of the certificate of incorporation or such statutes or regulations with respect to payment of withdrawals in event a savings bank does not pay all withdrawals in full); or

       Unless the commissioner finds that such an emergency exists which may result in loss to members, deposit account holders, stockholders or creditors, and which requires that he take custody immediately, the commissioner shall first give written notice to the directors and officers specifying the conditions criticized and allowing a reasonable time for corrections before a receiver shall be appointed.
      </li>

Such receiver shall furnish bond in form, amount and with surety as the commissioner may require. The commissioner may appoint the institution’s deposit account insurance corporation or its nominee as the receiver. Such insuring corporation shall be permitted to serve without posting bond.

Immediately upon taking possession of the savings bank, the receiver shall take possession and title of books, records and assets of the savings bank.

Such members, stockholders, holders of deposit accounts, officers or directors shall not thereafter, except as hereinafter expressly provided, exercise any such rights, powers or privileges, or act in connection with any assets or property of any nature of the savings bank in receivership.

     </p>
     <p>
      With the security interest in real estate evidenced by an appropriate written instrument and the loan evidenced by a note, bond or similar written instrument; a loan on the security of the whole of the beneficial interest in a land trust satisfies the requirements of this section if the title to the land is held by a corporate trustee and if the real estate held in the land trust meets the other requirements of this section.

     </p>
     <p>

     </h3>
     <p>
      If the board of directors determines at any time that funds are available in excess of the demands and needs for loans, maturities and withdrawals, a savings bank may invest funds as provided in this section:
     </p>
     <p>
      In demand, time or savings deposits or accounts, withdrawable accounts, or other insured obligations of any financial institution, the accounts of which are insured by a federal agency.
     </p>
     <p>
      In obligations of, or obligations that are fully guaranteed by the United States, and in stocks or obligations of any Federal Reserve Bank, Federal Home Loan Bank, the Student Loan Market Association, the Government National Mortgage Association, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or any other agency of the United States.
     </p>
     <p>
      In bonds or other direct obligations of, or guaranteed as to principal and interest by, this state.
     </p>
     <p>
      In bonds or other evidences of indebtedness that are direct general obligations of any unit of local government of this state, or other evidences of indebtedness that are payable from revenues or earnings specifically pledged therefor of a unit of local government, but in no event shall the total amount of the securities of any one (1) maker or obligor exceed fifteen percent (15%) of the savings bank’s total capital, nor shall the aggregate amount of investments under this paragraph exceed fifteen percent (15%) of the savings bank’s total assets.
     </p>
     <p>
      In real estate for the following purposes:
     </p>
     <p>
      A savings bank may invest in real property and equipment and in leasehold improvements to rented facilities necessary for the conduct of its business and in real property to be held for its future use. A savings bank may invest in an office building or buildings and appurtenances for the purpose of the transaction of the savings bank’s business. No such investment may be made without the prior written approval of the commissioner if the total amount of such investments exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the savings bank’s net worth. Facilities, furniture and fixtures leased for the purpose set forth in this section shall not be included in this limitation.
     </p>
     <p>
      With the prior written consent of the commissioner, a savings bank may invest in the initial purchase and development, or the purchase or commitment to purchase after completion, of home sites and housing for sale or rent, including, but not limited to: (A) projects for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or rebuilding of residential properties to meet the minimum standards of health and occupancy prescribed by appropriate local authorities; (B) the provision of accommodations for retail stores and other community services that are reasonably incident to such housing; or (C) in the shares of a corporation that owns one or more of those projects and that is wholly owned by one or more financial institutions whose investments are regulated by the laws of this state or of the United States. In no event shall the total investment in any one (1) project exceed fifteen percent (15%) of the savings bank’s net worth, nor shall the aggregate investment under this paragraph exceed fifty percent (50%) of its net worth.
     </p>
     <p>
      No savings bank may make an investment unless it is in compliance with the net worth requirements of this chapter and with the net worth maintenance requirements of its insurer of deposit accounts. The commissioner shall approve the investment only if the savings bank shows:
     </p>
     <p>
      That the savings bank has adequate assets available for the investment;
     </p>
     <p>
      That the proposed investment does not exceed the reasonable market value of the property or interest therein as determined in accordance with the appraisal requirements of this chapter; and
     </p>
     <p>
      That all other requirements of this section have been met.
     </p>
     <p>
      Nothing contained in this paragraph prohibits a savings bank from developing or building on land acquired by it under any other provision of this chapter nor from completing the construction of buildings in accordance with any construction loan contract where the borrower has failed to comply with the terms of the contract.
     </p>
     <p>
      In stocks or obligations of business development corporations chartered by this state or by the United States or an agency thereof, but in no event shall the aggregate amount of stock exceed two and one-half percent (2-1/2%) of the savings bank’s total capital or Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($250,000.00), whichever is greater.
     </p>
     <p>
      In obligations of urban renewal investment corporations chartered under the laws of this state, or the United States, or in certificates of beneficial interest of urban renewal investment trusts, but in no event shall the aggregate amount of the stock, obligations or beneficial interest certificates of any one (1) maker exceed two and one-half percent (2-1/2%) of the savings bank’s total capital, nor shall the aggregate amount of investments under this paragraph exceed fifteen percent (15%) of its total capital.
     </p>
     <p>
      In commercial paper. As used in this section, the term “commercial paper” means short-term obligations having a maturity ranging from two (2) to two hundred seventy (270) days issued by banks, corporations or other borrowers. Investments in commercial paper under this section must be in securities rated in one (1) of the two (2) highest categories by at least two (2) nationally recognized investment rating services.
     </p>
     <p>
      Purchase of stock in insurance companies. Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter to the contrary, a savings bank may purchase shares of, or otherwise acquire equity interest in, insurance companies and insurance holding companies organized to provide insurance for savings institutions and corporations and individuals affiliated with savings institutions; provided, however, that ownership of equity interest is a prerequisite to obtaining director’s, officer’s and blanket bond insurance through the company or companies. The commissioner may promulgate regulations concerning the size of each savings bank’s investment and manner of holding those investments.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subject to the regulation of the commissioner, in equity or debt securities or instruments of a service corporation that is a subsidiary of the savings bank.
     </p>
     <p>
      Through advances of federal funds to designated depositories, provided that the advances are made on the condition that they be repaid on the next business day following the date on which the advance is made. For the purpose of this paragraph, the term “federal funds” means funds that a savings bank has on deposit at a depository that are exchangeable for funds on deposit at a federal reserve bank; the term “business day” means any day on which the savings bank, the depository and the federal reserve bank where the funds are on deposit are all open for general business.
     </p>
     <p>
      In marketable investment securities, but in no event shall the total amount of those securities of any one (1) maker or obligor exceed five percent (5%) of the savings bank’s total capital, nor shall the aggregate amount of investments under this section exceed fifteen percent (15%) of total capital. As used in this section, the term “marketable investment securities” does not include stock, but means investment grade marketable obligations evidencing indebtedness of any person in the form of bonds, notes or debentures commonly known as investment securities, and of a type customarily sold on recognized exchanges or traded over the counter. As used in this section, the term “investment grade” means being rated in one (1) of the two (2) highest categories by at least two (2) nationally recognized investment rating services. As used in this section, the term “person” means an individual corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, estate or unincorporated association.

     <p>
      Loans aggregating fifteen percent (15%) of the unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus may be made by any state savings bank to any director or executive officer thereof, as defined in Regulation O promulgated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, less existing direct and indirect liabilities thereto, upon affirmative approval of a majority of all directors spread on the minutes of a directors’ meeting held before such loan is made, provided, such loan is made on substantially the same terms and conditions extended to other borrowers for comparable transactions. Any state savings bank may lend to any such director or executive officer thereof, upon affirmative approval of a majority of all directors spread on the minutes of a directors’ meeting held before such loan is made, not more than twenty percent (20%) of the unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus of the savings bank, less the amount of existing direct and indirect liabilities, when se cured; or when the portion thereof in excess of any amount loaned under the first provision hereof is secured by obligations of the United States government, the State of Mississippi, and the levee districts, counties, road districts, school districts, and municipalities of the State of Mississippi, obligations of any other state of the United States and other bonds of recognized character and standing, which are the subject of daily newspaper market quotations, provided such loan shall not exceed eighty percent (80%) of the market or par value (whichever is less) of the bonds or obligations offered as security. Any state savings bank may lend to any executive officer or director thereof upon affirmative approval of a majority of all directors spread on the minutes of a directors’ meeting held before such loan is made, such amount as is safe and proper, when secured by warehouse receipts or shippers’ order bills of lading representing actual existing values, provided the amount loaned shall not exceed eighty percent (80%) of the market value of the commodities representing the actual existing values, and loans of this nature shall be made payable on demand so that the security held therefor may be sold on any date and the proceeds thereof applied to the payment of the loan. However, a savings bank’s board of directors may, as shown in its minutes, give to a savings bank officer the authority to make secured or unsecured loans to an executive officer or director of such savings bank, without receiving the board’s prior approval, in an amount that, when aggregated with the amount of all other extensions of credit to that person and to all related interests of that person, does not exceed the greater of Twenty-five Thousand Dollars ($25,000.00) or five percent (5%) of the savings bank’s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus. However, no state savings bank shall extend credit to any director or executive officer thereof, in an amount that, when aggregated with all other extensions of credit to that person and to all related interests of that person, exceeds Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000.00) without documented prior affirmative approval of a majority of its directors.
     </p>
     <p>
      Loans and discounts by a state savings bank to a director or executive officer thereof secured in full by funds on deposit in time or savings accounts with the lending savings bank to the credit of the borrower shall not be restricted to the fifteen percent (15%) or twenty percent (20%) limitations herein prescribed.
     </p>
     <p>
      The limitations of this section shall not apply where an executive officer or director shall bona fide purchase from the savings bank at a reasonable price real or personal property acquired by the savings bank in payment of debts due the savings bank, provided such transactions are approved by a majority of the board of directors, such approval to be shown in their minutes; and, in cases where loans are made by branch offices, the sum total of loans made by any branch or branches and its parent savings bank to such executive officer or director shall be computed as against the total capital stock and surplus of the parent savings bank and its branch or branches. Loans heretofore made to executive officers or directors may be renewed or extended if in accord with sound banking practice.

     <p>
      Like demand shall be made and suit brought by the receiver of any savings bank in liquidation. Provided, however, this section shall not apply to loans to the State of Mississippi, or to any political subdivision thereof, nor to any levee district.

The money due under such accounts may be paid to, or on the order of, any one of such persons during his lifetime or to, or on the order of, any one of the survivors of such persons. The opening of the account in such form shall be conclusive evidence with regard to the liability of the savings bank of the intention of all of the parties to the account to vest title to money due under the account and the additions thereto in such survivor or survivors. By written instructions given to the savings bank by all parties to the account, the signatures of more than one (1) of such persons during their lifetime, or of more than one (1) of the survivors after the death of any one of them, may be required for withdrawal, in which case the savings bank shall pay the money in the account only in accordance with such instructions. However, no such instructions shall limit the right of the survivor or survivors to receive the money in the account. By written agreement with the savings bank, any person may create a joint account with other persons as joint tenants with the right of survivorship and such agreement may be signed only by the persons creating the account.

Any such pledge, hypothecation or assignment, or any increase to, or withdrawal from, the account shall not destroy the joint tenancy with the right of survivorship.

       § 81-14-361.
    Accounts of administrators, executors, guardians, trustees and other fiduciaries.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Any savings bank may accept accounts in the name of any administrator, executor, guardian, trustee or other fiduciary in trust for a named beneficiary or beneficiaries. Such fiduciary shall have the authority to vote as a member of the savings bank as if any membership account were held absolutely, and to make payments upon, and withdraw from, any such account in whole or in part. The withdrawal value of any such account, or other rights relating thereto, may be paid or delivered, in whole or in part, to such fiduciary without regard to any notice as long as such fiduciary is living. The payment or delivery to any such fiduciary or a receipt of acquittance signed by any such fiduciary to whom any such payment or any such delivery or rights is made shall be valid and sufficient release and discharge of any savings bank for the payment or delivery so made. Whenever a person holding an account in a fiduciary capacity dies and no written notice of the revocation or termination of the trust relationship has been given to a savings bank and the savings bank has no notice of any other disposition of the trust estate, the withdrawal value of such account, or other rights relating thereto, may at the option of a savings bank be paid or delivered, in whole or in part, to the beneficiary or beneficiaries of such trust. Whenever an account is opened by any person describing himself as trustee for another and there is no further notice of the existence and terms of a legal and valid trust, then such description shall be given in writing to such savings bank. In the event of the death of the person so described as trustee, the withdrawal value of such account, or any part thereof, may be paid to the person for whom the account was thus stated to have been opened. Such account, and all additions thereto, shall be the property of such person, unless prior to payment the trust agreement is presented to the savings bank showing a contrary interest. When made in accord with this section, the payment or delivery to any such beneficiary, beneficiaries or designated person, or a receipt or acquittance signed by any such beneficiary, beneficiaries or designated person for any such payment or delivery shall be a valid and sufficient release and discharge of a savings bank for the payment or delivery so made. Trust accounts permitted by this chapter shall not be required to be acknowledged and recorded. When an account is opened in a form described in this section, the right set forth in Section 81-14-363 shall apply. No savings bank paying any beneficiary in accordance with the provisions of this section shall thereby be liable for any estate, inheritance or succession taxes which may be owed to this state.

       An account in a savings bank may be opened by any person or persons with directions to make such account payable upon his or their death to the named beneficiary or beneficiaries. When an account is so opened, the savings bank shall pay any money to the person or persons opening such account during his or their lifetime in the same manner as if the account were in the sole name or names of such person or persons.

Such payment by the savings bank shall be valid, notwithstanding any lack of legal age of the named beneficiary or beneficiaries. However, where such an account is opened or subsequently held by more than one (1) person, the death of one (1) of such persons shall not terminate the account and the account shall continue as to the surviving person or persons and the named beneficiary or beneficiaries subject to the provisions of subsection (3).

     </h3>
     <ol>
      <li id="t81c14s81-14-367ol11">
       A savings bank shall have a right of setoff, without further agreement or pledge, upon all deposit accounts owned by any member or customer to whom or upon whose behalf the savings bank has made an unsecured advance of money by loans. Upon default in the repayment of satisfaction thereof, the savings bank may cancel on its books all or any part of the deposit accounts owned by such member or customer and apply the value of such accounts in payment of such obligation.
      </li>
      <li id="t81c14s81-14-367ol12">
       A savings bank which exercises the right of setoff provided in this section shall first give a thirty-day notice to the member or customer that such right will be exercised. Such accounts may be held or frozen, with no withdrawals permitted, during the thirty-day notice period. Such accounts may not be canceled and the value thereof may not be applied to pay such obligation until the thirty-day period has expired without the member or customer having cured the default on the obligation. The amount of any member’s or customer’s interest in a joint account or other account held in the names of more than one (1) person shall be subject to the right of setoff provided in this section.
      </li>
      <li id="t81c14s81-14-367ol13">
       If a savings bank shall proceed in good faith as provided in this section, but it is later determined that the savings bank was not entitled to have held or set off funds, then the savings bank’s sole obligation shall be to return the funds to the member’s or customer’s account, together with interest at the rate that would have applied if the account had not been held or set off. The savings bank shall not otherwise be liable for any costs or damages. This section is not exclusive, but shall be in addition to contract, common law and other rights of setoff. Such other rights shall not be governed in any fashion by this section.

     <p>
      A savings bank and any federal savings bank may issue savings accounts to any minor or other person under disability as the sole and absolute owner of such savings account. Such savings bank may receive payments by or for such owner, pay withdrawals, accept pledges to the savings bank, and act in any other manner with respect to such account on the written instruction of such savings account holder in accord with this chapter. Any payment or delivery of rights to any minor or other person under a disability, or a receipt or acquittance signed by a minor or other person under a disability, who holds a savings account, shall be a valid and sufficient release of such savings bank for any payment so made or delivery of rights to such minor or person. The receipt, acquittance, pledge or other action required by the savings bank to be taken by such minor or person shall be binding upon such minor or person as if he were of full age and legal capacity. The parent or guardian of such minor or person shall not in his capacity as parent or guardian have the power to attach or to transfer any savings account issued to, or in the name of, such minor or person; provided, however, that in the event of the death of such minor or person, the receipt or acquittance of either parent, a person standing in loco parentis, guardian or conservator of such minor or person shall be a valid and sufficient discharge of such savings bank for any sum not exceeding One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00), unless the minor or person has given written notice to the savings bank not to accept the signature of such person.

      <p>
       The 1999 amendment substituted “calculated pro rata unless otherwise required by law” for “calculated on the rule of the sum of the digits commonly known as the Rule of 78ths” in (1).
      </p>
      <p>
       The 2006 amendment, in (1), inserted “to the premium finance company as soon as reasonably possible” following “the insurer shall return,” and deleted “calculated pro rata unless otherwise required by law directly to the premium finance company for the account of the insured or insureds as soon as reasonably possible but in no event later than thirty (30) days after the effective date of cancellation” at the end.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 2010 amendment, in (1), added “and also shall furnish . . ./i summary of the computation of the return premium” at the end; and made minor stylistic changes in (2) and (3).

       Licensure and relicensure.No person or entity may act as a debt management service provider with respect to consumers who are residents of this state without a license issued under this chapter. The license application must be in a form prescribed by the commissioner. The commissioner may refuse the application if it contains erroneous or incomplete information. A license may not be issued unless the commissioner, upon investigation, finds that the financial soundness and responsibility, insurance coverage, consumer education programs and services component, character and fitness of the applicant and, when applicable, its partners, officers or directors, warrant belief that the business will be operated honestly and fairly within the purposes of this chapter. Each license shall remain in full force and effect until relinquished, suspended, revoked or expired. With each initial application for a license, the applicant shall pay to the commissioner a license fee of Seven Hundred Fifty Dollars ($750.00), and on or before December 31 of each year thereafter, an annual renewal fee of Four Hundred Seventy-five Dollars ($475.00). If the annual renewal fee remains unpaid after December 31, the license shall expire. If any person engages in business as provided for in this chapter without paying the license fee provided for in this subsection before beginning business or before the expiration of the person’s current license, as the case may be, then the person shall be liable for the full amount of the license fee, plus a penalty in an amount not to exceed Twenty-five Dollars ($25.00) for each day that the person has engaged in such business without a license or after the expiration of a license. All licensing fees and penalties shall be paid into the Consumer Finance Fund of the department.

A request for a hearing may not be made more than sixty (60) days after the application was accepted as complete or the commissioner has mailed a written notice to the applicant stating that the application has been denied and stating the reasons for the denial of the application.

     </p>
     <p>
      To authorize banking activities and operations, under Mississippi licenses issued by the commissioner, of branch and agency offices in the State of Mississippi of foreign banks, generally under terms and conditions not less favorable than the terms and conditions under which such activities and operations may be conducted by federal branch or agency offices of foreign banks in the United States, and to set forth a statutory framework for the licensing, regulation and supervision of such Mississippi-licensed offices of foreign banks by the commissioner to assure the safe and sound operation of such offices that are licensed under the laws of the State of Mississippi; and
     </p>
     <p>
      To authorize representative offices in the State of Mississippi of foreign banks, and to set forth statutory provisions governing the licensing and supervision of such offices by the commissioner.

       If the commissioner finds that any of the factors set forth in Section 81-25-167 are true with respect to any foreign bank which is licensed to establish and maintain a Mississippi state branch or Mississippi state agency and that it is necessary for the protection of the interests of the creditors of such foreign bank’s business in the State of Mississippi or for the protection of the public interest that he or she take immediate possession of the property and business of the foreign bank, the commissioner may by order forthwith take possession of the property and business of the foreign bank in the State of Mississippi and retain possession until the foreign bank resumes business in the State of Mississippi or is finally liquidated. The foreign bank may, with the consent of the commissioner resume business in the State of Mississippi upon such conditions as the commissioner may prescribe by regulation or order.

The court may, upon good cause being shown, direct the commissioner to refrain from further proceedings and to surrender such possession. The judgment of the court may be appealed by the commissioner or by the foreign bank in the manner provided by law for appeals from a judgment of Chancery Court of the State of Mississippi. Where the commissioner appeals the judgment of the court, such appeal shall operate as a stay of the judgment and a reinstatement of the commissioner’s possession. The commissioner shall not be required to post any bond.

However, in case the foreign bank has an office in another state of the United States which is in liquidation and the assets of such office appear to be insufficient to pay in full the creditors of that office, the court shall order the commissioner to transfer to the liquidator of that office such amount of any such remaining assets as appears to be necessary to cover such insufficiency; if there are two (2) or more such offices and the amount of remaining assets is less than the aggregate amount of insufficiencies with respect to the offices, the court shall order the commissioner to distribute the remaining assets among the liquidators of such offices in such manner as the court finds equitable.

     <p>
      To the extent consistent with subsection (c) of this section, the commissioner may make such examinations of any office established and maintained in this state pursuant to this article by an out-of-state trust institution as the commissioner may deem necessary to determine whether the office is being operated in compliance with the laws of this state and in accordance with safe and sound banking practices. The provisions of Sections 81-1-81, 81-1-83 and 81-23-17 shall apply to such examinations.
     </p>
     <p>
      The commissioner may require periodic reports regarding any out-of-state trust institution that has established and maintained an office in this state pursuant to this article. The required reports shall be provided by such trust institution or by the home state regulator. Any reporting requirements prescribed by the commissioner under this subsection (b) shall be (i) consistent with the reporting requirements applicable to state trust companies and (ii) appropriate for the purpose of enabling the commissioner to carry out his or her responsibilities under this article.
     </p>
     <p>
      The commissioner may enter into cooperative, coordinating and information-sharing agreements with any other bank supervisory agencies or any organization affiliated with or representing one or more bank supervisory agencies with respect to the periodic examination or other supervision of any office in this state of an out-of-state trust institution, or any office of a state trust institution in any host state, and the commissioner may accept such a party’s report of examination and report of investigation in lieu of conducting his or her own examination or investigation.
     </p>
     <p>
      The commissioner may enter into contracts with any bank supervisory agency that has concurrent jurisdiction over a state trust institution or an out-of-state trust institution maintaining an office in this state to engage the services of such agency’s examiners at a reasonable rate of compensation, or to provide the services of the commissioner’s examiners to such agency at a reasonable rate of compensation.
     </p>
     <p>
      The commissioner may enter into joint examinations or joint enforcement actions with other bank supervisory agencies having concurrent jurisdiction over any office established and maintained in this state by an out-of-state trust institution or any office established and maintained by a state trust institution in any host state. However, the commissioner may at any time take such actions independently if the commissioner deems such actions to be necessary or appropriate to carry out his or her responsibilities under this subarticle or to ensure compliance with the laws of this state; but in the case of an out-of-state trust institution, the commissioner shall recognize the exclusive authority of the home state regulator over corporate governance matters and the primary responsibility of the home state regulator with respect to safety and soundness matters.
     </p>
     <p>
      Each out-of-state trust institution that maintains one or more offices in this state may be assessed and, if assessed, shall pay supervisory and examination fees in accordance with the laws of this state and regulations of the commissioner. Such fees may be shared with other bank supervisory agencies or any organization affiliated with or representing one or more bank supervisory agencies in accordance with agreements between such parties and the commissioner.

       That a company is engaged in an unauthorized trust activity.

     </ol>

      The commissioner may determine by order that an out-of-state trust institution engaging in or proposing to engage in a trust business in this state does not meet the requirements for establishing a representative trust office in this state pursuant to Section 81-27-2.202, which order shall be effective on the date of issuance or such other date as the commissioner shall determine;
     </p>
     <p>
      In cases involving extraordinary circumstances requiring immediate action, the commissioner may take any action permitted by Section 81-27-2.302(a) or (b) without notice or opportunity for hearing, but shall promptly afford a subsequent hearing upon an application to rescind the action taken. The commissioner shall promptly give notice to the home state regulator of each enforcement action taken against an out-of-state trust institution and, to the extent practicable, shall consult and cooperate with the home state regulator in pursuing and resolving said enforcement action.

    Purchase of assets of another trust institution.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Subject to the provisions of this section, a trust institution may purchase assets of a state trust company or trust-related assets of another trust institution, including the right to control accounts established with the trust institution. Except as otherwise expressly provided by this section or another statute, the purchase of all or part of the assets of the trust institution does not make the purchasing trust institution responsible for any liability or obligation of the selling trust institution that the purchasing trust institution does not expressly assume. Except as otherwise provided by this chapter, this subarticle does not govern or prohibit the purchase by a state trust institution of all or part of the assets of a corporation or other entity that is not a trust institution.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the acquiring institution is a state bank, a state trust company, an out-of-state trust institution which maintains neither a branch nor a trust office in this state, or a savings association chartered under the laws of this state, an application in the form required by the commissioner must be filed with the commissioner for any acquisition of all or substantially all of (i) the assets of a state trust company or (ii) the trust assets of another trust institution. The commissioner shall investigate the condition of the purchaser and seller and may require the submission of additional information as considered necessary to make an informed decision. The commissioner shall approve the purchase if:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t81c27s81-27-3.401ol11">
       The acquiring trust institution will be solvent and have sufficient capitalization for its business and location;
      </li>
      <li id="t81c27s81-27-3.401ol12">
       The acquiring trust institution has complied with all applicable statutes and rules including without limitation any applicable requirements of Article 3 of this chapter;
      </li>
      <li id="t81c27s81-27-3.401ol13">
       All fiduciary obligations and liabilities of the parties have been properly discharged or otherwise assumed by the acquiring trust institution;
      </li>
      <li id="t81c27s81-27-3.401ol14">
       All conditions imposed by the commissioner have been satisfied or otherwise resolved; and
      </li>
      <li id="t81c27s81-27-3.401ol15">
       All fees and costs have been paid.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      A purchase requiring an application pursuant to Section 81-27-3.401(b) is effective on the date of approval, unless the purchase agreement provides for, and the commissioner consents to, a different effective date.
     </p>
     <p>
      The acquiring trust institution shall succeed by operation of law to all of the rights, privileges and obligations of the selling trust institution under each account included in the assets acquired.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Before any trust company may be organized and formed, the prospective incorporators shall give notice to the commissioner of their desire to engage in trust activities and apply for a certificate of authority to incorporate, and shall at the time file with the commissioner a copy of the proposed articles of incorporation, duly sworn to by one (1) of the prospective incorporators. The commissioner shall promptly give consideration to the application and make an examination of the proposed articles of incorporation to determine if they meet all requirements of law. The commissioner shall then make an investigation to determine if the necessity and other factors mentioned in Article 4 of this chapter requires that the proposed new trust company should be chartered and permitted to operate.
     </p>
     <p>
      When the commissioner has completed the examination and made his investigation, he shall record his findings in writing and shall draw up his recommendations to the State Board of Banking Review, established in Section 81-3-12. At the request of the chairman, he shall thereupon, in writing, call a meeting of the board to give consideration to his findings and recommendations, such call to be issued at least ten (10) days in advance of the meeting. Such meetings shall be held within one hundred twenty (120) days from the date on which the prospective incorporators gave notice to the commissioner of their desire to engage in trust activities, applied for a certificate of authority to incorporate, and filed with the commissioner a copy of the proposed articles of incorporation. The commissioner shall at the same time give notice of the meeting of the board to the prospective incorporators of the proposed new trust company and to any and all other interested persons and shall extend to them an invitation to be heard in writing or in person by the board.
     </p>
     <p>
      The board, at its meeting, shall consider the findings and recommendations of the commissioner and shall hear such oral testimony as he may wish to give, and shall also receive information and hear testimony from the prospective organizers of the proposed new trust company and from any and all other interested persons bearing upon the public necessity for the organization and operation of the new trust company.
     </p>
     <p>
      After considering the record submitted to it by the commissioner and his oral testimony and considering such other information and evidence, either written or oral, which has come before it, the board shall decide if it has before it sufficient information and evidence upon which it can dispose of the application to form the new trust company. If it is determined that evidence and information is not sufficient, then the board shall order the commissioner to secure such additional information and evidence as it may prescribe or shall request from the prospective incorporators and from other interested persons. The board shall thereupon set a date for a future meeting to be held before the expiration of the aforementioned one-hundred-twenty-day time limit and shall give to the prospective incorporators and other interested persons notice of such meeting, and shall recess the meeting then being held until such future date. The board shall have and is vested with the power to compel attendance of witnesses just as is the commissioner or examiner as provided for in Section 81-1-85, and all testimony given before the board shall be taken down and transcribed by a stenographer in the manner prescribed in Section 81-1-87.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the board, or a majority thereof, determines that it has before it sufficient evidence and information upon which to base a decision, then it shall render a written opinion and decision in the matter within sixty (60) days after the conclusion of the final board hearing. If its decision is favorable, then the board shall order the commissioner to give to such prospective incorporators a certificate under his hand and official seal of the Department of Banking and Consumer Finance authorizing the prospective incorporators to proceed to incorporate and organize as is provided in Section 81-27-4.102.
     </p>
     <p>
      When a certificate of incorporation is sought in order to effect the acquisition of an insolvent trust company any constraints of time imposed by this subsection shall not apply if the commissioner determines that an emergency exists which requires expedition of the procedure for granting a certificate in order to protect the interests of the public and the interests of the clients of the insolvent trust company.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the decision of the board, or a majority thereof, is unfavorable to the organization of the proposed new trust company, it shall render a written opinion and decision giving its reason for rejection within sixty (60) days after the conclusion of the final board hearing in the matter, and the commissioner shall so advise the prospective incorporators, giving them a copy of the written decision and opinion of the board. If the prospective incorporators are aggrieved at the unfavorable decision of the board in denying a certificate authorizing them to proceed with the incorporation of the proposed new trust company and the organization thereof, they shall have the right of appeal to the chancery court of the county in which the proposed trust company is to be located, which appeal shall be taken and perfected within sixty (60) days from the date of the denial of such certificate. The denial of the certificate by the board shall be construed as a judicial finding and appealable as such. All such appeals shall be taken, perfected, heard and determined either in termtime or vacation, and such appeals shall be heard and disposed of promptly by the court. Appeals from the board shall be taken and perfected by the filing of a bond in the sum of Two Hundred Fifty Dollars ($250.00), with two (2) sureties, or with a surety company qualified to do business in Mississippi as surety, conditioned to pay the costs of the appeal, the bond to be approved by the clerk of the chancery court, and such bond shall be payable to the state and may be enforced in its name as other judicial bonds filed in the chancery court, and judgment may be entered upon such bonds and process and execution shall issue upon such judgments as provided by law in other cases. Appeals may be taken from the chancery court to the Supreme Court in the manner provided by law. Upon approval of the bond by the clerk of the chancery court the clerk shall give notice to the commissioner of the appeal from the decision of the board, and it thereupon shall be the duty of the commissioner to promptly transmit to the clerk of the chancery court in which the appeal is pending the original or a certified copy of the application, proposed charter of incorporation, and his findings or decision thereon together with the opinion and decision of the board, including a transcript of pleadings and testimony, both oral and documentary, which shall be docketed by the clerk and shall be tried by the court. In perfecting such appeals, the provisions of law respecting notice to reporters and allowance of bills of exception, now or hereafter in force respecting appeals from the chancery court to the Supreme Court shall be applicable thereto. If the prospective incorporators of the proposed new trust company prevail, a decree shall be entered requiring the issuance by the commissioner of the certificate authorizing applicants to incorporate and organize in the same manner as if the application therefor had been approved by the board, and the costs therein incurred shall be paid by the commissioner out of the maintenance fund of the Department of Banking and Consumer Finance. However, if the action of the board is affirmed by the court, a decree shall be entered to that effect taxing costs of the proceedings to the applicants. The commissioner or the applicants shall have the right of appeal from the decision of the chancery court. During the time the cause is pending in the office of the commissioner or before the board or the court, the commissioner shall not issue a certificate to a subsequent applicant to incorporate and organize a new trust company or authorize any trust company then existing to establish a branch within the area in which the proposed new trust company is to be domiciled, and neither shall he consent to the removal of the domicile of an existing trust company from another place into the area where the proposed new trust company will be domiciled. A cause shall not be considered as pending in the office of the commissioner or before the board if the prospective incorporators or their representative have only given notice to the commissioner of their desire to engage in trust activities and apply for a certificate of authority to incorporate, but have not filed with the commissioner a copy of the proposed articles of incorporation and other documents required by statute or administrative regulation.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the decision of the board, or a majority thereof, is favorable to the organization of the proposed trust company, it shall in like manner as above render a written opinion and decision within sixty (60) days after the conclusion of the final board hearing on the matter, and an appeal in the manner herein set forth shall be available to any interested organizations, person or persons who have participated in the proceedings and feel aggrieved by the decision of the board.
     </p>
     <p>
      When a trust company has been incorporated and the capital stock thereof has been paid in full, the incorporators shall notify the commissioner of such fact, whereupon the commissioner himself or through an examiner shall make a special examination of the proposed new trust company and, finding the capital stock to have been paid in full, he shall under his hand and seal of the Department of Banking and Consumer Finance issue to the trust company a certificate authorizing it to commence business, and when such business has been commenced the trust company shall notify the commissioner to that effect. Upon completion of such special examination, the trust company shall pay to the Department of Banking and Consumer Finance as an assessment an amount sufficient to reimburse for the actual costs and expenses incurred during such special examination. The commissioner or examiner shall give a receipt therefor in duplicate, and the assessment shall be turned over by the Department of Banking and Consumer Finance to the State Treasurer for credit to the maintenance fund of the Department of Banking and Consumer Finance. The proposed new trust company shall not transact any business except as is necessarily preliminary to its incorporation and organization until it has been authorized by the commissioner to begin business. However, if the board rejects any application for a certificate to incorporate and organize, all costs incurred by the board in making a survey or holding a hearing on such application shall be borne by the petitioners.
     </p>
     <p>
      Notwithstanding the foregoing and any other provision of law to the contrary, if a trust company has not been established and is not in operation within two (2) years from the date of the certificate to incorporate and organize such trust company or within two (2) years from the date upon which any appellate litigation with respect to such certificate has been concluded, the certificate shall expire. However, the State Board of Banking Review for good cause shown may extend the two-year period for not more than two (2) times for periods not exceeding six (6) months each. This provision shall in no way affect certificates issued before July 1, 1998.

     <p>
      A state trust company that has been granted a charter under Section 81-27-4.105 or a predecessor statute may amend or restate its articles of association for any lawful purpose, including the creation of authorized but unissued shares or participation shares in one or more classes or series.
     </p>
     <p>
      An amendment authorizing the issuance of shares or participation shares in series must contain:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t81c27s81-27-4.201ol11">
       The designation of each series and of any variations in the preferences, limitations, and relative rights among series to the extent that the preferences, limitations, and relative rights are to be established in the articles of association; and

       A statement of any authority to be vested in the board to establish series and determine the preferences, limitations, and relative rights of each series.

       Deliver a certified copy of the amendment or restatement to the state trust company.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      A limited liability trust company may not amend its articles of association to extend its period of existence for a perpetual period or for any period of years, unless the period of existence is expressly contingent on those events resulting in dissolution of the limited liability trust company under subarticle B of Article 8 of this chapter.
     </p>
     <p>
      Amendment or restatement of the articles of association of a state trust company and approval of the board and shareholders or participants must be made or obtained in accordance with provisions of the Mississippi Business Corporation Act for the amendment or restatement of articles of incorporation except as otherwise provided by this chapter or rules or regulations adopted under this chapter. The original and one (1) copy of the articles of amendment or restated articles of association must be filed with the commissioner for approval. Unless the submission presents novel or unusual questions, the commissioner shall approve or reject the amendment or restatement not later than the thirty-first day after the date the commissioner considers the submission informationally complete and accepted for filing. The commissioner may require the submission of additional information as considered necessary to an informed decision to approve or reject any amendment or restatement or articles of association under this section.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the commissioner thinks that the amendment or restatement conforms to law and any conditions imposed by the commissioner, and any required filing fee has been paid, the commissioner shall:

     </p>
     <p>

     </p>

      A series of shares or participation shares may be established in the manner provided by the provisions of the Mississippi Business Corporation Act as if the state trust company were a domestic corporation, but the shares or participation shares of the series may not be issued and sold except upon compliance with this section.

     <p>
      To maintain status as an exempt private trust company under this chapter, the private trust company shall comply with the following:
     </p>
     <p>
      An exempt private trust company shall not transact business with the public.
     </p>
     <p>
      An exempt private trust company shall file an annual certification that it is maintaining the conditions and limitations of its exempt status. This annual certification shall be filed on a form provided by the commissioner and be accompanied by a fee determined by the commissioner. The annual certification shall be filed on or before June 30 of each year. No annual certification shall be valid unless it bears an acknowledgment stamped by the department. The department shall have thirty (30) days from the date of receipt to return a copy of the acknowledged annual certification to the private trust company. The burden shall be on the exempt private trust company to notify the department of any failure to return an acknowledged copy of any annual certification within the thirty-day period. The commissioner may examine or investigate the private state trust company periodically as necessary to verify the certification.
     </p>
     <p>
      An exempt private trust company shall comply with the principal office provisions of Section 81-27-2.003 and with the address and telephone requirements of subsection (a)(1)(E) of this section.

     </p>
     <p>
      Change of control. Control of an exempt private trust company may not be transferred or sold with exempt status. In any change of control, the acquiring control person must comply with the provisions of this chapter and the exempt status of the private trust company shall automatically terminate upon the effective date of the transfer. A separate application for exempt status must be filed if the acquiring person wishes to obtain or continue an exemption pursuant to this section.
     </p>
     <p>
      Authority to revoke. The commissioner shall have authority to revoke the exempt status of a private trust company in the following circumstances:
     </p>
     <p>
      The exempt private trust company makes a false statement under oath on any document required to be filed by the chapter or by any rule or regulation promulgated by the commissioner; or
     </p>
     <p>
      The exempt private trust company fails to submit to an examination as required by Section 81-27-2.003; or
     </p>
     <p>
      Notification of revocation of exemption. If the commissioner determines from examination or other credible evidence that an exempt private trust company has violated any of the requirements of this section, the commissioner may by personal delivery or registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, notify the exempt private trust company in writing that the private trust company’s exempt status has been revoked. The notification must state grounds for the revocation with reasonable certainty. The notice must state its effective date, which may not be before the fifth day after the date the notification is mailed or delivered. The revocation takes effect for the private trust company if the private trust company does not request a hearing in writing before the effective date. After taking effect the revocation is final and nonappealable as to that private trust company, and the private trust company shall be subject to all of the requirements and provisions of the act applicable to nonexempt state trust companies.
     </p>
     <p>
      Compliance period. A private trust company shall have five (5) calendar days after the revocation is effective to comply with the provisions of this chapter from which it was formerly exempt. If, however, the commissioner determines, at the time of revocation, that the private trust company has been engaging in or attempting to engage in acts intended or designed to deceive or defraud the public, the commissioner may shorten or eliminate, in the commissioner’s sole discretion, the five (5) calendar days compliance period.
     </p>
     <p>
      Remedies for failure to comply. If the private trust company does not comply with all of the provisions of this chapter, including such capitalization requirements as have been determined by the commissioner as necessary to assure the safety and soundness of the private trust company, within the prescribed time period, the commissioner may:
     </p>
     <p>
      Institute any action or remedy prescribed by this chapter, or any applicable rule or regulation, or
     </p>
     <p>
      Refer the private trust company to the Attorney General for institution of a quo warranto proceeding to revoke the charter.
     </p>
     <p>
      Private trust company under prior law. A private trust company that currently has a valid exemption under a predecessor statute is considered exempt under this chapter.

     <p>
      A private trust company may terminate its status as a private trust company and commence transacting business with the general public. A private trust company desiring to commence transacting business with the general public shall file a notice on a form prescribed by the commissioner, which shall set forth the name of the private trust company and an acknowledgement that any exemption granted or otherwise applicable to the private trust company pursuant to Section 81-27-4.301 shall cease to apply on the effective date of such notice, furnish a copy of the resolution adopted by the board authorizing the private trust company to commence transacting business with the general public, and pay the filing fee, if any, prescribed by the commissioner.
     </p>
     <p>
      The notificant may commence transacting business with the general public on the thirty-first day after the date the commissioner receives the notice, unless the commissioner specifies an earlier or later date.
     </p>
     <p>
      The thirty-day period of review may be extended by the commissioner on determination that the written notice raises issues that require additional information or additional time for analysis. If the period for review is extended, the notificant may commence transacting business with the public only on prior written approval by the commissioner.
     </p>
     <p>
      The commissioner may deny approval of the notice of the private trust company to commence transacting business with the general public if the commissioner finds that the notificant lacks sufficient financial resources to undertake the proposed expansion without adversely affecting its safety or soundness or that the proposed transacting of business of the general public would be contrary to the public interest or if the commissioner determines that the notificant will not within a reasonable period be in compliance with any provision of this chapter from which the notificant had been previously exempted pursuant to Section 81-27-4.301.

      In this subarticle, “state trust company facility” means real estate, including an improvement, owned, or leased to the extent the lease or the leasehold improvements are capitalized, by a state trust company for the purpose of:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t81c27s81-27-5.001ol11">
       Providing space for state trust company employees to perform their duties and space for parking by state trust company employees and customers;

       Conducting trust business, including meeting the reasonable needs and convenience of the state trust company’s customers, computer operations, document and other item processing, maintenance and record retention and storage;

       Conducting another activity authorized by rules or regulations adopted under this chapter.

     </ol>
     <p>
      Without the prior written approval of the commissioner, a state trust company may not directly or indirectly invest an amount in excess of its restricted capital in state trust company facilities, furniture, fixtures, and equipment. Except as otherwise provided by rules or regulations adopted under this chapter, in computing this limitation a state trust company:
     </p>
     <p>
      Shall include:
     </p>
     <p>
      Its direct investment in state trust company facilities;
     </p>
     <p>
      Any investment in equity or investment securities of a company holding title to a facility used by the state trust company for the purposes specified by subsection (a) of this section;
     </p>
     <p>
      Any loan made by the state trust company to or on the security of equity or investment securities issued by a company holding title to a facility used by the state trust company; and
     </p>
     <p>
      Any indebtedness incurred on state trust company facilities by a company:
     </p>
     <p>
      That holds title to the facility;
     </p>
     <p>
      That is an affiliate of the state trust company; and
     </p>
     <p>
      In which the state trust company is invested in the manner described by subparagraph (B) or (C) of this paragraph (1); and
     </p>
     <p>
      May exclude an amount included under paragraphs (1)(B) through (D) of this subsection to the extent any lease of a facility from the company holding title to the facility is capitalized on the books of the state trust company.
     </p>
     <p>
      Real estate acquired under subsection (a)(3) of this section and not improved and occupied by the state trust company ceases to be a state trust company facility on the third anniversary of the date of its acquisition, unless the commissioner on application grants written approval to further delay in the improvement and occupation of the property by the state trust company.
     </p>
     <p>
      A state trust company shall comply with generally accepted accounting principles, consistently applied, in accounting for its investment in and depreciation of state trust company facilities, furniture, fixtures, and equipment.

    Subsidiaries.

     <p>
      Except as otherwise provided by this article or rules or regulations adopted under this article, a state trust company may acquire or establish a subsidiary to conduct any activity that may lawfully be conducted through the form of organization chosen for the subsidiary.
     </p>
     <p>
      A state trust company may not invest more than an amount equal to fifteen percent (15%) of its capital in a single subsidiary and may not invest an amount in excess of its restricted capital in all subsidiaries. The amount of a state trust company’s investment in a subsidiary is the total amount of the state trust company’s investment in equity or investment securities issued by its subsidiary and any loans and extensions of credit from the state trust company to its subsidiary. The commissioner may authorize investments in excess of these limitations on written application if the commissioner concludes that:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t81c27s81-27-5.103ol11">

       The safety and soundness of the requesting state trust company is not adversely affected.

     <p>
      A state trust company that intends to acquire, establish, or perform new activities through a subsidiary shall submit a letter to the commissioner describing in detail the proposed activities of the subsidiary.
     </p>
     <p>
      The state trust company may acquire or establish a subsidiary or begin performing new activities in an existing subsidiary on the thirty-first day after the date the commissioner receives the state trust company’s letter, unless the commissioner specifies an earlier or later date. The commissioner may extend the thirty-day period of review on a determination that the state trust company’s letter raises issues that require additional information or additional time for analysis. If the period of review is extended, the state trust company may acquire or establish the subsidiary, or perform new activities in an existing subsidiary, only on prior written approval of the commissioner.
     </p>
     <p>
      A subsidiary of a state trust company is subject to regulation by the commissioner to the extent provided by this article or rules or regulations adopted under this article. In the absence of limiting rules or regulations, the commissioner may regulate a subsidiary as if it were a state trust company.

      A state trust company may invest for its own account in equity securities of an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 USCS Section 80a-1 et seq.) and the Securities Act of 1933 (15 USCS Section 77a et seq.) if the portfolio of the investment company consists wholly of investments in which the state trust company could invest directly for its own account.

     <p>
      If the portfolio of an investment company described in subsection (a) of this section consists wholly of investments in which the state trust company could invest directly without limitation under Section 81-27-5.101(d), the state trust company may invest in the investment company without limitation.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the portfolio of an investment company described in subsection (a) of this section contains any investment that is subject to the limits of Section 81-27-5.101(c), the state trust company may invest in the investment company not more than an amount equal to fifteen percent (15%) of the state trust company’s capital. This provision does not apply to a money market fund.

     <p>
      The aggregate loans and extensions of credit outstanding at any time to insiders of the state trust company may not exceed an amount equal to fifteen percent (15%) of the state trust company’s capital. All covered transactions between an insider and a state trust company must be engaged in only on terms and under circumstances, including credit standards, that are substantially the same as those for comparable transactions with a noninsider.
     </p>
     <p>
      The commissioner may adopt rules or regulations to administer and carry out this section, including rules to establish limits, requirements, or exemptions other than those specified by this section for particular classes or categories of loans or extensions of credit, and establish collective lending and investment limits.

      The commissioner may determine whether a loan or extension of credit putatively made to a person will be attributed to another person for purposes of this section.

      A state trust company may not lend trust deposits, except that a trustee may make a loan to a beneficiary of the trust if the loan is expressly authorized or directed by the instrument or transaction establishing the trust.
     </p>
     <p>
      An officer, director, manager, managing participant, or employee of a state trust company who approves or participates in the approval of a loan with actual knowledge that the loan violates this section is jointly and severally liable to the state trust company for the lesser of the amount by which the loan exceeded applicable lending limits or the state trust company’s actual loss and remains liable for that amount until the loan and all prior indebtedness of the borrower to the state trust company has been fully repaid. The state trust company may initiate a proceeding to collect an amount due under this subsection at any time before the date the borrower defaults on the subject loan or any prior indebtedness or before the fourth anniversary of that date. A person that is liable for and pays amounts to the state trust company under this subsection is entitled to an assignment of the state trust company’s claim against the borrower to the extent of the payments. For purposes of this subsection, an officer, director, manager, managing participant, or employee of a state trust company is presumed to know the amount of the state trust company’s lending limit under subsection (a) of this section and the amount of the borrower’s aggregate outstanding indebtedness to the state trust company immediately before a new loan or extension of credit to that borrower.

      Subject to rules or regulations adopted under this chapter, a state trust company may become the owner and lessor of tangible personal property for lease financing transactions on a net lease basis on the specific request and for the use of a client. Without the written approval of the commissioner to continue holding property acquired for leasing purposes under this subsection, the state trust company may not hold the property more than six (6) months after the date of expiration of the original or any extended or renewed lease period agreed to by the client for whom the property was acquired or by a subsequent lessee.
     </p>
     <p>
      Rental payments received by the trust company in a lease financing transaction under this section are considered to be rent and not interest or compensation for the use, forbearance, or detention of money. However, a lease financing transaction is considered to be a loan or extension of credit for purposes of Section 81-27-5.201.

     <p>
      The board of a state trust company must consist of not fewer than five (5) or more than twenty-five (25) directors, managers, or managing participants, the majority of whom must be residents of this state. Except for a limited liability trust company in which management has been retained by its participants, the principal executive officer of the state trust company is a member of the board. The principal executive officer acting in the capacity of board member is the board’s presiding officer unless the board elects a different presiding officer to perform the duties as designated by the board.
     </p>
     <p>
      Unless the commissioner consents otherwise in writing, a person may not serve as director, manager, or managing participant of a state trust company if:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t81c27s81-27-6.203ol11">
       The state trust company incurs an unreimbursed loss attributable to a charged-off obligation of or holds a judgment against the person or an entity that was controlled by the person at the time of funding and at the time of default on the loan that gave rise to the judgment or charged-off obligation;
      </li>

     </ol>
     <p>
      If a state trust company other than a limited liability trust company operated by managing participants does not elect directors or managers before the sixty-first day after the date of its regular annual meeting, the commissioner may appoint a conservator under Article 6 of this chapter to operate the state trust company and elect directors or managers, as appropriate. If the conservator is unable to locate or elect persons willing and able to serve as directors or managers, the commissioner may close the state trust company for liquidation.
     </p>
     <p>
      A vacancy on the board that reduces the number of directors, managers, or managing participants to fewer than five (5) must be filed not later than the thirtieth day after the date the vacancy occurs. A limited liability trust company with fewer than five (5) managing participants must add one or more new participants or elect a board of managers of not fewer than five (5) persons to resolve the vacancy. After thirty (30) days after the date the vacancy occurs, the commissioner may appoint a conservator under Article 6 of this chapter to operate the state trust company and elect a board of not fewer than five (5) persons to resolve the vacancy. If the conservator is unable to locate or elect five (5) persons willing and able to serve as directors or managers, the commissioner may close the state trust company for liquidation.
     </p>
     <p>
      Before each term to which a person is elected to serve as a director or manager of a state trust company, or annually for a person who is a managing participant, the person shall submit an affidavit for filing in the minutes of the state trust company stating that the person, to the extent applicable:
     </p>
     <p>
      Accepts the position and is not disqualified from serving in the position;
     </p>
     <p>
      Will not violate or knowingly permit an officer, director, manager, managing participant, or employee of the state trust company to violate any law applicable to the conduct of business of the state trust company; and

      Will diligently perform the duties of the position.

      A full liability participant of a limited liability trust company is liable under a judgment, decree, or order of court for a debt, obligation, or liability of the limited liability trust company that accrued during the participation of the full liability participant in the limited liability trust company and before the full liability participant or a successor in interest files a notice of withdrawal as a full liability participant from the limited liability trust company with the commissioner.

     <p>
      Management of a limited liability trust company is vested in the participants in proportion to each participant’s contribution to capital, as adjusted periodically to properly reflect any additional contribution. The articles of association may provide that management of a limited liability trust company is vested in a board of managers to be elected annually by the participants as prescribed by the bylaws.

      Participants of a limited liability trust company may not retain management and must elect a board of managers if:

     <p>
      The interest of a participant or participant-transferee in a limited liability trust company is the personal estate of the participant or the participant-transferee and may be transferred as provided by the bylaws or the participation agreement. A transferee of a participant’s interest has the status of a participant-transferee and does not by the transfer become a participant or obtain a right to participate in the management of the limited liability trust company. A participant-transferee is entitled to receive only a share of profits, return of contribution, or other distributive benefit in respect to the interest transferred to which the participant who transferred the interest would have been entitled. A participant-transferee may become a participant only as provided by the bylaws or the participation agreement.
     </p>
     <p>
      A limited liability trust company may add additional participants in the same manner as participant-transferees after payment in full of the capital contribution to the limited liability trust company payable for the issuance of additional participation interests.

      The board of a state trust company, with the commissioner’s approval, may cause a state trust company to sell all or substantially all of its assets, including the right to control accounts established with the trust company, without shareholder or participant approval if the commissioner finds:
     </p>

       The sale is in the best interest of the state trust company’s clients and creditors; and

      <li id="t81c27s81-27-6.408ol13">
       The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or its successor approves the transaction unless the deposits of the state trust company are not insured.

       Fees and assessments due the department.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      A sale under this section must include an assumption and promise by the buyer to pay or otherwise discharge:
     </p>
     <p>
      All of the state trust company’s liabilities to clients and depositors;
     </p>
     <p>
      All of the state trust company’s liabilities for salaries of the state trust company’s employees incurred before the date of the sale;
     </p>
     <p>
      Obligations incurred by the commissioner arising out of the supervision or sale of the state trust company; and
     </p>
     <p>
      This section does not limit the incidental power of a state trust company to buy and sell assets in the ordinary course of business.
     </p>
     <p>
      This section does not affect the commissioner’s right to take action under another law. The sale by a trust company of all or substantially all of its assets with shareholder or participant approval is considered a voluntary dissolution and liquidation and is governed by Section 81-5-101.

     <p>
      The commissioner, or his duly authorized representative, for the purpose of discovering violations of this chapter and for the purpose of determining whether companies or offices are subject to the provisions of this article, may examine authorized trust institutions that have a charter, license or registration under this chapter and companies or offices that are reasonably suspected by the commissioner of conducting business that requires a charter, license or registration under this chapter, including all relevant books, records and papers employed by those companies or offices in the transaction of their business, and may summon witnesses and examine them under oath concerning matters relating to the business of those companies or offices, or such other matters as may be relevant to the discovery of violations of this chapter, including without limitation the conduct of business without a charter, license or registration as required under this chapter.

When the commissioner shall approve the voluntary liquidation of a state trust company, the directors of the state trust company shall cause to be published in a newspaper in the county in which the same is located, or if no newspaper is published in such county, then in a newspaper having a general circulation in such county, a notice that the state trust company is closing down its affairs and going into liquidation, and notify its creditors to present their claims for payment. Such notice shall be published once a week for four (4) consecutive weeks.
