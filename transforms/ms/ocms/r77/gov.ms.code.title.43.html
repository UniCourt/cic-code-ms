       § 43-1-9.
    County department of public welfare.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      There shall be created in each county of the state a county department of public welfare which shall consist of a county director of public welfare, and such other personnel as may be necessary for the efficient performance of the duties of the county department. It shall be the duty of the board of supervisors of each county to provide office space for the county department.
     </p>
     <p>
      County director. The commissioner shall designate, in accordance with the rules and regulations of the State Personnel Board, with the approval of the Governor, a county director of public welfare who shall serve as the executive and administrative officer of the county department and shall be responsible to the state department for its management. Such director shall be a resident citizen of the county and shall not hold any political office of the state, county, municipality or subdivision thereof. However, in cases of emergency, the commissioner may appoint a director of public welfare who is a nonresident of such county, to serve during the period of emergency only.
     </p>
     <p>
      The county department of public welfare shall administer within the county all forms of public assistance and welfare services. The county department shall comply with such regulations and submit such reports as may be established or required by the state department. Subject to the approval of the state department, the county department may cooperate with other departments, agencies and institutions, state and local, when so requested, in performing services in conformity with the provisions of this chapter.
     </p>
     <p>
      In counties having two (2) judicial districts, the state commissioner of public welfare may create and establish in each of the judicial districts a separate county department of public welfare which shall consist of a director of public welfare and such other personnel as may be necessary for the efficient performance of the duties of the department thus established. In such cases the two (2) departments so established shall be dealt with as though each is a separate and distinct county department of public welfare, and each of the departments and each of the directors shall operate and have jurisdiction coextensive with the boundaries of the judicial district in which it is established; and, also, in such cases the words “county” and “director of public welfare” when used in this chapter shall, where applicable, mean each judicial district, and the director of public welfare appointed therefor; and where the board of supervisors is authorized to appropriate funds or provide office space or like assistance for one (1) county welfare department or director, such board may, as the case may be, appropriate the amount specified by law or render the assistance required by law to each of the departments or directors. Provided, however, that the commissioner of public welfare shall not create and establish a separate county department of public welfare pursuant to this paragraph in any county in which such separate county department of public welfare is not in existence on January 1, 1983. Provided further, that in any county having two (2) county departments of public welfare on January 1, 1983, but only one (1) county director of public welfare on said date, the commissioner of public welfare shall not authorize and establish the second position of county director of public welfare in such county.
     </p>
     <p>
      In any county not having two (2) judicial districts which is greater than fifty (50) miles in length, the commissioner of public welfare may establish one (1) branch office of the county department of public welfare which shall be staffed with existing employees and administrative staff of such county department for not less than four (4) days per week.

   Section 2 of ch. 589, Laws of 2006, effective from and after July 1, 2006 (approved April 21, 2006), amended this section. Section 1 of ch. 600, Laws of 2006, effective from and after July 1, 2006 (approved April 24, 2006), also amended this section. As set out above, this section reflects the language of Section 2 of ch. 589, Laws of 2006, which contains language that specifically provides that it supersedes
   §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c01s43-1-55" target="_self">43-1-55</a></cite> as amended by
   Laws of 2006, ch. 600.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pursuant to
   Section 1-1-109, the Joint Legislative Committee on Compilation, Revision and Publication of Legislation corrected a typographical error in paragraph (a) of subsection (5). The word “counsel” was changed to “council” following “advisory” in the next-to-last sentence. The Joint Committee ratified the correction at its May 31, 2006, meeting.

       In (3), there is a reference to “vulnerable adult cases.” The “Vulnerable Adults Act” was renamed the “Vulnerable Persons Act” by
   Laws of 2010, ch. 357 to change references to “vulnerable adult” to “vulnerable person.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 43-26-1, enacted by Chapter 494, Laws of 2016, effective May 13, 2016, provides that from and after July 1, 2018, the programs and services provided by the Office of Family and Children's Services of the Department of Human Services under this section will be provided by the Department of Child Protection Services.
      </p>
      <p>
       This section was amended by Section 10 of Chapter 420, Laws of 2019, effective July 1, 2019, to add the second and third sentences of subsection (1), which read: “The standards shall include at least two (2) hours of training regarding the subject of identifying, assessing and providing comprehensive services to a child who has experienced or is alleged to have experienced commercial sexual exploitation or human trafficking.
   For family protection workers, this training may be included in the four (4) weeks of intensive training described in paragraph (b) of this subsection.” The Joint Legislative Committee on Compilation, Revision and Publication of Legislation corrected an error in the language at the end of the second sentence as added by Chapter 420, by substituting “subsection (2)(b) of this section” for “paragraph (b) of this subsection.”
      </p>
      <p>
       However, at the direction of the co-counsel for the Joint Legislative Committee on Compilation, Revision and Publication of Legislation, the amendments by Chapter 420, Laws of 2019, have not been given effect because the section was also repealed by operation of law on July 1, 2019.

    Mississippi Child Care Quality Step System established by requiring Department of Human Services Office for Children and Youth to develop and implement pilot voluntary quality rating system (QRS).
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The Department of Human Services shall establish the Mississippi Child Care Quality Step System by requiring the Office for Children and Youth of the Department of Human Services, the lead agency for the Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF), to develop and implement a pilot voluntary Quality Rating System (QRS). The purpose of the pilot system will be to improve the quality of all licensed early care and education and after-school programs. The system is to be phased in over the next five (5) years beginning July 1, 2006, subject to appropriation. The QRS criteria will be the basis, at minimum, for the QRS, and shall address the following components: administrative policy, professional development, learning environment, and parental involvement and evaluation.
     </p>
     <p>
      In addition, the Office for Children and Youth shall develop and administer funds, based on appropriation, to create a Child Care Resource and Referral (CCR& R) statewide system in collaboration with community and junior colleges, universities, Mississippi Public Broadcasting, state agencies and/or nonprofit community entities. The CCR& R agencies shall provide training specific to the QRS criteria to enable early care and education program quality to improve as measured by the QRS system; and offer parent education information and training on what a quality early care and education program comprises and how to identify one. This program shall begin July 1, 2006, subject to appropriation.

The state superintendent, subject to the approval of the State Personnel Board, shall fix the amount of compensation or expenses of any of the personnel of the schools, which shall be paid upon the requisition of the state superintendent and warrant issued thereunder by the State Auditor out of the funds appropriated by the Legislature in a lump sum upon the basis of budgetary requirements submitted by the Superintendent of Education or out of funds otherwise made available. The entire expense of administering the schools shall never exceed the amount appropriated therefor, plus funds received from sources other than state appropriations. For a violation of this provision, the superintendent shall be liable, and he and the sureties on his bond shall be required to restore any excess. However, if for any reason within the two-year period beginning July 1, 2014, a new Superintendent of the School for the Blind, Superintendent of the School for the Deaf or other administrative or instructional personnel are employed by the department, the employment shall not be subject to the rules and regulations of the State Personnel Board, except as otherwise provided in Section 25-9-127(4).

      Braille print, designated commonly as revised Braille Grade Two, shall be taught in the School for the Blind. The use of this print shall be included in the high school literary courses of students in such school. Every teacher or instructor in the School for the Deaf, whose duties include oral instruction of pupils, shall become acquainted with the most efficient and advanced methods of lipreading, but every teacher shall also master the manual alphabet in order to be able to communicate with pupils who cannot read lips and in order to aid and participate in student activities outside the classrooms. Every pupil entering the school shall be given oral instruction until it is clearly determined whether he can master lipreading to an extent enabling him to progress satisfactorily in his studies, but manual instruction shall be provided in all subjects for all pupils unable to progress satisfactorily under oral instruction alone. The State Board of Education may set and determine the additional requirements necessary for each teacher or instructor. All teachers and instructors must enter into written contracts of employment to indicate and cover the period for which they are respectively employed. Complete courses in shorthand and typewriting are to be offered at the School for the Deaf.

       The Legislature recognizes that language used in reference to individuals with disabilities shapes and reflects society’s attitudes towards people with disabilities. Many of the terms currently used diminish the humanity and natural condition of having a disability. Certain terms are demeaning and create an invisible barrier to inclusion as equal community members. The Legislature finds it necessary to clarify preferred language for new and revised laws and rules by requiring the use of terminology that puts the person before the disability.

       The legislative drafting offices of the House and Senate are directed to avoid all references to the terms “disabled,” “developmentally disabled,” “mentally disabled,” “mentally ill,” “mentally retarded,” “handicapped,” “cripple” and “crippled,” in any new statute, memorial or resolution, and to change those references in any existing statute, memorial or resolution as sections including those references are otherwise amended by law. The drafting offices are directed to replace the terms referenced above as appropriate with the following revised terminology: “persons with disabilities,” “persons with developmental disabilities,” “persons with mental illness” and “persons with intellectual or cognitive disabilities.”

      The Mississippi Legislature finds that the benefits of meaningful work have significance and importance to all working-age persons, including persons with disabilities. In order to achieve meaningful and competitive employment for persons with disabilities, employment opportunities in fully integrated work settings shall be, to the extent practicable, the first and priority option explored in planning and providing services and supports for working-age persons with disabilities.

     </h3>
     <p>
      As used in this article, the following words shall have the following meaning, unless the context otherwise requires:
     </p>
     <p>
      “Competitive employment” means work in the competitive labor market that is performed on a full-time or part-time basis in an integrated setting and for which a person with a disability is compensated in a manner consistent with applicable wage-and-hour laws. Pay shall be comparable to the customary wage and level of benefits paid by the employer for the same or similar work performed by persons without disabilities.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Disability” means, with respect to a person, a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities of such person as defined in the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended. A “disability” does not include brief periods of intoxication caused by alcohol or drugs or dependence upon or addiction to any alcohol or drugs.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Integrated setting” means a setting typically found in the community in which persons with disabilities interact with persons without disabilities (other than disability service providers) to a comparable extent that persons without disabilities in comparable positions interact with other persons.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Working age” means fourteen (14) years of age or older in accordance with Section 71-7-17.

     <p>
      It is declared to be the policy of this state that competitive employment in an integrated setting shall be, to the extent practicable, considered the first and priority option when planning or providing services and supports to persons with disabilities who are of working age. All state agencies that provide services and support to persons with disabilities, and/or employment-related services, shall, using available resources, follow this policy and ensure that it is effectively implemented in their programs and services; however, nothing in this article shall supersede any agency’s ability to fulfill the agency’s duties and requirements mandated by federal statutes. Nothing in this article shall be construed to limit or disallow any disability benefits to which a person with a disability who is unable to be employed as contemplated by this article would otherwise be entitled. Nothing in this article shall be construed to require any state agency or other employer to give preference to hiring persons with disabilities or to prohibit any employment relationship or program that is otherwise permitted under applicable law. Any person with a disability who is employed by a state agency must meet the minimum qualifications and requirements for the position in which the person is employed.

     </p>

     <p>
      Upon completion of the investigation, the county department shall determine in accordance with the rules and regulations of the state department, whether the applicant is eligible for assistance under the provisions of this chapter, the amount of assistance he shall receive, and the date upon which such assistance shall begin. All checks for such assistance shall be mailed by the state department or county welfare office to the recipients at their postoffice address. The director of the state department shall determine whether such checks shall be mailed by the state department or by the county welfare office.
     </p>
     <p>
      It shall be the duty of the state department insofar as is practicable to provide assistance to eligible persons, who, due to limitations of available funds have not been placed upon the assistance rolls, as soon as practicable after additional funds become available to the department and prior to making a general increase in assistance grants to persons already on said assistance rolls. However, nothing in this section shall be construed to bar or limit any county department of public welfare from granting individual increases in the amount of assistance to recipients based upon their individual needs. The state department shall, as soon as made possible by the availability of additional funds, take steps to eliminate all waiting lists. The state department or the office of public welfare of the various counties shall notify each applicant concerning the action taken on his or her application for assistance, and if the application for assistance is denied, the applicant shall be notified and given the reasons for such denial, and the lack of money shall not constitute a reason for such denial.

     <p>
      The Mississippi Old Age Security Law is continued in force in pursuance of Public Law 92-603, 92nd Congress, under Title III thereof establishing supplemental security income for the aged, blind and disabled; and under Title VI thereof providing grants to the several states for services to the aged, blind or disabled to help needy individuals who are sixty-five (65) years of age or over, are blind, or are disabled to attain or retain capability for self-support or self-care under plans approved by the secretary of health, education and welfare, for services to the aged, blind or disabled; to continue the administration of aid to families with dependent children, pursuant to Title IV, federal Social Security Act, and Sections 43-17-1 through 43-17-25; to determine the eligibility of needy persons for food stamps from the U. S. Department of Agriculture or other federal agency, thus enabling the state to make more adequate provisions for needy aged, blind or disabled persons and for families with dependent children by reason of said federal grants therein provided, the state being unable financially to provide such services and assistance without such federal aid. Therefore, in the event that Public Law 92-603, 92nd Congress, or Title IV, federal Social Security Act, should be finally adjudged invalid, or in the event that the federal grants-in-aid provided thereunder should be substantially reduced below fifty percent (50%), then and in either of such events, and upon public proclamation of the governor, the Mississippi Old Age Security Law shall ipso facto be thereby repealed and rendered null and void.

    Definitions.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      When used in this chapter, the following words shall have the following meaning:
     </p>
     <p>
      “Institutions for the aged or infirm” means a place either governmental or private that provides group living arrangements for four (4) or more persons who are unrelated to the operator and who are being provided food, shelter and personal care, whether any such place is organized or operated for profit or not. The term “institution for aged or infirm” includes nursing homes, pediatric skilled nursing facilities, psychiatric residential treatment facilities, convalescent homes, homes for the aged and adult foster care facilities, provided that these institutions fall within the scope of the definitions set forth above. The term “institution for the aged or infirm” does not include hospitals, clinics or mental institutions devoted primarily to providing medical service, and does not include any private residence in which the owner of the residence is providing personal care services to disabled or homeless veterans under an agreement with, and in compliance with the standards prescribed by, the United States Department of Veterans Affairs, if the owner of the residence also provided personal care services to disabled or homeless veterans at any time during calendar year 2008.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Person” means any individual, firm, partnership, corporation, company, association or joint-stock association, or any licensee herein or the legal successor thereof.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Personal care” means assistance rendered by personnel of the home to aged or infirm residents in performing one or more of the activities of daily living, which includes, but is not limited to, the bathing, walking, excretory functions, feeding, personal grooming and dressing of such residents.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Psychiatric residential treatment facility” means any nonhospital establishment with permanent facilities which provides a twenty-four-hour program of care by qualified therapists, including, but not limited to, duly licensed mental health professionals, psychiatrists, psychologists, psychotherapists and licensed certified social workers, for emotionally disturbed children and adolescents referred to such facility by a court, local school district or by the Department of Human Services, who are not in an acute phase of illness requiring the services of a psychiatric hospital, and are in need of such restorative treatment services. For purposes of this paragraph, the term “emotionally disturbed” means a condition exhibiting one or more of the following characteristics over a long period of time and to a marked degree, which adversely affects educational performance:
     </p>
     <p>
      1. An inability to learn which cannot be explained by intellectual, sensory or health factors;
     </p>
     <p>
      2. An inability to build or maintain satisfactory relationships with peers and teachers;
     </p>
     <p>
      3. Inappropriate types of behavior or feelings under normal circumstances;
     </p>
     <p>
      4. A general pervasive mood of unhappiness or depression; or
     </p>
     <p>
      5. A tendency to develop physical symptoms or fears associated with personal or school problems. An establishment furnishing primarily domiciliary care is not within this definition.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Pediatric skilled nursing facility” means an institution or a distinct part of an institution that is primarily engaged in providing to inpatients skilled nursing care and related services for persons under twenty-one (21) years of age who require medical or nursing care or rehabilitation services for the rehabilitation of injured, disabled or sick persons.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Licensing agency” means the State Department of Health.

      “Medical records” mean, without restriction, those medical histories, records, reports, summaries, diagnoses and prognoses, records of treatment and medication ordered and given, notes, entries, x-rays and other written or graphic data prepared, kept, made or maintained in institutions for the aged or infirm that pertain to residency in, or services rendered to residents of, an institution for the aged or infirm.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Adult foster care facility” means a home setting for vulnerable adults in the community who are unable to live independently due to physical, emotional, developmental or mental impairments, or in need of emergency and continuing protective social services for purposes of preventing further abuse or neglect and for safeguarding and enhancing the welfare of the abused or neglected vulnerable adult. Adult foster care programs shall be designed to meet the needs of vulnerable adults with impairments through individual plans of care, which provide a variety of health, social and related support services in a protective setting, enabling participants to live in the community. Adult foster care programs may be (i) traditional, where the foster care provider lives in the residence and is the primary caregiver to clients in the home; (ii) corporate, where the foster care home is operated by a corporation with shift staff delivering services to clients; or (iii) shelter, where the foster care home accepts clients on an emergency short-term basis for up to thirty (30) days.

       Pursuant to Section 1-1-109, the Joint Legislative Committee on Compilation, Revision and Publication of Legislation corrected a typographical error in (h)(ii). In both versions of the section, (h)(ii) was corrected by substituting “shift staff delivering services” for “shift staff delivery services.” The Joint Committee ratified the correction at its July 22, 2010, meeting.

       In (h), there are references to “vulnerable adults.” The “Vulnerable Adult Act” was renamed the “Vulnerable Persons Act” by Laws of 2010, ch. 357 to change references to “vulnerable adult” to “vulnerable person.”

     <p>
      The licensing agency after notice and opportunity for a hearing to the applicant or licensee is authorized to deny, suspend or revoke a license in any case in which it finds that there has been a substantial failure to comply with the requirements established under this chapter.
     </p>
     <p>
      Such notice shall be effected by registered mail, or by personal service setting forth the particular reasons for the proposed action and fixing a date not less than thirty (30) days from the date of such mailing or such service, at which time the applicant or licensee, shall be given an opportunity for a prompt and fair hearing. On the basis of any such hearing, or upon default of the applicant or licensee, the licensing agency shall make a determination specifying its findings of fact and conclusions of law. A copy of such determination shall be sent by registered mail or served personally upon the applicant or licensee. The decision revoking, suspending or denying the license or application shall become final thirty (30) days after it is so mailed or served, unless the applicant or licensee, within such thirty (30) day period, appeals the decision to the chancery court pursuant to Section 43-11-23.
     </p>
     <p>
      The procedure governing hearings authorized by this section shall be in accordance with rules promulgated by the licensing agency. A full and complete record shall be kept of all proceedings, and all testimony shall be recorded but need not be transcribed unless the decision is appealed pursuant to section 43-11-23. Witnesses may be subpoenaed by either party. Compensation shall be allowed to witnesses as in cases in the chancery court. Each party shall pay the expense of his own witnesses. The cost of the record shall be paid by the licensing agency provided any other party desiring a copy of the transcript shall pay therefor the reasonable cost of preparing the same.

      <p>
       Section 1 of ch. 595, Laws of 2001, effective July 1, 2001, amended this section. Section 11 of ch. 603, Laws of 2001, effective July 1, 2001, also amended this section. As set out above, this section reflects the language of both amendments pursuant to Section 1-1-109, which gives the Joint Legislative Committee on Compilation, Revision and Publication of Legislation authority to integrate amendments so that all versions of the same code section enacted within the same legislative session may become effective. The Joint Committee on Compilation, Revision and Publication of Legislation ratified the integration of these amendments as consistent with the legislative intent pursuant to a letter to Committee members from the Committee Chairman proposing integration of the amendments, with no member objecting to the integration by June 4, 2001, the deadline set in the letter for objection.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pursuant to Section 1-1-109, the Joint Legislative Committee on Compilation, Revision and Publication of Legislation corrected a typographical error in paragraph (g) of subsection (5). The word “with” was changed to “without”. The Joint Committee ratified the correction at its June 3, 2003 meeting.

       Section 1 of ch. 317 Laws of 2004, effective from and after June 30, 2004 (approved April 12, 2004), amended this section. Section 3 of ch. 538, Laws of 2004, effective from and after July 1, 2004 (approved May 13, 2004), also amended this section.
   As set out above, this section reflects the language of Section 3 of ch. 538, Laws of 2004, pursuant to Section 1-3-79 which provides that whenever the same section of law is amended by different bills during the same legislative session, and the effective dates of the amendments are the same, the amendment with the latest approval date shall supersede all other amendments to the same section approved on an earlier date.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 1 of ch. 305, Laws of 2008, effective from and after June 30, 2008 (approved March 11, 2008), amended this section. Section 1 of ch. 423, Laws of 2008, effective from and after July 1, 2008 (approved April 3, 2008), also amended this section. The amendments to these sections do not conform and do not meet the Joint Committee’s criteria for integration. Pursuant to Section 1-3-79, which provides that whenever the same section of law is amended by different bills during the same legislative session, the amendment with the latest effective date shall supersede all other amendments to the same section taking effect earlier; therefore, as set out above, this section reflects the language of Section 1 of ch. 423, Laws of 2008.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pursuant to Section 1-1-109, the Joint Legislative Committee on Compilation, Revision and Publication of Legislation corrected an error in a statutory reference in (5)(b) and (d) by substituting “Section 45-33-23(h)” for “Section 45-33-23(g).” The Joint Committee ratified the correction at its August 1, 2013, meeting.

As set out above, this section reflects the language of Section 31 of Chapter 510, Laws of 2016, which contains language that specifically provides that it supersedes §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c11s43-11-13" target="_self">43-11-13</a></cite> as amended by Laws of 2016, ch. 413.

       The Department of Health may not, in adopting regulations establishing a schedule for updated checks, provide an exemption to employees who change employers during the validity period from being subject to another background check as such an exemption would contradict the statutory language requiring a check “on every new employee of a licensed entity.” Thompson, Jr., July 26, 2002, A.G. Op. #02-0360.
      </p>
      <p>
       Until such time as the Board of Health adopts regulations covering guidelines, procedures and instructions for require criminal history checks, licensed entities cannot be required to comply with the terms of the law pertaining thereto. Steinberger, Sept. 20, 2002, A.G. Op. #02-0476.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nursing and other allied-health students are “employees” under the definition of subdivision (5)(a) of this section to the extent that clinical training requires hands-on medical patient care and not just observation of care performed by others. Foxworth, Aug. 1, 2003, A.G. Op. 03-0381.
      </p>
      <p>
       A licensed entity where the student nurse is receiving clinical training shall be notified by the Mississippi State Department of Health of the results of the criminal history record check. The statute does not address releasing the results of the criminal history record check to any other party or entity. Foxworth, Aug. 1, 2003, A.G. Op. 03-0381.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Department of Health may, in its discretion, adopt a framework such as is set forth in subsection (e) of this section to determine whether the facts and circumstances of a particular case would warrant granting an individual a waiver and permitting him or her to work in a child-care facility. Terney, Apr. 23, 2004, A.G. Op. 04-0124.
      </p>
      <p>
       Law enforcement officers and employees of fire departments who provide emergency medical care during the course and scope of their official
   employment are not employees of health care facilities as defined in this section and therefore, do not have to undergo criminal history record checks. However, if a law enforcement officer or fire department employee is enrolled as a student in a health care professional/vocational technical academic program and performs clinical training in a licensed entity, he or she must comply with the law requiting which requires all such students to (a) be under the supervision of a licensed health care provider; and (b) sign affidavits to be on file at the school stating that they have not been convicted of or pleaded guilty or nolo contendere to a felony listed in subdivision (5)(d) of this section, or that any such conviction or plea was reversed on appeal or a pardon was granted for the conviction or plea. Ambulance personnel are subject to the criminal history record check as “employees” of licensed entities if they are employed by an ambulance service which is either (a) owned or operated by a licensed entity or (b) under contract with a licensed entity to transport patients, residents, or clients. Martin, Aug. 27, 2004, A.G. Op. 04-0297.

       The Mississippi State Department of Health is the “licensing agency” for purposes of 43-11-13(5). Amy, July 29, 2005, A.G. Op. 05-0365.
      </p>
      <p>
       Employees of EMS providers who can ever be expected to provide direct, hands-on, medical patient care in a patient’s, resident’s, or client’s room or in a treatment or recovery room to patients, residents, or clients being served by hospitals, nursing homes, personal care homes, home health agencies or hospices, either by virtue of being employed by one of those entities, or through a contract with same, must undergo a criminal history records background check under Section 43-11-13(5). An EMT working for an independent ambulance service that does not have a contract with a covered entity would not be subject to the statute. Amy, July 29, 2005, A.G. Op. 05-0365.

       This section shall apply to patients in long-term care facilities, as defined in subsection (2) of this section. It is the intent of the Legislature that the State of Mississippi shall be a “right-to-choose” state for the purposes of Medicaid and Medicare benefits, excluding Medicare Part A, and that patients of long-term care facilities shall have the same rights and privileges concerning pharmacy providers as participants or beneficiaries of health benefit plans.

       A long-term care facility may require that a patient or the person who normally makes health care decisions on behalf of the patient sign a document that identifies his pharmacy or pharmacist provider of choice and that releases the facility of any liability for the dispensing of the prescription until the facility accepts control of the dispensed drug.

    Integration of eligibility systems.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The Division of Medicaid shall submit a final Advanced Planning Document to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) for the purpose of applying for the OMB A87 exception to support the integration of eligibility systems between the division and any applicable Department of Human Services program where an integrated system of eligibility will serve the state’s interest in developing shared eligibility services across health and human services programs, while at the same time promoting and enhancing the state’s efforts of ensuring maximum program integrity across each agency. In preparing the final Advanced Planning Document, the division also shall:
     </p>
     <p>
      Identify functions that can be leveraged or shared across the state Medicaid program and other Department of Human Services programs;
     </p>
     <p>
      Weigh benefits of shared systems;
     </p>
     <p>
      Identify interoperability and integration goals;
     </p>
     <p>
      Seek guidance from the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services (CMS) and the Office for the Administration of Children and Families (ACF) on state ideas before submitting the Advanced Planning Document; and
     </p>
     <p>
      Ensure that the enhancement to front end identity and asset verification is an integral part of the advanced planning and integration process going forward.
     </p>
     <p>
      The division shall submit a report on its progress to the chairmen of the House and Senate Medicaid Committees within ninety (90) business days and on a quarterly basis thereafter until the final Advanced Planning Document is completed. The report also shall be provided to the other members of the Legislature upon request.

       Laws of 2018, ch. 400, § 1, effective March 19, 2018, provides:

      <p>
       “SECTION 1: The Legislature finds and declares:
      </p>
      <p>
       “(a) A rare disease is defined as a disease that affects fewer than two hundred thousand (200,000) people in the United States. Rare diseases are sometimes called orphan diseases. There are seven thousand (7,000) known rare diseases affecting approximately thirty million (30,000,000) men, women and children in the United States;
      </p>
      <p>
       “(b) The exact cause for many rare diseases remains unknown. However, eighty percent (80%) of rare diseases are genetic in origin and can be linked to mutations in a single gene or in multiple genes. Those diseases are referred to as genetic diseases. Genetic disease can be passed down from generation to generation, explaining why certain rare diseases run in families. It is also estimated that about half of all rare diseases affect children;
      </p>
      <p>
       “(c) A person suffering with a rare disease in Mississippi faces a wide range of challenges, including, but not limited to: delays in obtaining a diagnosis; misdiagnosis; shortage of medical specialists who are familiar with, and can provide treatment for, rare diseases; prohibitive cost of treatment; and the inability to access therapies and medication that are used by doctors to treat rare diseases but have not been approved by the federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for that specific purpose;
      </p>
      <p>
       “(d) In recent years, researchers have made considerable progress in developing diagnostic tools and treatment protocols for, and in discovering ways to prevent a variety of, rare diseases. However, much more remains to be done in the areas of rare disease research and the search for and development of new therapeutics; and
      </p>
      <p>
       “(e) It would be very beneficial to persons in Mississippi with rare diseases and to researchers who are trying to find ways to treat or prevent the occurrence of rare diseases to examine the existing data on rare diseases in Mississippi and compile it in a detailed report, which then could be analyzed and used to educate medical professionals, government agencies and the public about rare diseases as an important public health issue, and to encourage and fund research in the development of new treatments for rare diseases.”

      <p>
       Laws of 2018, ch. 400, § 2, effective March 19, 2018, provides:
      </p>
      <p>
       “SECTION 2. The University of Mississippi Medical Center (UMMC) as the lead agency, together with the State Department of Health, the Division of Medicaid and the Mississippi Health Information Network (MS-HIN), shall cooperate with each other in preparing a comprehensive report on the state of rare diseases in Mississippi, including the incidence of rare diseases in the state, the status of the rare disease community, and treatment and services provided to persons with rare diseases in the state. The State Department of Health, the Division of Medicaid and the MS-HIN shall provide to UMMC and each other all claims data and patient encounter data relating to the diagnosis and treatment of rare diseases and all related research and documentation relating to rare diseases, which shall be compiled, examined and analyzed in the report. The report shall be presented to the Chairs of the House Public Health and Human Services Committee, Senate Public Health and Welfare Committee, and the House and Senate Medicaid Committees not later than December 1, 2019.”

   To determine whether health care providers are entitled to bring private right of action under
   42 USCS § 1983 to challenged adequacy of state’s reimbursement rates for medical services provided under Medicaid program, court must look closely at precise statutory language, and examine what is required of state as a condition of receiving federal funds. Duties that are merely generalized are to be enforced by the Secretary, not by private individuals. The right must be unambiguously conferred by the statute. The two-prong test of
   Golden State Transit Corp. v. Los Angeles (1989) <cite class="us_code">493 U.S. 103</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">107 L. Ed. 3</cite>d 420,
   <cite class="s_court">110 S. Ct. 444</cite>, still has force: (1) plaintiff must assert violation of a federal rights: the interest the plaintiff asserts must not be too vague and amorphous, and it must be examined whether the provision was intended to benefit the putative plaintiff. (2) Even when plaintiff shows a federal right, defendant may show that Congress specifically foreclosed a remedy under section 1983 by providing a comprehensive enforcement mechanism for protection of a federal right, the burden to demonstrate that Congress had expressly withdrawn such a remedy being on the defendant.

       It shall be the duty of the Division of Medicaid to fully implement and carry out the administrative functions of determining the eligibility of those persons who qualify for medical assistance under Section 43-13-115.
      </li>
      <li id="t43c13s43-13-116ol12">
       In determining Medicaid eligibility, the Division of Medicaid is authorized to enter into an agreement with the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services for the purpose of securing the transfer of eligibility information from the Social Security Administration on those individuals receiving supplemental security income benefits under the federal Social Security Act and any other information necessary in determining Medicaid eligibility. The Division of Medicaid is further empowered to enter into contractual arrangements with its fiscal agent or with the State Department of Human Services in securing electronic data processing support as may be necessary.
      </li>
      <li id="t43c13s43-13-116ol13">
       Administrative hearings shall be available to any applicant who requests it because his or her claim of eligibility for services is denied or is not acted upon with reasonable promptness or by any recipient who requests it because he or she believes the agency has erroneously taken action to deny, reduce, or terminate benefits. The agency need not grant a hearing if the sole issue is a federal or state law requiring an automatic change adversely affecting some or all recipients. Eligibility determinations that are made by other agencies and certified to the Division of Medicaid pursuant to Section 43-13-115 are not subject to the administrative hearing procedures of the Division of Medicaid but are subject to the administrative hearing procedures of the agency that determined eligibility.
       <ol type="a">
        <li id="t43c13s43-13-116ol13a">
         A request may be made either for a local regional office hearing or a state office hearing when the local regional office has made the initial decision that the claimant seeks to appeal or when the regional office has not acted with reasonable promptness in making a decision on a claim for eligibility or services. The only exception to requesting a local hearing is when the issue under appeal involves either (i) a disability or blindness denial, or termination, or (ii) a level of care denial or termination for a disabled child living at home. An appeal involving disability, blindness or level of care must be handled as a state level hearing. The decision from the local hearing may be appealed to the state office for a state hearing. A decision to deny, reduce or terminate benefits that is initially made at the state office may be appealed by requesting a state hearing.
        </li>
        <li id="t43c13s43-13-116ol13b">
         A request for a hearing, either state or local, must be made in writing by the claimant or claimant’s legal representative. “Legal representative” includes the claimant’s authorized representative, an attorney retained by the claimant or claimant’s family to represent the claimant, a paralegal representative with a legal aid services, a parent of a minor child if the claimant is a child, a legal guardian or conservator or an individual with power of attorney for the claimant. The claimant may also be represented by anyone that he or she so designates but must give the designation to the Medicaid regional office or state office in writing, if the person is not the legal representative, legal guardian, or authorized representative.
        </li>
        <li id="t43c13s43-13-116ol13c">
         The claimant may make a request for a hearing in person at the regional office but an oral request must be put into written form. Regional office staff will determine from the claimant if a local or state hearing is requested and assist the claimant in completing and signing the appropriate form. Regional office staff may forward a state hearing request to the appropriate division in the state office or the claimant may mail the form to the address listed on the form. The claimant may make a written request for a hearing by letter. A simple statement requesting a hearing that is signed by the claimant or legal representative is sufficient; however, if possible, the claimant should state the reason for the request. The letter may be mailed to the regional office or it may be mailed to the state office. If the letter does not specify the type of hearing desired, local or state, Medicaid staff will attempt to contact the claimant to determine the level of hearing desired. If contact cannot be made within three (3) days of receipt of the request, the request will be assumed to be for a local hearing and scheduled accordingly. A hearing will not be scheduled until either a letter or the appropriate form is received by the regional or state office.
        </li>
        <li id="t43c13s43-13-116ol13d">
         When both members of a couple wish to appeal an action or inaction by the agency that affects both applications or cases similarly and arose from the same issue, one or both may file the request for hearing, both may present evidence at the hearing, and the agency’s decision will be applicable to both. If both file a request for hearing, two (2) hearings will be registered but they will be conducted on the same day and in the same place, either consecutively or jointly, as the couple wishes. If they so desire, only one of the couple need attend the hearing.
        </li>
        <li id="t43c13s43-13-116ol13e">
         The procedure for administrative hearings shall be as follows:
         <ol type="i">
          <li id="t43c13s43-13-116ol13ei">
           The claimant has thirty (30) days from the date the agency mails the appropriate notice to the claimant of its decision regarding eligibility, services, or benefits to request either a state or local hearing. This time period may be extended if the claimant can show good cause for not filing within thirty (30) days. Good cause includes, but may not be limited to, illness, failure to receive the notice, being out of state, or some other reasonable explanation. If good cause can be shown, a late request may be accepted provided the facts in the case remain the same. If a claimant’s circumstances have changed or if good cause for filing a request beyond thirty (30) days is not shown, a hearing request will not be accepted. If the claimant wishes to have eligibility reconsidered, he or she may reapply.
          </li>
          <li id="t43c13s43-13-116ol13eii">
           If a claimant or representative requests a hearing in writing during the advance notice period before benefits are reduced or terminated, benefits must be continued or reinstated to the benefit level in effect before the effective date of the adverse action. Benefits will continue at the original level until the final hearing decision is rendered. Any hearing requested after the advance notice period will not be accepted as a timely request in order for continuation of benefits to apply.
          </li>
          <li id="t43c13s43-13-116ol13eiii">
           Upon receipt of a written request for a hearing, the request will be acknowledged in writing within twenty (20) days and a hearing scheduled. The claimant or representative will be given at least five (5) days’ advance notice of the hearing date. The local and/or state level hearings will be held by telephone unless, at the hearing officer’s discretion, it is determined that an in-person hearing is necessary. If a local hearing is requested, the regional office will notify the claimant or representative in writing of the time of the local hearing. If a state hearing is requested, the state office will notify the claimant or representative in writing of the time of the state hearing. If an in-person hearing is necessary, local hearings will be held at the regional office and state hearings will be held at the state office unless other arrangements are necessitated by the claimant’s inability to travel.
          </li>
          <li id="t43c13s43-13-116ol13eiv">
           All persons attending a hearing will attend for the purpose of giving information on behalf of the claimant or rendering the claimant assistance in some other way, or for the purpose of representing the Division of Medicaid.
          </li>
          <li id="t43c13s43-13-116ol13ev">
           A state or local hearing request may be withdrawn at any time before the scheduled hearing, or after the hearing is held but before a decision is rendered. The withdrawal must be in writing and signed by the claimant or representative. A hearing request will be considered abandoned if the claimant or representative fails to appear at a scheduled hearing without good cause. If no one appears for a hearing, the appropriate office will notify the claimant in writing that the hearing is dismissed unless good cause is shown for not attending. The proposed agency action will be taken on the case following failure to appear for a hearing if the action has not already been effected.

          <li id="t43c13s43-13-116ol13evi">
           The claimant or his representative has the following rights in connection with a local or state hearing:

           When a request for a local hearing is received by the regional office or if the regional office is notified by the state office that a local hearing has been requested, the Medicaid specialist supervisor in the regional office will review the case record, reexamine the action taken on the case, and determine if policy and procedures have been followed. If any adjustments or corrections should be made, the Medicaid specialist supervisor will ensure that corrective action is taken. If the request for hearing was timely made such that continuation of benefits applies, the Medicaid specialist supervisor will ensure that benefits continue at the level before the proposed adverse action that is the subject of the appeal. The Medicaid specialist supervisor will also ensure that all needed information, verification, and evidence is in the case record for the hearing.

          <li id="t43c13s43-13-116ol13Eviii">
           When a state hearing is requested that appeals the action or inaction of a regional office, the regional office will prepare copies of the case record and forward it to the appropriate division in the state office no later than five (5) days after receipt of the request for a state hearing. The original case record will remain in the regional office. Either the original case record in the regional office or the copy forwarded to the state office will be available for inspection by the claimant or claimant’s representative a reasonable time before the date of the hearing.

          <li id="t43c13s43-13-116ol13Eix">
           The Medicaid specialist supervisor will serve as the hearing officer for a local hearing unless the Medicaid specialist supervisor actually participated in the eligibility, benefits, or services decision under appeal, in which case the Medicaid specialist supervisor must appoint a Medicaid specialist in the regional office who did not actually participate in the decision under appeal to serve as hearing officer. The local hearing will be an informal proceeding in which the claimant or representative may present new or additional information, may question the action taken on the client’s case, and will hear an explanation from agency staff as to the regulations and requirements that were applied to claimant’s case in making the decision.
          </li>

           After the hearing, the hearing officer will prepare a written summary of the hearing procedure and file it with the case record. The hearing officer will consider the facts presented at the local hearing in reaching a decision. The claimant will be notified of the local hearing decision on the appropriate form that will state clearly the reason for the decision, the policy that governs the decision, the claimant’s right to appeal the decision to the state office, and, if the original adverse action is upheld, the new effective date of the reduction or termination of benefits or services if continuation of benefits applied during the hearing process. The new effective date of the reduction or termination of benefits or services must be at the end of the fifteen-day advance notice period from the mailing date of the notice of hearing decision. The notice to claimant will be made part of the case record.
          </li>
          <li id="t43c13s43-13-116ol13Exi">
           The claimant has the right to appeal a local hearing decision by requesting a state hearing in writing within fifteen (15) days of the mailing date of the notice of local hearing decision. The state hearing request should be made to the regional office. If benefits have been continued pending the local hearing process, then benefits will continue throughout the fifteen-day advance notice period for an adverse local hearing decision. If a state hearing is timely requested within the fifteen-day period, then benefits will continue pending the state hearing process. State hearings requested after the fifteen-day local hearing advance notice period will not be accepted unless the initial thirty-day period for filing a hearing request has not expired because the local hearing was held early, in which case a state hearing request will be accepted as timely within the number of days remaining of the unexpired initial thirty-day period in addition to the fifteen-day time period. Continuation of benefits during the state hearing process, however, will only apply if the state hearing request is received within the fifteen-day advance notice period.

A request for a state hearing received in the state office will be forwarded to the regional office for inclusion in the case record and the regional office will prepare the case record and forward it to the appropriate division in the state office within five (5) days of receipt of the state hearing request.

Hearing officers will be individuals with appropriate expertise employed by the division and who have not been involved in any way with the action or decision on appeal in the case. The hearing officer will review the case record and if the review shows that an error was made in the action of the agency or in the interpretation of policy, or that a change of policy has been made, the hearing officer will discuss these matters with the appropriate agency personnel and request that an appropriate adjustment be made. Appropriate agency personnel will discuss the matter with the claimant and if the claimant is agreeable to the adjustment of the claim, then agency personnel will request in writing dismissal of the hearing and the reason therefor, to be placed in the case record.

       Chapter 118 of the Second Extraordinary Session of 2009 was effective on July 1, 2009, but the amendments to this section were contingent upon the effectuation of the hospital assessment provided for in
   Section 43-13-145(4).

   CMS approved the State Plan Amendment on March 9, 2010, and the hospital assessment then became effective, so the amendments to this section by Chapter 118 of the Second Extraordinary Session of 2009 became effective on March 9, 2010.

       Chancellor properly affirmed the findings of the Division of Medicaid (DOM) that its methodology for the distribution of upper payment limit (UPL) and Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) funds to hospitals comported with state law because DOM complied with the dictates of the statute, federal law, and its own State Plan, and it exhausted the maximum available DSH and UPL funds, per the directive of the Legislature; whether UPL or DSH had to be paid first was decided by the Legislature.

   To determine whether health care providers are entitled to bring private right of action under
   42 USCS § 1983 to challenged adequacy of state’s reimbursement rates for medical services provided under Medicaid program, court must look closely at precise statutory language, and examine what is required of state as a condition of receiving federal funds. Duties that are merely generalized are to be enforced by the Secretary, not by private individuals. The right must be unambiguously conferred by the statute. The two-prong test of

   <cite class="s_court">110 S. Ct. 444</cite>, still has force: (1) plaintiff must assert violation of a federal rights: the interest the plaintiff asserts must not be too vague and amorphous, and it must be examined whether the provision was intended to benefit the putative plaintiff. (2) Even when plaintiff shows a federal right, defendant may show that Congress specifically foreclosed a remedy under section 1983 by providing a comprehensive enforcement mechanism for protection of a federal right, the burden to demonstrate that Congress had expressly withdrawn such a remedy being on the defendant.

      It is the intent of the Legislature to expand access to Medicaid-funded home- and community-based services for eligible nursing facility residents who choose those services. The Executive Director of the Division of Medicaid is authorized to transfer funds allocated for nursing facility services for eligible residents to cover the cost of services available through the Independent Living Waiver, the Traumatic Brain Injury/Spinal Cord Injury Waiver, the Elderly and Disabled Waiver, and the Assisted Living Waiver programs when eligible residents choose those community services. The amount of funding transferred by the division shall be sufficient to cover the cost of home- and community-based waiver services for each eligible nursing facility residents who choose those services. The number of nursing facility residents who return to the community and home- and community-based waiver services shall not count against the total number of waiver slots for which the Legislature appropriates funding each year. Any funds remaining in the program when a former nursing facility resident ceases to participate in a home- and community-based waiver program under this provision shall be returned to nursing facility funding.

       Although a hospice care provider was a limited liability company that was administratively dissolved, the provider’s appeal of the Mississippi Division of Medicaid’s decision to demand that unsupported claims be repaid was allowed to proceed because the provider, by further appealing the decision, was not maintaining an action against Medicaid, but rather, continued to defend itself against Medicaid’s administrative decision.

       Long-term skilled nursing facility was not entitled to a per diem reimbursement from the Mississippi Division of Medicaid (DOM) for respiratory-therapist expenses because the DOM had no statutory requirement to provide funding for the respiratory therapy. Although the DOM did allow a per diem reimbursement for respiratory therapists’ salaries for certain categories of medical facilities, the nursing facility, which was classified as a large nursing facility was not entitled to claim respiratory-therapy expenses as part of its per diem calculation.

   To determine whether health care providers are entitled to bring private right of action under
   42 USCS § 1983 to challenged adequacy of state’s reimbursement rates for medical services provided under Medicaid program, court must look closely at precise statutory language, and examine what is required of state as a condition of receiving federal funds. Duties that are merely generalized are to be enforced by the Secretary, not by private individuals. The right must be unambiguously conferred by the statute. The two-prong test of
   Golden State Transit Corp. v. Los Angeles (1989) <cite class="us_code">493 U.S. 103</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">107 L. Ed. 3</cite>d 420,
   <cite class="s_court">110 S. Ct. 444</cite>, still has force: (1) plaintiff must assert violation of a federal rights: the interest the plaintiff asserts must not be too vague and amorphous, and it must be examined whether the provision was intended to benefit the putative plaintiff. (2) Even when plaintiff shows a federal right, defendant may show that Congress specifically foreclosed a remedy under section 1983 by providing a comprehensive enforcement mechanism for protection of a federal right, the burden to demonstrate that Congress had expressly withdrawn such a remedy being on the defendant.

       Action filed by several facility care providers against the Mississippi Division of Medicaid challenging a rate freeze was properly dismissed for failure to exhaust administrative remedies as set out through a state plan and policy manual before resorting to a chancery court for relief. No exception to the exhaustion requirement applied because the agency’s position was not clearly illegal, and the pursuit of an administrative remedy would not have resulted in irreparable harm.

   To determine whether health care providers are entitled to bring private right of action under 42 USCS § 1983 to challenged adequacy of state’s reimbursement rates for medical services provided under Medicaid program, court must look closely at precise statutory language, and examine what is required of state as a condition of receiving federal funds. Duties that are merely generalized are to be enforced by the Secretary, not by private individuals. Right must be unambiguously conferred by the statute. The two-prong test of Golden State Transit Corp. v. Los Angeles (1989) <cite class="us_code">493 U.S. 103</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">107 L. Ed. 3</cite>d 420, <cite class="s_court">110 S. Ct. 444</cite>, still has force: (1) plaintiff must assert violation of a federal rights: the interest the plaintiff asserts must not be too vague and amorphous, and it must be examined whether the provision was intended to benefit the putative plaintiff. (2) Even when plaintiff shows a federal right, defendant may show that Congress specifically foreclosed a remedy under section 1983 by providing a comprehensive enforcement mechanism for protection of a federal right, the burden to demonstrate that Congress had expressly withdrawn such a remedy being on the defendant. Evelyn V. v. Kings County Hosp. Ctr., 819 F. Supp. 183, 1993 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4452 (E.D.N.Y. 1993).

      Provide, with respect to individuals who are eligible for, or are provided, medical assistance under the state plan, upon the request of the Division of Medicaid, information to determine during what period the individual or their spouses or their dependents may be (or may have been) covered by a health insurer and the nature of the coverage that is or was provided by the health insurer (including the name, address and identifying number of the plan) in a manner prescribed by the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services;
     </p>
     <p>
      Accept the Division of Medicaid’s right of recovery and the assignment to the division of any right of an individual or other entity to payment from the party for an item or service for which payment has been made under the state plan;
     </p>
     <p>
      Respond to any inquiry by the Division of Medicaid regarding a claim for payment for any health care item or service that is submitted not later than three (3) years after the date of the provision of that health care item or service; and
     </p>
     <p>
      Agree not to deny a claim submitted by the Division of Medicaid solely on the basis of the date of submission of the claim, the type or format of the claim form, or a failure to present proper documentation at the point-of-sale that is the basis of the claim, if:
     </p>
     <p>
      The claim is submitted by the division within the three-year period beginning on the date on which the item or service was furnished; and
     </p>
     <p>
      Any action by the division to enforce its rights with respect to the claim is begun within six (6) years of the division’s submission of the claim.

         (i) Subject to and upon fulfillment of the requirements and conditions of paragraph (f) below, and notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, effective for state fiscal years 2016 through fiscal year 2021, an annual assessment on each hospital licensed in the state is imposed on each non-Medicare hospital inpatient day as defined below at a rate that is determined by dividing the sum prescribed in this subparagraph (i), plus the nonfederal share necessary to maximize the Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) and Medicare Upper Payment Limits (UPL) Program payments and hospital access payments and such other supplemental payments as may be developed pursuant to Section 43-13-117(A)(18), by the total number of non-Medicare hospital inpatient days as defined below for all licensed Mississippi hospitals, except as provided in paragraph (d) below. If the state matching funds percentage for the Mississippi Medicaid program is sixteen percent (16%) or less, the sum used in the formula under this subparagraph (i) shall be Seventy-four Million Dollars ($74,000,000.00). If the state matching funds percentage for the Mississippi Medicaid program is twenty-four percent (24%) or higher, the sum used in the formula under this subparagraph (i) shall be One Hundred Four Million Dollars ($104,000,000.00). If the state matching funds percentage for the Mississippi Medicaid program is between sixteen percent (16%) and twenty-four percent (24%), the sum used in the formula under this subparagraph (i) shall be a pro rata amount determined as follows: the current state matching funds percentage rate minus sixteen percent (16%) divided by eight percent (8%) multiplied by Thirty Million Dollars ($30,000,000.00) and add that amount to Seventy-four Million Dollars ($74,000,000.00). However, no assessment in a quarter under this subparagraph (i) may exceed the assessment in the previous quarter by more than Three Million Seven Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($3,750,000.00) (which would be Fifteen Million Dollars ($15,000,000.00) on an annualized basis). The division shall publish the state matching funds percentage rate applicable to the Mississippi Medicaid program on the tenth day of the first month of each quarter and the assessment determined under the formula prescribed above shall be applicable in the quarter following any adjustment in that state matching funds percentage rate. The division shall notify each hospital licensed in the state as to any projected increases or decreases in the assessment determined under this subparagraph (i). However, if the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) does not approve the provision in Section 43-13-117(39) requiring the division to reimburse crossover claims for inpatient hospital services and crossover claims covered under Medicare Part B for dually eligible beneficiaries in the same manner that was in effect on January 1, 2008, the sum that otherwise would have been used in the formula under this subparagraph (i) shall be reduced by Seven Million Dollars ($7,000,000.00).

          </li>
         </ol>
         <p>
          1. “Non-Medicare hospital inpatient day” means total hospital inpatient days including subcomponent days less Medicare inpatient days including subcomponent days from the hospital’s most recent Medicare cost report for the second calendar year preceding the beginning of the state fiscal year, on file with CMS per the CMS HCRIS database, or cost report submitted to the Division if the HCRIS database is not available to the division, as of June 1 of each year.
         </p>
         <p>
          a. Total hospital inpatient days shall be the sum of Worksheet S-3, Part 1, column 8 row 14, column 8 row 16, and column 8 row 17, excluding column 8 rows 5 and 6.
         </p>
         <p>
          b. Hospital Medicare inpatient days shall be the sum of Worksheet S-3, Part 1, column 6 row 14, column 6 row 16.00, and column 6 row 17, excluding column 6 rows 5 and 6.
         </p>
         <p>
          c. Inpatient days shall not include residential treatment or long-term care days.
         </p>
         <p>
          2. “Subcomponent inpatient day” means the number of days of care charged to a beneficiary for inpatient hospital rehabilitation and psychiatric care services in units of full days. A day begins at midnight and ends twenty-four (24) hours later. A part of a day, including the day of admission and day on which a patient returns from leave of absence, counts as a full day. However, the day of discharge, death, or a day on which a patient begins a leave of absence is not counted as a day unless discharge or death occur on the day of admission. If admission and discharge or death occur on the same day, the day is considered a day of admission and counts as one (1) subcomponent inpatient day.

       Chapter 118 of the Second Extraordinary Session of 2009 was effective on July 1, 2009, but the amendments to this section were contingent upon the effectuation of the hospital assessment provided for in subsection (4) of this section. Subsection (4)(f) of this section [in the first version of the section as it appeared in Laws of 2009, 2nd Ex Session, Ch. 118, § 3] provides that the hospital assessment will not take effect if the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) does not approve the Division of Medicaid's 2009 Medicaid State Plan Amendment for its methodology for Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) and inpatient Medicare Upper Payment Limits (UPL) payments to hospitals.
   CMS approved the State Plan Amendment on March 9, 2010, and the hospital assessment then became effective, so the amendments to this section by Chapter 118 of the Second Extraordinary Session of 2009 became effective on March 9, 2010.

      </h4>
      <p>
       Laws of 2009, ch. 553, §§ 1 and 2 provide:
      </p>
      <p>
       “SECTION 1. It is the purpose of this act to:
      </p>
      <p>
       “(a) Improve health care quality and outcomes for infants born preterm through enhanced hospital discharge, follow-up care and management processes and reduced rehospitalization; and
      </p>
      <p>
       “(b) Reduce infant morbidity and mortality associated with prematurity.”
      </p>
      <p>
       “SECTION 2. The Legislature makes the following findings:
      </p>
      <p>
       “(a)
   According to the Institute for Medicine, although there has been significant attention focused on neonatal intensive care for extremely preterm infants, little attention has been given to the majority of late-preterm infants born at thirty-four (34) through thirty-six (36) weeks gestational age.
   Even though these late-preterm infants may appear larger in size, are still more vulnerable to complications and disabilities than full-term infants.
   All babies born premature, including late-preterm infants, are at risk for a host of health and developmental issues that can last into and sometimes beyond childhood.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(b)
   Premature births are rising in Mississippi: eighteen and eight-tenths percent (18.8%) of Mississippi births were preterm in 2005, and premature births increased twenty-two percent (22%) in Mississippi between 1995 and 2005.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(c)
   In Mississippi, premature birth rates were highest in African Americans twenty-two and four-tenths percent (22.4%) followed by Whites fifteen percent (15%) and Hispanics thirteen and six-tenths percent (13.6%) in 2002-2004.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(d)
   Mississippi Medicaid paid for fifty-five and eight-tenths percent (55.8%) of all births in 2002.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(e)
   The direct employer health care cost for premature infants in their first year are fifteen (15) times greater than healthy full-term infants:
   Forty-one Thousand Six Hundred Ten Dollars ($41,610.00) versus Two Thousand Eight Hundred Thirty Dollars ($2,830.00).
      </p>
      <p>
       “(f)
   There are no standardized procedures for hospital discharge and follow-up care of premature infants.
   As a result, babies born premature may leave the hospital after birth without adequate discharge and follow-up care plans in place to ensure they receive appropriate care to address their special health needs once they are home in their community.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(g)
   Although there is growing evidence that late-preterm infants are at increased risk for morbidity and mortality compared to full-term infants, late-preterm infants may not be identified or managed any differently than full-term infants.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(h)
   Without organized discharge care plans, premature babies are more likely to experience gaps in health care. These infants require diligent evaluation, monitoring, referral and early return appointments for both post-neonatal evaluation and also continued long-term follow-up care.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(i)
   It is important to focus on the care and management of premature infants because the number of babies born premature at less than thirty-seven (37) weeks gestational age continues to grow in the United States with an increase of twenty percent (20%) since 1990 and nine percent (9%) since only 2000.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(j)
   In 2005, twelve and seven-tenths (12.7%) of all births were premature at less than thirty-seven (37) weeks gestational age, or more than five hundred twenty-five thousand (525,000) infants.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(k)
   The increase in premature birth rates in recent years is primarily associated with a rise in late-preterm births (thirty-four (34) through thirty-six (36) weeks gestational age), which has increased twenty-five percent (25%) since 1990 and account for seventy percent (70%) of all preterm births. Although multiple births have contributed to this rise, substantial increases in preterm birth rates, and especially late-preterm rates, have occurred because of singleton birth rates since 1990.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(
       <i>
        l
       </i>
       )
   Several studies have found that late-preterm infants have greater morbidity and mortality than full-term infants.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(m)
   Late-preterm infants have a mortality rate that is three (3) times greater than full-term infants, with the highest risk occurring during the neonatal period.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(n)
   Late-preterm babies have significant differences in clinical outcomes than full-term infants during the birth hospitalization, including greater risk for temperature instability, hypoglycemia, respiratory distress, and jaundice.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(o)
   Late-preterm infants have higher rates of rehospitalization during their first full year of life compared to full-term infants.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(p)
   The costs of premature births are significant:
   For the initial hospitalization after birth, the average length of stay for full-term infants was two and two-tenths (2.2) days and the average cost was Two Thousand Eighty-seven Dollars ($2,087.00), whereas late-preterm infants had a substantially longer average stay of eight and eight-tenths (8.8) days and cost of Twenty-six Thousand Fifty-four Dollars ($26,054.00). The average cost for late-preterm infants in their first year of life was Thirty-eight Thousand Three Hundred One Dollars ($38,301.00) versus Six Thousand One Hundred Fifty-six Dollars ($6,156.00) for full-term infants.
   Late-preterm infants had higher costs across every type of medical service category compared to full-term infants, including inpatient hospitalizations, well baby physician office visits, outpatient hospital services, home health care services and prescription drug use.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(q)
   The most frequent causes of rehospitalization for late-preterm infants are RSV bronchiolitis, bronchiolitis (cause unspecified), pneumonia (cause unspecified), esophageal reflux and vascular implant complications.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(r)
   Because all premature infants, and especially late-preterm infants born at thirty-four (34) through thirty-six (36) weeks gestational age, have higher risks for medical complications and rehospitalizations compared to full-term infants, stakeholders should examine and improve the discharge process, follow-up care and management of these infants to foster better health outcomes and lower risks for rehospitalizations and complications.”

       There was sufficient evidence presented to convict defendant of Medicaid fraud, even though a patient admitted that he had lied in the past about seeing medical providers, because the documentation provided by defendant falsely indicated that defendant had actually spoken to the providers; moreover, allowing the verdict to stand would not have sanctioned an unconscionable injustice.

Nothing in this section shall be construed to contradict the provisions of Section 43-19-101(6).

       Health insurance enrollment shall be on the form prescribed by the Department of Human Services unless a court or administrative order stipulates an alternative form of health-care coverage other than employer-based coverage. Employers must complete the employer response and return to the Department of Human Services within twenty (20) days. Employers must transfer the Medical Support Notice to Plan Administrator Part B to the appropriate group health plan providing any such health-care coverage for which the child(ren) is eligible within twenty (20) business days after the date of the notice. Employers must withhold any obligation of the employee for employee contributions necessary for coverage of the child(ren) and send any amount withheld directly to the plan. Employees may contest the withholding based on a mistake of fact. If the employee contests such withholding, the employer must initiate withholding until such time as the employer receives notice that the contest is resolved. Employers must notify the Department of Human Services promptly whenever the noncustodial parent’s employment is terminated in the same manner as required for income withholding cases.

        The employer shall allow payroll deduction for the insurance premium from the absent parent’s wages and pay the insurer.

The health insurer and employer shall allow payments to the provider of medical services, shall honor the assignment of rights to third-party sources by the Medicaid recipient and the subrogation rights of the Division of Medicaid as set forth in Section 43-13-305, Mississippi Code of 1972, and shall permit payment to the custodial parent.

       Executrix did not waive the homestead exemption by entering into a contractual relationship with the Mississippi Division of Medicaid on behalf of a decedent because the record did not support the idea that the decedent had any knowledge of the benefits a homestead exemption provided, nor that he intentionally waived his right to the benefit of that exemption since the contract did not provide any information pertaining to, or even mention, the significance of any exemption; there was no evidence of the decedent’s intent to waive any of his rights because by entering into the contract, the decedent merely acknowledged Medicaid as a creditor of his estate, which estate had no property against which Medicaid could recover. State v. Stinson (In re Estate of Darby), 68 So.3d 702, 2011 Miss. App. LEXIS 96 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 69 So.3d 767, 2011 Miss. LEXIS 419 (Miss. 2011).

       <p>
   Trial court did not err in granting an executrix summary judgment and in determining that the claim of the Mississippi Division of Medicaid was not valid against a decedent’s property because the decedent predeceased his children and a grandchild to whom he devised all of his property, and pursuant to the unambiguous language of Miss. Code Ann. §§<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.85.html#t85c03s85-3-21" target="_blank">85-3-21</a></cite>,<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.91.html#t91c01s91-1-19" target="_blank">91-1-19</a></cite>, and<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.91.html#t91c01s91-1-21" target="_blank">91-1-21</a></cite>, coupled with case law, the homestead, with its exemption, passed from the decedent to his children and grandchildren free of his debts; thus, Medicaid was not entitled to pursue a claim against the exempted property as it was not a part of the estate.

       Motion to intervene filed by the Governor of Mississippi, the Mississippi Division of Medicaid, and the Mississippi Health Care Trust Fund could not be set aside for a perceived lack of statutory or legal authority because: (1) the Governor unquestionably had not only the statutory but also the constitutional authority to intervene since the Governor was under a solemn duty to act in order to assure faithful execution of Mississippi’s laws; (2) the division had a compelling interest to see that the annual payments of $20 million were placed in the Mississippi Health Care Trust Fund because the suit was initially brought to recoup monies expended by the division; (3) the Mississippi Health Care Trust Fund was authorized to recoup funds paid to a partnership, a non-profit organization created to reduce under age smoking; and (4) the Mississippi Attorney General declined to take action.

       The purpose of this chapter is to provide for the development, implementation and oversight of a coordinated interagency system of necessary services and care for children and youth, called the Mississippi Statewide System of Care, up to age twenty-one (21) with serious emotional/behavioral disorders including, but not limited to, conduct disorders, or mental illness who require services from a multiple services and multiple programs system, and who can be successfully diverted from inappropriate institutional placement. The Mississippi Statewide System of Care is to be conducted in the most fiscally responsible (cost-efficient) manner possible, based on an individualized plan of care which takes into account other available interagency programs, including, but not limited to, Early Intervention Act of Infants and Toddlers, Section 41-87-1 et seq., Early Periodic Screening Diagnosis and Treatment, Section 43-13-117(A)(5), waivered program for home- and community-based services for developmentally disabled people, Section 43-13-117(A)(29), and waivered program for targeted case management services for children with special needs, Section 43-13-117(A)(31), those children identified through the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act of 1997 as having a serious emotional disorder (EMD), the Mississippi Children’s Health Insurance Program and waivered programs for children with serious emotional disturbances, Section 43-13-117(A)(46), and is tied to clinically and functionally appropriate outcomes. Some of the outcomes are to reduce the number of inappropriate out-of-home placements inclusive of those out-of-state and to reduce the number of inappropriate school suspensions and expulsions for this population of children. This coordinated interagency system of necessary services and care shall be named the Mississippi Statewide System of Care. Children to be served by this chapter who are eligible for Medicaid shall be screened through the Medicaid Early Periodic Screening Diagnosis and Treatment (EPSDT) and their needs for medically necessary services shall be certified through the EPSDT process. For purposes of this chapter, the Mississippi Statewide System of Care is defined as a coordinated network of agencies and providers working as a team to make a full range of mental health and other necessary services available as needed by children with mental health problems and their families. The Mississippi Statewide System of Care shall be:

       The Department of Child Protection Services shall administer a system of individualized plans, reviews and reports once every six (6) months for each child under its custody within the State of Mississippi, which document each child who has been adjudged a neglected, abandoned or abused child, including a child alleged to have experienced commercial sexual exploitation and/or human trafficking and whose custody was changed by court order as a result of that adjudication, and each public or private facility licensed by the department. The Department of Child Protection Services’ administrative review shall be completed on each child within the first three (3) months and a relative placement, fictive kin placement, or foster care review once every six (6) months after the child’s initial forty-eight-hour shelter hearing. That system shall be for the purpose of enhancing potential family life for the child by the development of individual plans to return the child to the child’s natural parent or parents, or to refer the child to the appropriate court for termination of parental rights and placement in a permanent relative’s home, adoptive home or foster/adoptive home. The goal of the Department of Child Protection Services shall be to return the child to the child’s natural parent(s) or refer the child to the appropriate court for termination of parental rights and placement in a permanent relative’s home, adoptive home or foster/adoptive home within the time periods specified in this subsection or in subsection (4) of this section. In furthering this goal, the department shall establish policy and procedures designed to appropriately place children in permanent homes, provide counseling services and other appropriate services to children who have been victims of commercial sexual exploitation or human trafficking. The policy shall include a system of reviews for all children in foster care, as follows: foster care counselors in the department shall make all possible contact with the child’s natural parent(s), custodial parent(s) of all siblings of the child, and any interested relative for the first two (2) months following the child’s entry into the foster care system, and provide care for victims of commercial sexual exploitation or human trafficking. For purposes of contacting custodial parent(s) of a sibling, siblings include those who are considered a sibling under state law, and those who would have been considered a sibling under state law, except for termination or disruption of parental rights. For any child who has been in foster care for fifteen (15) of the last twenty-two (22) months regardless of whether the foster care was continuous for all of those twenty-two (22) months, the department shall file a petition to terminate the parental rights of the child’s parents. The time period starts to run from the date the court makes a finding of abuse and/or neglect, or commercial sexual exploitation or human trafficking, or sixty (60) days from when the child was removed from his or her home, whichever is earlier. The department can choose not to file a termination of parental rights petition if the following apply:

         The department has documented compelling and extraordinary reasons why termination of parental rights would not be in the best interests of the child. Before granting or denying a request by the department for an extension of time for filing a termination of parental rights action, the court shall receive a written report on the progress which a parent of the child has made in treatment, to be made to the court in writing by a mental health/substance abuse therapist or counselor.

If this agreement has not been satisfactorily met, simultaneously the child will be referred to the appropriate court for termination of parental rights and placement in a permanent relative’s home, adoptive home or a foster/adoptive home. For children under the age of three (3) years, termination of parental rights shall be initiated within six (6) months, unless the department has documented compelling and extraordinary circumstances, and placement in a permanent relative’s home, adoptive home or foster/adoptive home within two (2) months. For children who have been abandoned under the provisions of Section 97-5-1, termination of parental rights shall be initiated within thirty (30) days and placement in an adoptive home shall be initiated without necessity for placement in a foster home. The department need not initiate termination of parental rights proceedings where the child has been placed in durable legal custody, durable legal relative guardianship, or long-term or formalized foster care by a court of competent jurisdiction.

       The Legislature recognizes that the best interests of the child require that the child be placed in the most permanent living arrangement as soon as is practicably possible. To achieve this goal, the Department of Child Protection Services is directed to conduct concurrent planning so that a permanent living arrangement may occur at the earliest opportunity. Permanent living arrangements may include prevention of placement of a child outside the home of the family when the child can be cared for at home without endangering the child’s health or safety; reunification with the family, when safe and appropriate, if temporary placement is necessary; or movement of the child toward the most permanent living arrangement and permanent legal status. When a child is placed in foster care or relative care, the department shall first ensure and document that reasonable efforts, as defined in Section 43-21-105, were made to prevent or eliminate the need to remove the child from the child’s home. The department’s first priority shall be to make reasonable efforts to reunify the family when temporary placement of the child occurs or shall request a finding from the court that reasonable efforts are not appropriate or have been unsuccessful. A decision to place a child in foster care or relative care shall be made with consideration of the child’s health, safety and best interests. At the time of placement, consideration should also be given so that if reunification fails or is delayed, the placement made is the best available placement to provide a permanent living arrangement for the child. The department shall adopt rules addressing concurrent planning for reunification and a permanent living arrangement. The department shall consider the following factors when determining appropriateness of concurrent planning:

Except in emergency circumstances as determined by the department or where the court orders placement of the child under Section 43-21-303, the foster parents, grandparents or other relatives of the child shall be given an opportunity to contest the specific reasons documented by the department at least seventy-two (72) hours before any such departure, and the court may conduct a review of that placement unless the new placement is in an adoptive home or other permanent placement. When a child is returned to foster care or relative care, the former foster parents or relative placement shall be given the prior right of return placement in order to eliminate additional trauma to the child.

       As used in this section, “emergency placement” means those limited instances when the Mississippi Department of Child Protection Services is placing a child in the home of private individuals, including relatives, neighbors or friends, as a result of a sudden unavailability of the child’s primary caretaker.
      </li>
      <li id="t43c15s43-15-14ol12">
       During an emergency placement situation when a child must be placed in home care due to the absence of parents or custodians, the Mississippi Department of Child Protection Services (MDCPS) may request that a criminal justice agency perform a federal name-based criminal history records check of each adult residing in the home. Name-based check results may be provided to the Mississippi Criminal Information Center (MCIC) of the Mississippi Department of Public Safety, which shall then provide a complete set of each adult resident’s fingerprints to the MCIC central repository for the immediate submission to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) within fifteen (15) calendar days from the date the name search was conducted. The central repository shall either positively identify the fingerprint subject or forward the fingerprints to the FBI within fifteen (15) calendar days from the date the name search was conducted. The child shall be removed from the home immediately if any adult resident fails to provide fingerprints and written permission to perform a federal criminal history records check when requested.

       When placement of a child in a home is denied as a result of a name-based criminal history records check of a resident, and the resident contests that denial, each such resident shall, within fifteen (15) calendar days, submit to MDCPS a complete set of the resident’s fingerprints with written permission allowing MCIC to forward the fingerprints to the MCIC criminal history records repository for submission to the FBI.

       The Department of Child Protection Services is authorized to make such payments as may be appropriate for supportive services to facilitate either the return of children to their natural parents or their adoption, depending upon and contingent upon the availability of the Department of Child Protection Services securing or having sufficient funds to render this supportive service. Upon court order, the parent(s) shall be responsible for reimbursing the department for any foster care or kinship care payments made on behalf of his or her child, based upon financial ability to pay, until such time as there is a termination of parental rights regarding the child, or the child is adopted.

       For those children placed in foster care by the state or county departments of human services, the department shall make monthly payments for the support of these children’s room and board, clothing, allowance and personal needs. From and after July 1, 1998, and subject to the availability of funds specifically appropriated therefor, the Department of Child Protection Services’ foster care and therapeutic care monthly payment schedule in effect before that date shall be increased by One Hundred Dollars ($100.00) per month, with that minimum payment not to preclude the department from increasing payments in later years as funds become available. From and after July 1, 1998, in order for foster parents to receive the monthly payments authorized under this subsection (2), the Department of Child Protection Services shall require foster care placements to be licensed as foster care homes and shall require prospective foster parents to satisfactorily complete an appropriate training program that emphasizes the goal of the foster care program to provide stable foster placement until a permanency outcome is achieved.

       For a child placed in the care of the child’s relative within the third degree by the state or county departments of human services, unless a child is placed in the care of a relative who is exempt from foster care training requirements, the department shall make monthly payments to defray the relative’s expense of furnishing room and board. The department’s relative care payment shall be in an amount up to one hundred percent (100%) of the amount of the foster care board payment. The department may continue to make those payments to the relative after the department relinquishes legal custody of the child to the relative if the relative has complied with foster care training requirements. Any such payments for relative care shall be subject to specific appropriation therefor by the Legislature.

The maximum for any individual family member in the dependent child’s budget may be exceeded for foster or medical care or in cases of children with an intellectual disability or a physical disability. TANF benefits granted shall be specifically limited only (a) to children existing or conceived at the time the caretaker relative initially applies and qualifies for such assistance, unless this limitation is specifically waived by the department, or (b) to a child born following a twelve-consecutive-month period of discontinued benefits by the caretaker relative.

       Pursuant to
   Section 1-1-109, the Joint Legislative Committee on Compilation, Revision and Publication of Legislation corrected an error in (3)(i).

The Joint Committee ratified the corrections at its July 24, 2014, meeting.
      </p>
      <p>

    Establishment of task force on out-of-wedlock pregnancies.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <ol>
      <li id="t43c17s43-17-35ol11">
       In the enactment of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-193), the United States Congress made the following findings relating to out-of-wedlock pregnancies:
       <ol type="a">
        <li id="t43c17s43-17-35ol11a">
         The increase of out-of-wedlock pregnancies and births is well documented.
        </li>
        <li id="t43c17s43-17-35ol11b">
         An effective strategy to combat teenage pregnancy must address the issue of male responsibility, including statutory rape culpability and prevention. The increase of teenage pregnancies among the youngest girls is particularly severe and is linked to predatory sexual practices by men who are significantly older.
        </li>
        <li id="t43c17s43-17-35ol11c">
         The negative consequences of an out-of-wedlock birth on the mother, the child, the family and society are well documented.
        </li>
        <li id="t43c17s43-17-35ol11d">
         Currently thirty-five percent (35%) of children in single-parent homes are born out of wedlock, nearly the same percentage as that of children in single-parent homes whose parents are divorced. While many parents find themselves, through divorce or tragic circumstances beyond their control, facing the difficult task of raising children alone, nevertheless, the negative consequences of raising children in single-parent homes are well documented.
        </li>
        <li id="t43c17s43-17-35ol11e">
         Therefore, in light of this demonstration of the crisis in our nation, it is the sense of the Congress that prevention of out-of-wedlock births are very important government interests and the policy contained in this legislation is intended to address the crisis.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t43c17s43-17-35ol11e2">
       The Department of Human Services shall establish a task force in compliance with Public Law 104-193, consisting of public and private organizations and individuals to review the incidence and circumstances of out-of-wedlock pregnancies in Mississippi. Based on these findings, goals will be established by the task force and a specific program will be recommended to prevent and reduce the incidence of out-of-wedlock pregnancies in Mississippi, as well as the efficiency and cost effectiveness of the program, with special emphasis on teenage pregnancies. The task force will establish numerical goals for reducing the illegitimacy ratio of the state as defined by federal law through calendar year 2005. The task force shall publish its findings and recommendations with any proposed legislation in a report to the Governor and the Legislature to be made on or before January 1, 1998.
      </li>
      <li id="t43c17s43-17-35ol11e3">
       The task force established under subsection (2) of this section shall continue in existence and shall study the effect that raising the statutory age of sexual consent to age sixteen (16) has on preventing and reducing the incidence of teenage out-of-wedlock pregnancies in Mississippi from July 1, 1998, to October 1, 2001. The task force shall consider whether raising the age of sexual consent to an age above age sixteen (16) would be more effective in preventing and reducing the incidence of teenage out-of-wedlock pregnancies in Mississippi. The task force shall publish its findings and recommendations, together with any proposed legislation, in a report to the Governor and the Legislature on or before January 1, 2002.

     <p>
      The Governor, on behalf of this state, is hereby authorized to execute a compact in substantially the following form with all other jurisdictions legally joining therein; and the legislature hereby signifies in advance its approval and ratification of such compact, which compact is as follows:
     </p>
     <p>
      INTERSTATE COMPACT ON THE PLACEMENT OF CHILDREN
     </p>
     <p>
      ARTICLE I.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is the purpose and policy of the party states to cooperate with each other in the interstate placement of children to the end that:
     </p>
     <p>
      Each child requiring placement shall receive the maximum opportunity to be placed in a suitable environment and with persons or institutions having appropriate qualifications and facilities to provide a necessary and desirable degree and type of care.
     </p>
     <p>
      The appropriate authorities in a state where a child is to be placed may have full opportunity to ascertain the circumstances of the proposed placement, thereby promoting full compliance with applicable requirements for the protection of the child.
     </p>
     <p>
      The proper authorities of the state from which the placement is made may obtain the most complete information on the basis on which to evaluate a projected placement before it is made.
     </p>
     <p>
      Appropriate jurisdictional arrangements for the care of children will be promoted.
     </p>
     <p>
      ARTICLE II.
     </p>
     <p>
      As used in this compact:
     </p>
     <p>
      “Child” means a person who, by reason of minority, is legally subject to parental, guardianship or similar control.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Sending agency” means a party state, officer or employee thereof; a subdivision of a party state, or officer or employee thereof; a court of a party state; a person, corporation, association, charitable agency or other entity which sends, brings or causes to be sent or brought any child to another party state.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Receiving state” means the state to which a child is sent, brought, or caused to be sent or brought, whether by public authorities or private persons or agencies and whether for placement with state or local public authorities or for placement with private agencies or persons.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Placement” means the arrangement for the care of a child in a family free or boarding home or in a child-caring agency or institution but does not include any institution caring for the mentally ill or mentally defective or any institution primarily educational in character, and any hospital or other medical facility.
     </p>
     <p>
      ARTICLE III.
     </p>
     <p>
      No sending agency shall send, bring or cause to be sent or brought into any other party state any child for placement in foster care or as a preliminary to a possible adoption unless the sending agency shall comply with each and every requirement set forth in this article and with the applicable laws of the receiving state governing the placement of children therein.
     </p>
     <p>
      Prior to sending, bringing or causing any child to be sent or brought into a receiving state for placement in foster care or as a preliminary to a possible adoption, the sending agency shall furnish the appropriate public authorities in the receiving state written notice of the intention to send, bring or place the child in the receiving state. The notice shall contain:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t43c18s43-18-1ol11">
       The name, date and place of birth of the child.
      </li>
      <li id="t43c18s43-18-1ol12">
       The identity and address or addresses of the parents or legal guardian.
      </li>
      <li id="t43c18s43-18-1ol13">
       The name and address of the person, agency or institution to or with which the sending agency proposes to send, bring or place the child.
      </li>
      <li id="t43c18s43-18-1ol14">
       A full statement of the reasons for such proposed action and evidence of the authority pursuant to which the placement is proposed to be made.
       <p>
        ARTICLE IV.
       </p>
       <p>
        The sending, bringing or causing to be sent or brought into any receiving state of a child in violation of the terms of this compact shall constitute a violation of the laws respecting the placement of children of both in which the sending agency is located or from which it sends or brings the child and of the receiving state. Such violation may be punished or subjected to penalty in either jurisdiction in accordance with its laws. In addition to liability for any such punishment or penalty, any such violation shall constitute full and sufficient grounds for the suspension or revocation of any license, permit or other legal authorization held by the sending agency which empowers or allows it to place or care for children.
       </p>
       <p>
        ARTICLE V.
       </p>
       <ol type="a">
        <li id="t43c18s43-18-1ol14a">
         The sending agency shall retain jurisdiction over the child sufficient to determine all matters in relation to the custody, supervision, care, treatment and disposition of the child which it would have had if the child had remained in the sending agency’s state, until the child is adopted, reaches majority, becomes self-supporting or is discharged with the concurrence of the appropriate authority in the receiving state. Such jurisdiction shall also include the power to effect or cause the return of the child or its transfer to another location and custody pursuant to law. The sending agency shall continue to have financial responsibility for support and maintenance of the child during the period of the placement. Nothing contained herein shall defeat a claim of jurisdiction by a receiving state sufficient to deal with an act of delinquency or crime committed therein.
        </li>
        <li id="t43c18s43-18-1ol14b">
         When the sending agency is a public agency, it may enter into an agreement with an authorized public or private agency in the receiving state providing for the performance of one or more services in respect of such case by the latter as agent for the sending agency.
        </li>
        <li id="t43c18s43-18-1ol14c">
         Nothing in this compact shall be construed to prevent a private charitable agency authorized to place children in the receiving state from performing services or acting as agent in that state for a private charitable agency of the sending state; nor to prevent the agency in the receiving state from discharging financial responsibility for the support and maintenance of a child who has been placed on behalf of the sending agency without relieving the responsibility set forth in paragraph (a) hereof.
         <p>
          Equivalent facilities for the child are not available in the sending agency’s jurisdiction; and
         </p>

       Where a child was given into the care of relatives in North Carolina by the Department of Human Services (DHS) under the auspices of the compact, the DHS retained jurisdiction over the child as the “sending agency,” and it was immaterial that the youth court judge “dismissed” the orders which originally gave custody to DHS. Oktibbeha County Dep't of Human Servs. v. N. G., 782 So. 2d 1226, 2001 Miss. LEXIS 33 (Miss. 2001).

      <p>
       The authority of the Department of Human Services to return a child, who had been sent to live with relatives in North Carolina, to Mississippi under the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children was not diminished by the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act as the child’s mother had not been discharged by the court and there was no decree in a Mississippi court removing permanent custody from her and granting it to the North Carolina relatives. Oktibbeha County Dep't of Human Servs. v. N. G., 782 So. 2d 1226, 2001 Miss. LEXIS 33 (Miss. 2001).

       Youth court judge can place delinquent child in out of state institution pursuant to Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children, Section 43-18-1 et seq. of the Code; but nothing in the Compact specifically authorizes law enforcement officers to maintain custody of persons outside state. Agin, March 2, 1994, A.G. Op. #93-1011.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children is applicable when a mother brings her child from another state to Mississippi and places the child with a private child placement agency, signing all the necessary forms, as the natural mother is a sending agency who brought her child from another state to Mississippi and placed the child as a disposition preliminary to a possible adoption.
   Taylor, Dec. 21, 1999, A.G. Op. #99-0308.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children is applicable when a pregnant woman comes to Mississippi and enters a program operated by a private child placement agency, the child is born and placed with the agency for adoption, and the mother returns to her home state.
   Taylor, Dec. 21, 1999, A.G. Op. #99-0308.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children might apply when a child is located in Mississippi, an out-of-state adoptive couple travels to Mississippi and adopts the child in Mississippi, and having received a final decree of adoption, they return to their home state with the child, if the child was initially located in Mississippi from across state lines or placed in Mississippi by out-of-state parties.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The Department of Human Services is hereby authorized and empowered to establish a single and separate Child Support Unit for the following purposes:
     </p>
     <p>
      To develop and implement a nonsupport and paternity program and institute proceedings in the name of the Department of Human Services or in the name of the recipient in any court of competent jurisdiction in any county where the mother of the child resides or is found, in the county where the father resides or is found, or in the county where the child resides or is found;
     </p>
     <p>
      To secure and collect support by any method authorized under state law and establish paternity for any child or children receiving aid from the department any form of public assistance, including, but not limited to, medical assistance, foster care, food stamps, TANF, or any other program under the federal Social Security Act, from a parent or any other person legally liable for such support who has either failed or refused to provide support, deserted, neglected or abandoned the child or children, including cooperating with other states in establishing paternity, locating absent parents and securing compliance with court orders for support of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) children; the department may petition the court for the inclusion of health insurance as part of any child support order on behalf of any child receiving aid from the department unless good cause for noncooperation, as defined by the Social Security Act or the Mississippi Department of Human Services, is established. Unless notified to the contrary, whenever a child or children for whom child support services have been provided ceases to receive public assistance, the department will continue to provide services and establish paternity, secure and collect such support payments from a parent or any other person legally liable for such support in accordance with the standards prescribed pursuant to the federal Social Security Act;

      To accept applications for child support enforcement services to establish paternity, secure and collect support from any proper party or person as defined by Title IV-D of the federal Social Security Act notwithstanding the fact that the child or children do not currently receive or have never received public assistance. The department shall have the authority to secure and collect support by any method authorized under state law and establish paternity for any child or children on behalf of a recipient of child support services, including individuals who do not currently receive or have never received public assistance from a parent or any other person legally liable for such support who has either failed or refused to provide support, deserted, neglected or abandoned the child or children, including cooperating with other states in establishing paternity, locating absent parents and securing compliance with court orders for support; the department may petition the court for the inclusion of health insurance as part of any child support order on behalf of such recipients of child support services. The proceeds of any collections resulting from such application shall be distributed in accordance with the standards prescribed in the federal Social Security Act;
     </p>
     <p>
      The department shall seek to recover from the individual who owes a support obligation to any individual who is a recipient of Title IV-D services as set forth in paragraph (b) or (c) on whose behalf the department is providing services, upon judicial proceedings conducted thereon after advance notice to such obligor, reasonable attorney’s fees and court costs, in excess of any administrative fees collected and in excess of amounts of current support owed by the obligor, which the department incurs in recovering and collecting the support obligation, such costs and fees as the department recovers to be deposited in the Special Fund of the Mississippi Department of Human Services which is hereby established for the pursuit and collection of child support;

     </p>
     <p>
      To have full responsibility in the aforementioned cases for initiating actions under the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act and for responding to the actions of other jurisdictions under said law when Mississippi is the responding state; however, this shall not impair private litigants’ rights to proceed under any applicable interstate enforcement mechanisms;
     </p>

The Central Receipting and Disbursement Unit shall be operated by the Department of Human Services or any financial institution having operations and qualified to do business in Mississippi, whose deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The department shall conduct cost-benefit analyses to determine and utilize the more cost efficient manner of operating the unit;
     </p>
     <p>

     </p>
     <p>
      2. Such tracking system shall include: 1. the names, residential and mailing addresses, telephone numbers, Social Security numbers, driver’s license numbers and dates of birth of each child and parent named in or subject to the court order; 2. the court cause number of the action; 3. name, address and telephone number of employer; 4. any restraining or protective order indicating domestic violence; and 5. any other information which may be used for the purpose of identifying any person named in or subject to the order or for the purposes of establishing, enforcing or modifying a child support order;
     </p>
     <p>
      To take administrative actions relating to genetic testing, determine paternity, establish child support orders, modification of child support orders, income withholding, liens and subpoenas without the necessity of obtaining an order from any judicial or other administrative tribunal with respect to cases initiated or enforced by the department pursuant to Title IV-D of the Social Security Act;
     </p>
     <p>
      To have the authority to use high-volume automated administrative enforcement in interstate cases to the same extent as used for intrastate cases, in response to a request made by another state to enforce support orders; and
     </p>
     <p>
      To provide any child support enforcement or other service as may be required by the United States of America, Department of Health and Human Services, Family Support Administration, Office of Child Support Enforcement or their successor pursuant to federal law or regulation.

       In simultaneous divorce and paternity actions, the biological father sought to have parental rights terminated, and the husband, who believed for years that the husband was the child’s father, sought to be declared the child’s legal father, but joinder of claims was not allowed, and with regard to the separate paternity action, the biological father was ordered to pay child support until some further order in the divorce proceedings supplanted that obligation.

       Proper venue for an action involving determination of paternity would be the county where the father resides if he resides or is domiciled within the state, even though the action also involved a determination of child support, for which proper venue would be the county of the mother’s residence, the county of the father’s residence, or the county of the child’s residence.

      </h4>
      <p>
       Chancery court did not er in awarding a retroactive increase in child-support payments or in choosing the date the mother initially filed her separate petition for child support to implement the retroactive increase because the decision was a discretionary call. McKinney v. Hamp, 268 So.3d 470, 2018 Miss. LEXIS 59 (Miss. 2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       Substantial credible evidence supported a chancellor’s child support award because the chancellor properly considered an obligor father’s existing expenses and debts by considering the father’s business expenses and the father’s separate child support obligation and an obligee mother’s income, and Section 43-19-101’s guidelines were inappropriate in this particular case, and it was not an abuse of discretion to deny an upward retroactive modification.

   Under Miss.

      <p>
       Chancellor erred in allowing a retroactive downward modification to a father’s child-support obligation dating back to the hearing where his testified indicating his desire not to have a relationship with his father; thus, the father was required to continue payments until the judgment ordering modification was entered. Finch v. Finch, 137 So.3d 227, 2014 Miss. LEXIS 33 (Miss. 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancellor did not err in temporarily reducing the father’s child support for a year because he could pay the amount he had voluntarily agreed was needed to support his two children by rearranging his priorities, financial affairs, and employment; however, downward retroactive modification of child support was prohibited. Frazier v. Frazier, 136 So.3d 1068, 2013 Miss. App. LEXIS 395 (Miss. Ct. App. 2013), cert. denied, 136 So.3d 437, 2014 Miss. LEXIS 220 (Miss. 2014), cert. denied, 2014 Miss. LEXIS 221 (Miss.

       Because a mother assigned the mother’s rights as payee to the Mississippi Department of Human Services by participation in Mississippi’s Aid to Families with Dependent Children public assistance program prior to a youth court’s reunification of custody order, a chancellor did not err in ordering disbursement of the collected child support to the various custodial family members. Vance v. Miss. Dep't of Human Servs. (Child Support Div.), 203 So.3d 11, 2016 Miss. App. LEXIS 667 (Miss. Ct. App. 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where two earlier paternity actions had been dismissed due to the the mother’s non-cooperation, the dismissal with prejudice of the third petition on collateral estoppel and res judicata grounds was error, as the interests of the mother and children were not “substantially identical,” and the children could not be faulted for the mother’s failure to cooperate with the genetic testing. Miss. Dep't of Human Servs. ex rel. Allen v. Sanford, 850 So. 2d 86, 2003 Miss. LEXIS 210 (Miss. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       Department of Public Welfare has authority to sue to enforce support of indigent children by action against non-supporting parent, because Department of Public Welfare is subrogated to rights of custodial parent against non-supporting parent. Statute provides that by accepting public assistance, parent is deemed to have assigned to Department of Public Welfare any right she may have to child support from other parent. Hull v. State Dep't of Public Welfare, 515 So. 2d 1205, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2930 (Miss. 1987).

       Since Child Support Unit is mandated by Section 43-19-31 (c) and (d) to initiate child support actions and to collect child support for non-AFDC recipients, and since Section 43-19-35 (3) mandates that any attorney initiating legal proceedings under Section 43-19-31 represents Department of Human Services exclusively with no attorney-client relationship existing between recipient of services and attorney, then there is no attorney-client relationship with recipients of either AFDC or non-AFDC services.

      The mother or father are competent to testify at the trial against the other as provided in Section 13-1-5 subject to the provisions of the Mississippi Rules of Evidence governing the husband-wife privilege. If a parent called for examination declines to answer upon the grounds that his testimony may incriminate him, the court may require him to answer, in which event he shall not thereafter be prosecuted for any criminal acts involved in the conception of the child whose paternity is in issue and/or for whom support is sought, except for perjury committed in his testimony.

     </h3>
     <p>
      For purposes of this section, an “authorized person” shall mean:
     </p>
     <p>
      Any agent or attorney of any state having in effect a plan approved under federal law, who has the duty or authority under such plan to seek to recover any amounts owed as child and spousal support (including, when authorized under the state plan, any official of a political subdivision);
     </p>
     <p>
      The court which has authority to issue an order or to serve as the initiating court in an action to seek an order against a noncustodial parent of the support and maintenance of a child, or any agent of such court;
     </p>
     <p>
      The resident parent, legal guardian, attorney or agent of a child (other than a child receiving federal assistance as determined by federal regulation) without regard to the existence of a court order against a noncustodial parent who has a duty to support and maintain any such child;
     </p>
     <p>
      A state agency that is administering a program operated under a state plan approved under federal law;
     </p>
     <p>
      Any agent or attorney of any state having an agreement under this section, who has the duty or authority under the law of such state to enforce a child custody or visitation determination;
     </p>
     <p>
      Any court having jurisdiction to make or enforce such a child custody or visitation determination, or any agent of such court; and
     </p>
     <p>
      Any agent or attorney of the United States, or of a state having an agreement under this section, who has the duty or authority to investigate, enforce or bring a prosecution with respect to the unlawful taking or restraint of a child.
     </p>
     <p>
      The department shall safeguard personal data if the department is provided with reasonable evidence of a risk of harm. A state agency, court, department of another state, obligor, obligee and such other persons or entities as the department may specify may provide the department with reasonable evidence of a risk of harm in such manner as the department may require. The department shall not be required to safeguard personal data in intrastate cases for longer than one (1) year unless the department is provided with reasonable evidence of a continued risk of harm in such manner as the department may require. The department shall notify individuals whose personal data is safeguarded under this section that in order for the safeguards to remain in effect, such individuals must provide the department annually with reasonable evidence of a continued risk of harm. For the purposes of this section “reasonable evidence of a risk of harm” shall mean reasonable evidence that the release of information may result in physical harm to the parent or child, that the release of information may result in emotional harm to the parent or child which would significantly reduce the parent’s capacity to care for the child, or would significantly reduce the parent or child’s ability to function adequately, or that a protective order or restraining order has been issued on behalf of the parent or child.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the department is provided with reasonable evidence of a risk of harm, the department, its employees and its contractors shall not disclose any personal data that could otherwise be disclosed about the location of a parent or child, including residential address, telephone number and name, address and telephone number of employer, and shall not disclose the Social Security number of a parent or child; provided, however, that such personal data may be shared by and between employees of the department and its contractors; provided further, that the department may disclose such personal data to the Federal Parent Locator Service, to the court, or agent of a court that is authorized to receive information from the Federal Parent Locator Service established pursuant to Title IV-D of the Social Security Act.
     </p>
     <p>
      Provided further, that the department may disclose the Social Security number of a child receiving IV-D services for the purposes directly connected to obtaining health care coverage for such child to an employer or provider of health care coverage.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the department is provided with reasonable evidence of a risk of harm pursuant to this section, the department shall notify the Federal Parent Locator Service established pursuant to Title IV-D of the Social Security Act that a risk of harm exists. Upon order of the court in an intrastate matter the department shall release personal data, which may include location information and Social Security numbers, to such court or agent, as required by said Title IV-D of the Social Security Act; provided, however, that if the department has been provided with reasonable evidence of a risk of harm, the department shall notify the court or agent that the department has received such information; before making any disclosure of such personal data, the court is required to determine whether such disclosure to any other person could be harmful to the parent or child. A person or agency seeking disclosure of personal data which the department is prohibited from disclosing because of a risk of harm, but which could otherwise be disclosed, may file a petition with the chancery court to request disclosure of such personal data.
     </p>
     <p>
      Upon an order by the court in interstate cases to override nondisclosure procedures in cases dealing with domestic violence, the court shall order the department to release this information within thirty (30) days of the order. Whereupon, the department shall transmit said court order to the Federal Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE), Federal Parent Locator Service (FPLS), whereby OCSE will notify the department of its decision to remove the nondisclosure code. Upon notification from OCSE, the department shall release said information unto the court.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any unauthorized disclosure or unauthorized willful inspection made in a good faith effort to comply with this section shall not be considered a violation of this section.
     </p>
     <p>
      A person or agency, including the department, seeking personal data which the department is prohibited from disclosing because of a risk of harm, but which could otherwise be disclosed or which the Federal Parent Locator Service established pursuant to Title IV-D of the Social Security Act is prohibited from disclosing because the Secretary of the Federal Department of Health and Human Services has been notified that there is a reasonable evidence of domestic violence or child abuse, may file a petition with the court where the person resides to request disclosure of such personal data. The petition shall specify the purpose for which such personal data is required. When a petition is filed, or when the court receives notice from the department that the department has been notified of a risk of harm, the court shall determine whether disclosure of personal data could be harmful to the parent or child before releasing such data to any other person or agency. In making such determination, the court shall notify the parent that the court has received a request to release personal data and shall provide a specific date by which the parent must object to release of the information and provide the basis for objection. The parent may provide such information in writing and shall not be required to appear in person to contest the release of information. The court shall also notify the department of any petition filed pursuant to this section and the department shall release to the court any information which it has been provided regarding the risk of harm; however, the department shall not be made a party to the action. Further, the attorney for the Department of Human Services, in any proceeding herein, shall not be deemed to be appearing in a representative capacity for any party. The court may also request information directly from the Federal Parent Locator Service from the department of another state, and from any other source.
     </p>
     <p>
      In determining whether disclosure of personal data could be harmful to the parent or child, the court shall consider any relevant information provided by the parent or child, any information provided by the department or by the department of another state, and any evidence provided by the person seeking the personal data. Documentary evidence transmitted to the court by facsimile, telecopier or other means that do not provide an original writing may not be excluded from evidence on an objection based on the means of transmission. The court may permit a party or witness to be deposed or to testify by telephone, audiovisual means, or other electronic means.
     </p>
     <p>
      The court may enter an order (1) impounding the personal data and prohibiting any disclosure by the court or its agents, (2) permitting disclosure by the court or its agents to a specific person or persons, or (3) removing any restrictions on disclosure by the court and its agents. An order permitting disclosure of personal data may specify the purposes for which the data may be used and may prohibit a person to whom the data is disclosed from making further disclosures to any other person. The court shall notify the department of any order entered pursuant to this section. Any person or agency who violates an order issued pursuant to this section may be held in contempt of court and subject to the penalties provided herein.
     </p>
     <p>
      The court may disclose location information about a parent for the limited purpose of notifying the parent of a proceeding under this section or of any other proceeding in court, provided that such information shall not be disclosed to another party unless the court issues an order pursuant to this section permitting such disclosure.

The recipient of an administrative subpoena shall supply the Child Support Unit, other state and federal IV-D agencies, its attorneys, investigators, probation officers, county or district attorneys in this state, all information relative to the location, employment, employment-related benefits including, but not limited to, availability of medical insurance, income and property of such parents and alleged parents and with all information on hand relative to the location and prosecution of any person who has, by means of a false statement or misrepresentation or by impersonation or other fraudulent device, obtained Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) to which he or she was not entitled, notwithstanding any provision of law making such information confidential. The Mississippi Department of Information Technology Services and any other agency in this state using the facilities of the Mississippi Department of Information Technology Services are directed to permit the Child Support Unit access to their files, inclusive of those maintained for other state agencies, for the purpose of locating absent and nonsupporting parents and alleged parents, except to the extent that any such access would violate any valid federal statute or regulation issued pursuant thereto. The Child Support Unit, other state and federal IV-D agencies, its attorneys, investigators, probation officers, or county or district attorneys, shall use such information only for the purpose of investigating or enforcing the support liability of such absent parents or alleged parents or for the prosecution of other persons mentioned herein. Neither the Child Support Unit nor those authorities shall use the information, or disclose it, for any other purpose. All records maintained pursuant to the provisions of Sections 43-19-31 through 43-19-53 shall be confidential and shall be available only to the Child Support Unit, other state and federal IV-D agencies, the attorneys, investigators and other staff employed or under contract under Sections 43-19-31 through 43-19-53, district or county attorneys, probation departments, child support units in other states, and courts having jurisdiction in paternity, support or abandonment proceedings. The Child Support Unit may release to the public the name, photo, last-known address, arrearage amount and other necessary information of a parent who has a judgment against him for child support and is currently in arrears in the payment of this support. Such release may be included in a “Most Wanted List” or other media in order to solicit assistance.

       Persons wishing to contest the imposition of an administrative civil penalty under the provisions of Laws, 1997, Chapter 588, shall be entitled to a hearing before the Director of the Department of Human Services or his designee by so requesting within twenty (20) days after receiving notice of the imposition of the administratively imposed civil penalty. The request shall identify the civil penalty contested and legibly state the contestant’s name, mailing address and home and daytime phone numbers. The date, time and place for the hearing shall be made as convenient as possible for the contestant, who shall receive notice thereof not less than seven (7) days before the hearing. A hearing on whether to impose a civil penalty and to consider circumstances in mitigation shall be held on the time and the place specified in the notice. The contestant may appear in person, through his attorney or, prior to the date set for the hearing, submit written testimony and other evidence, subject to the penalty for false swearing, for entry in the hearing record.

      <li id="t43c19s43-19-58ol12">
       After the hearing, the director or his designee shall issue his order, which may be appealed to the chancery court of the county in which the contestant resides in the same manner as is provided by law for appeals originating from county courts.

      <li id="t43c19s43-19-58ol13">
       The director or his designee may file the order assessing the penalty, or a certified copy of the order, with the clerk of any chancery court in the state after expiration of the time in which an appeal may be taken, or final determination of the matter on appeal, whereupon the order assessing the penalty shall be enrolled on the judgment roll and may be enforced in the same manner as a judgment.

       Chancellor did not commit manifest error in obligating a husband to pay for his children’s college expenses because the husband was more than able to provide his children with collegiate education commensurate with their parents’ station in life and had already set up and partially funded college-expense trust funds for the children; the record was silent as to any material change that the husband might have suffered or how the payments of college expenses would be a financial hardship on him.
   Descher v. Descher, — So.3d —, 2020 Miss. App. LEXIS 12 (Miss. Ct. App. Jan. 14, 2020).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancellor properly required a husband to provide a one million dollar life insurance policy to ensure continued support of the parties’ two minor children because the life insurance policy protected the children and the anticipated support obligation if their paying parent prematurely died; if the husband died before the potential future child support was fully paid, the children would lose that support. Descher v. Descher, — So.3d —, 2020 Miss. App. LEXIS 12 (Miss. Ct. App. Jan. 14, 2020).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancery court properly included a father’s signing bonus as part of his gross income when crafting a child-support award because the bonus had already been received, and it was reasonably expected to be available as contemplated by the statute; the father’s signing bonus accounted for a major guaranteed portion of his income as a professional athlete. McKinney v. Hamp, 268 So.3d 470, 2018 Miss. LEXIS 59 (Miss. 2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancery court was incorrect about the duration of a father’s NFL contract because the bulk of the of the record supported that the NFL contract was for four years, not five; therefore, the case was remanded for the chancellor to recalculate the child-support order to reflect the father’s contract as a four-year contract. McKinney v. Hamp, 268 So.3d 470, 2018 Miss. LEXIS 59 (Miss. 2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancellor retained the discretion to classify a mother’s lump-sum alimony as part of the mother’s income when calculating the mother’s child-support obligation when one of the parties’ children began living with the father. Davis v. Davis, 222 So.3d 1101, 2017 Miss. App. LEXIS 41 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 223 So.3d 786, 2017 Miss. LEXIS 302 (Miss. 2017).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Remand of a chancellor’s award of child support for further proceedings was necessary because the chancellor’s statement was not enough to satisfy the requirements of Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c19s43-19-101ol14" target="_self">43-19-101(4)</a></cite> as the chancellor did not disclose the basis for the calculations. This required the chancellor to state whether the award was based on the statutory child-support guidelines and to discuss the reasonableness of the award. O'Brien v. O'Brien, 149 So.3d 508, 2014 Miss. App. LEXIS 69 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 151 So.3d 1017, 2014 Miss. LEXIS 523 (Miss. 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       It was within a chancellor’s discretion to find that a former spouse’s adjusted gross income was not to be calculated based on an earning potential that the spouse, who was an emergency room physician, could only realize by working additional shifts at a hospital and thereby placing the spouse’s patients in potential danger from the spouse’s fatigue. Crittenden v. Crittenden, 129 So.3d 947, 2013 Miss. App. LEXIS 855 (Miss. Ct. App. 2013).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c19s43-19-101ol13a" target="_self">43-19-101(3)(a)</a></cite>, the father’s workers’ compensation benefits were income for child support assessment. Chapman v. Ward, 3 So.3d 790, 2008 Miss. App. LEXIS 808 (Miss. Ct. App. 2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       Award of $2,000 per month in child support was not reversed on appeal where the evidence showed that this was almost twenty percent of a father’s income, and he could have earned more since he was a physician. Henderson v. Henderson, 952 So. 2d 273, 2006 Miss. App. LEXIS 869 (Miss. Ct. App. 2006), cert. denied, 951 So. 2d 563, 2007 Miss. LEXIS 165 (Miss. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       As the original divorce agreement between the parents did not include a provision for child support, the chancellor was required to treat the mother’s motion as an initial award of child support, and both parents were obligated to provide financially for their child; the father, as the non-custodial parent, had to provide his child with 14 percent of his adjusted gross income. Forrest v. McCoy, 941 So. 2d 889, 2006 Miss. App. LEXIS 810 (Miss. Ct. App. 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancellor’s findings were sufficient to support an award of 22 percent of the husband’s reported adjusted gross income plus one-half of the children’s parochial school tuition where the husband earned in excess of $50,000 per year when bonuses and cash income received from plumbing jobs were included, the order to pay $800 per month in child support was based only on the husband’s reported income from his business, the children had always attended parochial school, and the husband’s mistress was a teacher at the public school where the twins would attend if they were taken out of parochial school. Seymour v. Seymour, 960 So. 2d 513, 2006 Miss. App. LEXIS 805 (Miss. Ct. App. 2006), cert. denied, 959 So. 2d 1051, 2007 Miss. LEXIS 382 (Miss. 2007).

       <p>
   As to
   Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c19s43-19-101ol13d" target="_self">43-19-101(3)(d)</a></cite>, even in those instances where an adjustment may be warranted, the statute does not reference the percentages enumerated in the child support guidelines; rather, it is within the chancellor’s discretion to determine an amount appropriate to the needs of the child or children. Further, §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c19s43-19-101ol13d" target="_self">43-19-101(3)(d)</a></cite> did not require the chancellor to make an adjustment to gross income for children living with the parent ordered to pay child support.
   Magruder v. Magruder, 881 So. 2d 365, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 875 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Difference between the statutory guideline figure of $ 559 and the $ 500 awarded by the chancellor amounted to $ 708 per year and could be considered a contribution to the health insurance coverage the father was required to provide for the three children. Since he was the custodial parent of two of the three children, the latter interpretation was consistent with the requirements of Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c19s43-19-101" target="_self">43-19-101</a></cite>. Magruder v. Magruder, 881 So. 2d 365, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 875 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Chancellor’s award of $ 824 a month in child support to the wife in a divorce action was exactly the 20 percent of the husband’s income called for by the child support guidelines set forth in Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c19s43-19-101" target="_self">43-19-101</a></cite>, and was not excessive; as the award was in accordance with the guidelines, the chancellor was not required to make specific findings justifying the award. Gable v. Gable, 846 So. 2d 296, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 461 (Miss. Ct. App. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Sufficient evidence supported the chancellor’s child support award where the chancellor used the father’s most recent paycheck to determine his gross income and made all the required statutory deductions to determine the father’s gross adjusted income was $1,600 a month; if multiplied by 14 percent, the correct percentage under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c19s43-19-101" target="_self">43-19-101</a></cite>, the total monthly child support equaled $224, which was the amount the father was ordered to pay. McClee v. Simmons, 834 So. 2d 61, 2002 Miss. App. LEXIS 809 (Miss. Ct. App. 2002).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   In a divorce proceeding, court-ordered medical and dental insurance for a child and the other means of support the father was ordered to provide for the child were not mandatory within the meaning of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c19s43-19-101" target="_self">43-19-101</a></cite>; therefore, the chancellor did not commit error in declining to consider these payments when he made his statutory calculation of child support. Wells v. Wells, 800 So. 2d 1239, 2001 Miss. App. LEXIS 495 (Miss. Ct. App. 2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   There is no provision in Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c19s43-19-101ol13" target="_self">43-19-101(3)</a></cite> for the deduction of general monthly expenses; therefore, compliance with the child support guidelines mandated that the father’s child support should have been calculated without the $716 deduction for monthly expenses. Laird v. Blackburn, 788 So. 2d 844, 2001 Miss. App. LEXIS 237 (Miss. Ct. App. 2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       In determining the adjusted gross income of the payor husband, who was a dentist, the court properly took into account that he attempted to divert income to his current wife, who was a registered nurse and who worked in his office as an office manager and medical director, by paying her a salary equal to his. Stroud v. Stroud, 758 So. 2d 502, 2000 Miss. App. LEXIS 209 (Miss. Ct. App. 2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       The chancellor did not intentionally deviate from the statutory guidelines, notwithstanding that the award was greater than that required by the guidelines with respect to the income reported by the husband, where the chancellor attempted to follow the statutory guidelines and the husband hid assets and income. Clark v. Clark, 754 So. 2d 450, 1999 Miss. LEXIS 345 (Miss. 1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Health, transportation, and college expenses are not included in determining the amount of support under the guidelines, although such extra obligations could well be considered for a downward departure from the guidelines under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c19s43-19-103" target="_self">43-19-103</a></cite>. Kilgore v. Fuller, 741 So. 2d 351, 1999 Miss. App. LEXIS 247 (Miss. Ct. App. 1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       The disparity in the income of the parents and the age of the minor child, who was five years old at the time of the hearing, supported the chancellor awarding child support to the custodial father in an amount less than the statutory guideline of fourteen percent of the mother’s adjusted gross income, especially as the mother testified that she was willing to pay the child’s monthly tuition to attend a church kindergarten. McGehee v. Upchurch, 733 So. 2d 364, 1999 Miss. App. LEXIS 53 (Miss. Ct. App. 1999).
      </p>

       A chancellor’s pronouncement of “broad discretion in setting the amount of child support” is true only to the extent that the award comports with the guidelines or if the deviation is supported by substantial evidence and buttressed by specific, findings in the record. Osborn v. Osborn, 724 So. 2d 1121, 1998 Miss. App. LEXIS 994 (Miss. Ct. App. 1998).

       While the statute allows the trial court to deduct the expenses of a child living in the non-custodial parent’s home the deduction is purely discretionary. Bailey v. Bailey, 724 So. 2d 335, 1998 Miss. LEXIS 586 (Miss. 1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       The court did not err in awarding child support to the wife and in ordering the husband to pay their child’s private school tuition where (1) the total of the amount to be paid by the husband closely approximated 14 percent of his gross income, (2) the parties agreed that their child should continue in private school, and (3) the child’s basic needs were still adequately provided for in light of the total amount ordered and the financial disclosures of the parties. Collins v. Collins, 722 So. 2d 596, 1998 Miss. LEXIS 523 (Miss. 1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       The court remanded for a determination of the appropriate amount of child support under the statute since one party had income under $5,000 and the chancellor’s written findings were insufficient where he stated only that “There is no exact mathematical precision to this decision, but, considering all of the financial information available to the court and the circumstances of the parents, the circumstances of the child, this amount is fair and appropriate.” Delozier v. Delozier, 724 So. 2d 984, 1998 Miss. App. LEXIS 1069 (Miss. Ct. App. 1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       The court would reverse and remand since the chancellor deviated from the statutory guidelines without specific written findings of fact where the child support award was based, not upon adjusted gross income, but upon the income which remained to the father after payment of his bills. Osborn v. Osborn, 724 So. 2d 1121, 1998 Miss. App. LEXIS 994 (Miss. Ct. App. 1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       The chancellor properly deviated from the guidelines and set an award of child support on the basis of the unemployed husband’s earning potential, which the court equated with the amount earned by the wife. White v. White, 722 So. 2d 731, 1998 Miss. App. LEXIS 813 (Miss. Ct. App. 1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where temporary financial reverses create an unreliable measure for an award of child support, the chancellor may in his discretion deviate from the guidelines and predicate an award on reasonable earning capacity. White v. White, 722 So. 2d 731, 1998 Miss. App. LEXIS 813 (Miss. Ct. App. 1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       The chancellor made written findings that were sufficient to rebut the presumption that the guidelines were appropriate and to justify a slight variance from them where the court found that the excess amount awarded was justified by the fact that the husband was being allowed to claim one of the children as a tax deduction and that the husband would have as much income after paying child support as the wife would have including child support. Johnston v. Johnston, 722 So. 2d 453, 1998 Miss. LEXIS 457 (Miss. 1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although there was nothing inherently wrong with the conclusion of the court not to award child support based on the fact that the husband earned only $180 per month, the matter was remanded since there was no written reference to the guidelines being bypassed and no explanation as to why. Rakestraw v. Rakestraw, 717 So. 2d 1284, 1998 Miss. App. LEXIS 159 (Miss. Ct. App. 1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the court did not relate in its decree or otherwise give proof of financial ability to the award in excess of that required by the guidelines and made no findings with regard to the needs of the children, the award was manifestly erroneous. Clausel v. Clausel, 714 So. 2d 265, 1998 Miss. LEXIS 268 (Miss. 1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       The court erred when it calculated the father’s monthly gross income without subtracting the legally mandated deductions for taxes, social security, and non-voluntary retirement and disability contributions; however, the father was not entitled to have paycheck deductions for medical insurance, 401K retirement fund, and credit union account deducted. Lee v. Stewart by & Through Summerville, 724 So. 2d 1093, 1998 Miss. App. LEXIS 1017 (Miss. Ct. App. 1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancellor was required to enter written findings in support of upward deviation from child support guidelines, and such findings had to be specific with regard to reasons that guideline amount would be unjust or inappropriate. Knutson v. Knutson, 704 So. 2d 1331, 1997 Miss. LEXIS 740 (Miss. 1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       Father’s and wife’s children, who lived at home with father and wife, were not “children due support” from father for purposes of child support award guidelines, and thus father’s other child, who was living with that child’s mother, was entitled to 14% of father’s adjusted gross income (AGI). Grace v. Department of Human Servs., 687 So. 2d 1232, 1997 Miss. LEXIS 32 (Miss. 1997), overruled,
   Bailey v. Bailey, 724 So. 2d 335, 1998 Miss. LEXIS 586 (Miss. 1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       Guidelines are not mandatory as to specific need or support required, and chancellor is to make determination based on facts he hears, witnesses he views, and circumstances of the parties, especially the child. Bruce v. Bruce, 687 So. 2d 1199, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 484 (Miss. 1996), overruled in part, Short v. Short, 131 So.3d 1149, 2014 Miss. LEXIS 85 (Miss. 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   A $350 per month award to be paid by a father for the support of his 3 children was manifestly erroneous where the father’s adjusted gross income based on his salary, which was his only significant and reliable source of income, was approximately $2,350 per month, the guidelines set forth in §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.99.html#t99c19s99-19-101" target="_blank">99-19-101</a></cite> suggested that he should pay $495 per month in child support, and the chancellor failed to make a specific finding on the record that application of the statutory guidelines would be unjust or inappropriate. Draper v. Draper, 658 So. 2d 866, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 362 (Miss. 1995).

   A chancellor did not err in deviating from the child support guidelines set forth in §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c19s43-19-101" target="_self">43-19-101</a></cite> when determining the amount of support to be paid by a father where she stated her reasons for departing from the guidelines, including the fact that there was “considerable question as to the actual earnings” of the father. Grogan v. Grogan, 641 So. 2d 734, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 315 (Miss. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       A chancellor did not abuse her discretion in ordering a father to pay $600 per month for the support of 2 children, in spite of the father’s argument that $600 per month constituted 27.5 percent of his adjusted gross income which was 7.5 percent greater than the percentage suggested by the statutory guidelines, where the mother’s monthly net income was $1,168, her monthly expenses were $2,225, the chancellor was skeptical as to the father’s true earnings, and the evidence suggested that the father had some alternative source of support that he had not disclosed.

       <p>
   A chancellor did not abuse his discretion in ordering a father to pay $300 in child support for his 14-year-old son, in spite of the father’s argument that the amount was excessive because it exceeded 14 percent of his adjusted gross income which was above the statutory guidelines for one child set forth in §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c19s43-19-101" target="_self">43-19-101</a></cite>, where the record indicated that the father would be able to support himself as well as pay child support in the amount awarded.

      </p>
      <p>
       A chancellor erred in awarding child support to be paid by the father in the amount of $1,000 per month where the father earned approximately $8,000 per month, and it appeared that the chancellor had used $4,155 as the figure for the father’s. Brennan v. Brennan, 638 So. 2d 1320, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 331 (Miss. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   A child support award to be paid by a mother for the support of one child was not excessive where the mother’s income was almost triple that of the father’s, and the chancellor followed the guidelines set out in §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c19s43-19-101" target="_self">43-19-101</a></cite> and awarded the 14 percent of adjusted gross income suggested by the statute for the support of a single child.

      </p>
      <p>
       It was manifest error and an abuse of discretion for a chancellor to find that there had been no material or substantial change in circumstances warranting a modification of a father’s child support payments where the father suffered a heart attack approximately one year after the original decree was entered which resulted in a precipitous decline in his income, the father would be required to pay over 1/2 of his income in child support payments if the original decree were not modified, and the statutory child support guidelines’ suggestion and the actual child support ordered constituted a difference of nearly $500.00 a month. McEwen v. McEwen, 631 So. 2d 821, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 77 (Miss. 1994).

   A chancellor abused his discretion in ordering a father to pay child support in the amount of $520 per month where, pursuant to the guidelines set forth in §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c19s43-19-101" target="_self">43-19-101</a></cite>, the child support should have been $362 per month, and the father’s expenses exceeded his net income by almost $250 a month.

      </p>
      <p>
       Although a chancellor’s award of child support to be paid by a father was not, standing alone, an abuse of discretion, the amount awarded for child support was an abuse of discretion when considered in conjunction with the alimony award and the income of the father. McEachern v. McEachern, 605 So. 2d 809, 1992 Miss. LEXIS 479 (Miss. 1992).

       <p>
   An increase in a father’s child support obligation from $300 to $750 per month was excessive and unsupported by the evidence in the record, even though the father’s income and resources had increased over time, where the mother’s income had also steadily increased, the child had not required any extraordinary or unexpected care or treatment, there was no evidence that any of the child’s needs had gone unmet, the child’s actual expenses averaged approximately $260 per month, and utilization of the child support guidelines set forth in §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c19s43-19-101" target="_self">43-19-101</a></cite> produced a monthly figure of approximately $583.

      </p>
      <p>
       Section 43-19-101, which sets forth child support award guidelines, is only a guideline and may not determine the specific need or the specific support required; the determination of the amount of support needed must be made by a chancellor who hears all the facts, views the witnesses, and is informed at trial of the circumstances of the parties and particularly the circumstances of the child.

   There was no error in a chancellor’s decision to leave a father’s child support obligation at $250 per month where the father argued that his salary had declined drastically from that earned in previous years but there was an indication that this was a voluntary choice of the father’s, the father argued that his monthly support burden should be at least $80 less in accordance with the guidelines of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c19s43-19-101" target="_self">43-19-101</a></cite>, and the wife argued that her monthly expenses outstripped her income by approximately $600 each month but she had received an increase in monthly income since the final decree. Caldwell v. Caldwell, 579 So. 2d 543, 1991 Miss. LEXIS 236 (Miss. 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       A child support award of $400 per month for one 6-year-old child was excessive where the father, who had custody of the child, only asked for $100 per month in child support, the chancellor recognized that $400 per month was not required at the time for child support, and both parents had approximately the same earnings. The chancellor should have considered the amount of money which reasonably should have been required in child support from each parent, but apparently considered only the guidelines developed by the Governor’s Commission on Child Support. Jellenc v. Jellenc, 567 So. 2d 847, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 561 (Miss. 1990).

   The guidelines for child support awards set forth in §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c19s43-19-101" target="_self">43-19-101</a></cite> must not control a chancellor’s award of child support. The national guideline must not dictate the amount of food, the need of clothing, the requirement of education or the standard of living of the children. Rather, this should be done by a chancellor who hears all the facts, views the witnesses, and is informed at trial of the circumstances of the parties and particularly the circumstances of the children. The guidelines may be received and considered in all support matters as relevant, but the guidelines may not determine the specific need or the specific support required; this is to be done by a chancellor at a time real, on a scene certain, and with a knowledge special to the actual circumstances and to the individual child or children.

       Chancery court did not abuse its discretion in the amount of the child support awarded because the chancellor thoroughly considered the issue and provided sound reasons for the chancellor’s decision to find the statutory guidelines to be inapplicable given the higher incomes involved.

       Child support award did not err because, inter alia, a chancellor made sufficient findings that the child support guidelines were applicable despite a father’s annual income exceeding $100,000. Lacoste v. Lacoste, 197 So.3d 897, 2016 Miss. App. LEXIS 460 (Miss. Ct. App. 2016).

   Chancellor did not err by using a mentally disabled father’s Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits to calculate child support pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c19s43-19-101" target="_self">43-19-101</a></cite>, though the chancellor was not required to consider SSI benefits in determining whether and in what amount to award child support. The chancellor properly utilized discretion based on the facts of the particular case. However, pursuant to 42 U.S.C.S. § 407(a), the SSI payments were not subject to a withholding order, attachment, garnishment, or other legal process to satisfy the father’s child-support obligation.

       Father argued that $ 500 per month in child support was much more than 20 percent of his adjusted gross income, but the father did not produce the needed financial records to determine his adjusted gross income; at trial, the father only produced two pay stubs and admitted to having others at home in California. The father testified about having a college education and being qualified in numerous fields related to the financial world, and he claimed to be an accomplished actor; therefore, the chancellor had evidence that he was able to contribute $ 500 per month in child support.

      <p>
       Where a father’s adjusted gross income was $9,370 per month, and the guidelines percentage for two children was 20%, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in ordering the father to pay $2,000 per month in child support, and the court’s written finding that the husband was capable of supporting himself while paying the amount of child support ordered was sufficient to support the finding.

      </p>
      <p>
       Chancellor properly declined to apply the child support guidelines because the husband had no employment income due to his incarceration; but as he had other assets, including half the equity in the marital home, the chancellor properly ordered him to pay $ 225 per month in child support, plus support retroactive to the date of his incarceration, secured by a lien against his interest in the marital home. Avery v. Avery, 864 So. 2d 1054, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 91 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).

       Because the husband had an adjusted gross income of more than $ 50,000, the child support guidelines did not apply; therefore, the trial court was not in error in deviating from the child support guidelines.

       Although the trial court’s order that the parties split the child’s tuition expenses 70/30 was above the statutory guidelines, such a split was appropriate under the circumstances when the husband was seemingly trying to avoid paying the child’s tuition, despite the trial court’s earlier order as part of the divorce decree that the children be provided with college educations.

       Husband’s agreement prior to a divorce to send a child to private school was by itself an inadequate basis for an award of child support in excess of that allowed by the statutory child support award guidelines. Southerland v. Southerland, 816 So. 2d 1004, 2002 Miss. LEXIS 133 (Miss. 2002).
      </p>

       The trial court erred in deviating from the guidelines and awarding no child support on the basis that the father was awarded 50 percent visitation/custody where the court awarded the father 10 weeks in the summer, every other weekend, and alternating holidays as such award did not amount to 50 percent visitation. Mitchell v. Mitchell, 767 So. 2d 1037, 2000 Miss. App. LEXIS 440 (Miss. Ct. App. 2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       The trial court did not err in deviating from the guidelines by awarding $500 per month in child support, rather than the $485 per month called for by the guidelines, where the court found that the upward deviation was appropriate because of unusual medical expenses for the children at issue. Grant v. Grant, 765 So. 2d 1263, 2000 Miss. LEXIS 200 (Miss. 2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       The court properly ordered the noncustodial father to pay $500 per month in child support where that amount was somewhat less than required by the guidelines based on his recent income, but the court explained that he was reducing child support payments to give the father the opportunity to pay his bills and some outstanding debts. James v. James, 756 So. 2d 847, 2000 Miss. App. LEXIS 45 (Miss. Ct. App. 2000).

       Where the chancellor awarded no child support in connection with an award of split custody, but did not cite the statute in reasoning its deviation from the guidelines, the matter would be remanded for the chancellor to specifically reference, in writing, why the statutory guidelines were inappropriate or unjust.

       Chancery court did not err by awarding a percentage of a husband’s adjusted gross income as child support because the percentage was detailed by the child support guidelines. Gunter v. Gunter, 281 So.3d 283, 2019 Miss. App. LEXIS 143 (Miss. Ct. App. 2019).
      </p>

       Chancery court did not err in decreasing the amount of child support because the calculation of child support was within the statutory guidelines; there was no evidence that the chancery court’s calculation of the husband’s income was incorrect.

       Chancery court did not err by failing to order a husband to pay for his daughter’s school tuition because it properly determined the amount of child support owed by the husband in accordance with the guidelines.

      </p>
      <p>
       Chancellor did not abuse his discretion by setting child support based on the statutory guidelines and the father’s admitted adjusted gross income at the time of trial. The chancellor was not required to predict and calculate a future adjusted gross income based only on the father’s estimate of how much the fathers annual income would probably decrease in the future due to the father’s resignation as head football coach of the school in which the father also taught. Harden v. Scarborough, 240 So.3d 1246, 2018 Miss. App. LEXIS 145 (Miss. Ct. App. 2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancery court erred in awarding the mother only 20 percent of the father’s adjusted gross income as this statute established a rebuttable presumption that support for three children should be 22 percent of the payor’s adjusted gross income. Leblanc v. Leblanc, 271 So.3d 494, 2018 Miss. App. LEXIS 524 (Miss. Ct. App. 2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       Father’s financial statement understated his net monthly income as $5,201, because the final months of 2016 showed gross earnings of approximately $10,000 per month and net pay, after deductions, of approximately $7,000 per month; and the father should have paid child support equal to 22 percent of his adjusted gross income. Leblanc v. Leblanc, 271 So.3d 494, 2018 Miss. App. LEXIS 524 (Miss. Ct. App. 2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       There was no error in a chancellor’s judgment ordering a mother to pay child support, rather than to find the mother’s teenage child to be emancipated, because despite the mother’s assertion, the chancellor’s judgment reflected that the chancellor possessed an awareness of the child’s extensive mental-health issues and history. Furthermore, the chancellor’s award of child support was within the statutory guidelines. Collins v. Miss. Dep't of Human Servs., — So.3d —, 2017 Miss. App. LEXIS 351 (Miss. Ct. App. June 13, 2017).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancellor erred by using an incorrect income figure to calculate child support as a wife was earning far less at the car dealership where the wife worked at the time of the divorce than the wife had at a prior job as a medical laboratory technician on which the chancellor based the award. Because the chancellor’s calculation of child support was based on a clear mathematical error, reversal of the child support award and remand for recalculation of the award was appropriate. Vassar v. Vassar, 228 So.3d 367, 2017 Miss. App. LEXIS 607 (Miss. Ct. App. 2017).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancellor’s upward deviation from the statutory guidelines for child support was affirmed where the chancellor made specific findings on the record, based in large part upon the mutual agreement among the parties regarding the lifestyle they wished their children to maintain, specifically noted that the husband’s wage-earning capacity far exceeded the wife’s, and that the husband was financially capable of providing those sums, and thus, the chancellor took into account the wife’s wage-earning capacity in making his determination. Black v. Black, 240 So.3d 1226, 2017 Miss. App. LEXIS 629 (Miss. Ct. App. 2017).
      </p>
      <p>
       Mother stated that her monthly income was $5,130, and the record failed to establish that her income was enhanced by regular distributions from her trust or that she had other sources of income, and the father failed to submit any evidence to support his bare allegations regarding the mother’s income; the chancellor did not abuse his discretion in failing to consider any distributions or undisclosed income for purposes of the child-support award. Ferrara v. Ferrara, 190 So.3d 884, 2016 Miss. App. LEXIS 216 (Miss. Ct. App. 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancellor properly computed the husband’s income at $750 per day for three days a week, totaling $117,000 annual earnings; and, based on the fact that the set percentage of child support for two minor children was 20 percent and that the husband’s adjusted gross income was $117,000, the chancellor properly determined the husband’s monthly child-support payment would be $1,950 and subtracted taxes for a child-support award of $1,800 per month. Branch v. Branch, 174 So.3d 932, 2015 Miss. App. LEXIS 470 (Miss. Ct. App. 2015).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because the husband received custody of the couple’s two minor children and the chancellor actually valued the wife’s adjusted gross income rather conservatively, considering that some evidence suggested that the wife’s parents gave her more than $3,000 per month, the chancellor did not err in ordering the wife to pay the husband child support in the amount of 20 percent of her adjusted gross income. Houston v. Houston, 121 So.3d 283, 2013 Miss. App. LEXIS 577 (Miss. Ct. App. 2013).

   Evidence relied on by the chancellor provided support for a child support award to a father as the record reflected the reasonableness of the chancellor’s reliance upon testimony in the record, financial disclosures, and the mother’s recent check stub in his calculations. The chancellor used the guidelines in Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c19s43-19-101" target="_self">43-19-101</a></cite> (Rev. 2009). Robinson v. Brown, 58 So.3d 38, 2011 Miss.

      <p>
       Chancellor’s award of child support was supported by the record, and his decision was not manifest error nor an abuse of discretion, because the children were accustomed to a standard of living where the husband made $ 71,377 per month, and they were living on $ 7,500 per month; the wife’s financial declaration did not cap out the maximum amount of child support the chancellor could grant, and the husband’s monthly income and earning potential far surpassed hers.

      </p>
      <p>
       Father’s child support order did not err because (1) the father’s income was reasonably estimated given the father’s limited evidence, (2) it was proper to deviate from the child support guidelines due to the father’s income exceeding $100,000, (3) the order was properly reduced based on the amount of time the children spent with the father, and (4) a credit was properly given for Social Security benefits the children received due to the father’s disability. Thomas v. Thomas, 281 So.3d 1191, 2019 Miss. App. LEXIS 270 (Miss. Ct. App. 2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancery court did not err by awarding one-half of day-care costs, because this was a justifiable deviation from the guidelines, and uninsured medical expenses, because they were not included in the guidelines. However, the court erred in awarding one-half of private-school tuition because the court did not make a written or specific finding as to why the deviation from the guidelines was needed. Gunter v. Gunter, 281 So.3d 283, 2019 Miss. App. LEXIS 143 (Miss. Ct. App. 2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancellor properly ordered an ex-husband pay 20 percent of his adjusted gross income, plus 50 percent of the children’s private-school tuition and expenses, because, while it was an upward deviation of the guidelines, the chancellor made detailed findings as to the parties’ financial conditions and earning capacities. Bruton v. Bruton, 271 So.3d 528, 2018 Miss. App. LEXIS 540 (Miss. Ct. App. 2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancery court provided sufficient justification for modifying the father’s monthly child-support payments and deviating from the statutory guidelines because a material change in circumstances occurred, namely, an increase in the father’s income, the increased age of the child, and the total available assets. Taylor v. Timmons (In re C.T.), 228 So.3d 311, 2017 Miss. App. LEXIS 332 (Miss. Ct. App. 2017).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancellor found the child support statutory percentage was to be adjusted based on the parties’ joint custody arrangement, and the chancellor further ordered that the father continue to provide insurance for the child, and this was supported and authorized by statute. Rayner v. Sims, 228 So.3d 353, 2017 Miss. App. LEXIS 612 (Miss. Ct. App. 2017).
      </p>
      <p>
       Substantial credible evidence supported a chancellor’s child support award because the chancellor properly considered an obligor father’s existing expenses and debts by considering the father’s business expenses and the father’s separate child support obligation and an obligee mother’s income, and Section 43-19-101’s guidelines were inappropriate in this particular case, and it was not an abuse of discretion to deny a retroactive award.

Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c19s43-19-101" target="_self">43-19-101</a></cite> was proper because the father consistently earned more than $50,000 per year and the chancellor’s findings concerning the child’s needs and circumstances supported the departure.

       Because a husband’s income exceeded $100,000, the chancellor was required to make written findings as to whether the application of the Mississippi child support guidelines was reasonable. Therefore, because the chancellor failed to do so reversal of that aspect of the chancellor’s judgment and remand of the issue for a determination as to whether the statutory guidelines should have applied along with a determination of the amount of support to be paid was appropriate.

       Chancellor provided a sufficient explanation to deviate from the statutory guidelines of child support and include private-school tuition for the parties’ child based upon the parties’ detailed testimony that the former husband wanted their child to continue the child’s education at an academy where the child had been for years. The chancellor was able both to downwardly modify the husband’s child support nearly by half, and provide for private-school tuition within the obligation. Bell v. Bell, 206 So.3d 1254, 2016 Miss.

       Chancery court decision to deny a mother’s request for payment of an arrearage was manifestly wrong and clearly erroneous because the nontaxable federal payments a father received for basic allowable housing and basic allowable subsistence were a form of earned income; the United States Navy paid the father additional income for his housing and subsistence, and those payments were earned by the father and assisted him with the payment of his monthly expenses.

      </p>
      <p>
       Father could have filed a post-judgment motion for findings, but instead he sought reversal based on the lack of specific findings of fact as to why the increase in his child support obligation was in excess of the guidelines; because the chancellor provided no findings of facts as to why the award deviated from the guidelines, the factors that were considered in modifying the father’s obligation could not be determined, and this mandated reversal and remand. Dailey v. McBeath, 151 So.3d 1038, 2014 Miss. App. LEXIS 683 (Miss. Ct. App. 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancellor’s decision to include the husband’s profits from vehicle sales in calculating child support was not clearly erroneous given that the issue turned on the parties’ testimony, and the chancellor was the sole authority for determining witness credibility. Ainsworth v. Ainsworth, 139 So.3d 761, 2014 Miss. App. LEXIS 295 (Miss. Ct. App. 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancellor did not err by failing to provide a written finding stating whether the application of a statutory guideline was reasonable because the chancellor ultimately provided a thoroughly written finding explaining the application of the statutory guideline in determining the appropriate child support, and there was nothing on the issue for the chancellor to address that the chancellor did not address in the chancellor’s final judgment. Stout v. Stout, 144 So.3d 177, 2013 Miss. App. LEXIS 854 (Miss. Ct. App. 2013), cert. denied, 145 So.3d 674, 2014 Miss. LEXIS 394 (Miss. 2014).

      <p>
       In calculating child support, the trial court abused its discretion in attributing any future rental income to the husband, as it had awarded the rental property to the wife. Collins v. Collins, 112 So.3d 428, 2013 Miss. LEXIS 285 (Miss. 2013).
      </p>
      <p>
       In calculating child support, the trial court erred in arbitrarily determining a husband’s monthly income to exclusion of the undisputed evidence he provided, due to his failure to comply with Miss. Unif. Ch. Ct. R. 8.05, because the remedy for his violation was to hold him in contempt, not to disregard the credible evidence he provided. Collins v. Collins, 112 So.3d 428, 2013 Miss. LEXIS 285 (Miss. 2013).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   While a chancellor erred in including rentals in a husband’s income, the error was harmless as the chancellor discussed and made specific findings for child support under Miss. Code Ann. §§<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c19s43-19-101" target="_self">43-19-101</a></cite>,<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c19s43-19-103" target="_self">43-19-103</a></cite> and properly relied on the parties’ Miss.

       Since a mother failed to raise to the chancellor her challenge to the reasonableness of the child-support guidelines, she was barred from challenging the chancellor’s failure to make specific findings of fact on the reasonableness of the guidelines. Robinson v. Brown, 58 So.3d 38, 2011 Miss. App. LEXIS 160 (Miss. Ct. App. 2011).

   As the record indicated that a husband’s income was much higher than claimed on the husband’s financial disclosure statement, a determination of the husband’s income and entry of a child support order in accordance with Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c19s43-19-101" target="_self">43-19-101</a></cite> was required, in a divorce proceeding; for example, there was explanation in the record as to how a $ 127,520 depreciation deduction was utilized.

   The chancery court had the authority to modify the provisions of an agreement regarding child support in a divorce action, and absent any showing that the final written order did not reflect the agreement announced in court, or any identification of a matter cognizable under Miss. R. Civ. P. 60 that could lead to setting aside a consent decree after being entered, the parties were bound by their agreement, notwithstanding fact that the chancellor did not make specific, written findings supporting the child support award pursuant to Miss.

       Chancellor did not abuse her discretion by basing her decision solely upon the father’s trust income, and not including income from his farming operations, where the record showed there was contradictory evidence as to the net income or loss arising out of the farming operations, and that the chancellor examined such evidence thoroughly before making her ruling. Owen v. Owen, 22 So.3d 386, 2009 Miss. App. LEXIS 859 (Miss. Ct. App. 2009).

   Recalculation of a child support award was required because mandatory deductions under Miss.

      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Because the father’s adjusted gross income was greater than $ 50,000, the trial court was required to state on the record whether the guidelines were reasonable, for purposes of Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c19s43-19-101ol14" target="_self">43-19-101(4)</a></cite>. Grove v. Agnew, 14 So.3d 790, 2009 Miss. App. LEXIS 490 (Miss. Ct. App. 2009).

   Although the chancery court did not make a written finding as to whether the application of the guidelines was reasonable pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c19s43-19-101ol14" target="_self">43-19-101(4)</a></cite>, it was clear that the chancery court considered the twenty percent statutory guideline figure set forth in Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c19s43-19-101ol11" target="_self">43-19-101(1)</a></cite> in setting a former husband’s support obligation for his two children because the chancery court stated that it took into account its statutory discretion and the children’s needs. Because the husband’s child support obligation was less than the amount set forth by the guidelines and the husband did not contend that the amount of child support awarded was unreasonable, the chancery court’s failure to make a written finding as to the reasonableness of the guidelines did not constitute reversible error. Morris v. Morris, 5 So.3d 476, 2008 Miss. App. LEXIS 612 (Miss. Ct. App. 2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a child custody case, if a second order entered by a chancellor was not a result of an agreement between the parents, then the chancellor should have made findings of fact as to why child support was less than the amount required by the guidelines. Klein v. McIntyre, 966 So. 2d 1252, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 708 (Miss. Ct. App. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancellor did not err by ordering a former husband to pay child support in the amount of $2,500 for two minor children because the guidelines did not have to be followed since the husband earned more than $50,000 per year. Yelverton v. Yelverton, 961 So. 2d 48, 2006 Miss. App. LEXIS 613 (Miss. Ct. App. 2006), rev'd, 961 So. 2d 19, 2007 Miss. LEXIS 414 (Miss. 2007).

      <p>
       <p>
   Monthly child support payment of $ 300 per month was in line with 14 percent of an annual income of $ 26,000 per year; that indicated that the trial court, evaluating all of the evidence presented, determined that the father’s yearly income was $ 26,000 and then based its statutory calculations on that figure. That was not manifest error as there was evidence to support the chancellor’s award; the chancery court applied the guidelines in its determination of the amount of child support, and therefore under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c19s43-19-101" target="_self">43-19-101</a></cite>, no written findings of fact were required, and the amount of $ 300 was within the statutory guidelines. Bryant v. Bryant, 924 So. 2d 627, 2006 Miss. App. LEXIS 190 (Miss. Ct. App. 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Findings of the chancellor in awarding child support to the wife were sufficient to comply with the requirements of Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c19s43-19-101" target="_self">43-19-101</a></cite> where the husband’s income was not greater than fifty thousand dollars per year; the chancellor’s findings were not required to be in writing, and the husband’s argument that the chancellor abused his discretion and committed manifest error was without merit. Gray v. Gray, 909 So. 2d 108, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 562 (Miss. Ct. App. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   In the husband’s appeal of the award of child support, the court rejected the husband’s claim that the chancellor did not comply with Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c19s43-19-101ol14" target="_self">43-19-101(4)</a></cite> requiring that the chancellor provide a written finding that the application of the statutory guidelines to income in excess of $ 50,000 was reasonable because the chancellor declared in his written judgment, that although the husband’s income exceeded $ 50,000 he saw no reason to deviate from the statutory child support guideline of 20 percent of the adjusted gross income. While the chancellor’s statement was rather succinct, it was nonetheless a written finding of reasonableness, especially when the statement was taken in the context of the chancellor’s opinion as a whole in consideration of the facts and circumstances of the case. Peters v. Peters, 906 So. 2d 64, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 1125 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Finding in favor of the husband in the parties’ divorce action was improper where the chancellor’s specific findings were deficient because the husband’s adjusted gross income exceeded $50,000, Miss. Code Ann. 43-19-101(4), but the chancellor’s opinion and judgment contained no written findings as to whether the statutory guidelines were reasonable or whether a departure was appropriate. Thus, the court had no guidance on how the chancellor arrived at child support in the amount of $400 per month, per child. Thompson v. Thompson, 894 So. 2d 603, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 906 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004), cert. denied, 893 So. 2d 1061, 2005 Miss. LEXIS 138 (Miss. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       The chancellor made sufficient findings of fact to support his decision to apply the suggested percentage for one child to the husband’s full income even though that income was greater than
   $50,000 where the chancellor explained the source of the husband’s income, noted that the income was expected to continue, and found that the resulting child support award was necessary and reasonable to maintain a reasonable standard of living for the child. Vaughn v. Vaughn, 798 So. 2d 431, 2001 Miss. LEXIS 66 (Miss. 2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       Under subsection (2) of this section, an on-the-record finding as to the applicability of the child support guidelines is required on both the initial award of child support and any subsequent modification of child support.

       Chancellor did not abuse his discretion in not giving the father a deduction for the child living in his home where the father did not mention any need that the custodial child might have which was greater than that of any of the other children; the father did not attempt to offer any proof of the expenses that child might have. McClee v. Simmons, 834 So. 2d 61, 2002 Miss. App. LEXIS 809 (Miss. Ct. App. 2002).
      </p>
      <p>
       As a chancellor in his discretion may reduce gross income by an amount sufficient to provide for children living with the parent required to pay support, it is logical to also allow a chancellor to consider other sources available for the support of those children, such as the income of the subsequent spouse of the obligor parent.

       Chancellor did not abuse the chancellor’s discretion by denying a mother’s request to increase the father’s monthly child support obligation and, instead, ordering the father to pay the children’s private school tuition because of the children’s special educational needs which required them to remain enrolled in the private school. Davis v. Davis, 217 So.3d 714, 2017 Miss. App. LEXIS 44 (Miss. Ct. App. 2017).

      <p>
       Chancellor did not abuse its discretion in its modification of child support because the chancellor increased a father’s child-support obligation to conform with statutory guidelines, but that figure was offset by the chancellor’s decision to order the mother to pay the father child support for their one child then living with the father. Furthermore, the chancellor found that the father’s criminal convictions was a substantial and material change in circumstances as the father was then having trouble finding employment. Davis v.

       Chancery court did not err in deciding that the father had to pay a portion of the child’s college expenses and all of her health insurance because the father did not present any evidence of how his lifestyle would change; the father’s financial documents showed that he was able to help with college expenses; and the child clearly showed aptitude for and the potential to benefit from college according to her high-school record.

       Chancery court did not err in increasing the father’s child-support payments because the child-support payments had not increased in 15 years; and the chancery court was provided with the father’s adjusted gross income and calculated the percentage set out in this statute.

       In determining a father’s child support obligation upon granting an upward modification, the trial court properly gave him a credit for taxes, which amounted to a deduction from his monthly gross income, as well as other credits for support paid to his other children and payments for health insurance for all of his children.

Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c19s43-19-101ol14" target="_self">43-19-101(4)</a></cite> (Rev. 2009), the court found that the chancery court had the authority to modify the provisions of an agreement regarding child support in a divorce action, and absent any showing that the final written order did not reflect the agreement announced in court, or any identification of a matter cognizable under Miss. R. Civ. P. 60 that could lead to setting aside a consent decree after being entered, the parties were bound by their agreement. Therefore, because the parties agreed to the amount of child support in the agreement which was read in open court, and the chancellor merely recited the agreement and reduced the husband’s contribution to the children’s college expenses by half, the husband was bound to the provisions in the agreement that the chancellor approved.

       Upon finding that a 21-year-old son was emancipated, a father’s duty to pay child support for the son ceased, and his child support obligation then became solely for his daughter.

   Chancery court did not err in finding the father to be in contempt for unpaid child support and in denying his petition to modify child custody and support, because the father had recovered from his injury and returned to work, had failed to promptly seek a modification after his injury and the support amount was within the guidelines of Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c19s43-19-101" target="_self">43-19-101</a></cite> and presumed reasonable.

   There was no basis on which to determine that the father was being required to pay more than the guidelines suggested as child support because (1) the appellate court was unable to determine from the record if the father was paying more than 22 percent of his adjusted gross income in child support, Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c19s43-19-101" target="_self">43-19-101</a></cite>; (2) the final divorce decree was not included in the record nor was any evidence of the father’s income or the children’s tuition expenses; and (3) the chancellor knew that the father’s income had been reduced and still ordered him to make the tuition payments, which were apparently less than originally had been required because of the school’s grant; thus, the father’s petition to modify his child support and tuition payments was properly denied.

   When it is evident that a non-custodial parent was exempted from a child support obligation at the time of an earlier court order only because of being unemployed, there is no logic to requiring proof that the parent’s later obtaining of employment is a material change in circumstances; in such a situation, it is justified to modify the earlier decree and require support consistent with the statute that sets out the support guidelines, Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c19s43-19-101" target="_self">43-19-101</a></cite>. Lacey v. Lacey, 822 So. 2d 1132, 2002 Miss. App. LEXIS 425 (Miss. Ct. App. 2002).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the divorce decree exempted the mother from paying child support, because the mother was a non-custodial parent who was now sober and employed, she was no longer exempted from paying child support and a modification of the decree requiring her to provide her two children with 20 percent of her adjusted gross income was proper. Lacey v. Lacey, 822 So. 2d 1132, 2002 Miss. App. LEXIS 425 (Miss. Ct. App. 2002).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancellor’s modification of a parent’s child support obligation to $1,000 per month was remanded for reconsideration in light of the fact that the chancellor’s calculation of the parent’s annual income was more than $300,000 below the parent’s actual income. Moulds v. Bradley, 791 So. 2d 220, 2001 Miss. LEXIS 187 (Miss. 2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       The statute addressed the issue of income and what was included when tabulating child support and included items in a person’s salary package; father’s housing allowance as part of his church salary constituted gross income and was included in the tabulation. Bustin v. Bustin, 806 So. 2d 1136, 2001 Miss. App. LEXIS 287 (Miss. Ct. App. 2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       Downward modification denied where father’s income was nearly unchanged, it had been only 15 months since he agreed to the current child support amount, and his considerable personal debt was newly accumulated through his willful and foreseeable acts. Magee v. Magee, 755 So. 2d 1057, 2000 Miss. LEXIS 16 (Miss. 2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       The chancellor erred in not referencing the statutory guidelines in making his specific findings of fact regarding an increase in child support. Wallace v. Bond, 745 So. 2d 844, 1999 Miss. LEXIS 257 (Miss. 1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       The court erred in increasing the amount of child support to be paid by a father for his teenage daughter where the guidelines provided for an award of 14 percent of the father’s adjusted gross income and the award was 22 percent of his adjusted gross income. Kilgore v. Fuller, 741 So. 2d 351, 1999 Miss. App. LEXIS 247 (Miss. Ct. App. 1999).

      </h4>
      <p>
       The court properly made a modification of child support retroactive to the date that the petition was filed, rather than the date the order was entered, notwithstanding that the modification was based in part on an annual bonus received after the date that the petition was filed; the chancellor was justified in including the bonus received in July in the appellant’s income for the whole year, not just for the latter half of the year.

       Chancellor properly imputed additional income to the mother in an irreconcilable-differences divorce because the evidence of the mother’s lifestyle did not support the mother’s claim as to the amount of the mother’s adjusted-gross income. The mother owned a day-care business, reported substantial earnings on tax returns, paid off a note on real property, purchased a new home, and the mother’s emancipated child testified that the mother told the child that the mother had purchased an airplane and a boat.

    Criteria for overcoming presumption that guidelines are appropriate.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The rebuttable presumption as to the justness or appropriateness of an award or modification of a child support award in this state, based upon the guidelines established by Section 43-19-101, may be overcome by a judicial or administrative body awarding or modifying the child support award by making a written finding or specific finding on the record that the application of the guidelines would be unjust or inappropriate in a particular case as determined according to the following criteria:
     </p>
     <p>
      Extraordinary medical, psychological, educational or dental expenses.
     </p>
     <p>
      Independent income of the child.
     </p>
     <p>
      The payment of both child support and spousal support to the obligee.
     </p>
     <p>
      Seasonal variations in one or both parents’ incomes or expenses.
     </p>
     <p>
      The age of the child, taking into account the greater needs of older children.
     </p>
     <p>
      Special needs that have traditionally been met within the family budget even though the fulfilling of those needs will cause the support to exceed the proposed guidelines.
     </p>
     <p>
      The particular shared parental arrangement, such as where the noncustodial parent spends a great deal of time with the children thereby reducing the financial expenditures incurred by the custodial parent, or the refusal of the noncustodial parent to become involved in the activities of the child, or giving due consideration to the custodial parent’s homemaking services.
     </p>
     <p>
      Total available assets of the obligee, obligor and the child.
     </p>
     <p>
      Payment by the obligee of child care expenses in order that the obligee may seek or retain employment, or because of the disability of the obligee.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any other adjustment which is needed to achieve an equitable result which may include, but not be limited to, a reasonable and necessary existing expense or debt.

       Father’s child support order did not err because (1) the father’s income was reasonably estimated given the father’s limited evidence, (2) it was proper to deviate from the child support guidelines due to the father’s income exceeding $100,000, (3) the order was properly reduced based on the amount of time the children spent with the father, and (4) a credit was properly given for Social Security benefits the children received due to the father’s disability. Thomas v. Thomas, 281 So.3d 1191, 2019 Miss. App. LEXIS 270 (Miss. Ct. App. 2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancery court did not deviate from the guidelines and thus, was not required to make specific findings on each factor, but all that was required was for the chancery court to find, in writing, that the standard, statutory, fourteen-percent guideline applied; the chancery court’s overall written analysis supported her decision because it considered, among other things the parents’ ages, health, incomes, and living expenses, and the child’s age, expenses, and future needs. McKinney v. Hamp, 268 So.3d 470, 2018 Miss. LEXIS 59 (Miss. 2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       Reversal of chancery court’s upward modification of child support was appropriate because the increase in child support was based upon speculative income on the part of the father. Furthermore, the chancellor on remand was to make specific on-the-record findings that the application of the child-support guidelines was unjust or inappropriate in the case. Gipson v. Jackson, 236 So.3d 846, 2018 Miss. App. LEXIS 70 (Miss. Ct. App. 2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancellor found the child support statutory percentage was to be adjusted based on the parties’ joint custody arrangement, and the chancellor further ordered that the father continue to provide insurance for the child, and this was supported and authorized by statute. Rayner v. Sims, 228 So.3d 353, 2017 Miss. App. LEXIS 612 (Miss. Ct. App. 2017).
      </p>
      <p>
       It was within a chancellor’s discretion to find that child-care expenses required an upward deviation in a former spouse’s child-support obligation. Hickey v. Hickey, 166 So.3d 43, 2014 Miss. App. LEXIS 728 (Miss. Ct. App. 2014), cert. denied, 166 So.3d 38, 2015 Miss. LEXIS 332 (Miss. 2015).
      </p>
      <p>
       Child support award did not err because, inter alia, it was not error to apply the child support guidelines despite the fluctuating income of a father’s business, as the father had always been able to maintain the business’s profitability. Lacoste v. Lacoste, 197 So.3d 897, 2016 Miss. App. LEXIS 460 (Miss. Ct. App. 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       Social Security benefits which a parent received on behalf of the parent’s other child, whose other parent was deceased, was not a reason to decrease the obligor parent’s child-support obligations, because the benefits belonged to the parent’s other child, not the obligor parent’s child. Marin v. Stewart, 122 So.3d 153, 2013 Miss. App. LEXIS 621 (Miss. Ct. App. 2013).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Chancellor did not err by requiring a parent to pay monthly child support greater than the fourteen percent of the parent’s adjusted-gross income prescribed by Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c19s43-19-101" target="_self">43-19-101</a></cite> because the subject child had to go to day-care for the other parent to retain employment, and the parents each lived rent free with one or both of their own parents. Marin v. Stewart, 122 So.3d 153, 2013 Miss. App. LEXIS 621 (Miss. Ct. App. 2013).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Low income is not among the statutory criteria in Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c19s43-19-103" target="_self">43-19-103</a></cite> for overcoming the presumption in favor of the child-support guidelines. Lowrey v. Lowrey, 25 So.3d 274, 2009 Miss. LEXIS 549 (Miss. 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   For purposes of
   Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c19s43-19-101ol13d" target="_self">43-19-101(3)(d)</a></cite>, the trial court did not subtract an amount from the adjusted gross income, but improperly used the guideline percentage for two children and divided it between the two children; the trial court did not follow the method provided in §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c19s43-19-101ol13d" target="_self">43-19-101(3)(d)</a></cite> and did not provide any written finding or specific finding on the record that the application of the guidelines would be unjust or inappropriate in this case that would overcome the presumption that the guidelines were appropriate under
   Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c19s43-19-103" target="_self">43-19-103</a></cite>, and thus the court had to reverse and remand so that the child support award could be calculated in accordance with
   Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c19s43-19-101" target="_self">43-19-101</a></cite>, or alternatively the trial court had to justify its failure to do so.

      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   In making the finding of the inapplicability of the statutory guidelines to the wife’s child support award, the chancellor failed to fully comply with Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c19s43-19-101ol12" target="_self">43-19-101(2)</a></cite> by making a written or specific finding on the record that the application of the guidelines would be unjust or inappropriate in a particular case as determined under the criteria specified in Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c19s43-19-103" target="_self">43-19-103</a></cite>; on remand, should the chancellor decide again to deviate from the statutory guidelines, the chancellor had to make a specific, on-the-record finding which would overcome the rebuttable presumption. Yelverton v. Yelverton, 961 So. 2d 19, 2007 Miss. LEXIS 414 (Miss. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a father’s adjusted gross income was $9,370 per month, and the guidelines percentage for two children was 20%, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in ordering the father to pay $2,000 per month in child support. Henderson v. Henderson, 952 So. 2d 273, 2006 Miss. App. LEXIS 869 (Miss. Ct. App. 2006), cert. denied, 951 So. 2d 563, 2007 Miss. LEXIS 165 (Miss. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   In a divorce case, a chancellor did not err in determining a husband’s adjusted gross income by using evidence from his financial statement, a tax return, and the testimony of witnesses; moreover, the chancellor correctly applied Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c19s43-19-103" target="_self">43-19-103</a></cite> in determining the amount of child support. Spahn v. Spahn, 959 So. 2d 8, 2006 Miss. App. LEXIS 695 (Miss. Ct. App. 2006), cert. denied, 958 So. 2d 1232, 2007 Miss. LEXIS 361 (Miss. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the record showed the parties had been married almost 20 years and that the wife had primarily worked at a few part-time jobs, in addition to raising two children, the appellate court held: (1) as to the husband’s part ownership in the business, the chancellor was within his discretion in finding that there was no goodwill, because said air conditioning business had numerous skilled employees, the husband was not an essential, irreplaceable part of said business, and the business would have operated normally if the husband left the business; (2) even though the husband was granted primary physical custody of the parties’ minor child, the award of child support to the wife was not improper based on the criteria for overcoming the presumption that the guidelines were appropriate; (3) the award of periodic alimony to the wife was proper given the length of the marriage, the fact that the parties had enjoyed a high standard of living, and that the wife had very little education or work experience; and (4) the wife’s acts of infidelity which occurred while the parties were separated was not a ground for denying alimony. Rush v. Rush, 932 So. 2d 800, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 533 (Miss. Ct. App. 2005), aff'd in part and rev'd in part, 932 So. 2d 794, 2006 Miss. LEXIS 354 (Miss. 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Chancellor’s award of $ 824 a month in child support to the wife in a divorce action was exactly the 20 percent of the husband’s income called for by the child support guidelines set forth in Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c19s43-19-101" target="_self">43-19-101</a></cite>, and was not excessive; as the award was in accordance with the guidelines, the chancellor was not required to make specific findings justifying the award. Gable v. Gable, 846 So. 2d 296, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 461 (Miss. Ct. App. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because the husband had an adjusted gross income of more than $ 50,000, the child support guidelines did not apply; therefore, the trial court was not in error by deviating from the child support guidelines. Holley v. Holley, 892 So. 2d 240, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 710 (Miss. Ct. App. 2003), aff'd in part and rev'd in part, 892 So. 2d 183, 2004 Miss. LEXIS 1171 (Miss. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Because the husband was a doctor and had the ability to earn a substantial income, the wife had no source of income at that time other than the rehabilitative alimony, and the children had special needs which the chancellor deemed to include private school tuition, the supreme court found that those reasons meet the criteria set out in Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c19s43-19-103ol1f" target="_self">43-19-103(f)</a></cite>, (h) and the chancellor properly found special circumstances existed that necessitated a variance from the statutory guidelines in setting the husband’s obligation of child support. Hensarling v. Hensarling, 824 So. 2d 583, 2002 Miss. LEXIS 200 (Miss. 2002).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the court made no specific findings as to the husband’s income and offered no reason as to why the child support award exceeded the amount suggested by the statutory guidelines based on what he reported as his adjusted gross income, the judgment would be vacated and remanded for specific findings as to the husband’s income and expenses. Gray v. Gray, 745 So. 2d 234, 1999 Miss. LEXIS 228 (Miss. 1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       Health, transportation, and college expenses are not included in determining the amount of support under the guidelines, although such extra obligations could well be considered for a downward departure from the guidelines under this section. Kilgore v. Fuller, 741 So. 2d 351, 1999 Miss. App. LEXIS 247 (Miss. Ct. App. 1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   A $350 per month award to be paid by a father for the support of his 3 children was manifestly erroneous where the father’s adjusted gross income based on his salary, which was his only significant and reliable source of income, was approximately $2,350 per month, the guidelines set forth in §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.99.html#t99c19s99-19-101" target="_blank">99-19-101</a></cite> suggested that he should pay $495 per month in child support, and the chancellor failed to make a specific finding on the record that application of the statutory guidelines would be unjust or inappropriate. Draper v. Draper, 658 So. 2d 866, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 362 (Miss. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       A chancellor did not abuse his discretion in ordering a wife to pay child support in the amount of $224.00 per month for the support of her minor son, even if the award exceeded the statutory guideline for the support of one child, where the record showed that the wife would be able to support herself as well as to pay child support. Smith v. Smith, 614 So. 2d 394, 1993 Miss. LEXIS 69 (Miss. 1993).

   A chancellor’s departure from the guidelines set forth in §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c19s43-19-101" target="_self">43-19-101</a></cite> in determining an appropriate amount of child support was not error where the chancellor followed the statutory method of rebutting the presumption that 26 percent of the father’s adjusted gross income was the appropriate amount of child support, and the record included a written finding, as required by §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c19s43-19-103" target="_self">43-19-103</a></cite>, that the guidelines were inappropriate in that particular case.

   In the father’s petition to clarify his child support obligations, the chancellor’s finding that counseling for his sons was not medically necessary was appropriate pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c19s43-19-103ol1a" target="_self">43-19-103(a)</a></cite> because the boys had only one session and the doctor did not order any follow up treatment.

      </p>
      <p>
       The trial court did not err in deviating from the guidelines by awarding $500 per month in child support, rather than the $485 per month called for by the guidelines, where the court found that the upward deviation was appropriate because of unusual medical expenses for the children at issue.

       Chancellor provided a sufficient explanation to deviate from the statutory guidelines of child support and include private-school tuition for the parties’ child based upon the parties’ detailed testimony that the former husband wanted their child to continue the child’s education at an academy where the child had been for years. The chancellor was able both to downwardly modify the husband’s child support nearly by half, and provide for private-school tuition within the obligation. Bell v. Bell, 206 So.3d 1254, 2016 Miss. App. LEXIS 778 (Miss. Ct. App. 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Husband, as a skilled medical professional, had the ability to earn a substantial income, whereas at this time, the wife did not, and the chancellor considered the child’s private school tuition and enhanced educational activities; the son’s extracurricular activities and the lifestyle to which the family was accustomed met the criteria in Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c19s43-19-103ol1f" target="_self">43-19-103(f)</a></cite>, and the chancellor found it reasonable to apply the fourteen percent statutory standard to the husband’s adjusted gross monthly income. Smith v. Smith, 25 So.3d 369, 2009 Miss. App. LEXIS 283 (Miss. Ct. App. 2009), cert. denied, 24 So.3d 1038, 2010 Miss. LEXIS 17 (Miss. 2010).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   To modify a decreed support obligation already exceeding the statutory guidelines in order to award college expenses, a chancellor is required to take into consideration the criteria set forth in
   Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c19s43-19-103" target="_self">43-19-103</a></cite>, as well as the factors contained in Brabham v. Brabham.

      </p>
      <p>
       Where a father made significantly more income than a mother and the father had enrolled their child in private school before the divorce and wished the child to continue there, an award of child support exceeding the statutory guidelines was not in error. Southerland v. Southerland, 875 So. 2d 204, 2004 Miss. LEXIS 716 (Miss. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the trial court’s order that the parties split the child’s tuition expenses 70/30 was above the statutory guidelines, such a split was appropriate under the circumstances when the husband was seemingly trying to avoid paying the child’s tuition, despite the trial court’s earlier order as part of the divorce decree that the children be provided with college educations. Fancher v. Pell, 831 So. 2d 1137, 2002 Miss. LEXIS 404 (Miss. 2002).
      </p>
      <p>
       The chancellor did not abuse his discretion in awarding child support of $1,000 per month, notwithstanding that the guidelines called for an award of $715 per month, where, prior to the divorce proceeding, the parties had mutually agreed to enroll their child in a private school and it was clear from the record that the chancellor considered this an extraordinary expense not contemplated in the statutory guidelines. Southerland v. Southerland, 2001 Miss. App. LEXIS 208 (Miss. Ct. App. May 22, 2001), aff'd in part and rev'd in part, 816 So. 2d 1004, 2002 Miss. LEXIS 133 (Miss. 2002).

      </h4>
      <p>
       Substantial credible evidence supported a chancellor’s child support award because the chancellor properly considered an obligor father’s existing expenses and debts by considering the father’s business expenses and the father’s separate child support obligation and an obligee mother’s income, and Section 43-19-101’s guidelines were inappropriate in this particular case, and it was not an abuse of discretion to deny an upward retroactive modification.

      </h4>
      <p>
       Reversal of chancery court’s upward modification of child support was appropriate because the increase in child support was based upon speculative income on the part of the father. Furthermore, the chancellor on remand was to make specific on-the-record findings that the application of the child-support guidelines was unjust or inappropriate in the case. Gipson v. Jackson, 236 So.3d 846, 2018 Miss. App. LEXIS 70 (Miss. Ct. App. 2018).

     <p>
      The purpose of this chapter is to protect and promote the health and safety of the children of this state by providing for the licensing of child care facilities as defined herein so as to assure that certain minimum standards are maintained in such facilities. This policy is predicated upon the fact that a child is not capable of protecting himself, and when his parents for any reason have relinquished his care to others, there arises the probability of exposure of that child to certain risks to his health and safety which require the offsetting statutory protection of licensing.

     <p>
      When used in this chapter, the following words shall have the following meanings:
     </p>
     <p>
      “Child care facility” means a place that provides shelter and personal care for six (6) or more children who are not related within the third degree computed according to the civil law to the operator and who are under thirteen (13) years of age, for any part of the twenty-four-hour day, whether that place is organized or operated for profit or not. The term “child care facility” includes day nurseries, day care centers and any other facility that falls within the scope of the definitions set forth in this paragraph, regardless of auspices. Exemptions from the provisions of this chapter include:
     </p>
     <p>
      Child care facilities that operate for no more than two (2) days a week, whose primary purpose is to provide respite for the caregiver or temporary care during other scheduled or related activities and organized programs that operate for three (3) or fewer weeks per year such as, but not limited to, Vacation Bible Schools and scout day camps.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any child residential home as defined in, and in compliance with the provisions of, Section 43-16-3(b) et seq.
     </p>
     <p>
      1. Any elementary, including kindergarten, and/or secondary school system, accredited by the Mississippi State Department of Education, the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, the Mississippi Private School Education Association, the American Association of Christian Schools, the Association of Christian Schools International, a school affiliated with Accelerated Christian Education, Inc., and any Head Start program operating in conjunction with an elementary school system, whether it is public, private or parochial, whose primary purpose is a structured school or school readiness program.
     </p>
     <p>
      2. Accreditation, for the purpose of exemption from the provisions of this chapter, means: a. receipt by any school or school system of full accreditation from an accrediting entity listed in item 1 of this subparagraph (iii), or b. proof of application by the school or school system for accreditation status from the accrediting entity. Proof of application for accreditation status shall include, but not be limited to, a copy of the applicant’s completed application for accreditation filed with the licensing agency and a letter or other authenticating documentation from a signatory authority with the accrediting entity that the application for accreditation has been received and that the applicant is currently under consideration or review for full accreditation status by the accrediting entity. An exemption for a nonaccredited applicant under this item 2 shall be for a maximum of one (1) year from the receipt date by the licensing agency of the completed documentation for proof of application for accreditation status. Failure to receive full accreditation by the end of the one-year exemption period for a nonaccredited applicant shall result in the nonaccredited applicant no longer remaining exempt from the provisions of this chapter at the end of the one-year period. However, if full accreditation is not received by the end of the one-year exemption period, the State Board of Health, in its discretion, may extend the exemption period for any nonaccredited applicant for periods of six (6) months, with the total extension not to exceed one (1) year. During any such extension periods, the board shall have the authority to enforce child care facility licensure provisions relating to the health and safety of the children in the school or school system. If a nonaccredited applicant fails to receive full accreditation by the end of all extended exemption periods, the applicant shall no longer remain exempt from the provisions of this chapter at the end of the extended exemption periods.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any membership organization affiliated with a national organization that charges only a nominal annual membership fee, does not receive monthly, weekly or daily payments for services, and is certified by its national association as being in compliance with the association’s minimum standards and procedures including, but not limited to, the Boys and Girls Club of America, and the YMCA.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any family child care home as defined in Section 43-20-53(a) et seq.
     </p>
     <p>
      All other preschool child care programs and/or extended day school programs must meet requirements set forth in this chapter. Any entity exempt from the requirements to be licensed but voluntarily chooses to obtain a license is subject to all provisions of this chapter.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Health” means that condition of being sound in mind and body and encompasses an individual’s physical, mental and emotional welfare.

     </p>
     <p>
      “Operator” means any person, acting individually or jointly with another person or persons, who establishes, owns, operates, conducts or maintains a child care facility. The child care facility license shall be issued in the name of the operator, or, if there is more than one (1) operator, in the name of one (1) of the operators. If there is more than one (1) operator, all statutory and regulatory provisions concerning the background checks of operators shall be equally applied to all operators of a facility including, but not limited to, a spouse who jointly owns, operates or maintains the child care facility regardless of which particular person is named on the license.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Personal care” means assistance rendered by personnel of the child care facility in performing one or more of the activities of daily living which includes, but is not limited to, the feeding, personal grooming, supervising and dressing of children placed in the child care facility.

       Headstart programs, operating in conjunction with elementary schools, are exempt from licensure under the Mississippi Child Care Licensing Law and therefore from having to perform sex offense criminal history record checks and child abuse registry checks; headstart programs which are not operated in conjunction with an elementary school and those headstart programs which are operated in conjunction with elementary schools, but have chosen to be or are required to be licensed by federal entities, must make such checks.

      <p>
       Information which may be relevant regarding an employee or prospective employee of a child care facility, such as the existence of a substantiated case of abuse or neglect listing that individual as a perpetrator, may be disclosed to the State Department of Health for determination of the appropriateness of the individual to be employed in a child care facility. Thompson, Jr., Feb. 13, 2002, A.G. Op. #01-0771.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Department of Health may enact policies which allow the performance of alternative criminal background checks to comport with the intent of the statute, if, in fact, such alternative means exist and may be implemented by the Department. Thompson, Jr., May 3, 2002, A.G. Op. #02-0145.
      </p>
      <p>
       The statute does not specifically require that the results of criminal history checks be received prior to the hiring of an individual as a child care giver at a child care facility, and no violation of the statute occurs when an individual is hired while the results of that criminal history check are pending. Thompson, Jr., May 3, 2002, A.G. Op. #02-0145.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because the Mississippi State Department of Health is the licensing agency for child-care facilities, it has the authority to disqualify current and prospective employees from being caregivers in child-care facilities based on their criminal history. A licensed child-care facility would not have the power to override that decision by the Department. Terney, Apr. 23, 2004, A.G. Op. 04-0124.

       To extent defendant referee of Youth Court failed to have record made of Youth Court proceeding for allegations of abuse of child, allegedly abused child was deprived of property interest to which she was entitled under Fourteenth Amendment. In addition, while referee did appoint guardian ad litem for child, he failed to insure that her interests were adequately protected by such representation and thus effectively denied her right to present evidence on her behalf, as established under state law, and deprived her of a protected property interest in that respect as well. Appropriate remedy for violation was to enjoin referee to hold new hearing in full conformity with statutory and constitutional requirements. Chrissy F. v. Mississippi Dep't of Public Welfare, 780 F. Supp. 1104, 1991 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17998 (S.D. Miss. 1991), aff'd in part and rev'd in part, 995 F.2d 595, 1993 U.S. App. LEXIS 16843 (5th Cir. Miss. 1993).

      This chapter shall be liberally construed to the end that each child coming within the jurisdiction of the youth court shall become a responsible, accountable and productive citizen, and that each such child shall receive such care, guidance and control, preferably in such child’s own home as is conducive toward that end and is in the state’s and the child’s best interest. It is the public policy of this state that the parents of each child shall be primarily responsible for the care, support, education and welfare of such children; however, when it is necessary that a child be removed from the control of such child’s parents, the youth court shall secure proper care for such child.

       Record revealed a worrisome disregard for the provisions of the Youth Court Act because despite the fact that the mother was not properly before the youth court and the father was not before the youth court at all, the youth court adjudicated their child neglected and ordered them to submit to drug screens. E.K. v. Miss. Dep't of Child Prot. Servs., 249 So.3d 377, 2018 Miss. LEXIS 323 (Miss. 2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court properly granted a natural father’s petition for custody modification, as the children’s foster mother’s unjustified refusal to allow the father visitation or telephone contact was a material change in circumstances adverse to the children. Barnett v. Oathout, 883 So. 2d 563, 2004 Miss. LEXIS 1227 (Miss. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Contrary to a foster mother’s claims, in changing custody from her to the children’s natural father, the trial court did not rely on the natural parent presumption, but imposed the burden on the father to show a material change in circumstances, which was the appropriate standard. Barnett v. Oathout, 883 So. 2d 563, 2004 Miss. LEXIS 1227 (Miss. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Nowhere did the Youth Court Act, Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c21s43-21-101" target="_self">43-21-101</a></cite> et seq., provide for it taking jurisdiction over a case involving exclusively child support, contempt, and modification issues; thus, where the family court had adjudicated the father as the natural father of the mother’s child, and set child support and visitation, but subsequently, the family court was abolished, in a later modification action, the appellate court reversed the youth court on the issue of jurisdiction, holding that the matter had to be transferred to the chancery court. Helmert v. Biffany, 842 So. 2d 1287, 2003 Miss. LEXIS 188 (Miss. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a hearing on a mother’s petition to restore custody of her 2 children, who had been adjudicated neglected and placed in foster care, the applicable standard for the chancellor’s consideration was whether there was “a material change in circumstances as to custody that would benefit and be for the best interest of the children”; the focus does not change in custody matters where it is not one parent vying against the other for custody of their child, but rather, the Department of Human Services seeking to retain custody of a neglected or abused child rather than have the child returned to a parent. Copiah County Dep't of Human Servs. v. Linda D. (In the Interest of R.D.), 658 So. 2d 1378, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 368 (Miss. 1995), overruled in part, D.T. v. Hinds Cnty.

In Interest of M.I., 519 So. 2d 433, 1988 Miss. LEXIS 38 (Miss. 1988).

       In a case in which a mother appealed a youth court’s adjudication that she had neglected her two minor children and had placed the children in the legal custody of the Department of Human Services (DHS), the facts supported the youth court’s finding that, at minimum, the children were not being provided the proper and necessary care or support or other care necessary for their well-being. The youth court was presented with conflicting testimony about the mother’s care and support for her children, and based on the mother’s alarming actions and statements that she would turn the children over to DHS, it could not be concluded with confidence that the youth court judge’s decision was manifestly wrong. S. v. State, 47 So.3d 715, 2010 Miss. App. LEXIS 138 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 49 So.3d 1139, 2010 Miss. LEXIS 606 (Miss. 2010).

       Youth court had no jurisdiction to adjudicate a mother’s son as a child in need of supervision and the mother’s two other sons as sexually abused because neither the mother nor any of the children were served a summons or were present at a hearing, and the children could not waive service, so the adjudications were void.

       Where the family court had entered an order on paternity, child support, and custody, but the family court was abolished, and father later sought to modify the order, the appellate court held the original paternity action could not have been brought in youth court. No allegations of abuse, neglect, or delinquency had been asserted, thus the matter was not one for which the youth court had been granted jurisdiction, and the matter was remanded for transfer to the chancery court.

   County youth court did not err in transferring what was a child custody case to the county chancery court, as the mother’s allegation that her 10-month-old child was in need of supervision was insufficient to show the child was in need of supervision under the relevant statute, Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c21s43-21-105ol1k" target="_self">43-21-105(k)</a></cite>, which required a child in need of supervision to have at least reached his seventh birthday; since there were also no allegations of abuse or neglect of the child, the case was a child custody case that fell under the jurisdiction of the county chancery court.

       Petition alleging a child was neglected was insufficient because there were no facts to “show” that she was “a neglected child”; in the absence of a causal connection between the facts alleged in the petition and the petition’s charge of neglect, the petition was legally insufficient to provide notice to the child, the mother, or the father of the particular circumstances that were to be inquired into at the adjudicatory proceedings.

       Evidence failed to demonstrate that a child was neglected because no evidence was offered to show that the mother’s fear of the father led to the child being neglected, and evidence of the mother’s positive test for marijuana usage was not shown to have affected the child; the mother’s marijuana usage did not negate the requirement of a causal connection between the drug usage and the neglect.

       In a case involving evidence of neglect of a sibling, the supreme court would adopt the doctrine of “anticipatory” or “potential” neglect, especially where the neglect of a sibling had been determined a mere month prior to the other child’s birth; the Mississippi Youth Court Act’s definition of a “neglected child” is sufficiently comprehensive to include a newborn child whose parents have previously demonstrated that they are unwilling or unable to provide proper care for the child. S.M. v. Miss. Dep't of Human Servs. (In the Interest of N.M.), 215 So.3d 1007, 2017 Miss. App. LEXIS 202 (Miss. Ct. App. 2017).

   Minor child could be found neglected, regardless of who the custodial parent was, if the non-custodial parent failed to remedy the situation when he or she was able to do so, and a non-custodial father, knowing that the children’s mother opposed taking one of the children to see a doctor, allowed the child to remain with the mother, untreated, for 10 additional days before taking the child back to see a doctor and because of that delay, the child’s bones began healing incorrectly. In addition to the medical neglect, the father was undoubtedly aware of the living conditions that his children were forced to endure, as he had lived at the very same residence in the past, he had undoubtedly witnessed the continuing nature of the living conditions when he came for his regular visits with the children, and according to the language of the “neglected child” statute,
   Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c21s43-21-105ol1a" target="_self">43-21-105(a)</a></cite>, the children were neglected for purposes of Miss. Code Ann.

   ) that requires that an adjudication of neglect be made specifically with respect to the parent whose rights are being terminated. Indeed, the language of the neglect statute defines a “neglected child” – not a “neglecting parent” – and defines a “neglected child” in such a way that both parents have the responsibility to insure that a child is not being neglected, regardless of who the custodial parent is; in other words, if a child is being neglected by the custodial parent, that child is also being neglected by the non-custodial parent if that parent fails to remedy the situation when he or she is able to do so.

       The siblings of a child who had been sexually abused by the children’s father were neglected and abused minor children within the meaning of the Youth Court Act by virtue of the fact that their sister was abused. An order enjoining the father from contact with the siblings until successful completion of a child sex abuse treatment program was justified by the potential harm those children would be subjected to in light of the fact that the father had already perpetrated sexual abuse upon one of his children.

Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c21s43-21-105ol1m" target="_self">43-21-105(m)</a></cite>. Sherron v. State, 959 So. 2d 30, 2006 Miss. App. LEXIS 832 (Miss. Ct.

       Evidence did not establish that defendant, who admittedly spanked his live-in girlfriend’s two-year-old child three times with belt, inflicted serious bodily harm, rather than nonaccidental physical injury, and thus, evidence was such that reasonable jury could find defendant not guilty of child abuse but guilty of misdemeanor child abuse; evidence included examining physician’s testimony that child’s bruises were superficial and did not require medical treatment. Yates v. State, 685 So. 2d 715, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 683 (Miss. 1996), overruled in part, Buffington v. State, 824 So. 2d 576, 2002 Miss. LEXIS 206 (Miss. 2002).

      <p>
       Trial court’s failure, in prosecution of defendant for felonious child abuse against his live-in girlfriend’s two-year-old child, to give instruction on lesser included offense of misdemeanor child abuse, though error because evidence adduced at trial was such that reasonable jury could have found defendant guilty of misdemeanor child abuse but not guilty of felonious child abuse, did not require new trial, but only required remand for resentencing, where Supreme Court found that the evidence sufficiently established defendant’s guilt of misdemeanor child abuse, thus obviating need for child, his family, defendant, or state to be required to endure additional expense and draining of emotions of another trial. Yates v. State, 685 So. 2d 715, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 683 (Miss. 1996), overruled in part, Buffington v. State, 824 So. 2d 576, 2002 Miss. LEXIS 206 (Miss. 2002).

       The evidence was insufficient to support a finding that 2 minor children, who had bruises on their buttocks from a spanking with a leather strap which resulted from conversations the children’s mother had with their teachers regarding the children’s behavior problem, were abused children within the meaning of the Youth Court Act, where the social worker did not interview the children’s teacher who had reported the behavioral problems to the mother, she did not review the children’s school records, she did not interview the children’s mother or step-father or examine the home environment of the children, she did not talk to the medical doctor who examined the children for evidence of child abuse, she did not look at the strap used in the discipline of the children, she did not have the children tested or evaluated by experts, and the record did not contain any medical records showing evidence of physical abuse.

       The evidence was sufficient to support a finding that a child had been sexually abused by her father, and was therefore an “abused child” under the Youth Court Act, where statements made by the child to a psychologist were offered into evidence, and the psychologist testified that it was his opinion that the child had been sexually abused by her father, even though the father denied engaging in any kind of sexual activity with the child and the child’s mother was of the opinion that the father had not sexually abused the child.

       The siblings of a child who had been sexually abused by the children’s father were neglected and abused minor children within the meaning of the Youth Court Act by virtue of the fact that their sister was abused.

   Trial judge abused his discretion in declining to recuse himself in a prosecution for aggravated assault and forcible rape of child, since he had served as county prosecuting attorney in an earlier youth-court shelter hearing regarding the child’s custody as a result of the events giving rise to the criminal charges, and 1) the threshold issue in that hearing was whether the complainant was an “abused child” under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c21s43-21-105ol1m" target="_self">43-21-105(m)</a></cite>, which went to the heart of the issue of defendant’s guilt; 2) the judge might have personal knowledge of disputed evidentiary facts concerning the criminal case due to his participation in the youth-court shelter hearing.

   While a juvenile’s intentional touching and squeezing of a pregnant woman’s derriere, without permission, amounted to a physical offense, this conduct did not constitute simple assault under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.97.html#t97c03s97-3-7ol11c" target="_blank">97-3-7(1)(c)</a></cite> (now<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.97.html#t97c03s97-3-7ol11aiii" target="_blank">97-3-7(1)(a)(iii)</a></cite>) where there was no proof of fear of imminent serious bodily harm. Thus, the juvenile’s adjudication of delinquency would be reversed based on the failure to prove an essential element of the crime of simple assault. S.B. v. State, 566 So. 2d 1276, 1990 Miss.

       Being under the influence of marijuana is not a designated criminal offense under our statutes except in conjunction with the operation of a vehicle, but such conduct, when properly alleged and upon adequate proof, may be shown to endanger a child’s health or to be a contributing factor to his incorrigibility or uncontrollability.

       A youth “who violates any state law or municipal ordinance,” even though it be his first such offense, may be adjudicated to be a “delinquent child” unless some violation is by some other applicable statute excluded from the purview of Code 1942 § 7185-02(g).

       Nothing in Code 1942, §§ 7185-02, 7185-09, or 7185-26 requires that any child upon being formally charged for the first time with a law violation or with being delinquent must be given a suspended sentence prior to commitment into the care and custody of a state supported training school.

       An allegation in general terms of delinquency does not bring a child within the operation of this act; hence it is not sufficient to allege that the child “is fast becoming uncontrollable” by its parents and “is violating the laws of the state in various ways.” Sharp v.

       The youth court system does not unconstitutionally usurp jurisdiction committed exclusively to the chancery court by permitting the Supreme Court to hear a direct appeal without appeal to the chancery court, even though the Mississippi Constitution provides that the chancery court shall have full jurisdiction over “minor’s business.” Youth courts are neither superior, equal, or inferior to other “inferior” courts; they are special courts due to the special nature of their function. Thus, the legislature had authority to vest in the youth courts “exclusive original jurisdiction in all proceedings concerning . . . an abused child,” and the social imperative for prompt disposition of matters affecting children is sufficiently within the police power that the legislature may streamline the appellate process. In Interest of T.L.C., 566 So. 2d 691, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 431 (Miss. 1990), overruled in part, D.T. v. Hinds Cnty. Youth Court (In re J.T.), 188 So.3d 1192, 2016 Miss. LEXIS 165 (Miss. 2016).

       Laws of 2017, ch. 420, § 5, provides:
      </p>
      <p>
       “SECTION 5. (1)
   There is hereby created a Community-Based Placement for At-risk Children Pilot Program for the counties of Hinds, Rankin, Madison, Warren, Yazoo, Copiah, DeSoto, Hancock and Coahoma.
   The purpose of the pilot program is to implement a plan for early intervention by the youth court to reach at-risk children and place the children in community-based homes under youth court supervision.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(2)(a)
   For the purposes of this section, ‘community home’ means a home designated by the youth court judge under this section.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(b)
   In order to be designated as a community home, the home must have been approved as being both safe and an environment in which a child will thrive by Child Protective Services before placement of any youth in the home.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(c)
   Homes designated as community homes will be recruited in the county in which the youth court has jurisdiction subject to the provisions of this subsection (2).
      </p>
      <p>
       “(3)(a)
   Children eligible for placement under the pilot program are those between the ages of ten (10) and fourteen (14) who have been determined by the youth court to be living in an environment that is either:
      </p>
      <p>
       “(i)
   Abusive;
      </p>
      <p>
       “(ii)
   Neglectful; or
      </p>
      <p>
       “(iii)
   That contributes to the delinquency of the child.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(b)
   The factors to be used by the youth court in determining the at-risk status of the child may include, but not be limited to, the following:
      </p>
      <p>
       “(i)
   Living with a single parent who has apparently either voluntarily or involuntarily lost control of the child;
      </p>

       “(ii)
   Disciplinary problems at school;
      </p>
      <p>
       “(iii)
   Academic problems at school; or

      <p>
       “(iv)
   Having older siblings from the same environment who have been adjudicated abused, neglected or delinquent.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(c)
   Placement under the program will require the consent of:
      </p>
      <p>
       “(i)
   The custodial parent;
      </p>
      <p>
       “(ii)
   A person in loco parentis to the child; or
      </p>
      <p>
       “(iii)
   The duly appointed guardian ad litem of the child.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(4)
   Compensation to the community homes for the expenses incurred in the placement shall be for a fair and reasonable amount as determined by the youth court.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(5)
   Funding for the pilot program shall consist of:
      </p>
      <p>
       “(a)
   Monies appropriated by the Legislature for the purposes of funding the pilot program;
      </p>
      <p>
       “(b)
   Monies dedicated by action of the board of supervisors for the purposes of funding the pilot program;
      </p>
      <p>
       “(c)
   Monies received from the federal government;
      </p>
      <p>
       “(d)

      <p>
       “(e)

      </p>
      <p>
       “(6)(a)
   Creation of a pilot program under this section shall be by order of the youth court of a county and solely contingent on committed funding as set forth in this section.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(b)
   Any youth court electing to operate a pilot program under this section shall report on the placements made and all expenses incurred under the pilot program to the Administrative Office of Courts not less than every six (6) months, and the Supreme Court shall ensure that the Legislature is informed of the status of the pilot program on at least an annual basis.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(c)

       Trial court did not abuse its discretion by limiting a guardian ad litem’s participation, but, because the appointment was mandatory after the wife’s allegations of child abuse by the husband, the chancellor was required at least to consider the guardian ad litem’s report and recommendations. Accordingly, reversal of the judgment and remand of the case was necessary for the chancellor to make findings of fact and conclusions of law taking into consideration the guardian ad litem’s report and recommendations.

      </p>
      <p>
       In a child custody case, a guardian ad litem (GAL) did not exceed the proper role of a GAL by offering testimony, providing a written report to the court, making recommendations, discussing the views of the court-appointed counselor, filing a motion, examining witnesses, and meeting ex-parte with the chancellor, where the GAL reported on matters required by the GAL’s appointment, and consistent with a GAL’s duties and where the chancellor did not allow the GAL to usurp the chancellor’s role as the ultimate finder of fact. McDonald v. McDonald, 39 So.3d 868, 2010 Miss. LEXIS 309 (Miss. 2010).

      <p>
       In an action to modify child custody, where guardian ad litem failed to provide the court with an objective record of the evidence or make a recommendation as to whether or not a material change in circumstances had occurred; did not prepare a written report or recommendation; declined to question any witnesses during the trial; and declined to add any statements to the record other than a statement that she would leave it to the court’s discretion as to whether or not there had been a material change in circumstances; she failed to comply with her statutory duties, and the case was properly remanded for the chancellor to reconsider based on the totality of the circumstances. Gainey v. Edington, 24 So.3d 333, 2009 Miss. App. LEXIS 823 (Miss. Ct. App. 2009).

      <p>
       When appointing a guardian ad litem to represent a minor, a judge’s duty to assure that the child’s best interests are protected requires as a minimum that (1) he or she select a competent person to serve as guardian ad litem, (2) he or she select a person with no adverse interest to the minor, and (3) the person selected is adequately instructed on the proper performance of his or her duties. Copiah County Dep't of Human Servs. v. Linda D. (In the Interest of R.D.), 658 So. 2d 1378, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 368 (Miss. 1995), overruled in part, D.T. v. Hinds Cnty.

      <p>
       In proceedings to determine custody of 2 children who had been adjudicated neglected and placed in foster care, the children were denied their due process right of representation where they were without the services of an attorney or guardian ad litem for approximately 3 years during the course of the custody proceedings.

       Judges have the obligation to appoint a guardian ad litem to represent every minor alleged to be abused or neglected, even if a request for a guardian ad litem is not made.

      Except for expenses provided by state funds and/or other monies, the board of supervisors, or the municipal governing board where there is a municipal youth court, shall adequately provide funds for the operation of the youth court division of the chancery court in conjunction with the regular chancery court budget, or the county or family courts where said courts are constituted. In preparation for said funding, on an annual basis at the time requested, the youth court judge or administrator shall prepare and submit to the board of supervisors, or the municipal governing board of the youth court wherever the youth court is a municipal court, an annual budget which will identify the number, staff position, title and amount of annual or monthly compensation of each position as well as provide for other expenditures necessary to the functioning and operation of the youth court. When the budget of the youth court or youth court judge is approved by the board of supervisors or the governing authority of the municipality, then the youth court or youth court judge may employ such persons as provided in the budget from time to time.
     </p>
     <p>
      The board of supervisors of any county in which there is located a youth court, and the governing authority of any municipality in which there is located a municipal youth court, are each authorized to reimburse the youth court judges and other youth court employees or personnel for reasonable travel and expenses incurred in the performance of their duties and in attending educational meetings offering professional training to such persons as budgeted.

   Evidence was insufficient to show that the attorney’s conduct was a willful or contumacious violation of the Youth Court Act beyond a reasonable doubt where the record indicated that the grandmother paid the attorney for her representation of the mother and the grandmother was the attorney’s client and had a right to be informed of the outcome of the custody hearing. In re Spencer, 985 So. 2d 330, 2008 Miss. LEXIS 327 (Miss.), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">555 U.S. 1046</cite>, <cite class="s_court">129 S. Ct. 629</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">172 L.

   Youth court lacked jurisdiction over defendant, a minor, because he was charged with statutory rape, Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.97.html#t97c03s97-3-65" target="_blank">97-3-65</a></cite>, which if committed by an adult, carried the possibility of sentencing to life imprisonment; the actual sentence defendant might receive because of his age was irrelevant, and thus the youth court was without jurisdiction to proceed. In the Interest of D.S., 943 So. 2d 1280, 2006 Miss. LEXIS 686 (Miss. 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Defendant’s claim that the youth court did not have the necessary jurisdiction to transfer the case to circuit court was without merit where the youth court found that jurisdiction existed; and after considering Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c21s43-21-157ol15a" target="_self">43-21-157(5)(a)</a></cite> through (k), the court found that no reasonable prospects of rehabilitation existed within the juvenile system. Hicks v. State, 870 So. 2d 1238, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 76 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).

   Once a minor becomes a suspect in a crime carrying a potential life sentence or death to the extent that it becomes necessary to detain him and inform him of his Miranda rights before interrogating him, Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c21s43-21-151ol11a" target="_self">43-21-151(1)(a)</a></cite> of the Youth Court Act is sufficiently invoked so as to remove that youthful suspect from the protections otherwise afforded him under the Act. Moody v. State, 838 So. 2d 324, 2002 Miss. App. LEXIS 501 (Miss. Ct. App. 2002).
      </p>
      <p>
       Circuit court had original jurisdiction over a child who committed a crime, which if the same crime were committed by an adult would be punishable under either state or federal law by life imprisonment or death; a circuit court with original jurisdiction was not required to consider alternative sentencing. Flowers v. State, 805 So. 2d 654, 2002 Miss. App. LEXIS 54 (Miss. Ct. App. 2002).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where defendant pled guilty to crimes that fell into the deadly weapon category of subsection (1)(B), the circuit court had original jurisdiction and had the authority to sentence defendant as an adult. Smith v. State, 806 So. 2d 299, 2001 Miss. App. LEXIS 356 (Miss. Ct. App. 2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Sentencing 17-year-old defendant to death was not prohibited merely because state statute did not explicitly state that 16 or 17-year-old defendant could be punished with execution for capital crime. Holly v. State, 671 So. 2d 32, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 15 (Miss.), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">518 U.S. 1025</cite>, <cite class="s_court">116 S. Ct. 2565</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">135 L.

   The placement of minors in a detention center subjected the minors to the jurisdiction of the youth court pursuant to §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c21s43-21-103" target="_self">43-21-103</a></cite>, which provides that “when a child is removed from the control of his parents, the youth court shall secure proper care for him”, and, therefore, it was incumbent upon the court to insure that the residents of the center received treatment in accordance with approval by the state.

   Circuit court’s jurisdiction was proper where juvenile was indicted for murder, offense carrying potential life sentence, although he was ultimately convicted for aggravated assault. Johnson v.

   Defendant could not assert that death penalty violated Eighth Amendment because statutes did not set a minimum age below which child may not be transferred from youth court to circuit court for crimes punishable by death where defendant committed his crime at age 17, an age where it is sufficiently clear that no national consensus forbids imposition of capital punishment. Blue v. State, 674 So. 2d 1184, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 304 (Miss.), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">519 U.S. 1030</cite>, <cite class="s_court">117 S. Ct. 588</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">136 L.

      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Mississippi procedure does not violate the constitutional prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment by vesting original jurisdiction in the circuit court when a person under 18 years of age is charged with a capital offense, rather than requiring a certification proceeding in youth court for transfer to the circuit court; Mississippi law allows a capital murder defendant who is under the age of 18 years to request a special hearing to consider his or her age, lack of prior offenses, likelihood of successful rehabilitation and other factors which favor sending the case to the youth court rather than continuing in circuit court. Foster v. State, 639 So. 2d 1263, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 670 (Miss. 1994), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">514 U.S. 1019</cite>, <cite class="s_court">115 S. Ct. 1365</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">131 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 221, 1995 U.S. LEXIS 2061 (U.S. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Mississippi procedure does not violate the constitutional prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment by its failure to explicitly state a minimum age that a person may be subject to the death penalty, since the age at which one may receive a death sentence for the crime of capital murder is implied; no one under 13 years of age may receive the death penalty because a child under the age of 13 cannot even be charged with a felony. Foster v. State, 639 So. 2d 1263, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 670 (Miss. 1994), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">514 U.S. 1019</cite>, <cite class="s_court">115 S. Ct. 1365</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">131 L.

      </p>
      <p>
       The youth court system does not unconstitutionally usurp jurisdiction committed exclusively to the chancery court by permitting the Supreme Court to hear a direct appeal without appeal to the chancery court, even though the Mississippi Constitution provides that the chancery court shall have full jurisdiction over “minor’s business.” Youth courts are neither superior, equal, or inferior to other “inferior” courts; they are special courts due to the special nature of their function. Thus, the legislature had authority to vest in the youth courts “exclusive original jurisdiction in all proceedings concerning . . . an abused child,” and the social imperative for prompt disposition of matters affecting children is sufficiently within the police power that the legislature may streamline the appellate process. In Interest of T.L.C., 566 So. 2d 691, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 431 (Miss. 1990), overruled in part, D.T. v. Hinds Cnty. Youth Court (In re J.T.), 188 So.3d 1192, 2016 Miss. LEXIS 165 (Miss. 2016).

       In a case involving evidence of neglect of a sibling, the supreme court would adopt the doctrine of “anticipatory” or “potential” neglect, especially where the neglect of a sibling had been determined a mere month prior to the other child’s birth; the Mississippi Youth Court Act’s definition of a “neglected child” is sufficiently comprehensive to include a newborn child whose parents have previously demonstrated that they are unwilling or unable to provide proper care for the child. S.M. v. Miss. Dep't of Human Servs. (In the Interest of N.M.), 215 So.3d 1007, 2017 Miss. App. LEXIS 202 (Miss. Ct. App. 2017).
      </p>
      <p>
       Youth court exceeded its authority in denying parents’ motion to set aside a judgment adjudicating their child as a child in need of special care because the Department of Human Services petition did not state a basis for invoking its jurisdiction; there was no specific allegation that the child had any mental or physical illness, and thus, the youth court based its decision to place the child in custody as a child in need of special care upon evidence of neglect of the parents’ other children. S.M. v. Miss. Dep't of Human Servs. (In the Interest of N.M.), 215 So.3d 1007, 2017 Miss. App. LEXIS 202 (Miss. Ct. App. 2017).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because a mother assigned the mother’s rights as payee to the Mississippi Department of Human Services by participation in Mississippi’s Aid to Families with Dependent Children public assistance program prior to a youth court’s reunification of custody order, a chancellor did not err in ordering disbursement of the collected child support to the various custodial family members. Vance v. Miss. Dep't of Human Servs. (Child Support Div.), 203 So.3d 11, 2016 Miss. App. LEXIS 667 (Miss. Ct. App. 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Because defendant was 17 years old at the time the alleged felony offense of accessory after the fact to murder was committed, jurisdiction was proper in the circuit court pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c21s43-21-151" target="_self">43-21-151</a></cite> (Rev. 2004). Moreover, although defendant argued that the statements he made to the police were inadmissible because the police failed to take his statements in compliance with the requirements of the Youth Court Act, Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c21s43-21-303ol13" target="_self">43-21-303(3)</a></cite> (Rev. 2004), the youth court did not have jurisdiction over defendant’s case, and since the Youth Court Act did not apply, parental notification was unnecessary. Miller v. State, 18 So.3d 898, 2009 Miss. App. LEXIS 675 (Miss. Ct. App. 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Circuit court did not commit reversible error when it admitted defendant’s two statements, regarding his involvement in a murder under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.97.html#t97c03s97-3-21" target="_blank">97-3-21</a></cite>, into evidence because despite defendant’s being a minor at the time of his interrogation, protection of the Mississippi Youth Court pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c21s43-21-151ol11a" target="_self">43-21-151(1)(a)</a></cite> was not afforded to defendant once he was arrested for an act, which, if committed by an adult, was punishable by life imprisonment or death. Trotter v. State, 9 So.3d 402, 2008 Miss. App. LEXIS 570 (Miss. Ct. App. 2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Custody award in favor of a father was vacated on appeal because a youth court had given the maternal grandparents temporary custody earlier, as under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c21s43-21-151" target="_self">43-21-151</a></cite> and Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c21s43-21-301ol11" target="_self">43-21-301(1)</a></cite>, the youth court had exclusive jurisdiction to determine custody; however, the issues of child support and paternity were affirmed since the grandparents were not necessary parties to such. Thomas v. Byars, 947 So. 2d 375, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 18 (Miss. Ct. App. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Defendant’s convictions for murder and aggravated assault were proper because Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c21s43-21-151" target="_self">43-21-151</a></cite> and case law made it clear that juveniles in Mississippi were not afforded any additional protections during custodial interrogation. Anthony v. State, 936 So. 2d 471, 2006 Miss. App. LEXIS 590 (Miss. Ct. App. 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Order for the Department of Human Services (MDHS) to return funds garnished from the father for child support was improper under Miss. Const. Art. 6, § 159(b) because chancery courts have continuous and exclusive jurisdiction over custody proceedings. The MDHS collected the father’s wages pursuant to a valid order and the youth court had no authority under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c21s43-21-151" target="_self">43-21-151</a></cite> to terminate the father’s child support obligations. Dep't of Human Servs. v. Blount, 913 So. 2d 326, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 247 (Miss. Ct. App. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the youth court was granted exclusive jurisdiction in abuse proceedings, that jurisdiction may be retained by the chancery court if allegations of abuse are brought during the pendency of a custody hearing. Helmert v. Biffany, 842 So. 2d 1287, 2003 Miss. LEXIS 188 (Miss. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Paternity actions can never be brought in youth court. Under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.93.html#t93c09s93-9-15" target="_blank">93-9-15</a></cite>, the county court, the circuit court, or the chancery court has jurisdiction of an action relating to paternity and support of illegitimate children; the youth court, however, does not have jurisdiction over those matters, and will be unable to act to establish the paternity of a child who is within its jurisdiction. Helmert v. Biffany, 842 So. 2d 1287, 2003 Miss. LEXIS 188 (Miss. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Nowhere did the Youth Court Act, Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c21s43-21-101" target="_self">43-21-101</a></cite> et seq., provide for it taking jurisdiction over a case involving exclusively child support, contempt, and modification issues; thus, where the family court had adjudicated the father as the natural father of the mother’s child, and set child support and visitation, but subsequently, the family court was abolished, in a later modification action, the appellate court reversed the youth court on the issue of jurisdiction, holding that the matter had to be transferred to the chancery court. Helmert v. Biffany, 842 So. 2d 1287, 2003 Miss. LEXIS 188 (Miss. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Counsel was not ineffective for failing to develop and present evidence in support of petitioner’s motion to remand the matter to youth court, as petitioner was charged with capital murder and thus, under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c21s43-21-151" target="_self">43-21-151</a></cite>, petitioner did not fall within the jurisdiction of the youth court. McGilberry v.

      </p>
      <p>
       The youth court had no jurisdiction and the circuit court was the proper jurisdiction where the defendant used a shotgun to commit a robbery and the maximum penalty for the crime was life imprisonment. Bronson v. State, 786 So. 2d 1083, 2001 Miss. App. LEXIS 235 (Miss. Ct. App. 2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       The defendant was under the original jurisdiction of the circuit court where he was originally charged with two counts of armed robbery, which counts each merited a life sentence; the fact that those charges were reduced to the crimes of attempted robbery and accessory after the fact to robbery, which mandated less than a life sentence, did not remove original jurisdiction from the circuit court. Young v. State, 797 So. 2d 239, 2001 Miss. App. LEXIS 2 (Miss. Ct. App. 2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Because defendant was charged with murder, circuit court was court of “original jurisdiction” and provisions for having a parent present during interrogation and actions in the youth court were thus inapplicable.

   Where police officer charged 14 year old boy who was driving his parents’ car without a license, with offense of driving without license, and took boy to police station and issued him a ticket, and less than one hour after release boy committed suicide, officer did not violate Youth Court Law by taking boy into custody without order from Youth Court, since under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c21s43-21-159ol11" target="_self">43-21-159(1)</a></cite> Youth Court does not have “exclusive original jurisdiction” over traffic offenses; although subsection (1) of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c21s43-21-151" target="_self">43-21-151</a></cite> grants Youth Court “exclusive original jurisdiction in all proceedings concerning a delinquent child”, §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c21s43-21-159ol11" target="_self">43-21-159(1)</a></cite> creates an exception granting concurrent jurisdiction to appropriate criminal court in cases where child is charged with traffic violation; therefore if boy was taken into custody at all it was for a traffic violation and not for something over which Youth Court had exclusive or original jurisdiction.

       Continuing and exclusive nature of chancery court jurisdiction over issues involving child custody precludes Youth Court from having exclusive original jurisdiction over proceedings involving abused child, where allegations of abuse are raised in context of custody proceeding over which chancery court already exercises jurisdiction. Rights of minor child suspected of having been sexually abused by parent, to access to court, were not impaired by chancery court’s considering allegations of sexual abuse without referring matter to Youth Court; and even though Youth Court statute provided for exercise of exclusive jurisdiction over child abuse cases, such provision was not applicable to charges raised in case over which chancery court had already assumed and was exercising jurisdiction.

       Circuit court lacked jurisdiction over defendant juveniles’ case because there was not a transfer of jurisdiction to the circuit court from the youth court; the youth court possessed exclusive original jurisdiction over the proceeding because both defendants were seventeen years old at the time of the offense, and a youth-court transfer order or transcript from a hearing on the matter did not appear in the record.

The circuit court had original jurisdiction since defendant was charged with armed robbery, and being properly before the circuit court, his infancy did not prevent him from entering a valid plea of guilty without parental accompaniment; moreover, the record showed defendant had responded in the affirmative that he understood there was no minimum sentence, but that the maximum sentence for armed robbery was life in prison.

   Finding adjudicating the victim to be a sexually abused child was proper where venue was proper in the county court because the evidence determined that the victim was present in the county when the report was made to the youth court intake unit. Therefore, under the second part of Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c21s43-21-155ol12" target="_self">43-21-155(2)</a></cite>, there was sufficient evidence to determine that it was not reversible error for the youth court to decide that venue in the county was proper.

      <li id="t43c21s43-21-157ol11">
       If a child who has reached his thirteenth birthday is charged by petition to be a delinquent child, the youth court, either on motion of the youth court prosecutor or on the youth court’s own motion, after a hearing as hereinafter provided, may, in its discretion, transfer jurisdiction of the alleged offense described in the petition or a lesser included offense to the criminal court which would have trial jurisdiction of such offense if committed by an adult. The child shall be represented by counsel in transfer proceedings.
      </li>
      <li id="t43c21s43-21-157ol12">
       A motion to transfer shall be filed on a day prior to the date set for the adjudicatory hearing but not more than ten (10) days after the filing of the petition. The youth court may order a transfer study at any time after the motion to transfer is filed. The transfer study and any other social record which the youth court will consider at the transfer hearing shall be made available to the child’s counsel prior to the hearing. Summons shall be served in the same manner as other summons under this chapter with a copy of the motion to transfer and the petition attached thereto.

      <li id="t43c21s43-21-157ol13">
       The transfer hearing shall be bifurcated. At the transfer hearing, the youth court shall first determine whether probable cause exists to believe that the child committed the alleged offense. For the purpose of the transfer hearing only, the child may, with the assistance of counsel, waive the determination of probable cause.
      </li>
      <li id="t43c21s43-21-157ol14">
       Upon such a finding of probable cause, the youth court may transfer jurisdiction of the alleged offense and the youth if the youth court finds by clear and convincing evidence that there are no reasonable prospects of rehabilitation within the juvenile justice system.

Any misdemeanor offenses committed by youth who are in circuit court jurisdiction pursuant to this section or Section 43-21-151 shall be prosecuted in the court which would have jurisdiction over that offense if committed by an adult without any additional transfer proceedings.

       Circuit court lacked jurisdiction over defendant juveniles’ case because there was not a transfer of jurisdiction to the circuit court from the youth court; the youth court possessed exclusive original jurisdiction over the proceeding because both defendants were seventeen years old at the time of the offense, and a youth-court transfer order or transcript from a hearing on the matter did not appear in the record. Meadows v. State, 217 So.3d 772, 2017 Miss. App. LEXIS 87 (Miss. Ct. App. 2017).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Defendant’s claim that the youth court did not have the necessary jurisdiction to transfer the case to circuit court was without merit where the youth court found that jurisdiction existed; and after considering Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c21s43-21-157ol15a" target="_self">43-21-157(5)(a)</a></cite> through (k), the court found that no reasonable prospects of rehabilitation existed within the juvenile system. Hicks v. State, 870 So. 2d 1238, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 76 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>

       Circuit court did not have jurisdiction over burglary charge against juvenile, where charge was not certified from youth court. Ferguson v. State, 688 So. 2d 760, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 680 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>

   Because defendant had previously been convicted of aggravated assault and certified as an adult, he would not have been entitled to a youth court hearing for his capital murder charge even if such a hearing would otherwise be required.

       In the trial of a juvenile for murder, when the circuit court directed the verdict in favor of the juvenile its jurisdiction ended, and it erred in not sustaining the motion of the juvenile to transfer the cause to the youth court of the county. Grant v. State, 305 So. 2d 351, 1974 Miss. LEXIS 1480 (Miss. 1974).
      </p>
      <p>
       Code 1942, § 7204 does not ipso facto deprive the circuit court of its jurisdiction in felony cases, it not being mandatory that such jurisdiction be surrendered thereunder, and it is not necessarily violative of any provision of the constitution. McGinnis v. State, 201 Miss. 239, 29 So. 2d 109, 1947 Miss. LEXIS 391 (Miss. 1947).
      </p>
      <p>
       Code 1942, § 7204, instead of § 7203, Code of 1942, is applicable to a prosecution charging a boy under eighteen years of age with felonious assault and battery with intent to kill and murder, as regards the petition to transfer the case to the juvenile court. McGinnis v. State, 201 Miss. 239, 29 So. 2d 109, 1947 Miss. LEXIS 391 (Miss. 1947).
      </p>
      <p>
       The disposition to be made of any child under eighteen years of age being prosecuted for a felony, whether to dismiss the prosecution and order the child committed to the juvenile court, or, after conviction, to suspend judgment and order the defendant released on good behavior, or such other order as in the judgment of the court would be for the best interest of the infant, is confined to the discretion of the criminal court. Farr v. State, 199 Miss. 637, 25 So. 2d 186, 1946 Miss. LEXIS 235 (Miss. 1946).
      </p>
      <p>
       Under this section [Code 1942, § 7204] the dismissal of a felony prosecution, and the committal of the defendant therein to the juvenile court rests in the sound discretion of the trial judge, subject only to review for abuse thereof. Parker v. State, 194 Miss. 895, 13 So. 2d 620, 1943 Miss. LEXIS 99 (Miss. 1943).
      </p>
      <p>
       Refusal of trial court to dismiss prosecution of 16-year-boy for murder and to commit him to the juvenile court was not error where there was no abuse of discretion apparent. Parker v. State, 194 Miss. 895, 13 So. 2d 620, 1943 Miss. LEXIS 99 (Miss. 1943).

       No jeopardy attached upon the impaneling and swearing in of the first jury, since the circuit court was without jurisdiction to try the minor defendant for manslaughter, and she was not placed in jeopardy for a second time by her subsequent trial for murder and conviction of manslaughter, after she had been certified by the youth court to the circuit court for trial as an adult. Butler v. State, 489 So. 2d 1093, 1986 Miss. LEXIS 2507 (Miss. 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   The prosecution of a youth as an adult in a state court, upon the youth’s transfer from the juvenile court system after an adjudicatory hearing finding that the youth had violated a state criminal statute, and after a dispositional hearing finding that the youth was unfit for treatment as a juvenile, violated the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment as applied to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment. Breed v. Jones, <cite class="us_code">421 U.S. 519</cite>, <cite class="s_court">95 S. Ct. 1779</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">44 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 346, 1975 U.S. LEXIS 66 (U.S. 1975).
      </p>
      <p>
       That prosecutor makes the decision whether a juvenile will be charged with murder rather than manslaughter, thereby determining whether defendant will be tried as a juvenile or an adult, does not render this section unconstitutional, nor does section unconstitutionally violate a juvenile defendant’s right to a presumption of innocence. Jackson v. State, 311 So. 2d 658, 1975 Miss. LEXIS 1621 (Miss. 1975).

       Where delinquents under eighteen years of age had been arrested for the commission of a crime to which they pleaded guilty but the delinquents were not convicted therefor and no criminal sentence imposed upon them, Code 1942 § 7201 rather than Code 1942 § 6755 applies so that the court, acting as a juvenile court, had jurisdiction to commit them to the proper state institution even though there was no affirmative finding that it was for the best interests of the delinquents and of the public that they should be so committed.

   A 15-year-old defendant was properly convicted of armed robbery in the circuit court, though there was no youth court certification order, since the maximum punishment possible for armed robbery is life imprisonment and the clause of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c21s43-21-31" target="_self">43-21-31</a></cite> [former law now repealed] giving exclusive jurisdiction to the circuit court of juveniles charged with crimes punishable by life imprisonment or death was not intended to apply only to offenses for which death was a possible punishment or to offenses for which the only possible alternative punishments were life imprisonment or death.

       Since a person convicted of a crime of rape is subject to suffer death or life imprisonment, rape cases are excepted from the provisions of the Youth Court Act, so that the circuit court did not err in proceeding to enter judgment against a minor, who was accused of rape, upon his plea of guilty without conducting a hearing in accordance with the requirement of the Act.

       Appeal to the supreme court does not lie from a youth court order that does no more than decline jurisdiction and certify the case to the circuit court.

   Although proper certification is necessary before the circuit court has jurisdiction to try a minor under 18 years of age, there is no requirement in §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.41.html#t41c21s41-21-31" target="_blank">41-21-31</a></cite> [former law, now repealed] that an order of the youth court certifying an accused to the circuit court for trial must be filed in the circuit court before trial. Hammons v. State, 291 So. 2d 177, 1974 Miss. LEXIS 1722 (Miss. 1974).
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the circuit court did not have jurisdiction to try a 16-year-old for a felony until after indictment by the grand jury, the return of an indictment for manslaughter did not automatically confer exclusive jurisdiction on the circuit court and preclude the assumption of jurisdiction by the youth court, and the circuit court should have sustained the minor defendant’s motion to transfer the case to the county youth court for a determination by that court whether it should retain jurisdiction or waive it, in view of the rehabilitative purposes of the Youth Court Act. Walker v. State, 235 So. 2d 714, 1970 Miss. LEXIS 1465 (Miss. 1970).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a defendant, charged with rape, was a large young man, grown in all respects except age, the juvenile laws of the state of Mississippi were not applicable. Smith v. State, 229 So. 2d 551, 1969 Miss. LEXIS 1246 (Miss. 1969).

       An order waiving the youth court’s jurisdiction over a 15-year-old minor charged with the offense of burglary which does not affirmatively show that a hearing was had in the presence of the minor and his parent or parents, that the minor was represented by counsel, or that the right to counsel was properly waived is fatally defective. Hopkins v. State, 209 So. 2d 841, 1968 Miss. LEXIS 1480 (Miss. 1968).
      </p>
      <p>
       Circuit court was not without jurisdiction over two defendants fourteen and fifteen years old, accused of larceny of $1,100, merely because they were first brought into Youth Court and adjudged delinquent, since the latter court, as it was fully authorized to do, certified them to the circuit court for appropriate proceedings.

      </p>
      <p>
       Where one accused of murder committed when he was sixteen years of age was over eighteen years of age at the time of trial, the trial court was correct in not referring the case to the juvenile court at the time of trial, and in overruling the motion to suspend sentence without a new hearing, since he had already heard the evidence, was fully informed of the act of delinquency involved and a further hearing of evidence would have served no useful purpose. Farr v. State, 199 Miss. 637, 25 So. 2d 186, 1946 Miss. LEXIS 235 (Miss. 1946).

       When a person appears before a court other than the youth court, and it is determined that the person is a child under jurisdiction of the youth court, such court shall, unless the jurisdiction of the offense has been transferred to such court as provided in this chapter, or unless the child has previously been the subject of a transfer from the youth court to the circuit court for trial as an adult and was convicted, immediately dismiss the proceeding without prejudice and forward all documents pertaining to the cause to the youth court; and all entries in permanent records shall be expunged. The youth court shall have the power to order and supervise the expunction or the destruction of such records in accordance with Section 43-21-265. Upon petition therefor, the youth court shall expunge the record of any case within its jurisdiction in which an arrest was made, the person arrested was released and the case was dismissed or the charges were dropped, there was no disposition of such case, or the person was found not delinquent.

        In cases where the child is charged with a hunting or fishing violation or a traffic violation, whether it be any state or federal law, a violation of the Mississippi Implied Consent Law, or municipal ordinance or county resolution, or where the child is charged with a violation of Section 67-3-70, the appropriate criminal court shall proceed to dispose of the same in the same manner as for other adult offenders and it shall not be necessary to transfer the case to the youth court of the county. However, unless the cause has been transferred, or unless the child has previously been the subject of a transfer from the youth court to the circuit court for trial as an adult and was convicted, the youth court shall have power on its own motion to remove jurisdiction from any criminal court of any offense including a hunting or fishing violation, a traffic violation, a violation of the Mississippi Implied Consent Law, or a violation of Section 67-3-70, committed by a child in a matter under the jurisdiction of the youth court and proceed therewith in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.

       After conviction and sentence of any child by any other court having original jurisdiction on a misdemeanor charge, and within the time allowed for an appeal of such conviction and sentence, the youth court of the county shall have the full power to stay the execution of the sentence and to release the child on good behavior or on other order as the youth court may see fit to make unless the child has previously been the subject of a transfer from the youth court to the circuit court for trial as an adult and was convicted. When a child is convicted of a misdemeanor and is committed to, incarcerated in or imprisoned in a jail or other place of detention by a criminal court having proper jurisdiction of such charge, such court shall notify the youth court judge or the judge’s designee of the conviction and sentence prior to the commencement of such incarceration. The youth court shall have the power to order and supervise the destruction of any records involving children maintained by the criminal court in accordance with Section 43-21-265. However, the youth court shall have the power to set aside a judgment of any other court rendered in any matter over which the youth court has exclusive original jurisdiction, to expunge or destroy the records thereof in accordance with Section 43-21-265, and to order a refund of fines and costs.

       In any case wherein the defendant is a child as defined in this chapter and of which the circuit court has original jurisdiction, the circuit judge, upon a finding that it would be in the best interest of such child and in the interest of justice, may at any stage of the proceedings prior to the attachment of jeopardy transfer such proceedings to the youth court for further proceedings unless the child has previously been the subject of a transfer from the youth court to the circuit court for trial as an adult and was convicted or has previously been convicted of a crime which was in original circuit court jurisdiction, and the youth court shall, upon acquiring jurisdiction, proceed as provided in this chapter for the adjudication and disposition of delinquent child proceeding proceedings. If the case is not transferred to the youth court and the youth is convicted of a crime by any circuit court, the trial judge shall sentence the youth as though such youth was an adult. The circuit court shall not have the authority to commit such child to the custody of the Department of Youth Services for placement in a state-supported training school.

       Although circuit court did not make any findings as to whether a transfer to youth court would be in the best interest of the minor and in the interest of justice; the error was harmless as there was no evidence which would support a finding that a transfer would be in defendant’s best interest or in the interest of justice as it the acts of the perpetrators demonstrated a clear lack of conscience, and they needed to be dealt with harshly, no matter their ages. Horne v. State, 825 So. 2d 627, 2002 Miss. LEXIS 260 (Miss. 2002).
      </p>

   Circuit court with original jurisdiction was not required to consider alternative sentencing under the Youth Court Act, Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c21s43-21-151" target="_self">43-21-151</a></cite> et seq. Flowers v. State, 805 So. 2d 654, 2002 Miss. App. LEXIS 54 (Miss. Ct. App. 2002).
      </p>
      <p>
       The court remanded a case to the circuit court for consideration of alternative sentencing under the Youth Court Act where the circuit court stated that the defendant was only 17 and had no prior offenses, but failed to state on the record whether it considered the provisions of the Youth Court Act before sentencing the defendant. Gary v. State, 760 So. 2d 743, 2000 Miss. LEXIS 135 (Miss. 2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court adequately considered juvenile Sentencing Guidelines by considering guidelines in context of juvenile’s motion for postconviction relief, even though court had made no notation in record of having considered guidelines at guilty plea hearing. Ferguson v. State, 688 So. 2d 760, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 680 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Issue of whether capital case juvenile is transferred from circuit court back to youth court is within sound discretion of circuit court judge. Foster v. State, 687 So. 2d 1124, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 216 (Miss. 1996), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">521 U.S. 1108</cite>, <cite class="s_court">117 S. Ct. 2488</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">138 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 996, 1997 U.S. LEXIS 3936 (U.S. 1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant’s claim that youthful offender statute was unconstitutional was procedurally barred, since defendant did not cite any authority for his proposition or give any reasons as to why his position was correct reflection of the law. Hoops v. State, 681 So. 2d 521, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 433 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       When considering alternative sentencing under youthful offender statute, trial judge must consider presence or absence of facilities for care of offender in mitigation of the punishment and allow defendant’s counsel the opportunity to introduce such evidence, and trial judge must also make specific findings as to basis for his sentence and include those findings in the record along with mitigation evidence. Hoops v. State, 681 So. 2d 521, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 433 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       There are alternatives set out in the Youth Court Act which the circuit court judge should consider in imposing sentence on a child; the trial judge should see to it that the record clearly reflects the reason which prompted him or her to exercise his or her discretion in utilizing or not utilizing the alternatives afforded, and the trial court should let the record disclose the facts which prompted the exercise of discretion either way. Erwin v. State, 557 So. 2d 799, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 57 (Miss. 1990), but see Strahan v. State, 729 So. 2d 800, 1998 Miss. LEXIS 343 (Miss. 1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       Alternatives under Youth Court Act are: (1) commit defendant to county jail for term not in excess of one year; (2) suspend sentence and release defendant on probation; (3) commit defendant to custody of Department of Corrections; and (4) impose fine as though defendant was adult under such terms and conditions as may be prescribed; however, Circuit Court shall not have authority to commit such child to custody of Department of Youth Services for placement in state supported training school. Gardner v. State, 514 So. 2d 292, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2520 (Miss. 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       Judge must consider alternative sentences available and in effect at time crime was committed, and not at time of sentencing, where subsequent amendment of statute limited alternatives available. Gardner v. State, 514 So. 2d 292, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2520 (Miss. 1987).

       Circuit court lacked jurisdiction over defendant juveniles’ case because there was not a transfer of jurisdiction to the circuit court from the youth court; the youth court possessed exclusive original jurisdiction over the proceeding because both defendants were seventeen years old at the time of the offense, and a youth-court transfer order or transcript from a hearing on the matter did not appear in the record. Meadows v. State, 217 So.3d 772, 2017 Miss. App. LEXIS 87 (Miss. Ct. App. 2017).

   In a trial of defendant who was 13 at the time of the murder, the trial court properly retained jurisdiction in the circuit court under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c21s43-21-151ol11" target="_self">43-21-151(1)</a></cite> as opposed to transferring the case to the youth court under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c21s43-21-159ol14" target="_self">43-21-159(4)</a></cite>, because the trial judge performed an extensive analysis of what would be in both defendant’s best interest, and the best interest of justice. After having done so, the trial judge found that the interests of justice necessitated that the case stay within the jurisdiction of the circuit court, rather than youth court. Edmonds v. State, 2006 Miss. App. LEXIS 88 (Miss. Ct. App. Jan. 31, 2006), op. withdrawn, sub. op., 955 So. 2d 864, 2006 Miss. App. LEXIS 311 (Miss. Ct. App. 2006).

   Matter was remanded to the youth court for a new dispositional hearing because the youth court had placed the juvenile in a state-supported training school, and the placement was now prohibited, pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c21s43-21-159ol15" target="_self">43-21-159(5)</a></cite>, because the juvenile had reached the age of 18; the youth court had other dispositional alternatives available to it, pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c21s43-21-605" target="_self">43-21-605</a></cite>. In the Interest of L.C.A., 938 So. 2d 300, 2006 Miss. App. LEXIS 640 (Miss. Ct. App. 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Youth Court Law did not offer the defendant an additional sentencing alternative since, although he was 17 years of age at the time of the commission of the crimes, he was under the original jurisdiction of the circuit court under subsection (4). Young v. State, 797 So. 2d 239, 2001 Miss. App. LEXIS 2 (Miss. Ct. App. 2001).

      <p>
       <p>
   Seventeen-year-old capital murder defendant was procedurally barred by res judicata from arguing in application for postconviction collateral relief that death penalty was unconstitutional due to lack of particularized finding by circuit court in retaining original jurisdiction over defendant and not transferring him to youth court, as issue had already been challenged on direct appeal, and defendant had merely camouflaged issue by couching claim as ineffective assistance of counsel. Foster v. State, 687 So. 2d 1124, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 216 (Miss. 1996), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">521 U.S. 1108</cite>, <cite class="s_court">117 S. Ct. 2488</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">138 L.

      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Defense counsel for 17-year-old capital murder defendant did not provide ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to request transfer proceeding from circuit court to youth court, as there was no prejudice to defendant; had counsel made request, trial judge would have found that defendant was on brink of 18 years of age and had violent, selfish nature, exhibited uncooperative tendencies, and had maturity to know right from wrong, and counsel would be hard-pressed to convince judge that defendant would not have committed subject types of acts once he was 18 years old and it was only because he had not yet turned 18 that he committed crimes due to his immaturity. Foster v. State, 687 So. 2d 1124, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 216 (Miss. 1996), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">521 U.S. 1108</cite>, <cite class="s_court">117 S. Ct. 2488</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">138 L.

      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant was not denied consideration of alternative sentencing under youthful offender statute, where trial judge told defendant’s counsel during defendant’s motion for new trial that he considered alternatives available when he sentenced defendant, youth services counselor recommended that defendant be tried in adult court system, and judge noted on the record the reasons for his sentence. Hoops v. State, 681 So. 2d 521, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 433 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   A trial judge in a murder prosecution was well within his discretion in sentencing the 14-year-old defendant to life imprisonment for aiding and abetting in the murder, in spite of the defendant’s argument that the judge abused his discretion by not stating in the record his reasons for declining to utilize possible alternative criminal sanctions for juvenile offenders provided for in §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c21s43-21-159" target="_self">43-21-159</a></cite> of the Youth Court Act, where the judge stated that he was very much aware of the requirements in May v. State (Miss. 1981) 398 So. 2d 1331 because of the many cases he had handled dealing with teenagers charged with capital offenses; although minimal, the trial court adequately addressed the reasons for not utilizing the alternatives afforded. Swinford v. State, 653 So. 2d 912, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 90 (Miss. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       Police officer did not violate state youth court law by allegedly taking 14-year-old into custody for driving his parents’ car without license, without order from youth court, as youth court did not have exclusive original jurisdiction over traffic offenses. White v. Walker, 950 F.2d 972, 1991 U.S. App. LEXIS 30338 (5th Cir. Miss. 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Where police officer charged 14 year old boy who was driving his parents’ car without a license, with offense of driving without license, and took boy to police station and issued him a ticket, and less than one hour after release boy committed suicide, officer did not violate Youth Court Law by taking boy into custody without order from Youth Court, since under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c21s43-21-159ol11" target="_self">43-21-159(1)</a></cite> Youth Court does not have “exclusive original jurisdiction” over traffic offenses; although subsection (1) of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c21s43-21-151" target="_self">43-21-151</a></cite> grants Youth Court “exclusive original jurisdiction in all proceedings concerning a delinquent child”, §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c21s43-21-159ol11" target="_self">43-21-159(1)</a></cite> creates an exception granting concurrent jurisdiction to appropriate criminal court in cases where child is charged with traffic violation; therefore if boy was taken into custody at all it was for a traffic violation and not for something over which Youth Court had exclusive or original jurisdiction.

Accordingly, a petitioner who pled guilty to the felony of burglary might have been eligible for relief pursuant to §§ 99-15-57 and 99-15-26 if his guilty plea had occurred on or after October 1, 1982, that being the earliest date to satisfy the “within 6 months prior to” March 31, 1983, requirement of § 99-15-57. However, the petitioner pleaded guilty to burglary on October 9, 1979, 3 years prior to October 1, 1982, and admitted that he did not fall within the criterion in any of the statutes authorizing expungement, and thus the trial court did not err in denying his petition for expungement.

   Where it appeared that the trial court, in sentencing a 16-year-old defendant convicted of armed robbery to a term of 14 years in state prison, had been under the misapprehension that §§<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.97.html#t97c03s97-3-79" target="_blank">97-3-79</a></cite> and<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.47.html#t47c07s47-7-3" target="_blank">47-7-3</a></cite>, read together, mandated a sentence of at least 10 years in the state penitentiary, absent a jury verdict of life imprisonment, the case would be remanded to the court for a clarification of the sentencing since there was no way to ascertain whether the trial court had considered the statutory alternative for sentencing minor offenders under the provisions of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c21s43-21-159ol13" target="_self">43-21-159(3)</a></cite>.

       <p>
   In a prosecution for armed robbery, a sentence of 12 years in prison, without eligibility of parole for 10 years, imposed upon a 14-year-old mentally retarded defendant did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment; however, the case would be remanded to the trial court for consideration of alternative sentencing under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c21s43-21-159" target="_self">43-21-159</a></cite> where the trial judge should have placed in the record the sources and facts of his sentence study and should have permitted the defendant’s attorney to introduce evidence of the presence or absence of facilities at the Mississippi State Penitentiary for the care of the defendant, and the availability of other institutions or facilities which could be utilized by the defendant.

       Order dismissing the petition alleging that the child was an abused child was the product of prosecutorial discretion, and the guardian ad litem was responsible for presenting the youth court with the motion to dismiss; the motion and resulting order, however, remained a product of prosecutorial discretion because the guardian ad litem was acting in accordance with his agreement with the prosecutor, and the order dismissing the petition did not render an adjudication as to the allegations in the petition as it simply abandoned the case, leaving all parties just as they were before the petition was filed, such that the youth court did not deprive the mother of her right to notice and a hearing. In the Interest of C.R., 879 So. 2d 1119, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 781 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).

       In proceedings to determine custody of 2 children who had been adjudicated neglected and placed in foster care, the children were denied their due process right of representation where they were without the services of an attorney or guardian ad litem for approximately 3 years during the course of the custody proceedings. Copiah County Dep't of Human Servs. v. Linda D. (In the Interest of R.D.), 658 So. 2d 1378, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 368 (Miss. 1995), overruled in part, D.T. v. Hinds Cnty.

In Interest of C.R., 604 So. 2d 1079, 1992 Miss. LEXIS 359 (Miss. 1992).
      </p>

   A trial court committed error by failing to conduct a separate and distinct dispositional hearing as required by §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c21s43-21-601" target="_self">43-21-601</a></cite> of the Youth Court Act (§§<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c21s43-21-101" target="_self">43-21-101</a></cite> et seq.) where the court determined, at the conclusion of the adjudicatory hearing which resulted in a finding that the child was educationally neglected, that the child should be placed in the Mississippi School for the Deaf. In Interest of C.R., 604 So. 2d 1079, 1992 Miss. LEXIS 359 (Miss. 1992).

       In noncriminal cases involving allegations of child abuse by the parent, the right of confrontation should be accorded to the accused parent. Bailey v. Woodcock, 574 So. 2d 1369 (Miss. 1990).

      <p>
       Where the testimony of a child is needed, it should not be declined except to avoid serious risk to the welfare of the child. To avoid this damage, the trial court must have considerable discretion as to the conduct of the examination and the appearance of the courtroom. Bailey v. Woodcock, 574 So. 2d 1369 (Miss. 1990).

   Where the circuit court ordered a sexual battery case filed against defendant juvenile to be transferred to youth court, the transfer was accepted and the youth court entered a final judgment adjudicating defendant a delinquent child. The State’s appeal of the transfer order was barred by the Fifth Amendment’s protection against double jeopardy; Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c21s43-21-203ol15" target="_self">43-21-203(5)</a></cite> did not limit the application of the right against double jeopardy in a juvenile proceeding.

      </h4>
      <p>
       To the extent that the supreme court or the court of appeals has held that the Mississippi Rules of Evidence have some diminished force in youth-court adjudications, the supreme court overrules the cases. When the youth court adjudicates the ultimate issue of abuse, the Rules must be given full effect. D.T. v. Hinds Cnty. Youth Court (In re J.T.), 188 So.3d 1192, 2016 Miss. LEXIS 165 (Miss. 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       Youth court erred in disregarding the Mississippi Rules of Evidence because Miss. R. Evid. 1101(a) applied the Rules to all proceedings unless otherwise provided, and Rule 1101(b) did not except youth-court adjudication hearings; both the rules of court and the Mississippi Code dictate that the Mississippi Rules of Evidence apply to abuse adjudications in youth court. D.T. v. Hinds Cnty. Youth Court (In re J.T.), 188 So.3d 1192, 2016 Miss. LEXIS 165 (Miss. 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       Specific rules have been promulgated by the supreme court to govern youth-court proceedings, and where those specific provisions depart from the Mississippi Rules of Evidence, the specific youth-court rule applies; but where no specific youth-court rule supersedes the Mississippi Rules of Evidence, the Rules apply with full force and effect, and neither the Rules of Evidence, nor the Uniform Youth Court Rules allow ad hoc amendment by trial judges. D.T. v. Hinds Cnty. Youth Court (In re J.T.), 188 So.3d 1192, 2016 Miss. LEXIS 165 (Miss. 2016).

     <p>
      In proceedings under this chapter, no court costs shall be charged against any party to a petition, and no salaried officer of the state, county or any municipality, nor any youth court counselor, nor any witness other than an expert witness shall be entitled to receive any fee for any service rendered to the youth court or for attendance in the youth court in any proceedings under this chapter; but the fees of the circuit and chancery clerks in youth court cases originating by petition shall be paid as is provided by law for like services in other cases and shall be paid by the county on allowance of the board of supervisors on an itemized cost bill approved by the judge. These costs shall be paid out of the general fund. No clerk shall be allowed compensation for attendance in youth court.

       Youth court action is in nature of complaint other than ex parte matter carrying $75 fee. Jones Nov. 10, 1993, A.G. Op. #93-0514.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the Department of Human Services (DHS) calls an expert witness in a parental termination case, the expense incurred would be the responsibility of the department; however, if an expert witness is sought on the motion of the guardian ad litem or the court, and the court so orders, any expert witness fee or expense would be borne by the county, not by DHS. Ward, May 4, 1999, A.G. Op. #99-0175.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where an order of the chancery court for filing intake records results in an order for no action, the chancery clerk may not charge a fee.
   Sumners, August 27, 1999, A.G. Op. #99-0342.
      </p>
      <p>
       The chancery clerk does not earn a fee where the Youth Court, without a hearing:
   (a) orders that no action be taken; (b) orders that an informal adjustment be made; (c) orders that the Department of Human Services, Division of Family and Children Services, monitor the child, family and other children in this same environment; or (d) orders that the child is warned or counseled informally.
   Sumners, August 27, 1999, A.G. Op. #99-0342.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fees paid to clerks in Youth Court cases are paid from the general fund, but are statutorily required to be paid in the same manner as fees for “like services” in other cases pursuant to an itemized cost bill approved by the appropriate judge; there is no authority for officials who receive such fees to have those fees paid through the county payroll with the county matching social security and retirement contributions. Lee, Jr., March 10, 2000, A.G. Op. #2000-0101.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the amount of the chancery clerk’s fee is calculated by reference to the laws “for like services in other cases,” the compensation is by the county to the clerk for services performed for the county by the clerk and, further, the chancery clerk is required by law to provide these services to the county; this is similar to the fees paid by the county to the medical examiner for services the examiner is required by law to provide to the county and is a direct payment for services rendered for which the board of supervisors is authorized to pay the matching employer’s contributions out of general funds; however, the same does not apply in lunacy cases where the parties to the litigation are liable for the costs and the county is only potentially liable in pauper’s cases. Childers, Jan. 25, 2002, A.G. Op. #02-0024.

       Juvenile’s required registration as a sex offender, following his adjudication of delinquency for sexual battery, did not violate the Youth Court Law’s confidentiality requirement. The names and addresses of juveniles adjudicated delinquent for sexual battery were exempted from the Youth Court Law’s confidentiality requirement for the purposes of registration as a sex offender. L.B.C. v. Forrest Cty. Youth Court, — So.3d —, 2017 Miss. LEXIS 443 (Miss. Nov. 30, 2017).
      </p>
      <p>
       Youth court erred by imposing a gag order in a child custody proceeding because it failed to consider any balancing test before imposing the gag order, thus, there existed no imminent danger to a compelling interest of such magnitude that the restraint on the parties’ speech was warranted. Cruz v. Jackson County, Dep't of Human Servs. (In the Interest of R.J.M.B.), 133 So.3d 335, 2013 Miss. LEXIS 305 (Miss. 2013).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Issue of confidentiality of youth court records was not moot because a federal court did not seal its records since Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c21s43-21-261" target="_self">43-21-261</a></cite> still had the effect of limiting the public’s ability to view, copy, or otherwise disseminate the youth-court records for any other reason. Cruz v. Jackson County, Dep't of Human Servs. (In the Interest of R.J.M.B.), 133 So.3d 335, 2013 Miss. LEXIS 305 (Miss. 2013).
      </p>
      <p>
       Youth court did not abuse its discretion in ordering that the youth court records in a child custody proceeding remain confidential because the mother could not expressly waive record confidentiality just because she was a parent. Cruz v. Jackson County, Dep't of Human Servs. (In the Interest of R.J.M.B.), 133 So.3d 335, 2013 Miss. LEXIS 305 (Miss. 2013).

       Registry of neglected and abused children should include name of person who was responsible for child at time abuse occurred; depending on facts, this person may also be perpetrator. Hathorn, Sept. 17, 1992, A.G. Op. #92-0679.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are two hurdles which must be overcome in order for an individual to be a “substantiated perpetrator” of abuse: first, the investigation by the Department of Human Services must have revealed the commission of act(s) of either sexual abuse or physical abuse, or child neglect causing a threat to life; and, second, there must be an adjudication or conviction for child neglect, or for sexual abuse or physical abuse which would otherwise be deemed a felony. Brooks, July 26, 2002, A.G. Op. #02-0401.
      </p>
      <p>
       Placement of any name on the central registry must be supported by a court order, and not simply a determination by DHS staff. Whether a hearing is required prior to an adjudication is a question for the judge to determine. Brittain, Aug. 29, 2003, A.G. Op. 03-0397.
      </p>
      <p>
       While the youth court judge may order that the individual’s name be placed on the registry, that individual must still be provided notice and an opportunity to be heard regarding the findings of abuse and/or neglect. Brittain, Aug. 29, 2003, A.G. Op. 03-0397.

       A youth court judge did not abuse his discretion in holding that youth court records of a juvenile’s adjudication of delinquency arising from a shoplifting incident could be released for the purposes of the juvenile’s civil suit for slander, assault, and battery against a store employee arising from the same incident. Daniels by Glass v. Wal-Mart Stores, 634 So. 2d 88, 1993 Miss. LEXIS 564 (Miss. 1993), limited, Sample v. State, 643 So. 2d 524, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 466 (Miss. 1994), limited, Mask v.

      </p>
      <p>
       Youth court records of a juvenile’s adjudication of delinquency arising from a shoplifting incident were admissible into evidence in the juvenile’s slander suit against a store employee arising from the same incident, since the truth is a total defense to a slander suit; the juvenile’s action of initiating the slander suit “lifted the veil of confidentiality” of the youth court proceedings, thereby exposing him to the “harsh realities of litigation.” Daniels by Glass v. Wal-Mart Stores, 634 So. 2d 88, 1993 Miss. LEXIS 564 (Miss. 1993), limited, Sample v. State, 643 So. 2d 524, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 466 (Miss. 1994), limited, Mask v.

       The right of “confidentiality” on behalf of the child in a youth court proceeding is a “qualified” and not an “absolute” privilege. Daniels by Glass v.

       Circuit court properly dismissed defendant’s petition for postconviction collateral relief because he failed to show that he was entitled to any relief where his petition—filed more than 13 years after the judgment of conviction was entered—was time barred, his sentence was consistent with the State’s plea offer, defendant’s guilty plea was knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily made, his sentence was presumptively valid and not violative of a fundamental, constitutional right, and the inquiries into defendant’s juvenile record were made in order to impeach his mother’s credibility after defense counsel opened the door during direct examination.

   Chancellor erred by refusing to allow the mother and father to review their daughter’s records from the youth court and to conduct an interview with the social worker in camera because the chancellor denied the appellate court an opportunity to review the evidence he relied upon in making his decision; also Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c21s43-21-261ol13" target="_self">43-21-261(3)</a></cite> granted parents the right to inspect the records which were to be considered by the youth court without the prerequisite of an order from the youth court.

       A youth court judge did not abuse his discretion in holding that youth court records of a juvenile’s adjudication of delinquency arising from a shoplifting incident could be released for the purposes of the juvenile’s civil suit for slander, assault, and battery against a store employee arising from the same incident. Daniels by Glass v. Wal-Mart Stores, 634 So. 2d 88, 1993 Miss. LEXIS 564 (Miss. 1993), limited, Sample v. State, 643 So. 2d 524, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 466 (Miss. 1994), limited, Mask v.

      <p>
       Youth court records of a juvenile’s adjudication of delinquency arising from a shoplifting incident were admissible into evidence in the juvenile’s slander suit against a store employee arising from the same incident, since the truth is a total defense to a slander suit; the juvenile’s action of initiating the slander suit “lifted the veil of confidentiality” of the youth court proceedings, thereby exposing him to the “harsh realities of litigation.” Daniels by Glass v. Wal-Mart Stores, 634 So. 2d 88, 1993 Miss. LEXIS 564 (Miss. 1993), limited, Sample v. State, 643 So. 2d 524, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 466 (Miss. 1994), limited, Mask v.

       The right of “confidentiality” on behalf of the child in a youth court proceeding is a “qualified” and not an “absolute” privilege. Daniels by Glass v.

       Youth Court Act does not require prior approval of youth court before records may be used to impeach testimony of witness in criminal proceeding; youth court confidentiality is for protection of youth, and no rational reading of statutory scheme would give adult shield when object of proceedings is truth of charges against him, not youth.

       Names and addresses of the witnesses who testified in the related youth-court proceedings had to be disclosed to a high school in parents’ negligence action seeking damages associated with the alleged assault of their daughter because allowing disclosure of information deemed relevant to the school’s defense through an in camera review balanced the parents’ interest in the confidentiality of youth-court records and the school’s interest in receiving a fair trial.

       Witness’s juvenile court record was offered for general impeachment purposes, which was not permitted, and the record was not offered to show bias or interest in testifying and thus the trial court properly refused to allow the witness to be cross-examined thereby; the witness’s prior instances of violence were inadmissible under Miss. R. Evid. 608(b) and the evidence was also inadmissible under Miss. R. Evid. 404(a), as it was offered to show that he was a violent person to create an inference that he acted in conformity with his propensity for violence. Williams v. State, 994 So. 2d 808, 2008 Miss.

Cruz v. Jackson County, Dep't of Human Servs. (In the Interest of R.J.M.B.), 133 So.3d 335, 2013 Miss. LEXIS 305 (Miss. 2013).

       Youth court did not abuse its discretion in ordering that the youth court records in a child custody proceeding remain confidential because the mother could not expressly waive record confidentiality just because she was a parent. Cruz v. Jackson County, Dep't of Human Servs. (In the Interest of R.J.M.B.), 133 So.3d 335, 2013 Miss. LEXIS 305 (Miss. 2013).

   Defendant’s conviction for sexual battery of a child by a person in a position of trust or authority over the child was proper because there was nothing in the record to indicate the existence of any Brady materials among the victim’s youth court records that were sought. Defendant was not entitled to engage in a fishing expedition, as he was not entitled to view all of the victim’s youth court records, Miss.

       Juvenile’s required registration as a sex offender, following his adjudication of delinquency for sexual battery, did not violate the Youth Court Law’s confidentiality requirement. The names and addresses of juveniles adjudicated delinquent for sexual battery were exempted from the Youth Court Law’s confidentiality requirement for the purposes of registration as a sex offender.

       Youth court judge may authorize release of information to schools concerning juvenile records of any student when judge finds that such disclosure is required for public safety and finds that health or safety of that student or other students in school may be affected if information is not made available to school officials. Bennett Nov. 3, 1993, A.G. Op. #93-0779.
      </p>
      <p>
       Restitution ordered to be made by the parents of the juvenile and by a juvenile who is adjudicated for an act which comes under Section 43-21-261(8) or (9) could be enrolled as a civil judgment. Any restitution ordered, since the youth court judge is empowered to order restitution from both the juvenile and the parents, guardians or caretakers, could be joint and several. Floyd, April 21, 1995, A.G. Op. #95-0219.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a juvenile is adjudicated delinquent for one of the crimes listed in Section 43-21-261(9), the name and address of the juvenile should be made available to the public. Hudson, May 8, 1995, A.G. Op. #95-0185.
      </p>
      <p>
       For acts which would be a felony if committed by an adult or for possession of a firearm, Section 43-21-261 requires two separate adjudications. Hudson, May 8, 1995, A.G. Op. #95-0185.
      </p>
      <p>
       If two petitions are filed at the same time and two adjudications made, the name and address of the juvenile should be made available to the public. If only one adjudication is made on the first petition alleging delinquency, even where more than one offense is charged in that petition, the name and address should not be made available to the public, except for adjudication for offenses specified in Section 43-21-261(9). Hudson, May 8, 1995, A.G. Op. #95-0185.

       The justice court record of a juvenile who is arrested and charged with DUI is a public record until and unless a court orders the charge nonadjudicated. Little, Oct. 6, 2000, A.G. Op. #2000-0592.

      <p>
       The Department of Human Services has authority to share certain records regarding allegations of abuse and neglect, including central registry contents, with the Department of Health, and this disclosure may be made without the necessity of a Youth Court Order permitting the release of that information. Thompson, Jr., Feb. 13, 2002, A.G. Op. #01-0771.
      </p>
      <p>
       Release by law enforcement of the name and identifying information of a child reported missing or abducted would not violate the provisions of this section. Riley, Sept. 27, 2002, A.G. Op. #02-0561.
      </p>
      <p>
       A general docket call each morning for all cases set for a hearing that day, with all parties and their attorneys present in the courtroom at the same time, would compromise the confidentiality provisions in Section 43-21-251 and this section and is therefore not legally permissible. Sigalas, Dec. 20, 2002, A.G. Op. #02-0739.
      </p>
      <p>
       The provisions of this section, which grant to a parent, guardian, custodian (or their attorney) or the attorney representing a child in a youth court action the right to inspect the records, allow disclosure of the records without the prerequisite of an order from the youth court. Taylor, July 30, 2004, A.G. Op. 04-0370.

Accordingly, a petitioner who pled guilty to the felony of burglary might have been eligible for relief pursuant to §§ 99-15-57 and 99-15-26 if his guilty plea had occurred on or after October 1, 1982, that being the earliest date to satisfy the “within 6 months prior to” March 31, 1983, requirement of § 99-15-57. However, the petitioner pleaded guilty to burglary on October 9, 1979, 3 years prior to October 1, 1982, and admitted that he did not fall within the criterion in any of the statutes authorizing expungement, and thus the trial court did not err in denying his petition for expungement.

       Evidence failed to demonstrate that a child was neglected because no evidence was offered to show that the mother’s fear of the father led to the child being neglected, and evidence of the mother’s positive test for marijuana usage was not shown to have affected the child; the mother’s marijuana usage did not negate the requirement of a causal connection between the drug usage and the neglect.

       Juvenile’s argument on appeal that the deputy did not have probable cause to arrest the juvenile for creating a disturbance at an alternative school was without merit because the deputy was making the arrest pursuant to a custody order that had been issued to the school by a youth court after the school had called and reported the disturbance. In the Interest of L.C.A., 938 So. 2d 300, 2006 Miss. App. LEXIS 640 (Miss. Ct. App. 2006).
      </p>

   Defendant’s convictions for burglary and armed robbery were both proper where he was 18-years-old at the time he gave his statement, Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c21s43-21-303ol13" target="_self">43-21-303(3)</a></cite>, and where, even had he only been 17-years-old, he could have been questioned without his mother’s presence pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c21s43-21-151ol13" target="_self">43-21-151(3)</a></cite> because the youth court did not have original jurisdiction concerning any act committed by a child that carried the possible criminal penalty of life imprisonment. Brown v. State, 839 So. 2d 597, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 165 (Miss. Ct. App. 2003).
      </p>

       Youth court does not have exclusive original jurisdiction over traffic offenses. White v. Walker, 950 F.2d 972, 1991 U.S. App. LEXIS 30338 (5th Cir. Miss. 1991).

       Police officer had probable cause to arrest a thirteen-year-old juvenile for resisting arrest for disorderly conduct in that the juvenile refused to comply with the officer’s reasonable instructions to put the juvenile’s hands on a patrol car, when the officer responded to a report that gunshots had been fired in the area from a car that matched the description of the car defendant was standing near, and in fact struggled with the officer and other responding officers. S.M.K.S. v. Youth Court of Union County, 155 So.3d 876, 2014 Miss. App. LEXIS 2 (Miss. Ct. App. 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Because defendant was 17 years old at the time the alleged felony offense of accessory after the fact to murder was committed, jurisdiction was proper in the circuit court pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c21s43-21-151" target="_self">43-21-151</a></cite> (Rev. 2004). Moreover, although defendant argued that the statements he made to the police were inadmissible because the police failed to take his statements in compliance with the requirements of the Youth Court Act, Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c21s43-21-303ol13" target="_self">43-21-303(3)</a></cite> (Rev. 2004), the youth court did not have jurisdiction over defendant’s case, and since the Youth Court Act did not apply, parental notification was unnecessary. Miller v. State, 18 So.3d 898, 2009 Miss. App. LEXIS 675 (Miss. Ct. App. 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Defendant’s age, 17 years, did not require that he have parent present during interrogation in view of fact that he was charged with murder and had been certified to circuit court on another crime. Blue v. State, 674 So. 2d 1184, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 304 (Miss.), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">519 U.S. 1030</cite>, <cite class="s_court">117 S. Ct. 588</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">136 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 517, 1996 U.S. LEXIS 7523 (U.S. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Because defendant was charged with murder, circuit court was court of “original jurisdiction” and provisions for having a parent present during interrogation and actions in the youth court were thus inapplicable. Blue v. State, 674 So. 2d 1184, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 304 (Miss.), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">519 U.S. 1030</cite>, <cite class="s_court">117 S. Ct. 588</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">136 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 517, 1996 U.S. LEXIS 7523 (U.S. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Police officer did not violate state youth court law by allegedly taking 14-year-old into custody for driving his parents’ car without license, without order from youth court, as youth court did not have exclusive original jurisdiction over traffic offenses. White v. Walker, 950 F.2d 972, 1991 U.S. App. LEXIS 30338 (5th Cir. Miss. 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   A police department’s refusal of a mother’s request to be present during the interrogation of her 17-year-old son was a violation of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c21s43-21-303ol13" target="_self">43-21-303(3)</a></cite> which necessitated reversal of the son’s conviction.

   Although defendant was 14 years old when interviewed by the police without the presence of a parent, an attorney, or other friendly adult, defendant’s statement was admissible because defendant was accused of murder and, as such, he was no longer afforded the protections of the Youth Court Act, Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c21s43-21-303" target="_self">43-21-303</a></cite>. Evans v. State, 109 So.3d 1056, 2011 Miss. App. LEXIS 343 (Miss. Ct.

   42 USCS § 1983.

   Defendant’s conviction for being an accessory after the fact to her husband’s crime of statutory rape by assisting her daughter in obtaining an abortion was appropriate because defendant’s proposed jury instruction was legally in error; defendant, the victim’s mother, was told by her daughter of the sexual abuse while defendant worked at a school, and thus she had a reporting requirement under Miss.

       Where two parents were unable to produce evidence to rebut the presumption that a principal acted in good faith by reporting suspected child abuse, a trial court properly granted a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim since the principal had immunity in an action alleging defamation, slander, libel, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and false light.

   For purposes of governmental immunity, the statutory framework for reporting cases of suspected child abuse includes elements of both ministerial and discretionary conduct; §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c21s43-21-353" target="_self">43-21-353</a></cite> first requires a person to make a determination of whether “reasonable cause” exists as a foundation for an incident report, which involves a duty to investigate a ministerial duty and a decision as to whether reasonable cause exists a decision involving the exercise of personal judgment and discretion; if a determination is made that there is reasonable cause to report the incident, the statute then mandates that an immediate oral report be issued to the Department of Human Services an action involving no discretion.

       Employees of the Mississippi Department of Human Services are not prohibited from serving as the intake unit for abuse and neglect cases, but they must be appointed by the youth court judge and, as salaried public employees, must not receive additional compensation from the municipality or county.

      <p>
       The update to the youth court prosecutor referred to in subsection (1) would consist of any information which becomes available to the department which would be pertinent to the youth court prosecutor’s decision of whether or not to file a petition in the youth court.
   Taylor, June 19, 1998, A.G. Op. #98-0318.
      </p>
      <p>
       The responsibility of the Department of Human Services under subsection (8) requires only a determination of whether the reported abuse or neglect was done by a parent, guardian, or custodian or any person responsible for a child’s care or support; once this question has been answered in the negative, any investigation of the abuse or neglect is solely the responsibility of law enforcement agencies.

       Youth court did not err in ordering the Mississippi Department of Human Services Division of Family and Children’s Services (DHS) to monitor a mother and father because the evidence of a mother’s drug usage was sufficient for DHS to monitor them and the child; the mother’s later, diluted negative drug test results could have created suspicion, or perhaps even an inference of drug use that merited further monitoring and investigation.

       Proceedings violated the Youth Court Law, and consequently, the right of a juvenile and his parents to due process, because the petition against the juvenile was filed forty-eight days after his detention hearing. J.P. v. State, 151 So.3d 204, 2014 Miss. LEXIS 561 (Miss. 2014).

   While the 90-day requirement set forth in §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c21s43-21-551" target="_self">43-21-551</a></cite> is stated in the mandatory “shall,” dismissal by the youth court for failure to file within the required period after authorization to file the petition is discretionary under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c21s43-21-451" target="_self">43-21-451</a></cite>. A youth court did not abuse its discretion in not dismissing a petition, seeking to have a child adjudged an abused child, for failure to comply with §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c21s43-21-451" target="_self">43-21-451</a></cite>’s 10-day time limit where the reasons given by the youth court for not dismissing the petition were that it would not be in the best interest of the child and the tremendous case load of the youth court, and the child’s father failed to demonstrate any prejudice that resulted from the 26-day delay and failed to make any inquiry concerning the case until approximately 2 months after the date of the shelter hearing. In Interest of T.L.C., 566 So. 2d 691, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 431 (Miss. 1990), overruled in part, D.T. v. Hinds Cnty. Youth Court (In re J.T.), 188 So.3d 1192, 2016 Miss. LEXIS 165 (Miss. 2016).

       Alternative school programs are integral part of school district; programs are operated in connection with regular programs of district and are subject to accreditation standards established by State Department of Education; therefore, assignment to alternative program is not expulsion or suspension from school district and would not require full due process hearing; informal conference with student during which he or she is allowed to explain his or her side is sufficient process in such cases.

       Petition alleging a child was neglected was insufficient because there were no facts to “show” that she was “a neglected child”; in the absence of a causal connection between the facts alleged in the petition and the petition’s charge of neglect, the petition was legally insufficient to provide notice to the child, the mother, or the father of the particular circumstances that were to be inquired into at the adjudicatory proceedings. E.K. v. Miss. Dep't of Child Prot. Servs., 249 So.3d 377, 2018 Miss. LEXIS 323 (Miss. 2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       Youth court exceeded its authority in denying parents’ motion to set aside a judgment adjudicating their child as a child in need of special care because the Department of Human Services petition did not state a basis for invoking its jurisdiction; there was no specific allegation that the child had any mental or physical illness, and thus, the youth court based its decision to place the child in custody as a child in need of special care upon evidence of neglect of the parents’ other children. S.M. v. Miss. Dep't of Human Servs. (In the Interest of N.M.), 215 So.3d 1007, 2017 Miss. App. LEXIS 202 (Miss. Ct. App. 2017).
      </p>
      <p>
       Proceedings violated the Youth Court Law, and consequently, the right of a juvenile and his parents to due process, because not a single fact was alleged to support the charge against the juvenile; the complete failure to provide adequate notice of the charges violated the Due Process Clauses of the United States and Mississippi Constitutions. J.P. v. State, 151 So.3d 204, 2014 Miss. LEXIS 561 (Miss. 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   The fact that a youth court petition failed to state the statute or ordinance which the juvenile was alleged to have violated was not fatal where the juvenile and his attorney were well aware of the nature of the charges; however, Youth Court prosecutors and Youth Courts should take seriously the statutory directive of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c21s43-21-455ol11d" target="_self">43-21-455(1)(d)</a></cite>, which governs Youth Court proceedings, and include in their petitions “a citation of the statute or ordinance which the child is alleged to have violated.” In Interest of R.T., 520 So. 2d 136, 1988 Miss. LEXIS 124 (Miss. 1988).

       The petition could not support a finding that appellant was a delinquent under the Youth Court Law where, in attempting to charge offenses of grand larceny and burglary, it omitted any allegations as to ownership of the articles allegedly stolen and any description of the property allegedly burglarized, or even the ownership or right of ownership of that property. In Interest of Earles, 294 So. 2d 171, 1974 Miss. LEXIS 1816 (Miss. 1974).
      </p>
      <p>
       A petition which institutes a youth court proceeding must recite factual allegations specific and definite enough to fairly apprise juvenile, his parents, custodians or guardians of particular act or acts of misconduct or the particular circumstances which will be inquired into at adjudicatory proceedings, and in those cases where a charge of delinquency is based upon violation of a criminal law, petition must charge offense with the same particularity required in a criminal indictment. In Interest of Dennis, 291 So. 2d 731, 1974 Miss. LEXIS 1743 (Miss. 1974).
      </p>
      <p>
       The youth court is a court of statutory and limited jurisdiction, and the facts vesting jurisdiction should be shown affirmatively. Griffin v. Bell, 215 So. 2d 573, 1968 Miss. LEXIS 1366 (Miss. 1968).
      </p>
      <p>
       A petition alleging merely that a child is neglected, without setting forth the facts supporting the assertion, is insufficient. Interest of Slay, 245 Miss. 294, 147 So. 2d 299, 1962 Miss. LEXIS 554 (Miss. 1962).
      </p>
      <p>
       An allegation in general terms of delinquency does not bring a child within the operation of this act; hence it is not sufficient to allege that the child “is fast becoming uncontrollable” by its parents and “is violating the laws of the state in various ways.” Sharp v. State, 240 Miss. 629, 127 So. 2d 865, 1961 Miss. LEXIS 493 (Miss. 1961).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where petition to commit minor to training school did not set forth names of parents or guardian or state they were unknown, as required, commitment was unlawful. Yarborough v. Coulter, 162 Miss. 50, 138 So. 591, 1932 Miss. LEXIS 104 (Miss. 1932).
      </p>
      <p>
       A petition for commitment of child must show existence of conditions specified in the statute. Holden v. Smith, 135 Miss. 322, 100 So. 27, 1924 Miss. LEXIS 46 (Miss. 1924).

       Youth court’s adjudication of a child as neglected was in violation of the mother’s rights because there was no evidence that service was perfected on the mother, who was a required party to the child’s neglect adjudication; the mother’s presence at the adjudicatory hearing and the initial disposition hearing was not enough to find that she waived her right to service of process because the youth court did not engage her on the record to determine if she waived her rights. E.K. v. Miss. Dep't of Child Prot. Servs., 249 So.3d 377, 2018 Miss. LEXIS 323 (Miss. 2018).

       Where the presence of a previously declared delinquent minor and his mother was the third time that they had appeared before the court in connection with a petition to revoke the minor’s probation, and his court appointed counsel had been appointed 15 days before the hearing, and the record left no doubt that such counsel gave the minor vigorous, conscientious and capable representation throughout, under the circumstances there was no denial of due process because of inadequate notice of the hearing.

      <p>
       The decree of the youth court was reversed and the cause remanded where no order had been entered fixing a date and place for the hearing, process was not issued and served upon the minor and his custodial relatives, the hearing without process was had within two days after the petition was filed, and the indigent minor was denied appointed counsel. In Interest of Edwards, 298 So. 2d 703, 1974 Miss. LEXIS 1566 (Miss. 1974).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Youth Court Act contemplates a hearing with the parents present during the entire proceedings, and where the child’s parent had been excluded from the hearing the court’s order committing the child to a training school was rendered without due process of law and invalid.

   A minor cannot waive process required by this section [Code 1972, §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c21s43-21-13" target="_self">43-21-13</a></cite>], and the youth court has no jurisdiction of the person until process has been served upon the minor and his parents, or persons standing in loco parentis; notice to the parents may be waived by them, but not process on the minor. In Interest of Edwards, 298 So. 2d 703, 1974 Miss. LEXIS 1566 (Miss. 1974).
      </p>
      <p>
       The youth court is without jurisdiction unless the parents or guardian, if available, be summoned as required by this section [Code 1942, § 7185-06]. Hopkins v. Youth Court of Issaquena County, 227 So. 2d 282, 1969 Miss. LEXIS 1341 (Miss. 1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       It is invalid to conduct a hearing without summoning the parent or parents of the minor, and it is invalid to conduct a hearing when the parent, when present, is excluded from the courtroom. Hopkins v. Youth Court of Issaquena County, 227 So. 2d 282, 1969 Miss. LEXIS 1341 (Miss. 1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the minor was a neglected child, since the only person who appeared on his behalf at the hearing in the youth court was the minor’s aunt, and the proof disclosed that the father of the minor resided within the state, and no attempt was made to get process upon him, the youth court was without authority to send the minor to the state hospital for examination, observation and treatment. Walker v. State, 238 Miss. 532, 119 So. 2d 277, 1960 Miss. LEXIS 434 (Miss. 1960).
      </p>
      <p>
       The court is without jurisdiction to make a committal order where it is not shown that the parents were given personal notice of the hearing or that the appearance of the minor with the parents in court was voluntary. Monk v. State, 238 Miss. 658, 116 So. 2d 810, 1960 Miss. LEXIS 452 (Miss. 1960).
      </p>
      <p>
       A decree of committal of a minor to a state industrial school was void, and the minor was entitled to discharge in habeas corpus proceedings, where it appeared that, while process was issued for and was served on his father, and also on his grandfather and grandmother, the minor being in the custody of the grandparents at the time, service of process was not made upon him, and it was not shown that he was present at the committal hearing, no judgment, order or decree being valid or binding upon a party who has no notice of the proceedings against him.

      </p>
      <p>
       The invalidity of the provision of Code 1942 § 7185-06 that a minor may waive issuance and service of process by voluntary appearance does not affect the rest of the statute. Sharp v. State, 240 Miss. 629, 127 So. 2d 865, 1961 Miss. LEXIS 493 (Miss. 1961).

       Even if a mother knowingly waived her rights, the youth court still would have erred in proceeding to the adjudication of the child as neglected because the father was not present for the hearing. E.K. v. Miss. Dep't of Child Prot. Servs., 249 So.3d 377, 2018 Miss. LEXIS 323 (Miss. 2018).

       Youth court had no jurisdiction to adjudicate a mother’s son as a child in need of supervision and the mother’s two other sons as sexually abused because neither the mother nor any of the children were served a summons or were present at a hearing, and the children could not waive service, so the adjudications were void.

       Because a juvenile’s father was served with his summons for hearing only two days before the hearing occurred, his service did not comply with the rules of service established by the Youth Court Law; however, the father appeared at the hearing, and any infirmity in the service was cured by the father’s appearance.

       Proceedings violated the Youth Court Law, and consequently, the right of a juvenile and his parents to due process, because the youth court never held an adjudicatory hearing, despite the juvenile’s being detained for a total of 133 days; when the youth court postponed the adjudicatory hearing, it did so on its own motion, and after twenty-one days from the date of the juvenile’s detainment, the youth court was without authority to hold him in detention. J.P. v. State, 151 So.3d 204, 2014 Miss. LEXIS 561 (Miss. 2014).

   The statutory requirements for an adjudicatory hearing under the Youth Court Act (§§<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c21s43-21-101" target="_self">43-21-101</a></cite> et seq.) were met where the proceedings were recorded by a court reporter pursuant to §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c21s43-21-203ol17" target="_self">43-21-203(7)</a></cite>, the parties received notice of the hearing more than 3 days before it was scheduled to begin under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c21s43-21-507" target="_self">43-21-507</a></cite>, and the hearing was held within 90 days of the filing of the petition under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c21s43-21-551" target="_self">43-21-551</a></cite>; the fact that the proceeding was postponed for approximately three months was without consequence since §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c21s43-21-551" target="_self">43-21-551</a></cite> provides that a hearing may be continued upon a showing of good cause, and therefore the hearing was held within the time provided by the Youth Court Act.

      </p>

       <p>
   While the 90-day requirement set forth in §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c21s43-21-551" target="_self">43-21-551</a></cite> is stated in the mandatory “shall,” dismissal by the youth court for failure to file within the required period after authorization to file the petition is discretionary under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c21s43-21-451" target="_self">43-21-451</a></cite>. A youth court did not abuse its discretion in not dismissing a petition, seeking to have a child adjudged an abused child, for failure to comply with §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c21s43-21-451" target="_self">43-21-451</a></cite>’s 10-day time limit where the reasons given by the youth court for not dismissing the petition were that it would not be in the best interest of the child and the tremendous case load of the youth court, and the child’s father failed to demonstrate any prejudice that resulted from the 26-day delay and failed to make any inquiry concerning the case until approximately 2 months after the date of the shelter hearing. In Interest of T.L.C., 566 So. 2d 691, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 431 (Miss. 1990), overruled in part, D.T. v. Hinds Cnty. Youth Court (In re J.T.), 188 So.3d 1192, 2016 Miss. LEXIS 165 (Miss. 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   The Youth Court Act contemplates the existence of a youth court clerk, and a petition is deemed “filed” when delivered to that office with no necessity of filing in the circuit clerk’s office. The youth court clerk is the clerk of the youth court, and therefore a petition was “filed” on the date it was delivered to the clerk of the youth court. Thus, the 90-day requirement of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c21s43-21-551" target="_self">43-21-551</a></cite> was complied with where the adjudicatory hearing commenced 87 days after the petition was delivered to the youth court clerk. In Interest of T.L.C., 566 So. 2d 691, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 431 (Miss. 1990), overruled in part, D.T. v. Hinds Cnty. Youth Court (In re J.T.), 188 So.3d 1192, 2016 Miss. LEXIS 165 (Miss. 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       If adjudicatory hearing is not held within 21 days, child may be released from detention, but petition under which child is being held need not be dismissed so long as 90 day limitation period is not exceeded. In Interest of W.R.A., 481 So. 2d 280, 1985 Miss. LEXIS 2422 (Miss. 1985).

   In a case where a full evidentiary hearing was not held until 126 days after the charging petition was filed, dismissal of the juvenile proceeding was not mandated under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c21s43-21-551ol11" target="_self">43-21-551(1)</a></cite>, because an initial hearing was held 13 days after the petition was filed, and even though not titled as such, it was an adjudicatory hearing which was continued until the later full evidentiary hearing; the continuance was for good cause, namely, full evidentiary disclosure.

       The court should exercise care to assure that an admission or confession was voluntary in the sense, not only that is was not coerced or suggested, but also that it was not the product of ignorance of rights, or of adolescent fantasy, fright, or despair; the youth charged has the same right to testify for the limited purpose of testing the admissibility of a confession as an adult under a criminal charge; and any confessions or admissions which are self-incriminating must meet the constitutional standard of due process in order to be admissible at any hearing.

       Youth court’s adjudication of a child as neglected was in violation of the mother’s due-process right to representation because there was no evidence that service was perfected on her; clearly indicating the importance of the mother’s right to representation, the Youth Court Act reiterated the youth court’s duty to make sure that a party understood her right to counsel, and it further provided a right to a continuance if the party wished to engage representation E.K. v.

      </p>

       Because a juvenile’s father was served with his summons for hearing only two days before the hearing occurred, his service did not comply with the rules of service established by the Youth Court Law; however, the father appeared at the hearing, and any infirmity in the service was cured by the father’s appearance.

Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c21s43-21-557" target="_self">43-21-557</a></cite>, the error was harmless because there was no resulting prejudice or unfairness shown; defendant was allowed to cross-examine witnesses, witnesses were called to testify on her behalf, and defendant was served with a summons outlining her right to counsel and to subpoena witnesses.

Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c21s43-21-557" target="_self">43-21-557</a></cite> the error was harmless when the juvenile was at all times represented by appointed counsel with knowledge of juvenile law.

In Interest of T.L.C., 566 So. 2d 691, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 431 (Miss. 1990), overruled in part, D.T. v. Hinds Cnty. Youth Court (In re J.T.), 188 So.3d 1192, 2016 Miss. LEXIS 165 (Miss. 2016).

       Youth court’s adjudication of a child as neglected was in violation of the mother’s rights because there was no evidence that service was perfected on the mother, who was a required party to the child’s neglect adjudication; the mother’s presence at the adjudicatory hearing and the initial disposition hearing was not enough to find that she waived her right to service of process because the youth court did not engage her on the record to determine if she waived her rights.

       Where the youth court provided competent counsel for the delinquent youth, it was not necessary under this section that the youth court provide counsel for the parents of the youth. In Interest of Evans, 350 So. 2d 52, 1977 Miss. LEXIS 2209 (Miss. 1977).
      </p>
      <p>
       An order of the youth court adjudging two minors as delinquent was reversed and the case was remanded for further proceedings where the record failed to show that the minors were informed of their right to counsel or that they waived that right. Copeland v. State, 292 So. 2d 171, 1974 Miss. LEXIS 1763 (Miss. 1974).
      </p>
      <p>
       In proceedings to adjudge juvenile a delinquent, service of process 11 days before hearing afforded minor, his parents, and his attorney full time for preparation; record supported finding that youth court had venue and jurisdiction; minor fully understood his rights and his statement was freely and voluntarily made after his constitutional rights were explained to him; and minor waived his right to confrontation by the accusing witness, a young girl, by making no mention or request for her personal appearance at the hearing. In re in Interest of Wise, 291 So. 2d 727, 1974 Miss. LEXIS 1742 (Miss. 1974).
      </p>
      <p>
       It is well settled in our jurisprudence that a juvenile is entitled to many of the constitutional rights afforded an adult where “critically important actions determining vitally important statutory rights of the juvenile are concerned”, the juvenile is entitled to a hearing upon constitutional principles relating to due process with the assistance of counsel. Patterson v. Hopkins, 350 F. Supp. 676, 1972 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11971 (N.D. Miss. 1972), aff'd, 481 F.2d 640, 1973 U.S. App. LEXIS 9413 (5th Cir. Miss. 1973).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although trial by jury in the juvenile court’s adjudicative stage is not a constitutional requirement it is an inescapable conclusion that while all of the constitutional guarantees accorded an adult are not required in juvenile proceedings, the applicable due process standard in juvenile proceedings is “fundamental fairness”. Patterson v. Hopkins, 350 F. Supp. 676, 1972 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11971 (N.D. Miss. 1972), aff'd, 481 F.2d 640, 1973 U.S. App. LEXIS 9413 (5th Cir. Miss. 1973).

       A juvenile has the same right to due process as an adult has under the Constitution of the United States and the state Bill of Rights. Dependents of Roberts v. Holiday Parks, Inc., 221 So. 2d 92, 1969 Miss. LEXIS 1488 (Miss. 1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section [Code 1942, § 7185-08] recognizes that matters brought under this act may be adversary proceedings, and it is only fitting and proper that the minor and his parents be advised that they are entitled to legal representation, and the court in delinquency proceedings should so advise them. Krebs v. Stephenson, 184 So. 2d 861, 1966 Miss. LEXIS 1485 (Miss. 1966).

       As to defendant’s alleged possession of a controlled substance, several students either testified or submitted written statements implicating defendant in drug activity at the subject school, but none of those students could testify to dates, and no tangible evidence of a chemically analyzed controlled substance was offered by the State at any time during the hearing. An agent for the State simply testified that the youth’s descriptions of the various pills corresponded with the descriptions of several Schedule II drugs; secondly, although a number of the youths stated that defendant told them he was stealing pills and selling them, standing alone, those statements (out-of-court admissions by a child defendant), were insufficient to support an adjudication of delinquency, and the evidence failed to meet the required proof beyond a reasonable doubt standard, which was applicable to adult proceedings as well as juvenile proceedings. In the Interest of T.B., 909 So. 2d 131, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 563 (Miss. Ct. App. 2005), overruled in part, D.T. v. Hinds Cnty. Youth Court (In re J.T.), 188 So.3d 1192, 2016 Miss.

       An adjudication of delinquency cannot be based solely on the unsubstantiated incriminating statement of the juvenile. J.P.C. v. State (In the Interest of J.P.C.), 783 So. 2d 778, 2000 Miss. App. LEXIS 564 (Miss. Ct. App. 2000).

       Evidence failed to demonstrate that a child was neglected because no evidence was offered to show that the mother’s fear of the father led to the child being neglected, and evidence of the mother’s positive test for marijuana usage was not shown to have affected the child; the mother’s marijuana usage did not negate the requirement of a causal connection between the drug usage and the neglect. E.K. v. Miss. Dep't of Child Prot. Servs., 249 So.3d 377, 2018 Miss. LEXIS 323 (Miss. 2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       To the extent that the supreme court or the court of appeals has held that the Mississippi Rules of Evidence have some diminished force in youth-court adjudications, the supreme court overrules the cases. When the youth court adjudicates the ultimate issue of abuse, the Rules must be given full effect. D.T. v. Hinds Cnty. Youth Court (In re J.T.), 188 So.3d 1192, 2016 Miss. LEXIS 165 (Miss. 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       Youth court erred in disregarding the Mississippi Rules of Evidence because Miss. R. Evid. 1101(a) applied the Rules to all proceedings unless otherwise provided, and Rule 1101(b) did not except youth-court adjudication hearings; both the rules of court and the Mississippi Code dictate that the Mississippi Rules of Evidence apply to abuse adjudications in youth court. D.T. v. Hinds Cnty. Youth Court (In re J.T.), 188 So.3d 1192, 2016 Miss. LEXIS 165 (Miss. 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       Specific rules have been promulgated by the supreme court to govern youth-court proceedings, and where those specific provisions depart from the Mississippi Rules of Evidence, the specific youth-court rule applies; but where no specific youth-court rule supersedes the Mississippi Rules of Evidence, the Rules apply with full force and effect, and neither the Rules of Evidence, nor the Uniform Youth Court Rules allow ad hoc amendment by trial judges. D.T. v. Hinds Cnty. Youth Court (In re J.T.), 188 So.3d 1192, 2016 Miss. LEXIS 165 (Miss. 2016).

   In a delinquency adjudication for the act of burglary, any statement by the juvenile was inadmissible under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c21s43-21-559" target="_self">43-21-559</a></cite> (Rev. 2009) because it was uncorroborated where the only other evidence presented was a low-resolution, home-surveillance video, which directed contradicted the juvenile’s statement. Testimony of witnesses who merely had watched the surveillance video likewise did not corroborate such an “admission.” C.K.B. v. Harrison County Youth Court, 36 So.3d 1267, 2010 Miss. LEXIS 306 (Miss. 2010).

   This section did not bar admission into evidence in defendant’s trial for armed robbery of known fingerprints that had been taken when defendant was a youth, particularly since §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.99.html#t99c15s99-15-13" target="_blank">99-15-13</a></cite> [repealed] permits law enforcement officers to take the fingerprints of those charged with crime for identification purposes, where there was no evidence that the known fingerprints had been given in evidence in a youth court proceeding. Nixon v. State, 336 So. 2d 742, 1976 Miss. LEXIS 1522 (Miss. 1976).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where no evidence was offered as to the ownership of places allegedly burglarized except passing references by state witnesses to “Mrs. Edmond’s Fruit Stand” and “Johnny Cleveland’s Trailer Park,” this was hearsay on the part of the witnesses and consequently inadmissible, and inasmuch as there was no proof of ownership of the premises allegedly burglarized or the name of the person entitled to possession thereof, the judgment of the youth court adjudging a child to be a delinquent child would be reversed, the child discharged and the proceedings against him dismissed. In Interest of Jenkins, 274 So. 2d 143, 1973 Miss. LEXIS 1594 (Miss. 1973).
      </p>
      <p>
       It was reversible error to permit the youth court referee to testify on the trial of the defendant in circuit court as to his recollection of what the defendant, a 14-year-old boy, had said on his trial in youth court when placed by his attorney upon the witness stand; for this section [Code 1942, § 7185-09] specifically prohibits the admissibility in any other court of evidence given in youth courts.

       State failed to produce sufficient evidence to prove that a child had been sexually abused because it produced no evidence that the child’s facially ambiguous statement described abuse since the statement could describe sexual abuse or innocent contact, and no additional evidence was provided to show abuse; the parents provided an innocent explanation, and neither the Mississippi Department of Human Services nor the investigative guardian ad litem discovered evidence of abuse.

       Youth court properly found that a four-year-old child was neglected because four different family members all stated that the child was being sexually abused by his 11-year-old brother, one of the family members provided eyewitness testimony of a sexual encounter between the child and his brother, and a forensic interview neither confirmed nor rejected the allegations of sexual abuse.

       Defendant sought to attack the victim’s credibility and show that she had a motive to lie for ill will by introducing evidence at trial regarding a juvenile adjudication of a shoplifting charge, and notwithstanding the prohibition on the use of a juvenile adjudication for the purpose of impeachment, the crime of shoplifting could not be used for impeachment purposes because it was not a crime categorized as crimen falsi; thus, the trial court did not err in excluding defendant’s questioning regarding the victim’s juvenile shoplifting adjudication.

       In a capital murder trial, defense counsel was able to adequately question an eyewitness to the crime about his relevant juvenile record, even though the questioning was limited; the trial court permitted questioning about two instances: one was relating to where the eyewitness met defendant and the other was relating to a conviction for auto theft, which showed a propensity for dishonesty and a motive to steal a murder victim’s vehicle.

   The right to cross-examine a witness as to prior convictions in order to show bias or interest is guaranteed an accused under the Sixth Amendment and should be interpreted liberally to favor the accused; however, an accused does not have an absolute right under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.13.html#t13c01s13-1-13" target="_blank">13-1-13</a></cite> or case law prior to adoption of the Mississippi Rules of Evidence to require a witness to disclose any prior convictions in order to attack his or her credibility simply because the witness had been convicted of a criminal offense.

       Section 43-21-561(5) and Rule 609(d), Miss. R. Ev. serve the same purpose, have the same objective, and, though worded differently, provide the same general criterion for a trial judge in exercising his or her discretion to determine whether a previous youth court adjudication should be admissible in the cross-examination of a minor witness; the only difference is that under the Rule a criminal defendant may not be cross-examined as to his or her prior youth court adjudications, so that, in a criminal case, the court’s discretion extends only to witnesses other than the accused.

       Criminal defendants were properly precluded from cross-examining the State’s juvenile witness as to his juvenile record where the trial court told the defense attorneys that they could cross-examine the witness to show special treatment, offers or concessions, or to show any bias or interest, but could not just ask him about his juvenile court record, the defense attorneys did not make any proffer of what they expected to show by cross-examining the witness as to his youth court record except a general statement to show “bias or interest,” and the defense attorneys did not attempt before the jury to explore the witness’ state of mind when he was questioned by the police or the State.

      <p>
       In a case in which a mother appealed a youth court’s adjudication that she had neglected her two minor children and had placed the children in the legal custody of the Department of Human Services (DHS), the facts supported the youth court’s finding that, at minimum, the children were not being provided the proper and necessary care or support or other care necessary for their well-being. The youth court was presented with conflicting testimony about the mother’s care and support for her children, and based on the mother’s alarming actions and statements that she would turn the children over to DHS, it could not be concluded with confidence that the youth court judge’s decision was manifestly wrong. S. v. State, 47 So.3d 715, 2010 Miss. App. LEXIS 138 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 49 So.3d 1139, 2010 Miss. LEXIS 606 (Miss. 2010).

       The siblings of a child who had been sexually abused by the children’s father were neglected and abused minor children within the meaning of the Youth Court Act by virtue of the fact that their sister was abused.

       It is well settled in our jurisprudence that a juvenile is entitled to many of the constitutional rights afforded an adult where “critically important actions determining vitally important statutory rights of the juvenile are concerned”, the juvenile is entitled to a hearing upon constitutional principles relating to due process with the assistance of counsel. Patterson v. Hopkins, 350 F. Supp. 676, 1972 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11971 (N.D. Miss. 1972), aff'd, 481 F.2d 640, 1973 U.S. App. LEXIS 9413 (5th Cir. Miss. 1973).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although trial by jury in the juvenile court’s adjudicative stage is not a constitutional requirement it is an inescapable conclusion that while all of the constitutional guarantees accorded an adult are not required in juvenile proceedings, the applicable due process standard in juvenile proceedings is “fundamental fairness”. Patterson v. Hopkins, 350 F. Supp. 676, 1972 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11971 (N.D. Miss. 1972), aff'd, 481 F.2d 640, 1973 U.S. App. LEXIS 9413 (5th Cir. Miss. 1973).

       A youth “who violates any state law or municipal ordinance,” even though it be his first such offense, may be adjudicated to be a “delinquent child” unless some violation is by some other applicable statute excluded from the purview of Code 1942 § 7185-02(g). In Interest of Suratt, 273 So. 2d 178, 1973 Miss. LEXIS 1564 (Miss. 1973).
      </p>
      <p>
       The right of an accused to confront and cross-examine his accuser is so broad and fundamental as to transcend the right of a juvenile accuser to keep secret his former delinquent activity, and the refusal to permit a full cross-examination of a juvenile whose testimony implicated one defendant with possession of LSD, and who had been adjudged a juvenile delinquent, and was afraid of being returned to the training school, was error.

       In a case in which the father appealed an order adjudicating his children as abused, his appeal was dismissed based on lack of jurisdiction because the father appealed directly from the youth court’s adjudication order without first allowing the youth court or the chancery court to conduct a disposition hearing and enter a disposition order; and there was not yet a final appealable order of disposition as the youth court’s disposition order expressly stated that the youth court was withholding disposition, relinquishing jurisdiction, and transferring the matter to chancery court, and, when the father noticed the appeal, neither the youth court nor the chancery court had completed the statutorily required steps antecedent to a proper appeal.

       Specific rules have been promulgated by the supreme court to govern youth-court proceedings, and where those specific provisions depart from the Mississippi Rules of Evidence, the specific youth-court rule applies; but where no specific youth-court rule supersedes the Mississippi Rules of Evidence, the Rules apply with full force and effect, and neither the Rules of Evidence, nor the Uniform Youth Court Rules allow ad hoc amendment by trial judges.

       Youth court’s adjudication of delinquency and disposition were proper because it was not allowed to include in its disposition order the very information that a juvenile requested, any argument that the detention was unreasonable or inappropriate was moot due to his release from detention, and the juvenile’s supervised probation, though not limited in time, was not inappropriate or unreasonable. In the Interest of J.C.M., 135 So.3d 210, 2014 Miss. App. LEXIS 140 (Miss. Ct. App. 2014).

   Youth court took into consideration the factors in Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c21s43-21-603" target="_self">43-21-603</a></cite> when it committed defendant to a training school and placed her on probation until her 18th birthday in a case where defendant assaulted a teacher; the youth court clearly found that defendant’s therapy and medications were not working.

       Youth court did not err in ordering that it was in the best interest of the child to grant durable legal custody to the foster parents, based on the child’s situation of chronic abuse and long-term physical placement with the same foster family, as opposed to reunification with the mother. In re S.A.M., 826 So. 2d 1266, 2002 Miss. LEXIS 291 (Miss. 2002).

   The evidence was insufficient to support a finding that a deaf child was “educationally neglected” within the meaning of the Youth Court Act (§§<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c21s43-21-101" target="_self">43-21-101</a></cite> et seq.) where the child was enrolled in the best public school situation available to her in her local community, and therefore the court erred in ruling that the child should be removed from her home and placed in the Mississippi School for the Deaf; a court cannot remove a child from her home and family simply because a more desirable setting is available elsewhere, as the court must first find a failure of the child’s environment and then take steps to protect the child’s interests.

   A youth court’s failure to advise a child’s father, prior to adjudicatory and dispositional hearings to determine whether the child should be adjudged an abused child, of certain rights pursuant to §§<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c21s43-21-557" target="_self">43-21-557</a></cite> and<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c21s43-21-603" target="_self">43-21-603</a></cite> was harmless where the father was ably represented by counsel during both the adjudicatory and dispositional hearings, the father’s counsel vigorously cross-examined the witnesses called by the youth court prosecutor and gave closing argument, the father, through his counsel, was heard on all pretrial objections to jurisdiction and other points, and the father could point to no denial of any right that would make the hearings any less than fair. In Interest of T.L.C., 566 So. 2d 691, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 431 (Miss. 1990), overruled in part, D.T. v. Hinds Cnty. Youth Court (In re J.T.), 188 So.3d 1192, 2016 Miss. LEXIS 165 (Miss. 2016).

       Hearsay and opinion evidence may be considered in disposition hearings, the youth-court equivalent of adult sentencing hearings; this comports with Miss. R.

       To the extent that the supreme court or the court of appeals has held that the Mississippi Rules of Evidence have some diminished force in youth-court adjudications, the supreme court overrules the cases.

       Youth court erred in disregarding the Mississippi Rules of Evidence because Miss. R.

       As to defendant’s alleged possession of a controlled substance, several students either testified or submitted written statements implicating defendant in drug activity at the subject school, but none of those students could testify to dates, and no tangible evidence of a chemically analyzed controlled substance was offered by the State at any time during the hearing. An agent for the State simply testified that the youth’s descriptions of the various pills corresponded with the descriptions of several Schedule II drugs; secondly, although a number of the youths stated that defendant told them he was stealing pills and selling them, standing alone, those statements (out-of-court admissions by a child defendant), were insufficient to support an adjudication of delinquency, and the evidence failed to meet the required proof beyond a reasonable doubt standard, which was applicable to adult proceedings as well as juvenile proceedings. In the Interest of T.B., 909 So. 2d 131, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 563 (Miss. Ct. App. 2005), overruled in part, D.T. v. Hinds Cnty. Youth Court (In re J.T.), 188 So.3d 1192, 2016 Miss.

       The lower court could have bypassed the “reasonable efforts” to reunite the children with the parents and could have expedited the matter as a preference case for termination of parental rights where both parents refused to acknowledge the father’s sexual abuse of the children at issue, the father failed to obtain counseling though the court-ordered program, and the mother failed to establish her own home independent of the father and work with the department of human services for the return of the children.

       This section [Code 1942, § 7201] does not require that an order of committal to a proper state institution affirmatively recite that it is to the best interest of the child and the public that the child be so committed.

       Where delinquents under eighteen years of age had been arrested for the commission of a crime to which they pleaded guilty but the delinquents were not convicted therefor and no criminal sentence imposed upon them, this section [Code 1942, § 7201] rather than Code 1942, § 6755 applies so that the court, acting as a juvenile court, had jurisdiction to commit them to the proper state institution even though there was no affirmative finding that it was for the best interests of the delinquents and of the public that they should be so committed.

Only a child who has been adjudicated delinquent for a felony may be committed to the training school. In the event a child is committed to the Oakley Youth Development Center by the court, the child shall be deemed to be committed to the custody of the Department of Human Services which may place the child in the Oakley Youth Development Center or another appropriate facility.

          The training school may retain custody of the child until the child’s twentieth birthday but for no longer. When the child is committed to the training school, the child shall remain in the legal custody of the training school until the child has made sufficient progress in treatment and rehabilitation and it is in the best interest of the child to release the child. However, the superintendent of the state training school, in consultation with the treatment team, may parole a child at any time he or she may deem it in the best interest and welfare of such child. Ten (10) business days before the parole, the training school shall notify the committing court of the pending release. This notice may be made in less than ten (10) days if Oakley Youth Development Center needs to manage population limitations. The youth court may then arrange subsequent placement after a reconvened disposition hearing, except that the youth court may not recommit the child to the training school or any other secure facility without an adjudication of a new offense or probation or parole violation. The Department of Human Services shall ensure that staffs create transition planning for youth leaving the facilities. Plans shall include providing the youth and his or her parents or guardian with copies of the youth’s training school education and health records, information regarding the youth’s home community, referrals to mental and counseling services when appropriate, and providing assistance in making initial appointments with community service providers. Before assigning the custody of any child to any private institution or agency, the youth court through its designee shall first inspect the physical facilities to determine that they provide a reasonable standard of health and safety for the child. No child shall be placed in the custody of the state training school for a status offense or for contempt of or revocation of a status offense adjudication unless the child is contemporaneously adjudicated for having committed an act of delinquency that is not a status offense. A disposition order rendered under this subparagraph shall meet the following requirements:

          3. The disposition order provides that the court has considered the medical, educational, vocational, social and psychological guidance, training, social education, counseling, substance abuse treatment and other rehabilitative services required by that child as determined by the court;

The term of service will be from twenty-four (24) to one hundred twenty (120) hours of community service. A juvenile will work the hours to which he or she was adjudicated on the weekends during school and weekdays during the summer. Parents are responsible for a juvenile reporting for work.

         (i) Order the child into a juvenile detention center operated by the county or into a juvenile detention center operated by any county with which the county in which the court is located has entered into a contract for the purpose of housing delinquents. The time period for detention cannot exceed ninety (90) days, and any detention exceeding forty-five (45) days shall be administratively reviewed by the youth court no later than forty-five (45) days after the entry of the order. At that time the youth court counselor shall review the status of the youth in detention and shall report any concerns to the court. The youth court judge may order that the number of days specified in the detention order be served either throughout the week or on weekends only. No first-time nonviolent youth offender shall be committed to a detention center for a period in excess of ninety (90) days until all other options provided for in this section have been considered and the court makes a specific finding of fact by a preponderance of the evidence by assessing what is in the best rehabilitative interest of the child and the public safety of communities and that there is no reasonable alternative to a nonsecure setting and therefore commitment to a detention center is appropriate.

       Proceedings violated the Youth Court Law, and consequently, the right of a juvenile and his parents to due process, because the juvenile spent 103 days in a juvenile detention facility. J.P. v. State, 151 So.3d 204, 2014 Miss. LEXIS 561 (Miss. 2014).

   Matter was remanded to the youth court for a new dispositional hearing because the youth court had placed the juvenile in a state-supported training school, and the placement was now prohibited, pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c21s43-21-159ol15" target="_self">43-21-159(5)</a></cite>, because the juvenile had reached the age of 18; the youth court had other dispositional alternatives available to it, pursuant to Miss.

   A youth court order violated §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c21s43-21-605" target="_self">43-21-605</a></cite> where it stated that it would be inappropriate for the minor to be released from custody in less than one year, and required the superintendent of the state training school to provide the court with “conclusive proof” that parole would be in the minor’s best interest, since the statute indicates that decisions regarding parole of youths are to be decided by the superintendent of the training facility.

       Where delinquents under eighteen years of age had been arrested for the commission of a crime to which they pleaded guilty but the delinquents were not convicted therefor and no criminal sentence imposed upon them, Code 1942, § 7201 rather than Code 1942, § 6755 applies so that the court, acting as a juvenile court, had jurisdiction to commit them to the proper state institution even though there was no affirmative finding that it was for the best interests of the delinquents and of the public that they should be so committed.

       If acts of a student, although not rising to the level of a felony, are such that the student poses a threat to the safety of himself or others or will disrupt the educational process at the Alternative School, then the School Board may remove the student from the school system altogether. If a compulsory-school-age child is expelled from the Alternative School for criminal or violent behavior, the school district must refer the case to the youth court if probable cause exists.

       § 43-21-609.
    Dispositional alternatives in neglect and abuse cases.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      In neglect and abuse cases, the disposition order may include any of the following alternatives, giving precedence in the following sequence:
     </p>
     <p>
      Release the child without further action;
     </p>
     <p>
      Place the child in the custody of his parents, a relative or other person subject to any conditions and limitations as the court may prescribe. If the court finds that temporary relative placement, adoption or foster care placement is inappropriate, unavailable or otherwise not in the best interest of the child, durable legal custody may be granted by the court to any person subject to any limitations and conditions the court may prescribe; such durable legal custody will not take effect unless the child or children have been in the physical custody of the proposed durable custodians for at least six (6) months under the supervision of the Department of Human Services. The requirements of Section 43-21-613 as to disposition review hearings do not apply to those matters in which the court has granted durable legal custody. In such cases, the Department of Human Services shall be released from any oversight or monitoring responsibilities;
     </p>
     <p>
      (i) Grant durable legal relative guardianship to a relative or fictive kin licensed as a foster parent if the licensed relative foster parent or licensed fictive kin foster parent exercised physical custody of the child for at least six (6) months before the grant of durable legal relative guardianship and the Department of Child Protection Services had legal custody or exercised supervision of the child for at least six (6) months. In order to establish durable legal relative guardianship, the youth court must find the following:
     </p>
     <p>
      1. That both reunification and adoption have been determined to be inappropriate;
     </p>
     <p>
      2. That the relative guardian or fictive kin guardian shows full commitment to the care, shelter, education, nurture, and reasonable medical care of the child; and
     </p>
     <p>
      3. That the youth court consulted with any child twelve (12) years of age or older before granting durable legal relative guardianship.
     </p>
     <p>
      The requirements of Section 43-21-613 as to disposition review hearings do not apply to a hearing concerning durable legal relative guardianship. However, the Department of Child Protection Services must conduct an annual review and recertification of the durable legal relative guardianship to determine whether it remains in the best interest of the child. If a material change in circumstances occurs adverse to the best interest of the child, the parent, relative guardian, fictive kin guardian, or Department of Child Protection Services may petition the court to review the durable legal relative guardianship;
     </p>
     <p>
      Order terms of treatment calculated to assist the child and the child’s parent, guardian or custodian which are within the ability of the parent, guardian or custodian to perform;
     </p>
     <p>
      Order youth court personnel, the Department of Child Protection Services or child care agencies to assist the child and the child’s parent, guardian or custodian to secure social or medical services to provide proper supervision and care of the child;
     </p>
     <p>
      Give legal custody of the child to any of the following but in no event to any state training school:
     </p>
     <p>
      The Department of Child Protection Services for appropriate placement; or
     </p>
     <p>
      Any private or public organization, preferably community-based, able to assume the education, care and maintenance of the child, which has been found suitable by the court. Prior to assigning the custody of any child to any private institution or agency, the youth court through its designee shall first inspect the physical facilities to determine that they provide a reasonable standard of health and safety for the child;
     </p>
     <p>
      If the court makes a finding that custody is necessary as defined in Section 43-21-301(3)(b), and that the child, in the action pending before the youth court had not previously been taken into custody, the disposition order shall recite that the effect of the continuation of the child’s residing within his or her own home would be contrary to the welfare of the child, that the placement of the child in foster care is in the best interests of the child, and unless the reasonable efforts requirement is bypassed under Section 43-21-603(7)(c), the order also must state:
     </p>
     <p>
      That reasonable efforts have been made to maintain the child within his or her own home, but that the circumstances warrant his or her removal, and there is no reasonable alternative to custody; or
     </p>
     <p>
      The circumstances are of such an emergency nature that no reasonable efforts have been made to maintain the child within his or her own home, and there is no reasonable alternative to custody; or
     </p>
     <p>
      If the court makes a finding in accordance with (ii) of this paragraph, the court shall order that reasonable efforts be made towards the reunification of the child with his or her family; or
     </p>
     <p>
      If the court had, before the disposition hearing in the action pending before the court, taken the child into custody, the judge or referee shall determine, and the youth court order shall recite that reasonable efforts were made by the Department of Child Protection Services to finalize the child’s permanency plan that was in effect on the date of the disposition hearing.

       Where the mother’s children were removed from her home after her husband was charged with raping their 11-year-old daughter, the trial court did not err in refusing durable legal custody and terminating her parental rights. The mother did not qualify for durable legal custody, because she had not had custody of her children for at least one year prior to the proceeding. May v. Harrison County Dep't of Human Servs., 883 So. 2d 74, 2004 Miss. LEXIS 1013 (Miss. 2004).

      </p>
      <p>
       Youth court did not err in ordering that it was in the best interest of the child to grant durable legal custody to the foster parents, based on the child’s situation of chronic abuse and long-term physical placement with the same foster family, but the youth court erred in relieving the Mississippi Department of Human Services in the case, as the intent of durable legal custody was merely to avoid the required annual dispositional reviews, not a complete preclusion of further involvement. In re S.A.M., 826 So. 2d 1266, 2002 Miss. LEXIS 291 (Miss. 2002).
      </p>
      <p>
       While preference in custody matters was first given to parents, then relatives, and lastly to other people or agencies, relatives did not always have a preferential right to custody, especially where, as in the instant case, the infant or her brother incurred unexplained injuries consistent with those found in cases involving child abuse when with the parents or relatives, and, thus, the best interests of the infant did not involve placing her with those people. In re E.M., 810 So. 2d 596, 2002 Miss. LEXIS 103 (Miss. 2002).
      </p>
      <p>
       The evidence was insufficient to support the youth court’s action of dissolving a no-contact order previously issued by the circuit court to prohibit a criminal defendant from being alone with his step-daughter, who was the victim of a gratification of lust charge to which the defendant pled guilty, where the circuit court order remained intact, no evidence or strategy was presented to assure the court that the step-daughter would not be alone and unsupervised while in the defendant’s presence, and there was conflicting testimony as to whether the defendant received adequate treatment for sexual abuse as required by the circuit court order. Loggans v. Hall (In the Interest of D.K.L.), 652 So. 2d 184, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 158 (Miss. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   The evidence was insufficient to support a finding that a deaf child was “educationally neglected” within the meaning of the Youth Court Act (§§<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c21s43-21-101" target="_self">43-21-101</a></cite> et seq.) where the child was enrolled in the best public school situation available to her in her local community, and therefore the court erred in ruling that the child should be removed from her home and placed in the Mississippi School for the Deaf; a court cannot remove a child from her home and family simply because a more desirable setting is available elsewhere, as the court must first find a failure of the child’s environment and then take steps to protect the child’s interests.

       Despite the fact the record indicated that there was a substantial compliance with requirements of the trial court, the trial court properly directed that proceedings to terminate parental rights be instituted, where from all the evidence the court was apparently was of the opinion that the best interest of the child required the institution of such proceedings.

       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       Although a youth court did not use the specific language “durable legal custody” in its permanency order, it could be inferred from the court’s order that it did so and that it was in the child’s best interest to grant a great-aunt durable legal custody. Smith v. Coahoma County Dep't of Human Servs. (In the Interest of Joey), 149 So.3d 560, 2014 Miss. App. LEXIS 596 (Miss. Ct. App. 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Durable legal custody was not a mandatory option for the youth court and ultimately the paramount concern in determining proper disposition continued to be the best interest of the child, not reunification of the family; thus, the youth court did not err by not considering alternatives to termination of parental rights, specifically, durable legal custody under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c21s43-21-609" target="_self">43-21-609</a></cite>. B.S.G. v. J.E.H., 958 So. 2d 259, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 402 (Miss. Ct. App. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       Fact that under durable legal custody the parent retains some form of residual rights and responsibilities is a vital and obvious distinction to termination of parental rights. Another distinction is that a decision to grant durable legal custody is not permanent and is, therefore, subject to further review and modification by the courts. May v. Harrison County Dep't of Human Servs., 883 So. 2d 74, 2004 Miss. LEXIS 1013 (Miss. 2004).

       In a case in which a mother appealed a youth court’s adjudication that she had neglected her two minor children and had placed the children in the legal custody of the Department of Human Services (DHS), the facts supported the youth court’s finding that, at minimum, the children were not being provided the proper and necessary care or support or other care necessary for their well-being. The youth court was presented with conflicting testimony about the mother’s care and support for her children, and based on the mother’s alarming actions and statements that she would turn the children over to DHS, it could not be concluded with confidence that the youth court judge’s decision was manifestly wrong.

    Dispositional alternatives for children in need of special care.

     </h3>
     <p>
      If the youth court finds at the disposition hearing that a delinquent child, a child in need of supervision, a neglected child, an abused child or a dependent child is also a child in need of special care, the youth court may, in its discretion, make any appropriate additional disposition designed for the treatment of the disability or infirmity, which may include civil commitment to a state institution providing care for that disability or infirmity. Any commitment, including one to a Department of Mental Health facility, ordered pursuant to this section shall be in compliance with the requirements for civil commitment as set forth in Section 41-21-61 et seq. Discharge from a Department of Mental Health facility shall be made pursuant to the provisions of Section 41-21-87. Nothing contained in this section shall require any state institution, department or agency to provide any service, treatment or facility if said service, treatment or facility is not available, nor shall this section be construed to authorize the youth court to overrule an expulsion or suspension decision of appropriate school authorities.

       Youth court exceeded its authority in denying parents’ motion to set aside a judgment adjudicating their child as a child in need of special care because the Department of Human Services petition did not state a basis for invoking its jurisdiction; there was no specific allegation that the child had any mental or physical illness, and thus, the youth court based its decision to place the child in custody as a child in need of special care upon evidence of neglect of the parents’ other children.

       Under Section 43-21-611, the youth court would have original jurisdiction over commitment of a mentally ill juvenile only where that juvenile is already in youth court jurisdiction as abused, neglected, delinquent, in need of supervision or dependent. Jurisdiction over commitment proceedings for adults and for all other juveniles would be in chancery court pursuant to Section 41-21-63. Floyd, March 29, 1996, A.G. Op. #96-0148.

The hearing shall be initiated by the filing of a petition that complies with the sections governing petitions in this chapter and that includes a statement of the youth court’s original disposition order, probation or parole, the alleged violation of that order, probation or parole, and the facts which show the violation of that order, probation or parole.

       Procedure used by the youth court to charge a father for a juvenile’s confinement fell drastically short of the basic procedures that guaranteed that a parent’s due process rights were observed because the father was not notified that he could be charged for the juvenile’s detention, and he was not old the cost, or given the opportunity to object to the charge. J.P. v. State, 151 So.3d 204, 2014 Miss. LEXIS 561 (Miss. 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       Youth court erred in ordering a juvenile’s parents to pay for the cost of his confinement in juvenile detention because it failed to follow the procedures put in place to determine delinquency; the youth court did not articulate the proper burden of proof necessary for its judgment, and under the Youth Court Law, it was without authority and jurisdiction to sentence the juvenile to a detention facility when no petition had been filed against him and when he was not adjudicated delinquent. J.P. v. State, 151 So.3d 204, 2014 Miss. LEXIS 561 (Miss. 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       Contrary to a foster mother’s claims, in changing custody from her to the children’s natural father, the trial court did not rely on the natural parent presumption, but imposed the burden on the father to show a material change in circumstances, which was the appropriate standard. Barnett v. Oathout, 883 So. 2d 563, 2004 Miss. LEXIS 1227 (Miss. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Youth court did not err in ordering that it was in the best interest of the child to grant durable legal custody to the foster parents, based on the child’s situation of chronic abuse and long-term physical placement with the same foster family, but the youth court erred in relieving the Mississippi Department of Human Services in the case, as the intent of durable legal custody was merely to avoid the required annual dispositional reviews, not a complete preclusion of further involvement. In re S.A.M., 826 So. 2d 1266, 2002 Miss. LEXIS 291 (Miss. 2002).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a hearing on a mother’s petition to restore custody of her 2 children, who had been adjudicated neglected and placed in foster care, the applicable standard for the chancellor’s consideration was whether there was “a material change in circumstances as to custody that would benefit and be for the best interest of the children”; the focus does not change in custody matters where it is not one parent vying against the other for custody of their child, but rather, the Department of Human Services seeking to retain custody of a neglected or abused child rather than have the child returned to a parent. Copiah County Dep't of Human Servs. v. Linda D. (In the Interest of R.D.), 658 So. 2d 1378, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 368 (Miss. 1995), overruled in part, D.T. v. Hinds Cnty. Youth Court (In re J.T.), 188 So.3d 1192, 2016 Miss. LEXIS 165 (Miss. 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a proceeding to determine custody of 2 children who had been adjudicated neglected and placed in foster care, the chancellor erred by deciding to return custody of the children to their natural mother, even though she had substantially complied with the requirements in the “service agreement” submitted to her by the Department of Human Services, where almost nothing had changed about the mother’s situation or her attitude toward caring for her children since she lost custody, and the children were afraid of her and did not want to return to her home. Copiah County Dep't of Human Servs. v. Linda D. (In the Interest of R.D.), 658 So. 2d 1378, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 368 (Miss. 1995), overruled in part, D.T. v. Hinds Cnty.

       Trial court properly granted a natural father’s petition for custody modification, as the children’s foster mother’s unjustified refusal to allow the father visitation or telephone contact was a material change in circumstances adverse to the children. Barnett v. Oathout, 883 So. 2d 563, 2004 Miss. LEXIS 1227 (Miss. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       The lower court could have bypassed the “reasonable efforts” to reunite the children with the parents and could have expedited the matter as a preference case for termination of parental rights where both parents refused to acknowledge the father’s sexual abuse of the children at issue, the father failed to obtain counseling though the court-ordered program, and the mother failed to establish her own home independent of the father and work with the department of human services for the return of the children. S.R.B.R. v. Harrison County Dep't of Human Servs., 798 So. 2d 437, 2001 Miss. LEXIS 70 (Miss. 2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       Sections 43-21-603 and 43-21-613 clearly contemplate that strict adherence to the rules of evidence will not be required, and “concerns over hearsay evidence and the like are basically dismissed.” Copiah County Dep't of Human Servs. v. Linda D. (In the Interest of R.D.), 658 So. 2d 1378, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 368 (Miss. 1995), overruled in part, D.T. v. Hinds Cnty. Youth Court (In re J.T.), 188 So.3d 1192, 2016 Miss.

       The youth court’s jurisdiction of youth adjudged to be delinquent is a continuing one, with a continuing power to alter the terms of probation if, in the interests of the child, the original arrangement proves inadequate or ill advised, since without such flexibility the court would no longer be in an advantageous position to give a delinquent youth “another chance” as an initial measure, at least, by granting probation upon terms of the least possible restraint and mild supervision. McLeod v. Boone, 232 So. 2d 733, 1970 Miss. LEXIS 1644 (Miss. 1970).

      <p>
       At a minor’s probation revocation hearing, the fact that the acts of misconduct charged to the minor did not violate any express condition of his probation did not mean that the youth court was without power to revoke probation or to change its conditions, in view of the fact that it was shown that the minor, during his probation, had been taken into custody on numerous occasions by law officers in connection with various acts of misconduct, which included “car prowling”, shoplifting, incidents of assault and battery, and creating a public disturbance, it being an implicit condition of every order of probation that the probationer refrain from engaging in any criminal activity.

       The youth court may, in compliance with the laws governing education of children, order any state-supported public school in its jurisdiction after notice and hearing to enroll or reenroll any compulsory-school-age child in school, and further order appropriate educational services.

For the purpose of this section “violent act” means any action which results in death or physical harm to another or an attempt to cause death or physical harm to another.

       Mississippi Supreme Court intends to make clear that, should evidence indicate that a sexual assault or attempted sexual assault occurred, it is, without question, a violent act; thus, a youth court acted outside of its authority when it ordered the reenrollment of two students who had been expelled from school based on evidence presented to the expelling school board that they had been involved in the sexual assault of a female student on a school campus. Lauderdale County Sch. Bd. v. Brown, 106 So.3d 807, 2013 Miss. LEXIS 33 (Miss. 2013).

   While Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c21s43-21-621ol11" target="_self">43-21-621(1)</a></cite> empowers a youth court to order a state-supported public school within its jurisdiction to enroll or reenroll any compulsory-school-age child in school, the statute does not grant to the youth court the power to designate the specific school in which the child is to be enrolled.

      <li id="t43c21s43-21-625ol11">
       The Department of Human Services shall develop and implement a wilderness training program for first time youth offenders sentenced or classified as delinquency cases or as children in need of supervision.
      </li>
      <li id="t43c21s43-21-625ol12">
       The program shall include supervised camping trips, calisthenics, manual labor assignments, physical training with obstacle courses, training in decision-making and personal development and drug counseling and rehabilitation programs.
      </li>
      <li id="t43c21s43-21-625ol13">
       The department shall adopt rules requiring that wilderness training participants complete a structured disciplinary program and allowing for a restriction on general inmate population privileges.
      </li>
      <li id="t43c21s43-21-625ol14">
       Upon receipt of youth offenders, the department shall screen offenders for the wilderness training program. To participate, an offender must have no physical limitations which would preclude participation in strenuous activity, must not be impaired and must not have been previously incarcerated in a state or federal correctional facility. In screening offenders for the wilderness training program, the department shall consider the offender’s criminal history and the possible rehabilitative benefits of the program. If an offender meets the specified criteria and space is available, the department shall request in writing from the sentencing court, approval to participate in the wilderness training program. If the person is classified by the court as a delinquent or child in need of supervision and the department is requesting approval from the sentencing court for placement in the program, the department shall, at the same time, notify the prosecuting attorney that the offender is being considered for placement in the wilderness training program. The notice shall explain that the purpose of such placement is diversion from lengthy incarceration when a wilderness training program could produce the same deterrent effect, and that the person given notice may, within fourteen (14) days of the mailing of the notice, notify the sentencing court in writing of objections, if any, to the placement of the offender in the wilderness training program. The sentencing court shall notify the department in writing of placement approval no later than twenty-one (21) days after receipt of the department’s request for placement of the youthful offender in the wilderness training program. Failure to notify the department within twenty-one (21) days shall be considered an approval by the sentencing court for placing the youthful offender in the wilderness training program. The offices of the prosecuting attorneys may develop procedures for notifying each victim that the offender is being considered for placement in the wilderness training program.
      </li>
      <li id="t43c21s43-21-625ol15">
       The program shall provide a period of rigorous training to offenders who require a greater degree of supervision than community control or probation provides. Wilderness training programs may be operated in secure areas in or adjacent to adult institutions or in any area approved by the department. The program is not intended to divert offenders away from probation or community control but to divert them from long periods of incarceration when a wilderness training program could produce the same deterrent effect.
      </li>
      <li id="t43c21s43-21-625ol16">
       If an offender in the wilderness training program becomes unmanageable, the department may place him in an appropriate facility to complete the remainder of his sentence. Any period of time in which the offender is unable to participate in the wilderness training program activities may be excluded from the specified time requirements in the program. The portion of the sentence served prior to placement in the wilderness training program shall not be counted toward program completion. Upon the offender’s completion of the wilderness training program, the department shall submit a report to the court that describes the offender’s performance. If the offender’s performance has been satisfactory, the court shall issue an order modifying the sentence imposed and placing the offender on probation. If the offender violates the conditions of probation, the court may revoke probation and impose any sentence which it might have originally imposed.
      </li>
      <li id="t43c21s43-21-625ol17">
       The department shall provide a special training program for staff selected for the wilderness training program.

      Each youth court is authorized to establish a youth court work program as an alternative disposition for nonviolent offenders. The youth court work program shall be used only for first time nonviolent youth offenders. The court shall solicit and approve the assistance of volunteers from the area served by the youth court, including business and community volunteers. The court may require a nonviolent youth offender to work for a minimum of six (6) months with a court approved volunteer as part or all of a sentence imposed by the court. The volunteers shall provide a working environment as mentors to provide guidance and support and to teach the youth offender job skills. Each youth offender and volunteer shall be under the supervision of the court and shall make regular reports to the court as required by order of the court. If a youth offender violates the terms and conditions imposed by the court while participating in the youth court work program, the court is authorized to remove the offender from the program and impose any other disposition authorized by law.

   Finding that the juvenile was a delinquent child after having been charged with simple assault was proper where he was required to immediately appeal the decision of the trial court which refused his motion to appeal supersedeas to the Supreme Court before proceeding with his appeal on the merits, Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c21s43-21-651ol12" target="_self">43-21-651(2)</a></cite>; the Supreme Court could then have reviewed the order of the youth court and determined whether the judge had abused his discretion, but, since the juvenile failed to appeal, his claim on that issue was procedurally barred. In re G. L. H., 843 So. 2d 109, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 335 (Miss. Ct. App. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   There was no evidence in the record of any appeal taken from the judgment of the youth court, much less any appeal taken within the requisite 10 days; as the father’s proper method of seeking relief from the youth court’s determination would have been to file an appeal with the appellate court within 10 days, the filing of an original circuit court complaint against the Department of Human Services a year and a half later was not the appropriate remedy for seeking relief. Little v. Miss. Dep't of Human Servs., 835 So. 2d 9, 2002 Miss. LEXIS 333 (Miss. 2002), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">540 U.S. 878</cite>, <cite class="s_court">124 S.

      </p>
      <p>
       Though separate hearings are required for the two phases of a youth court determination, they are both part of the same proceeding for an appeal, and there is no final appealable order in a delinquency proceeding until the youth court has entered its order of disposition. J.P.C. v. State (In the Interest of J.P.C.), 783 So. 2d 778, 2000 Miss. App. LEXIS 564 (Miss. Ct. App. 2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       The youth court system does not unconstitutionally usurp jurisdiction committed exclusively to the chancery court by permitting the Supreme Court to hear a direct appeal without appeal to the chancery court, even though the Mississippi Constitution provides that the chancery court shall have full jurisdiction over “minor’s business.” Youth courts are neither superior, equal, or inferior to other “inferior” courts; they are special courts due to the special nature of their function. Thus, the legislature had authority to vest in the youth courts “exclusive original jurisdiction in all proceedings concerning . . . an abused child,” and the social imperative for prompt disposition of matters affecting children is sufficiently within the police power that the legislature may streamline the appellate process. In Interest of T.L.C., 566 So. 2d 691, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 431 (Miss. 1990), overruled in part, D.T. v. Hinds Cnty. Youth Court (In re J.T.), 188 So.3d 1192, 2016 Miss. LEXIS 165 (Miss. 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       In the youth court, as elsewhere, requests for continuance are addressed to the sound discretion of the court, except that in youth court more so than almost any other there is an imperative that the Court proceed with the matter as promptly as may fairly be done. The Supreme Court will not reverse the youth court in exercising its discretion in these cases unless the youth court abused its discretion and the Supreme Court is convinced that injustice would result therefrom. In Interest of T.L.C., 566 So. 2d 691, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 431 (Miss. 1990), overruled in part, D.T. v. Hinds Cnty. Youth Court (In re J.T.), 188 So.3d 1192, 2016 Miss. LEXIS 165 (Miss. 2016).

      </p>
      <p>
       A person colorably claiming to be a natural parent, even if a non-custodial one, has standing to appeal an order of a youth court adjudging custody or other matters regarding his or her child. Several sections of the Youth Court Act recognize the parent or guardian of the child as a party to the proceedings by requiring that they be provided with notice; while these statutes do not grant a right of appeal, they do recognize the substantial interest a parent has in the outcome of the proceedings, whatever their nature-the continued custody of their child. Thus, a father had standing to appeal a youth court’s order placing his child in the custody of her mother, even though the father was not and had never been married to the child’s mother. In Interest of T.L.C., 566 So. 2d 691, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 431 (Miss. 1990), overruled in part, D.T. v. Hinds Cnty. Youth Court (In re J.T.), 188 So.3d 1192, 2016 Miss. LEXIS 165 (Miss. 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a statutory appeal is taken from a youth court, the statute is mandatory that nowhere on the records of the Supreme Court or the appellate records or briefs or other proceedings should the minor’s name appear, only his or her initials; however, failure to submit the appellate record showing only initials is not reversible error. In Interest of B., 394 So. 2d 907, 1981 Miss. LEXIS 1946 (Miss. 1981).

       A juvenile was entitled to present evidence to the Supreme Court on appeal for its determination as to whether an attorney appointed by the youth court effectively aided the juvenile and whether the constitutional rights of the juvenile were violated, the trial judge not being the final judge as to such questions.

   Where the youth court has continuing, retained jurisdiction over the case of a minor, it is the proper tribunal to determine any factual issues as to the minor’s rehabilitation occurring subsequent to its order committing him to a training school; which order was affirmed by the Supreme Court.

   A youth court order finding a minor to be a delinquent child and that it would be for his best interest that he be placed in a training school is reviewable by the Supreme Court.

       Where a minor and his parents contend they were denied their full right of appeal from a decision of a youth court in that no transcript of the testimony introduced there was provided them, the fact that they did not request the transcript, even assuming they were entitled to one, did not constitute a denial of their rights.

     <p>
      The youth court of any county in the state may establish a teen court program for the diversion of certain offenders who have waived all right of confidentiality and privilege against self-incrimination. The youth court of Rankin County may extend its teen court program within the city limits of Pearl. The offenders eligible to participate shall be those offenders who in the discretion of the youth court are suitable and compulsory-school-age children who have come into the jurisdiction of the youth court as a result of not attending school. The teen court shall be a preventive program for juveniles comprised of youth who are not less than thirteen (13) nor more than seventeen (17) years of age, which students shall serve as prosecutor, defense counsel, bailiff, court clerk and jurors. The program is to administer the “sentencing” or disposition phase of the proceedings against offenders who elect to participate, shall be under the guidance of the local youth court, and shall be approved by the local youth court. The youth court judge, or his designee who is a licensed attorney, shall preside. The teen court is authorized to require eligible offenders who choose to go to teen court in lieu of youth court to perform up to one hundred twelve (112) hours of community service, require offenders to make a personal apology to a victim, require offenders to submit a research paper on any relevant subject, attend counseling and make restitution or any other disposition authorized by the youth court. The youth court shall establish rules and regulations, including sentencing guidelines, for the operation of a teen court. The teen court is authorized to accept monies from any available public or private source, including public or private donations, grants, gifts and appropriated funds for funding expenses of operating the court.
     </p>
     <p>
      Teen court may be held at whatever location the youth court selects at whatever time or times. Eligible offenders shall be only those children who agree to participate in the teen court and to abide by the teen court’s rulings, whose parents or legal guardian shall also so agree, and who are otherwise qualified to participate.
     </p>
     <p>
      The youth court judge may require an offender who elects to participate in the teen court to pay a fee not to exceed Five Dollars ($5.00); any such fees shall be used in administering this article, and the fee shall not be refunded, regardless of whether the child successfully completes the teen court program.

The funds shall be utilized to compensate an intake officer who shall be responsible for ensuring that all intake and case information for the Division of Youth Services, truancy matters and the Division of Family and Children’s Services is entered into the Mississippi Youth Court Information Delivery System (MYCIDS) in an accurate and timely manner. If the court already has an intake officer responsible for entering all cases of the Division of Youth Services, truancy matters and the Division of Family and Children’s Services into MYCIDS, the regular youth court referee or municipal court judge may certify to the Administrative Office of Courts that such a person is already on staff. In such a case, each regular youth court referee or municipal youth court judge shall have the sole individual discretion to appropriate those funds as expense monies to assist in hiring secretarial staff and acquiring materials and equipment incidental to carrying on the business of the court within the private practice of law of the referee or judge, or may direct the use of those funds through the county or municipal budget for court support supplies or services. The regular youth court referee and municipal youth court judge shall be accountable for assuring through private, county or municipal employees the proper preparation and filing of all necessary tracking and other documentation attendant to the administration of the youth court.

      The Governor, on behalf of this state, may execute a compact in substantially the following form, and the Legislature signifies in advance its approval and ratification of the compact:
     </p>
     <p>
      THE INTERSTATE COMPACT FOR JUVENILES
     </p>
     <p>
      ARTICLE I
     </p>
     <p>
      PURPOSE
     </p>
     <p>
      The compacting states to this Interstate Compact recognize that each state is responsible for the proper supervision or return of juveniles, delinquents and status offenders who are on probation or parole and who have absconded, escaped or run away from supervision and control and in so doing have endangered their own safety and the safety of others. The compacting states also recognize that each state is responsible for the safe return of juveniles who have run away from home and in doing so have left their state of residence. The compacting states also recognize that Congress, by enacting the Crime Control Act, 4 USCS Section 112 (1965), has authorized and encouraged compacts for cooperative efforts and mutual assistance in the prevention of crime.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is the purpose of this compact, through means of joint and cooperative action among the compacting states to:
     </p>
     <p>
      Ensure that the adjudicated juveniles and status offenders subject to this compact are provided adequate supervision and services in the receiving state as ordered by the adjudicating judge or parole authority in the sending state;
     </p>
     <p>
      Ensure that the public safety interests of the citizens, including the victims of juvenile offenders, in both the sending and receiving states are adequately protected.
     </p>
     <p>
      Return juveniles who have run away, absconded or escaped from supervision or control or have been accused of an offense to the state requesting their return;
     </p>
     <p>
      Make contracts for the cooperative institutionalization in public facilities in member states for delinquent youth needing special services;
     </p>
     <p>
      Provide for the effective tracking and supervision of juveniles;
     </p>
     <p>
      Equitably allocate the costs, benefits and obligations of the compacting states;
     </p>
     <p>
      Establish procedures to manage the movement between states of juvenile offenders released to the community under the jurisdiction of courts, juvenile departments, or any other criminal or juvenile justice agency that has jurisdiction over juvenile offenders;
     </p>
     <p>
      Ensure immediate notice to jurisdictions where defined offenders are authorized to travel or to relocate across state lines;
     </p>
     <p>
      Establish procedures to resolve pending charges (detainers) against juvenile offenders before transfer or release to the community under the terms of this compact.
     </p>
     <p>
      Establish a system of uniform data collection on information pertaining to juveniles subject to this compact that allows access by authorized juvenile justice and criminal justice officials, and regular reporting of compact activities to heads of state, executive, judicial, and legislative branches and juvenile and criminal justice administrators;
     </p>
     <p>
      Monitor compliance with rules governing interstate movement of juveniles and initiate interventions to address and correct noncompliance;
     </p>
     <p>
      Coordinate training and education regarding the regulation of interstate movement of juveniles for officials involved in that activity; and
     </p>
     <p>
      Coordinate the implementation and operation of the compact with the Interstate Compact for the Placement of Children, the Interstate Compact for Adult Offender Supervision and other compacts affecting juveniles particularly in those cases where concurrent or overlapping supervision issues arise.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is the policy of the compacting states that the activities conducted by the Interstate Commission created by this compact are the formation of public policies and therefore are public business. Furthermore, the compacting states shall cooperate and observe their individual and collective duties and responsibilities for the prompt return and acceptance of juveniles subject to the provisions of this compact. The provisions of this compact shall be reasonably and liberally construed to accomplish the purposes and policies of the compact.

     <p>
      (a) Officers and Staff.— The Interstate Commission shall, by a majority of the members, elect annually from among its members a chairperson and a vice chairperson each of whom shall have such authority and duties as may be specified in the bylaws. The chairperson or, in the chairperson’s absence or disability, the vice chairperson shall preside at all meetings of the Interstate Commission. The officers so elected shall serve without compensation or remuneration from the Interstate Commission; however, subject to the availability of budgeted funds, the officers shall be reimbursed for any ordinary and necessary costs and expenses incurred by them in the performance of their duties and responsibilities as officers of the Interstate Commission.
     </p>
     <p>
      (a) Qualified Immunity, Defense and Indemnification.— The commission’s executive director and employees shall be immune from suit and liability, either personally or in their official capacity, for any claim for damage to or loss of property, personal injury or other civil liability caused or arising out of or relating to any actual or alleged act, error, or omission that occurred, or that the person had a reasonable basis for believing occurred within the scope of commission employment, duties or responsibilities; however, any such person shall not be protected from suit or liability for any damage, loss, injury or liability caused by the intentional or willful and wanton misconduct of any such person.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Interstate Commission shall promulgate and publish rules in order to effectively and efficiently achieve the purposes of the compact.
     </p>
     <p>
      Rule making shall occur using the criteria set forth in this article and the bylaws and rules adopted under this article. That rule making shall substantially conform to the principles of the “Model State Administrative Procedures Act,” 1981 Act, Uniform Laws Annotated, Volume 15, page 1 (2000), or such other administrative procedures act, as the Interstate Commission deems appropriate consistent with due process requirements under the United States Constitution as now or hereafter interpreted by the United States Supreme Court. All rules and amendments shall become binding as of the date specified, as published with the final version of the rule as approved by the commission.
     </p>
     <p>
      When promulgating a rule, the Interstate Commission shall, at a minimum:
     </p>
     <p>
      Allow not later than sixty (60) days after a rule is promulgated, any interested person to file a petition in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or in the Federal District Court where the Interstate Commission’s principal office is located for judicial review of the rule. If the court finds that the Interstate Commission’s action is not supported by substantial evidence in the rule-making record, the court shall hold the rule unlawful and set it aside. For purposes of this subsection, evidence is substantial if it would be considered substantial evidence under the Model State Administrative Procedures Act.
     </p>
     <p>
      If a majority of the legislatures of the compacting states rejects a rule, those states may, by enactment of a statute or resolution in the same manner used to adopt the compact, cause that the rule shall have no further force and effect in any compacting state.
     </p>
     <p>
      The existing rules governing the operation of the Interstate Compact on Juveniles superceded by this act shall be null and void twelve (12) months after the first meeting of the Interstate Commission created under this compact.
     </p>
     <p>
      Upon determination by the Interstate Commission that a state of emergency exists, it may promulgate an emergency rule that shall become effective immediately upon adoption, provided that the usual rule-making procedures provided under this article retroactively applied to the rule as soon as reasonably possible, but no later than ninety (90) days after the effective date of the emergency rule.
     </p>
     <p>
      (a) Oversight. — The Interstate Commission shall oversee the administration and operations of the interstate movement of juveniles subject to this compact in the compacting states and shall monitor those activities being administered in noncompacting states that may significantly affect compacting states.
     </p>
     <p>
      (a) Dispute Resolution.— The compacting states shall report to the Interstate Commission on all issues and activities necessary for the administration of the compact, as well as issues and activities pertaining to compliance with the provisions of the compact and its bylaws and rules.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Interstate Commission shall pay or provide for the payment of the reasonable expenses of its establishment, organization and ongoing activities.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Interstate Commission shall levy on and collect an annual assessment from each compacting state to cover the cost of the internal operations and activities of the Interstate Commission and its staff, which must be in a total amount sufficient to cover the Interstate Commission’s annual budget as approved each year. The aggregate annual assessment amount shall be allocated based upon a formula to be determined by the Interstate Commission, taking into consideration the population of each compacting state and the volume of interstate movement of juveniles in each compacting state, and shall promulgate a rule binding upon all compacting states which governs the assessment.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Interstate Commission shall not incur any obligations of any kind before securing the funds adequate to meet the same; nor shall the Interstate Commission pledge the credit of any of the compacting states, except by and with the authority of the compacting state.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Interstate Commission shall keep accurate accounts of all receipts and disbursements. The receipts and disbursements of the Interstate Commission shall be subject to the audit and accounting procedures established under its bylaws. However, all receipts and disbursements of funds handled by the Interstate Commission shall be audited yearly by a certified or licensed public accountant and the report of the audit shall be included in and become part of the annual report of the Interstate Commission.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any state, the District of Columbia (or its designee), the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the United States Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa and the Northern Marianas Islands as defined in Article II of this compact is eligible to become a compacting state.
     </p>
     <p>
      The compact shall become effective and binding upon legislative enactment of the compact into law by no less that thirty-five (35) of the states. The initial effective date shall be the later of July 1, 2004, or upon enactment into law by the thirty-fifth jurisdiction. Thereafter, it shall become effective and binding as to any other compacting state upon enactment of the compact into law by that state. The governors of nonmember states or their designees shall be invited to participate in the activities of the Interstate Commission on a nonvoting basis before adoption of the compact by all states and territories of the United States.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Interstate Commission may propose amendments to the compact for enactment by the compacting states. No amendment shall become effective and binding upon the Interstate Commission and the compacting states unless and until it is enacted into law by unanimous consent of the compacting states.
     </p>
     <p>
      (a) Withdrawal.— Once effective, the compact shall continue in force and remain binding upon each and every compacting state; however, a compacting state may withdraw from the compact by specifically repealing the statute that enacted the compact into law.
     </p>
     <p>
      (a) Technical Assistance, Fines, Suspension, Termination and Default.— If the Interstate Commission determines that any compacting state has at any time defaulted in the performance of any of its obligations or responsibilities under this compact, or the bylaws or duly promulgated rules, the Interstate Commission may impose any or all of the following penalties:
     </p>
     <p>
      Judicial Enforcement. The Interstate Commission may, by majority vote of the members, initiate legal action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or, at the discretion of the Interstate Commission, in the federal district court where the Interstate Commission has its offices, to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact, its duly promulgated rules and bylaws, against any compacting state in default. If judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of the litigation, including reasonable attorney’s fees.
     </p>
     <p>
      (a) Dissolution of Compact.— The compact dissolves effective upon the date of the withdrawal or default of the compacting state, which reduces membership in the compact to one (1) compacting state.
     </p>
     <p>
      The provisions of this compact shall be severable, and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision is deemed unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the compact shall be enforceable.
     </p>
     <p>
      The provisions of this compact shall be liberally construed to effectuate its purposes.
     </p>
     <p>
      (a) Other Laws.— Nothing in this compact prevents the enforcement of any other law of a compacting state that is not inconsistent with this compact.
     </p>
     <p>
      (a) Binding Effect of the Compact.— All lawful actions of the Interstate Commission, including all rules and bylaws promulgated by the Interstate Commission, are binding upon the compacting states.

       A county home for paupers, for which poverty was the indispensable prerequisite for admission and from which the non-indigent aged or ill were excluded, was not an institution “primarily engaged in the care of the sick, the aged, the mentally ill or defective” within the meaning of federal legislation extending minimum wage legislation to the employees of such institutions, even though many of the residents of said home were old or ill.

       A contract by a county to pay the superintendent of its poorhouse a certain sum for each pauper there cared for, does not bind the county to require all indigent persons maintained by it to become inmates of the poorhouse, nor is the county liable to the superintendent for money paid for such maintenance elsewhere, nor for breach of contract in that it so aided the pauper.

       Where county undertook to levy tax “for food stamp plan and pauper maintenance,” without separately stating what portion of the tax was for each item thereof in violation of statute, and the tax exceeded tax anticipation loan notes executed by county, taxpayer paying tax under protest was entitled to recover such tax and also tax paid pursuant to levy “for food stamp loan warrants.” Chickasaw County v. Gulf, M. & O. R. Co., 195 Miss. 754, 15 So. 2d 348, 1943 Miss. LEXIS 144 (Miss. 1943).
      </p>
      <p>
       As to the contention that this section [Code 1942, § 7352] imposes no limitations upon the amount that may be levied for the support of the poor of the county, it is a sufficient answer that in the absence of an express limitation it is to be implied that the taxing authorities should levy only such an amount as might be reasonably necessary for the support of the poor of the county who are within the class contemplated by this chapter (chap 4, title 26, Code of 1942).

       This provision for a tax levy for a special purpose and not for the benefit o the general public was not repealed by Laws 1932, chap. 104, providing for a limitation of taxes for general purposes.

       The Housing Authority Act (§§ 7295-7600-06, inclusive, Code of 1942) neither violates § 112 nor § 182 of the Constitution. Biloxi-Pascagoula Real Estate Bd., Inc. v. Mississippi Reg'l Housing Auth., 231 Miss. 89, 93 So. 2d 856, 1957 Miss. LEXIS 493 (Miss. 1957).

       Based on very broad definition of “housing project” under Miss. Code Section 43-33-1(j), housing authority may fix rentals at rate necessary to meet the costs of, and to provide for, maintaining and operating activities of authority involving acquisition of property, demolition of existing structures, construction of improvements, etc. Alexander, Apr. 7, 1993, A.G. Op. #93-0158.

       The Mississippi Regional Housing Authority No. VI may contract with a nonprofit corporation established by the Authority pursuant to Section 43-33-11(i) to perform such work as collecting rents, cutting grass, repairing housing units, etc., for the corporation; however, any contract for the performance of such duties by employees of the authority and at the authority’s expense may not include action that would result in a donation or gratuity being made to a third party in contravention of the express provisions of Section 66 of the Mississippi Constitution of 1890.

       A regional housing authority is not an “agency” for purposes of the Administrative Procedures Law and is thus exempt from the requirements thereof, including the filing of rules.

       Because the act of maintaining or repairing the apartments – or failing to maintain or repair – fell under the housing authority’s duty to provide its residents a safe dwelling, it could not be said the decision to not repair or replace a light fixture was the exercise of a discretionary function; however, the housing authority was entitled to sovereign immunity because it had no actual or constructive notice of the dangerous condition of the light fixture before it fell on the tenant.

     </h3>
     <p>
      In each town or city and in each county of the state there is hereby created a public body corporate and politic to be known as the “housing authority” of the town or city or county. However, such authority shall not transact any business or exercise its powers hereunder until or unless the governing body of the town or city or the county, as the case may be, by proper resolution shall declare at any time hereafter that there is need for an authority to function in such town or city or county. The determination as to whether there is such need for an authority to function (a) may be made by the governing body on its own motion or (b) shall be made by the governing body upon the filing of a petition signed by twenty-five (25) residents of the town or city or county, as the case may be, asserting that there is need for an authority to function in such town or city or county and requesting that the governing body so declare.
     </p>
     <p>
      The governing body shall adopt a resolution declaring that there is need for a housing authority in the town or city or county, as the case may be, if it shall find (a) that unsanitary or unsafe inhabited dwelling accommodations exist in such town or city or county or (b) that there is a shortage of safe or sanitary dwelling accommodations in such town or city or county available to persons of low income at rentals they can afford. In determining whether dwelling accommodations are unsafe or unsanitary said governing body may take into consideration the degree of overcrowding, the percentage of land coverage, the light, air, space and access available to the inhabitants of such dwelling accommodations, the size and arrangement of the rooms, the sanitary facilities, and the extent to which conditions exist in such buildings which endanger life or property by fire or other causes.
     </p>
     <p>
      In any suit, action or proceeding involving the validity or enforcement of or relating to any contract of the authority, the authority shall be conclusively deemed to have become established and authorized to transact business and exercise its powers hereunder upon proof of the adoption of a resolution by the governing body declaring the need for the authority. Such resolution or resolutions shall be deemed sufficient if it declares that there is such need for an authority and finds in substantially the foregoing terms (no further detail being necessary) that either or both of the above enumerated conditions exist in the town or city or county, as the case may be. A copy of such resolution duly certified by the clerk shall be admissible in evidence in any suit, action or proceeding.

     <p>
      When the governing body of a city adopts a resolution as provided in Section 43-33-5, such governing body shall forthwith appoint five (5) persons as commissioners of the authority created for said city.When the governing body of a county adopts a resolution as provided in Section 43-33-5, said governing body shall appoint five (5) commissioners for said board created for said county.The commissioners who are first appointed shall be designated to serve for terms of one (1), two (2), three (3), four (4) and five (5) years, respectively, from the date of their appointment, and thereafter when a vacancy shall occur either by the expiration of term of office or otherwise, the vacancy shall be filled by the governing body of the city or county, as the case may be, either to fill an unexpired term where a commissioner shall die or resign or shall become disqualified during his term, or for a full term of five (5) years where the term of a commissioner expires.No commissioner of an authority may be an officer or employee of the city or county for which the authority is created.However, at least one (1) commissioner must be a person who is directly assisted by the authority if required under applicable federal law.A commissioner shall hold office until his successor has been appointed and has qualified.A certificate of the appointment or reappointment of any commissioner shall be filed with the clerk of the city or county as the case may be and such certificate shall be conclusive evidence of the due and proper appointment of such commissioner.A commissioner shall receive compensation for his services in the manner and amount authorized in Section 25-3-69 for up to fifteen (15) days during the fiscal year of the authority, and he shall also be entitled to necessary expenses, including traveling expenses, incurred in the discharge of his duties.
     </p>
     <p>
      The powers of each authority shall be vested in the commissioners thereof in office from time to time. Three (3) commissioners shall constitute a quorum of the authority for the purpose of conducting its business and exercising its powers and for all other purposes. Action may be taken by the authority upon a vote of a majority of the commissioners present, unless in any case the bylaws of the authority shall require a larger number. The board of commissioners shall elect which member shall be chairman and thereafter fill any vacancy by like election. An authority shall select from among its commissioners a vice chairman, and it may employ a secretary (who shall be executive director), technical experts and such other officers, agents and employees, permanent and temporary, as it may require, and shall determine their qualifications, duties and compensation. For such legal services as it may require, an authority may call upon the chief law officer of the city or the county or may employ its own counsel and legal staff. An authority may delegate to one or more of its agents or employees such powers or duties as it may deem proper.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the event that a directly assisted commissioner ceases to be directly assisted by the authority for which he/she serves as commissioner, said person shall then become disqualified to serve that authority as a directly assisted commissioner and shall be replaced as commissioner by a person who is directly assisted by the authority if federal law then requires that authority to have a directly assisted commissioner.

       It is apparent that “reappointments” which occurred in years past, without action of town board of aldermen, were not in conformity with law, and every commissioner so “reappointed” was holdover, or de facto, officer, holding office until his or her successor was validly appointed and qualified; while acts of holdover or de facto officer are legally binding, individual so acting is in no way entitled to complete term of that office when successor has been appointed.

       If a housing authority has hired an executive director or other employee and has set the salary of that individual in an employment agreement or contract, the authority is precluded from paying any additional compensation to that individual, regardless of extra duties which may be performed by that individual; the proper mechanism for addressing this would be to renegotiate the terms of the employment/contract of that individual to take these duties into consideration. McGriggs, Apr. 27, 2001, A.G. Op. #01-0243.

      It is hereby declared to be the policy of this state that each housing authority shall manage and operate its housing projects in an efficient manner so as to enable it to fix the rentals for dwelling accommodations at the lowest possible rates consistent with its providing decent, safe and sanitary dwelling accommodations, and that no housing authority shall construct or operate any such project for profit, or as a source of revenue to the city or the county. To this end an authority shall fix the rentals for dwellings in its projects at no higher rates than it shall find to be necessary in order to produce revenues which (together with all other available moneys, revenues, income and receipts of the authority from whatever sources derived) will be sufficient (a) to pay, as the same become due, the principal and interest on the bonds of the authority; (b) to meet the cost of, and to provide for, maintaining and operating the projects (including the cost of any insurance) and the administrative expenses of the authority; and (c) to create (during not less than six (6) years immediately succeeding its issuance of any bonds) a reserve sufficient to meet the largest principal and interest payments which will be due on such bonds in any one year thereafter and to maintain such reserve.

    Rentals and tenant selection.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      In the operation or management of housing projects an authority shall at all times observe the following duties with respect to rentals and tenant selection:
     </p>
     <p>
      It may rent or lease the dwelling accommodations therein only to persons of low income and at rentals within the financial reach of such persons of low income;
     </p>
     <p>
      It may rent or lease to a tenant dwelling accommodations consisting of the number of rooms (but no greater number) which it deems necessary to provide safe and sanitary accommodations to the proposed occupants thereof, without overcrowding;
     </p>
     <p>
      The dwellings in low-rent housing as defined in this article shall be available solely for families whose net annual income at the time of admission, less an exemption of one hundred dollars ($100.00) for each minor member of the family other than the head of the family and his spouse, does not exceed five (5) times the annual rental (including the value or cost to them of water, electricity, gas, other heating and cooking fuels, and other utilities) of the dwellings to be furnished such families. For the purpose of determining eligibility for continued occupancy, a public housing agency shall allow, from the net income of any family, an exemption for each minor member of the family (other than the head of the family and his spouse) of either (a) one hundred dollars ($100.00), or (b) all or any part of the annual income of such minor. For the purpose of this subparagraph, a minor shall mean a person less than twenty-one (21) years of age.
     </p>
     <p>
      Nothing contained in this section or Section 43-33-13 shall be construed as limiting the power of an authority to vest in an obligee the right, in the event of a default by the authority, to take possession of a housing project or cause the appointment of a receiver thereof, free from all the restrictions imposed by this section or Section 43-33-13.

   Because a developer had not been denied compensation for an alleged taking of lease contracts, principally because it had not sought such compensation through Mississippi procedures, its federal takings claims against a regional housing authority and the housing authority’s interim executive director were not ripe for review; since the housing authority clearly wielded the power of eminent domain through Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c33s43-33-19" target="_self">43-33-19</a></cite>, Mississippi had long provided for actions in inverse condemnation, and Mississippi courts provided plaintiffs with a cause of action for regulatory takings, there was nothing to suggest that Mississippi law unquestionably afforded the developer no remedy.

      An authority shall have power to issue bonds from time to time, in its discretion, for any of its corporate purposes. An authority shall also have power to issue refunding bonds for the purpose of paying or retiring bonds previously issued by it. An authority may issue such types of bonds as it may determine, including (without limiting the generality of the foregoing) bonds on which the principal and interest are payable: (a) exclusively from the income and revenues of the housing project financed with the proceeds of such bonds; (b) exclusively from the income and revenues of certain designated housing projects whether or not they are financed in whole or in part with the proceeds of such bonds; or (c) from its revenues generally. Any such bonds may be additionally secured by a pledge of any grant or contributions from the federal government or other source, or a pledge of any income or revenues of the authority, or a mortgage of any housing project, projects or other property of the authority.
     </p>
     <p>
      Neither the commissioners of an authority nor any person executing the bonds shall be liable personally on the bonds by reason of the issuance thereof. The bonds and other obligations of an authority (and such bonds and obligations shall so state on their face) shall not be a debt of the city, the county, the state or any political subdivision thereof and neither the city or the county, nor the state or any political subdivision thereof shall be liable thereon, nor in any event shall such bonds or obligations be payable out of any funds or properties other than those of said authority. The bonds shall not constitute an indebtedness within the meaning of any constitutional or statutory debt limitation or restriction. Bonds of an authority are declared to be issued for an essential public and governmental purpose and to be public instrumentalities and, together with interest thereon and income therefrom, shall be exempt from taxes.

     <p>
      Bonds of an authority shall be authorized by its resolution and may be issued in one or more series and shall bear such date or dates, mature at such time or times, bear interest at such rate or rates, not to exceed that allowed in Section 75-17-103, Mississippi Code of 1972, be in such denomination or denominations, be in such form, either coupon or registered, carry such conversion or registration privileges, have such rank or priority, be executed in such manner, be payable in such medium of payment, at such place or places, and be subject to such terms of redemption (with or without premium) as such resolution, its trust indenture or mortgage may provide. No bond shall bear more than one (1) rate of interest; each bond shall bear interest from its date to its stated maturity date at the interest rate specified in the bid; all bonds of the same maturity shall bear the same rate of interest from date to maturity; all interest accruing on such bonds so issued shall be payable semiannually or annually, except that the first interest coupon attached to any such bond may be for any period not exceeding one (1) year.
     </p>
     <p>
      No interest payment shall be evidenced by more than one (1) coupon and neither cancelled nor supplemental coupons shall be permitted; the lowest interest rate specified for any bonds issued shall not be less than seventy percent (70%) of the highest interest rate specified for the same bond issued. The interest rate of any one (1) interest coupon shall not exceed the maximum interest rate allowed on such bonds.
     </p>
     <p>
      Each interest rate specified in any bid must be in multiples of one-eighth of one percent (1/8 of 1%) or in multiples of one-tenth of one percent (1/10 of 1%). The denomination, form, and place, or places, of payment of such bonds shall be fixed in the resolution or ordinance of the governing authorities issuing such bonds. Such bonds shall be executed by the manual or facsimile signature of the chairman and secretary of such authority, with the seal of the authority impressed, imprinted or reproduced thereon. At least one (1) signature on each bond shall be a manual signature, as specified in the resolution. The coupons may bear only the facsimile signatures of such chairman and secretary. No bonds shall be issued and sold under the provisions of this article for less than par and accrued interest.
     </p>
     <p>
      The bonds may be sold at not less than par at public sale held after notice published once at least five (5) days prior to such sale in a newspaper having a general circulation in the area of operation and in a financial newspaper published in the City of Jackson, Mississippi, or in the City of New York, New York. Such bonds may be sold at not less than par to the federal government or to a federally chartered corporation at private sale without any public advertisement.
     </p>
     <p>
      In case any of the commissioners or officers of the authority whose signatures appear on any bonds or coupons shall cease to be such commissioners or officers before the delivery of such bonds, such signatures shall, nevertheless, be valid and sufficient for all purposes, the same as if such commissioners or officers had remained in office until such delivery. Any provision of any law to the contrary notwithstanding, any bonds issued pursuant to this article shall be fully negotiable.
     </p>
     <p>
      In any suit, action or proceedings, involving the validity or enforceability of any bond of an authority or the security therefor, any such bond reciting in substance that it has been issued by the authority to aid in financing a housing project to provide dwelling accommodations for persons of low income shall be conclusively deemed to have been issued for a housing project of such character, and said project shall be conclusively deemed to have been planned, located and constructed in accordance with the purposes and provisions of this article.

      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Any housing authority organized under Sections 43-33-1 through 43-33-53 which is composed of ten (10) counties in the northeastern part of the State of Mississippi with counties bordering both the State of Tennessee and the State of Alabama and more specifically domiciled in a county where U. S. Highway 45 and U. S. Highway 72 intersect is hereby authorized and empowered to issue negotiable leased housing revenue refunding bonds in a principal amount not exceeding nineteen million dollars ($19,000,000.00) for the purpose of refunding its outstanding sixteen million dollars ($16,000,000.00) principal amount housing bonds, Series 1970, dated as of December 1, 1970, (“the Series 1970 bonds”), including interest thereon and applicable redemption premiums and paying other obligations and expenses of the authority necessary for the completion of one thousand thirty-three (1,033) low-rent dwelling units proposed to be financed from the proceeds of the Series 1970 bonds. The proceeds of any such refunding bonds shall be deposited with the trustee named in the bonds to be refunded, and pending the application thereof to the payment of the principal of and interest on and redemption premium on the bonds to be refunded shall be invested and reinvested only in (a) obligations of, or obligations the principal of and interest on which is guaranteed by, the United States of America; (b) obligations of any agency or instrumentality of the United States of America; or (c) in certificates of deposit issued by either a state or national bank which is a qualified depository of the State of Mississippi bearing interest at any rate which may be agreed upon, which certificates of deposit shall be secured by a pledge of any of the obligations authorized by law for the securing of public deposits and having at all times an aggregate market value, exclusive of accrued interest, equal at least to the principal amount of the certificates so secured.
     </p>
     <p>
      All interest or other increment received on or on account of all such investments shall be deposited in and become a part of the fund held by the trustee for the payment and redemption of the bonds to be refunded. Provided that the trustee may, after making due provisions for the payment and redemption of the Series 1970 bonds, disburse any portion of the principal proceeds in excess of sixteen million dollars ($16,000,000.00) for payment of obligations and expenses of the authority necessary for the completion of the low-rent dwelling units and for payment of expenses incurred by the issuance of the bonds herein authorized; provided, that attorney’s fees shall not exceed those set forth in Section 57-1-31, Mississippi Code of 1972.
     </p>
     <p>
      The bonds herein authorized shall be authorized by a resolution adopted by the board of commissioners of the authority; may bear such date; may be of such denomination; may mature at such time or times, not exceeding twenty (20) years after the date thereof; and may be redeemable on such terms; all as may be determined by such resolution and in compliance with the provisions of Section 43-33-25. Such bonds shall not bear a greater overall maximum interest rate to maturity than six percent (6%) per annum. No bond shall bear more than one (1) rate of interest; each bond shall bear interest from its date to its stated maturity date at the interest rate specified in the bid; all bonds of the same maturity shall bear the same rate of interest from date to maturity; all interest accruing on such bonds so issued shall be payable semiannually or annually, except that the first interest coupon attached to any such bond may be for any period not exceeding one (1) year.
     </p>
     <p>
      No interest payment shall be evidenced by more than one (1) coupon and neither cancelled nor supplemental coupons shall be permitted; the lowest interest rate specified for any bonds issued shall not be less than seventy percent (70%) of the highest interest rate specified for the same bond issue. The interest rate of any one (1) interest coupon shall not exceed seven percent (7%).
     </p>
     <p>
      Each interest rate specified in any bid must be in multiples of one-eighth of one percent (1/8 of 1%) or in multiples of one-tenth of one percent (1/10 of 1%), and a zero rate of interest cannot be named. No bonds shall be issued and sold under the provisions of this section for less than par and accrued interest.
     </p>
     <p>
      The bonds herein authorized shall be payable solely from certain revenues derived by the authority in connection with the low-rent housing project for which the Series 1970 bonds were issued, including annual contributions from the United States of America, income from notes and mortgages purchased from the proceeds of the Series 1970 bonds and the bonds herein authorized, and surplus money available after the Series 1970 bonds shall have been retired from the trust created pursuant to this section and may be secured by a trust indenture. The bonds herein authorized shall not be obligations of the State of Mississippi or of any county or municipality therein, but shall be solely the obligations of the authority.

       § 43-33-103.
    Creation of regional housing authority.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      If the board of supervisors of each of two (2) or more contiguous counties by resolution declares that there is a need for one (1) housing authority to be created for all of such counties to exercise in such counties powers and other functions prescribed for a regional housing authority, a public body corporate and politic to be known as a regional housing authority shall thereupon exist for all of such counties and exercise its powers and other functions in such counties; and thereupon each county housing authority created for each of such counties shall cease to exist except for the purpose of winding up its affairs and executing a deed to the regional housing authority as hereinafter provided. The board of supervisors of a county shall not adopt a resolution as aforesaid if there is a county housing authority created for such county which has any bonds, notes or other evidences of indebtedness outstanding unless, first, all holders of such evidences of indebtedness consent in writing to the substitution of such regional housing authority in lieu of such county housing authority on all such evidences of indebtedness, and second, the commissioners of such county housing authority adopt a resolution consenting to the transfer of all the rights, contracts, obligations, and property, real and personal, of such county housing authority to such regional housing authority as hereinafter provided. When the above two (2) conditions are complied with and such regional housing authority is created and authorized to exercise its powers and other functions, all rights, contracts, agreements, obligations, and property of such county housing authority shall be in the name of and vest in such regional housing authority, and all obligations of such county housing authority shall be the obligations of such regional housing authority and all rights and remedies of any person against such county housing authority may be asserted, enforced, and prosecuted against such regional housing authority to the same extent as they might have asserted, enforced, and prosecuted against such county housing authority.
     </p>
     <p>
      When any real property of a county housing authority vests in a regional housing authority as provided above, the county housing authority shall execute a deed of such property to the regional housing authority which thereupon shall file such deed in the office provided for the filing of deeds; nothing contained in this sentence shall affect the vesting of property in the regional housing authority as provided above.
     </p>
     <p>
      The board of supervisors of each of two (2) or more contiguous counties shall by resolution declare that there is a need for one (1) regional housing authority to be created for all of such counties to exercise in such counties powers and other functions prescribed for a regional housing authority, if such board of supervisors finds (and only if it finds) (a) that unsanitary or unsafe inhabited dwelling accommodations exist in such county or there is a shortage of safe or sanitary dwelling accommodations in such county available to persons of low income at rentals they can afford and (b) that a regional housing authority would be a more efficient or economical administrative unit than the housing authority of such county to carry out the purposes of this article and the Housing Authorities Law in such county.
     </p>
     <p>
      In any suit, action, or proceeding involving the validity or enforcement of or relating to any contract of the regional housing authority, the regional housing authority shall be conclusively deemed to have become created as a public body corporate and politic and to have become established and authorized to transact business and exercise its powers hereunder upon proof of the adoption of a resolution by the board of supervisors of each of the counties creating the regional housing authority declaring the need for the regional housing authority. Each such resolution shall be deemed sufficient if it declares that there is need for the regional housing authority and finds in substantially the foregoing terms (no further detail being necessary) that the conditions enumerated above in (a) and (b) exist. A copy of such resolution of the board of supervisors of a county, duly certified by the county clerk of such county, shall be admissible in evidence in any suit, action, or proceeding.

A county or regional housing authority shall not undertake any housing project or projects within the boundaries of any city unless a resolution shall have been adopted by the governing body of such city (and also by any housing authority which shall have been theretofore established and authorized to exercise its powers in such city) declaring that there is a need for the county or regional housing authority to exercise its powers within such city.

       Because administration of a Section 8 rental assistance program does not fit within the definition of a “housing project or projects” as that term is defined in Section 43-33-1, a regional housing authority was not required to obtain the permission of the housing authority of a city and the governing authorities of the city to administer a Section 8 program; thus, whether resolutions are rescinded would have no bearing on the continued administration of a Section 8 program by the regional housing Authority within the limits of the city.

      The area of operation of a regional housing authority shall be increased from time to time to include one (1) or more additional contiguous counties not already within a regional housing authority if the board of supervisors of each of the counties then included in the area of operation of such regional housing authority, the commissioners of the regional housing authority and the board of supervisors of each such additional county or counties each adopt a resolution declaring that there is a need for the inclusion of such additional county or counties in the area of operation of such regional housing authority.

      The area of operation of a regional housing authority shall be decreased from time to time to exclude one (1) or more counties from such area if the board of supervisors of each of the counties in such area and the commissioners of the regional housing authority each adopt a resolution declaring that there is a need for excluding such county or counties from such area. No action may be taken pursuant to this section if the regional housing authority has outstanding any bonds, notes or other evidences of indebtedness, unless first, all holders of such evidences of indebtedness consent in writing to such action. If such action decreases the area of operation of the regional housing authority to only one (1) county, such authority shall thereupon constitute and become a housing authority for such county, in the same manner as though such authority were created by and authorized to transact business and exercise its powers pursuant to Section 43-33-5 of the Housing Authorities Law, and the commissioners of such authority shall be thereupon appointed as provided for the appointment of commissioners of a housing authority created for a county.
     </p>
     <p>
      The board of supervisors of each of the counties in the area of operation of the regional housing authority and the commissioners of the regional housing authority shall adopt a resolution declaring that there is a need for excluding a county or counties from such area if: (a) each such board of supervisors of the counties to remain in the area of operation of the regional housing authority and the commissioners of the regional housing authority find that (because of facts arising or determined subsequent to the time when such area first included the county or counties to be excluded) the regional housing authority would be a more efficient or economical administrative unit to carry out the purposes of this article and the Housing Authorities Law if such county or counties were excluded from such area, and (b) the board of supervisors of each such county or counties to be excluded and the commissioners of the regional housing authority each also find that (because of the aforesaid changed facts) the purposes of this article and the Housing Authorities Law could be carried out more efficiently or economically in such county or counties if the area of operation of the regional housing authority did not include such county or counties.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any property held by a regional housing authority within a county or counties excluded from the area of operation of such authority, as herein provided, shall (as soon as practicable after the exclusion of said county or counties respectively) be disposed of by such authority in the public interest.

     <p>
      At any time after a county or counties is excluded from the area of operation of a regional housing authority as provided in Section 43-33-109, the board of supervisors of any such county may adopt a resolution declaring that there is a need for a housing authority in the county, if the board shall find such need according to the provisions of Section 43-33-5 of the Housing Authorities Law. Thereupon a public body corporate and politic to be known as the housing authority of the county shall exist for such county and may transact business and exercise its powers in the same manner as though created by said Section 43-33-5. Nothing contained herein shall be construed as preventing such county from thereafter being included within the area of operation of a regional housing authority as provided in Sections 43-33-103 or 43-33-107 of this article.

    Commissioners of regional housing authority.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The board of supervisors of each county included in a regional housing authority shall appoint one (1) person as a commissioner of such authority, and each such commissioner to be first appointed by the board of supervisors of a county may be appointed at or after the time of the adoption of the resolution declaring the need for such regional housing authority or declaring the need for the inclusion of such county in the area of operation of such regional housing authority. When the area of operation of a regional housing authority is increased to include an additional county or counties as provided above, the board of supervisors of each such county shall thereupon appoint one (1) additional person as a commissioner of the regional housing authority. The board of supervisors of each county shall appoint the successor of the commissioner appointed by it. A certificate of the appointment of any such commissioner shall be filed with the clerk of the county, and such certificate shall be conclusive evidence of the due and proper appointment of such commissioner. If any county is excluded from the area of operation of a regional housing authority, the office of the commissioner of such regional housing authority appointed by the board of supervisors of such county shall be thereupon abolished.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the area of operation of a regional housing authority consists at any time of an even number of counties, the commissioners of the regional housing authority appointed by the boards of supervisors of such counties shall appoint one (1) additional commissioner whose term of office shall be as herein provided for a commissioner of a regional housing authority except that such term shall end at any earlier time that the area of operation of the regional housing authority shall be changed to consist of an odd number of counties. The commissioners of such authority appointed by the boards of supervisors of such counties shall likewise appoint each person to succeed such additional commissioner; the term of office of such person begins during the terms of office of the commissioner appointing him. A certificate of the appointment of any such additional commissioner of such regional housing authority shall be filed with the other records of the regional housing authority and shall be conclusive evidence of the due and proper appointment of such additional commissioner.
     </p>
     <p>
      At least one (1) commissioner of a regional housing authority must be a person who is directly assisted by the authority if required under applicable federal law.
     </p>
     <p>
      The commissioners of a regional housing authority shall be appointed for terms of five (5) years except that all vacancies shall be filled for the unexpired terms. Each commissioner shall hold office until his successor has been appointed and has qualified, except as otherwise provided herein.
     </p>
     <p>
      The commissioners shall constitute the regional housing authority, and the powers of such authority shall be vested in such commissioners in office from time to time.
     </p>
     <p>
      The commissioners of a regional housing authority shall elect a chairman from among the commissioners and shall have power to select or employ such other officers and employees as the regional housing authority may require. A majority of the commissioners of a regional housing authority shall constitute a quorum of such authority for the purpose of conducting its business and exercising its powers and for all other purposes. In the event that a directly assisted commissioner ceases to be directly assisted by the authority for which he/she serves as commissioner, said person shall then become disqualified to serve that authority as a directly assisted commissioner and shall be replaced as commissioner by a person who is directly assisted by the authority if federal law then requires that authority to have a directly assisted commissioner.

      County housing authorities and regional housing authorities are specifically empowered and authorized to borrow money, accept grants and exercise their other powers to provide housing on farms or in other areas outside of cities. With respect to such housing, county and regional housing authorities shall not be subject to the limitations provided in clause (c) of Section 43-33-15 of the Housing Authorities Law. Any such housing authority may rent, sell, or make loans to finance the cost of such housing, and make or accept such conveyances, purchase agreements or leases as it deems necessary to assure the achievement of the objectives of this article and the Housing Authorities Law. Such leases, agreements or conveyances may include such covenants as the housing authority deems appropriate regarding the housing and the tracts of land described in any such instrument, which covenants shall be deemed to run with the land where the housing authority deems it necessary and the parties to such instrument so stipulate. Nothing contained in this section shall be construed as limiting any other powers of any housing authority.

      Until a purchaser makes full payment for a dwelling which is constructed by an authority on a farm, such dwelling shall continue to be the property of the authority regardless of the title to the land on which it is constructed, and such dwelling shall be exempt from taxation in the same manner as other property of the authority. Any document making land available for use by an authority shall be admitted to record, and accordingly constitute notice, in the same manner as a deed or other instrument relating to real estate.

     <p>
      When an authority provides a dwelling on a farm hereunder, the owner of the farm living in the dwelling under a lease or purchase agreement shall be entitled to receive the same homestead exemption as if he had title to the dwelling.

      If the governing body of each of two (2) or more municipalities (whether or not contiguous) by resolution declares that there is a need for one (1) housing authority to be created for all of such municipalities to exercise in such municipalities the powers and other functions prescribed for a housing authority, a public body corporate and politic to be known as a consolidated housing authority (with such corporate name as it selects) shall thereupon exist for all of such municipalities and exercise its powers and other functions within its area of operation (as herein defined), including the power to undertake projects therein; and thereupon each housing authority (if any) created for each of such municipalities shall cease to exist except for the purpose of winding up its affairs and executing a deed of its real property to the consolidated housing authority. The creation of a consolidated housing authority and the finding of need therefor shall be subject to the same provisions and limitations of this article as are applicable to the creation of a regional housing authority and that all of the provisions of this article applicable to regional housing authorities and the commissioners thereof shall be applicable to consolidated housing authorities and the commissioners thereof.

     <p>
      The Legislature hereby finds and declares:
     </p>
     <p>
      That there exists in the State of Mississippi a severe shortage of adequate, safe and sanitary residential and rental housing available at prices or rentals within the financial means of persons of low or moderate income; that this shortage has contributed to and will contribute to the creation and persistence of substandard living conditions and is damaging to the health, welfare and prosperity of the residents of this state.
     </p>
     <p>
      That private enterprise and investment have been unable, without assistance, to produce the needed construction or rehabilitation of adequate, safe and sanitary housing at prices or rentals which persons of low or moderate income can afford and to provide sufficient long-term mortgage financing for residential or rental housing for occupancy by such persons;
     </p>
     <p>
      That the shortage of adequate and affordable housing can best be addressed through a strong, unified organization which can develop creative approaches to housing production and assistance through active cooperation of public and private entities, including federal, state and local government, private nonprofit and for profit entities, community and citizens groups, charitable organizations, and private citizens; that this organization should stimulate private development, construction and rehabilitation, develop a wide range of state housing assistance programs, engage in comprehensive planning, study, research and statewide coordination with respect to low and moderate housing, provide technical, educational and consultative services, and promote governmental and community interest in the provision of housing for low and moderate income persons in the state; that this organization should receive appropriations of public funds, should be authorized to obtain funding for its programs by issuing its bonds and notes; and that this organization should be authorized to administer available federal, state or local programs and monies and to retain for its corporate purposes all such fees and income generated thereby;
     </p>
     <p>
      To aid in remedying these conditions and to accomplish these public purposes, effective September 1, 1989, there is created a public body corporate and politic, separate and apart from the state, constituting a governmental instrumentality, to be known as the Mississippi Home Corporation, for the performance of essential public functions. The corporation shall be constituted and shall have such powers as provided in this article.

The resolution or resolutions shall request the corporation to issue its bonds or notes for the purpose of refunding bonds or notes of the housing authority or authorities then outstanding and shall contain such other terms and conditions as necessary or appropriate. The total amount of any such refunding bonds or notes shall be an amount sufficient to effect the refunding and may include an amount sufficient to pay (a) the principal amount of the refunded bonds or notes, (b) interest accrued or to accrue to the date of maturity or the date of redemption of the bonds or notes to be refunded which need not necessarily be on the first available redemption date, (c) any redemption premiums to be paid thereon, (d) any reasonable expenses incurred in connection with such refunding, and (e) any other reasonable costs deemed necessary by the corporation to effect the refunding.

    Findings and declarations of necessity.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      It is hereby found and declared that there exist in municipalities of the state slum and blighted areas which constitute a serious and growing menace, injurious to the public health, safety, morals and welfare of the residents of the state; that the existence of such areas contributes substantially and increasingly to the spread of disease and crime, constitutes an economic and social liability imposing onerous municipal burdens which decrease the tax base and reduce tax revenues, substantially impairs or arrests the sound growth of municipalities, retards the provision of housing accommodations, aggravates traffic problems and substantially impairs or arrests the elimination of traffic hazards and the improvement of traffic facilities; and that the prevention and elimination of slums and blight is a matter of state policy and state concern in order that the state and its municipalities shall not continue to be endangered by areas which are focal centers of disease, promote juvenile delinquency, and consume an excessive proportion of its revenues because of the extra services required for police, fire, accident, hospitalization and other forms of public protection, services and facilities.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is further found and declared that certain slum or blighted areas, or portions thereof, may require acquisition, clearance, and disposition subject to use restrictions, as provided in this article, since the prevailing condition of decay may make impracticable the reclamation of the area by conservation or rehabilitation; that other areas or portions thereof may, through the means provided in this article, be susceptible of conservation or rehabilitation in such a manner that the conditions and evils hereinbefore enumerated may be eliminated, remedied or prevented; and that salvable slum and blighted areas can be conserved and rehabilitated through appropriate public action as authorized in this article, and the cooperation and voluntary action of the owners and tenants of property in such areas.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is further found and declared that the powers conferred by this article are for public uses and purposes for which public money may be expended and the power of eminent domain and police power exercised. The necessity in the public interest for the provisions enacted as this article is hereby declared as a matter of legislative determination.

       The burden of proof on the issue of necessity is on the landowner who seeks to show lack of necessity, and whether the taking is necessary is within the discretion of the condemnor, and the courts will interfere with the exercise of such discretion only when abuse of discretion or fraud is shown, and in the absence of such proof a housing authority’s declaration of necessity will not be overturned.

       § 43-35-13.
    Preparation and approval of urban renewal projects and urban renewal plans.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      A municipality shall not approve an urban renewal project for an urban renewal area unless the governing body has, by resolution, determined such area to be a slum area or a blighted area or a combination thereof and designated such area as appropriate for an urban renewal project. The local governing body shall not approve an urban renewal plan until a general plan for the municipality has been prepared. For this purpose and other municipal purposes, authority is hereby vested in every municipality to prepare, to adopt and to revise from time to time, a general plan for the physical development of the municipality as a whole (giving due regard to the environs and metropolitan surroundings), to establish and maintain a planning commission for such purpose and related municipal planning activities, and to make available and to appropriate necessary funds therefor. A municipality shall not acquire real property for an urban renewal project unless the local governing body has approved the urban renewal project in accordance with subsection (d) hereof.
     </p>
     <p>
      The municipality may itself prepare or cause to be prepared an urban renewal plan, or any person or agency, public or private, may submit such a plan to a municipality. Prior to its approval of an urban renewal project, the local governing body shall submit such plan to the planning commission of the municipality, if any, for review and recommendations as to its conformity with the general plan for the development of the municipality as a whole. The planning commission shall submit its written recommendations with respect to the proposed urban renewal plan to the local governing body within thirty (30) days after receipt of the plan for review. Upon receipt of the recommendations of the planning commission, or if no recommendations are received within said thirty (30) days, then without such recommendations, the local governing body may proceed with the hearing on the proposed urban renewal project prescribed by subsection (c) hereof.
     </p>
     <p>
      The local governing body shall hold a public hearing on an urban renewal project, after public notice thereof by publication in a newspaper having a general circulation in the area of operation of the municipality. The notice shall describe the time, date, place and purpose of the hearing, shall generally identify the urban renewal area covered by the plan, and shall outline the general scope of the urban renewal project under consideration.
     </p>
     <p>
      Following such hearing, the local governing body may approve an urban renewal project if it finds that (1) a feasible method exists for the location of families who will be displaced from the urban renewal area in decent, safe and sanitary dwelling accommodations within their means and without undue hardship to such families; (2) the urban renewal plan conforms to the general plan of the municipality as a whole; and (3) the urban renewal plan will afford maximum opportunity, consistent with the sound needs of the municipality as a whole, for the rehabilitation or redevelopment of the urban renewal area by private enterprise. If the urban renewal area consists of an area of open land to be acquired by the municipality, such area shall not be so acquired unless (1) if it is to be developed for residential uses, the local governing body shall determine that a shortage of housing of sound standards and design which is decent, safe and sanitary exists in the municipality; that the need for housing accommodations has been or will be increased as a result of the clearance of slums in other areas (including other portions of the urban renewal area); that the conditions of blight in the area and the shortage of decent, safe and sanitary housing cause or contribute to an increase in and spread of disease and crime and constitute a menace to the public health, safety, morals, or welfare; and that the acquisition of the area for residential uses is an integral part of and essential to the program of the municipality, or (2) if it is to be developed for nonresidential uses, the local governing body shall determine that such nonresidential uses are necessary and appropriate to facilitate the proper growth and development of the community in accordance with sound planning standards and local community objectives, which acquisition may require the exercise of governmental action, as provided in this article, because of defective or unusual conditions of title, diversity of ownership, tax delinquency, improper subdivisions, outmoded street patterns, deterioration of site, economic disuse, unsuitable topography or faulty lot layouts, the need for the correlation of the area with other areas of a municipality by streets and modern traffic requirements, or any combination of such factors or other conditions which retard development of the area.
     </p>
     <p>
      An urban renewal plan may be modified at any time, provided that if modified after the lease or sale by the municipality of real property in the urban renewal project area, such modification may be conditioned upon such approval of the owner, lessee or successor in interest as the municipality may deem advisable and in any event shall be subject to such rights at law or in equity as a lessee or purchaser, or his successor or successors in interest, may be entitled to assert.
     </p>
     <p>
      Upon the approval by a municipality of an urban renewal plan or of any modification thereof, such plan or modification shall be deemed to be in full force and effect for the respective urban renewal area and the municipality may then cause such plan or modification to be carried out in accordance with its terms.
     </p>
     <p>
      Notwithstanding any other provisions of this article, where the local governing body certifies that an area is in need of redevelopment or rehabilitation as a result of a flood, fire, hurricane, earthquake, storm, or other catastrophe respecting which the governor of the state has certified the need for disaster assistance under Public Law 875, Eighty-first Congress, or other federal law, the local governing body may approve an urban renewal plan and an urban renewal project with respect to such area without regard to the provisions of subsection (d) of this section and the provisions of this section requiring a general plan for the municipality and a public hearing on the urban renewal project.

       Where at the time of a municipal housing authority’s resolution declaring the necessity for taking certain properties as a blighted area, such area was populated and had houses and commercial buildings constructed thereon, the fact that at the time eminent domain proceedings were commenced there was nothing standing in the area except grass and trees, such proceedings were not violative of the statute prohibiting condemnation of “open land,” since the condition of the area was otherwise at the time that the declaration of necessity for taking was adopted.

    Powers.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Every municipality shall have all the powers necessary or convenient to carry out and effectuate the purposes and provisions of this article, including the following powers in addition to others herein granted:
     </p>

L. 93-383, or amendments thereto, and to make grants or loans to individuals who own property in the designated area and who qualify according to the provisions of the act, such grants or loans to be made from funds accepted under the provisions of said P. L. 93-383, as amended, or from the grants and contributions derived under the provisions of subsection (e) of this section; and to make loans from funds derived from subsection (e) of this section or from the proceeds of revenue bonds issued pursuant to the authority of Section 43-35-21, Mississippi Code of 1972.

     </p>
     <p>
      To prepare plans for the relocation of persons (including families, business concerns and others) displaced by an urban renewal project, and to make relocation payments to or with respect to such persons for moving expenses and losses of property for which reimbursement or compensation is not otherwise made, including the making of payments financed by the federal government;

A municipality may exercise the power of eminent domain in the manner provided in Chapter 27, Title 11, Mississippi Code of 1972, or it may exercise the power of eminent domain in the manner now or which may be hereafter provided by any other statutory provisions for the exercise of the power of eminent domain. Property already devoted to a public use may be acquired in like manner, provided that no real property belonging to the state, or any political subdivision thereof, may be acquired without its consent.

       § 43-35-19.
    Disposal of property in urban renewal area.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      A municipality may sell, lease or otherwise transfer real property or any interest therein acquired by it, and may enter into contracts with respect thereto, in an urban renewal area for residential, recreational, commercial, industrial or other uses or for public use, or may retain such property or interest for public use, in accordance with the urban renewal plan, subject to such covenants, conditions and restrictions, including covenants running with the land, as it may deem to be necessary or desirable to assist in preventing the development or spread of future slums or blighted areas or to otherwise carry out the purposes of this article. Such sale, lease, other transfer, or retention, and any agreement relating thereto, may be made only after the approval of the urban renewal plan by the local governing body. The purchasers or lessees and their successors and assigns shall be obligated to devote such real property only to the uses specified in the urban renewal plan, and may be obligated to comply with such other requirements as the municipality may determine to be in the public interest, including the obligation to begin within a reasonable time any improvements on such real property required by the urban renewal plan. Such real property or interest shall be sold, leased, otherwise transferred, or retained at not less than its fair value for uses in accordance with the urban renewal plan. In determining the fair value of real property for uses in accordance with the urban renewal plan, a municipality shall take into account and give consideration to the uses provided in such plan; the restrictions upon, and the covenants, conditions and obligations assumed by the purchaser or lessee or by the municipality retaining the property; and the objectives of such plan for the prevention of the recurrence of slum or blighted areas. The municipality in any instrument of conveyance to a private purchaser or lessee may provide that such purchaser or lessee shall be without power to sell, lease, or otherwise transfer the real property without the prior written consent of the municipality until he has completed the construction of any or all improvements which he has obligated himself to construct thereon. Real property acquired by a municipality which, in accordance with the provisions of the urban renewal plan, is to be transferred, shall be transferred as rapidly as feasible in the public interest consistent with the carrying out of the provisions of the urban renewal plan. Each contract for such transfer and the urban renewal plan shall be recorded in the land records of the county in such manner as to afford actual or constructive notice thereof.
     </p>
     <p>
      A municipality may dispose of real property in an urban renewal area to private persons only under such reasonable competitive bidding procedures as it shall prescribe or as hereinafter provided in this subsection. A municipality may, by public notice by publication in a newspaper having a general circulation in the community (thirty (30) days prior to the execution of any contract to sell, lease or otherwise transfer real property and prior to the delivery of any instrument of conveyance with respect thereto under the provisions of this section), invite proposals from and make available all pertinent information to private redevelopers or any persons interested in undertaking to redevelop or rehabilitate an urban renewal area, or any part thereof. Such notice shall identify the area, or portion thereof, and shall state that proposals shall be made by those interested within thirty (30) days after the date of publication of said notice, and that such further information as is available may be obtained at such office as shall be designated in said notice. The municipality shall consider all such redevelopment or rehabilitation proposals and the financial and legal ability of the persons making such proposals to carry them out, and may negotiate with any persons for proposals for the purchase, lease or other transfer of any real property acquired by the municipality in the urban renewal area. The municipality may accept such proposal as it deems to be in the public interest and in furtherance of the purposes of this article. A notification of intention to accept such proposal shall be filed with the governing body not less than thirty (30) days prior to any such acceptance. Thereafter, the municipality may execute such contract in accordance with the provisions of subsection (a) and deliver deeds, leases and other instruments and take all steps necessary to effectuate such contract.
     </p>
     <p>
      A municipality may temporarily operate and maintain real property acquired in an urban renewal area pending the disposition of the property as authorized in this article, without regard to the provisions of subsection (a) above, for such uses and purposes as may be deemed desirable even though not in conformity with the urban renewal plan.

       § 43-35-21.
    Issuance of bonds.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      A municipality shall have power to issue bonds from time to time, in its discretion, to finance the undertaking of any urban renewal project under this article, including, without limiting the generality thereof, the payment of principal and interest upon any advances for surveys and plans, and shall also have power to issue refunding bonds for the payment or retirement of such bonds previously issued by it. Such bonds shall be made payable, as to both principal and interest, solely from the income, proceeds, revenues, and funds of the municipality derived from or held in connection with its undertaking and carrying out of urban renewal projects under this article. Payment of such bonds, both as to principal and interest, may be further secured by a pledge of any loan, grant or contribution from the federal government or other source, in aid of any urban renewal projects of the municipality under this article, and by a mortgage of any such urban renewal projects, or any part thereof title to which is in the municipality.
     </p>
     <p>
      Bonds issued under this section shall not constitute an indebtedness within the meaning of any constitutional or statutory debt limitation or restriction, and shall not be subject to the provisions of any other law or charter relating to the authorization, issuance or sale of bonds. Bonds issued under the provisions of this article are declared to be issued for an essential public and governmental purpose and, together with interest thereon and income therefrom, shall be exempted from all taxes.
     </p>
     <p>
      Bonds issued under this section shall be authorized by resolution or ordinance of the local governing body and may be issued in one or more series and shall bear such date or dates, be payable upon demand or mature at such time or times, not to exceed thirty (30) years from date of issue, bear interest at such rate or rates, not exceeding that allowed in Section 75-17-103, be in such denomination or denominations, be in such form either coupon or registered, carry such conversion or registration privileges, have such rank or priority, be executed in such manner, be payable in such medium of payment, at such place or places, and be subject to such terms of redemption (with or without premium), be secured in such manner, and have such other characteristics, as may be provided by such resolution or trust indenture or mortgage issued pursuant thereto. Any bond issue to be awarded and sold to the United States of America or any agency thereof shall mature at such time or times, not to exceed thirty-five (35) years, as shall be prescribed in the ordinance authorizing their issuance.
     </p>
     <p>
      Such bonds may be sold at not less than par at public sales held after notice published prior to such sale in a newspaper having a general circulation in the area of operation and in such other medium of publication as the municipality may determine, may be exchanged for other bonds on the basis of par or may be sold at private sale under such terms and conditions as may be determined from time to time by the municipality. Such bonds may be sold to the federal government at private sale at not less than par, and, in the event less than all of the authorized principal amount of such bonds is sold to the federal government, the balance may be sold at private sale at not less than par at an interest cost to the municipality of not to exceed the interest cost to the municipality of the portion of the bonds sold to the federal government.
     </p>
     <p>
      In case any of the public officials of the municipality whose signatures appear on any bonds or coupons issued under this article shall cease to be such officials before the delivery of such bonds, such signatures shall, nevertheless, be valid and sufficient for all purposes, the same as if such officials had remained in office until such delivery. Any provision of any law to the contrary notwithstanding, any bonds issued pursuant to this article shall be fully negotiable.
     </p>
     <p>
      In any suit, action or proceeding involving the validity or enforceability of any bond issued under this article, or the security therefor, any such bond reciting in substance that it has been issued by the municipality in connection with an urban renewal project, shall be conclusively deemed to have been issued for such purpose and such project shall be conclusively deemed to have been planned, located and carried out in accordance with the provisions of this article.

      All banks, trust companies, bankers, savings banks and institutions, building and loan associations, savings and loan associations, investment companies and other persons carrying on a banking or investment business; all insurance companies, insurance associations, and other persons carrying on an insurance business; and all executors, administrators, curators, trustees, and other fiduciaries, may legally invest any sinking funds, moneys, or other funds belonging to them or within their control in any bonds or other obligations issued by a municipality pursuant to this article or by any urban renewal agency or housing authority vested with urban renewal project powers under Section 43-35-31. Such bonds and other obligations shall be secured by an agreement between the issuer and the federal government in which the issuer agrees to borrow from the federal government and the federal government agrees to lend to the issuer, prior to the maturity of such bonds or other obligations, moneys in an amount which (together with any other moneys irrevocably committed to the payment of interest on such bonds or other obligations) will suffice to pay the principal of such bonds or other obligations with interest to maturity thereon, which moneys, under the terms of said agreement, are required to be used for the purpose of paying the principal of and the interest on such bonds or other obligations at their maturity. Such bonds and other obligations shall be authorized security for all public deposits. It is the purpose of this section to authorize any persons, political subdivisions and officers, public or private, to use any funds owned or controlled by them for the purchase of any such bonds or other obligations.

      For the purpose of aiding in the planning, undertaking or carrying out of an urban renewal project located within the area in which it is authorized to act, any public body may, upon such terms, with or without consideration, as it may determine: (1) dedicate, sell, convey or lease any of its interest in any property or grant easements, licenses or other rights or privileges therein to a municipality; (2) incur the entire expense of any public improvements made by such public body in exercising the powers granted in this section; (3) do any and all things necessary to aid or cooperate in the planning or carrying out of an urban renewal plan; (4) lend, grant or contribute funds to a municipality; (5) enter into agreements (which may extend over any period, notwithstanding any provision or rule of law to the contrary) with a municipality or other public body respecting action to be taken pursuant to any of the powers granted by this article, including the furnishing of funds or other assistance in connection with an urban renewal project; and (6) cause public buildings and public facilities, including parks, playgrounds, recreational, community, educational, water, sewer or drainage facilities, or any other works which it is otherwise empowered to undertake to be furnished; furnish, dedicate, close, vacate, pave, install, grade, regrade, plan or replan streets, roads, sidewalks, ways or other places; plan or replan, zone or rezone any part of the public body or make exceptions from building regulations; and cause administrative and other services to be furnished to the municipality. If at any time title to or possession of any urban renewal project is held by any public body or governmental agency, other than the municipality, which is authorized by law to engage in the undertaking, carrying out, or administration of urban renewal projects (including any agency or instrumentality of the United States of America), the provisions of the agreements referred to in this section shall inure to the benefit of and may be enforced by such public body or governmental agency. As used in this subsection, the term “municipality” shall also include an urban renewal agency or a housing authority vested with all of the urban renewal project powers pursuant to the provisions of Section 43-35-31.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any sale, conveyance, lease or agreement provided for in this section may be made by a public body without appraisal, public notice, advertisement or public bidding.

    Exercise of powers in carrying out urban renewal project.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      A municipality may itself exercise its urban renewal project powers (as herein defined) or may, if the local governing body by resolution determines such action to be in the public interest, elect to have such powers exercised by the urban renewal agency (created by Section 43-35-33) or by the housing authority, if one exists or is subsequently established in the community. In the event the local governing body makes such determination, the urban renewal agency or the housing authority, as the case may be, shall be vested with all of the urban renewal project powers in the same manner as though all such powers were conferred on such agency or authority instead of the municipality. If the local governing body does not elect to make such determination, the municipality, in its discretion, may exercise its urban renewal project powers through a board or commissioner or through such officers of the municipality as the local governing body may by resolution determine.
     </p>
     <p>
      As used in this section, the term “urban renewal project powers” shall include the rights, powers, functions and duties of a municipality under this article, except the following: the power to determine an area to be a slum or blighted area or combination thereof and to designate such area as appropriate for an urban renewal project and to hold any public hearings required with respect thereto; the power to approve urban renewal plans and modifications thereof; the power to establish a general plan for the locality as a whole; the power to formulate a workable program under Section 43-35-9; the power to make the determinations and findings provided for in Section 43-35-7, Section 43-35-11, and subsection (d) of Section 43-35-13; the power to issue general obligation bonds; and the power to appropriate funds, to levy taxes and assessments, and to exercise other powers provided for in subsection (h) of Section 43-35-15.

       § 43-35-33.
    Urban renewal agency.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      There is hereby created in each municipality a public body corporate and politic to be known as the “urban renewal agency” of the municipality. Such agency shall not transact any business or exercise its powers hereunder until or unless the local governing body has made the finding prescribed in Section 43-35-11, and has elected to have the urban renewal project powers exercised by an urban renewal agency as provided in Section 43-35-31.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the urban renewal agency is authorized to transact business and exercise powers hereunder, the mayor, by and with the advice and consent of the local governing body, shall appoint a board of commissioners of the urban renewal agency which shall consist of five (5) commissioners. The term of office of each such commissioner shall be for five (5) years. The commissioners who are appointed in 1973 shall be designated to serve for terms of one (1), two (2), three (3), four (4) and five (5) years, respectively, from the date of their appointment, and thereafter when a vacancy shall occur either by the expiration of term of office or otherwise, the vacancy shall be filled by the governing body of the city either to fill an unexpired term where a commissioner shall die or resign or shall become disqualified during his term, or for a full term of five (5) years where the term of a commissioner expires.
     </p>
     <p>
      A commissioner shall receive no compensation for his services but shall be entitled to the necessary expenses, including traveling expenses, incurred in the discharge of his duties. Each commissioner shall hold office until his successor has been appointed and has qualified. A certificate of the appointment or reappointment of any commissioner shall be filed with the clerk of the municipality and such certificate shall be conclusive evidence of the due and proper appointment of such commissioner.
     </p>
     <p>
      The powers of an urban renewal agency shall be exercised by the commissioners thereof. A majority of the commissioners shall constitute a quorum for the purpose of conducting business and exercising the powers of the agency and for all other purposes. Action may be taken by the agency upon a vote of a majority of the commissioners present, unless in any case the bylaws shall require a larger number. Any persons may be appointed as commissioners if they reside within the area of operation of the agency, which shall be coterminous with the area of operation of the municipality, and are otherwise eligible for such appointments under this article.
     </p>
     <p>
      An agency may employ an executive director, technical experts and such other agents and employees, permanent and temporary, as it may require, and determine their qualifications, duties and compensation. For such legal service as it may require, an agency may employ or retain its own counsel and legal staff. An agency authorized to transact business and exercise powers under this article shall file with the local governing body, on or before March 31 of each year, a report of its activities for its preceding fiscal year, which report shall include a complete financial statement setting forth its assets, liabilities, income and operating expenses as of the end of such fiscal year. At the time of filing the report, the agency shall publish a true and correct copy of such report in a newspaper of general circulation in the community.
     </p>
     <p>
      For inefficiency or neglect of duty or misconduct in office, a commissioner may be removed only after a hearing and after he shall have been given a copy of the charges at least ten (10) days prior to such hearing and have had an opportunity to be heard in person or by counsel.

   Even if the mayor could direct the executive director of the Joint Redevelopment Authority (JRA), it was the JRA commissioners, not its executive director, who made the actual decisions regarding which projects to support; the mayor’s statutory authority to influence the JRA was constrained, and because the city council had policymaking authority over funding, the city was not liable for the mayor’s actions.

   The Jackson Redevelopment Agency was a legal entity entitled to exercise the power of eminent domain, even though it had failed to file the required annual reports; the fact that two of the seven commissioners of the redevelopment agency were not qualified to serve on the board of directors because they did not meet the statutory residence requirements did not invalidate the agency’s exercise of its eminent domain powers where, under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.25.html#t25c01s25-1-37" target="_blank">25-1-37</a></cite>, their right to office could not be impeached in a collateral proceeding; nor could a collateral proceeding be used to raise a claim that two of the commissioners had improperly failed to file statements regarding conflicts of interest and that three other commissioners were not qualified because they held other public office; however, the agency’s action in condemning the property at issue was invalid under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c35s43-35-33" target="_self">43-35-33</a></cite> since a quorum of the commissioners was not present when the resolution to exercise the power of eminent domain was adopted.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Upon the adoption of an ordinance finding that building conditions of the character described in Section 43-35-103 exist within a municipality, the governing body of such municipality is hereby authorized to adopt ordinances relating to the buildings within such municipality which are unfit for human habitation, use or occupancy. Such ordinances shall include the following provisions:
     </p>
     <p>
      That a public officer be designated or appointed to exercise the powers prescribed by the ordinances.
     </p>
     <p>
      That whenever a petition is filed with the public officer by a public authority or by at least five (5) residents of the municipality, charging that any building is unfit for human habitation, use or occupancy, or whenever it appears to the public officer, on his own motion, that any building is unfit for human habitation, use or occupancy, the public officer shall, if his preliminary investigation discloses a basis for such charges, issue and cause to be served upon the owner of and parties in interest in such premises a complaint, stating the charges in that respect and containing a notice that a hearing will be held before the public officer, or his designated agent, at a place therein fixed not less than ten (10) days nor more than thirty (30) days after the serving of said complaint; and that the owner and parties in interest shall be given the right to file an answer to the complaint and to appear in person, or otherwise, and give testimony at the place and time fixed in the complaint.
     </p>
     <p>
      That if, after such notice and hearing, the public officer determines that the building under consideration is unfit for human habitation, use or occupancy, he shall state in writing his findings of fact in support of such determination and shall issue and cause to be served upon the owner thereof an order requiring him, to the extent and within the time specified in the order, to repair, alter or improve the said building to render it fit for human habitation, use or occupancy or, at the option of the owner, to vacate and close the building as a human habitation, or for human use or occupancy.
     </p>
     <p>
      That, if the owner fails to comply with such order within the time prescribed, the public officer may cause the building to be vacated and closed; that the public officer may cause to be posted on the main entrance of any building so closed a placard with the following words:
     </p>
     <p>
      “This building is unfit for human habitation, use or occupancy; the use or occupation of this building by humans is prohibited and unlawful.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Any person who shall rent, lease or occupy, or who shall permit any person to rent, lease or occupy such building for a human habitation, use or occupancy, shall be liable for such fine as may be prescribed by the ordinances of the municipality.
     </p>
     <p>
      That if, after notice and hearing, the public officer determines that a building is in such condition, because of dilapidation, disrepair, structural defects, or otherwise, that it is dangerous or injurious to the health or safety of the public or the occupants of buildings or the occupants of neighboring buildings, said public officer shall issue and cause to be served upon the owner an order requiring him to repair, alter or improve the said building to the extent and within the time specified in such order, or, at the option of the owner, to remove or demolish such building; that if the owner fails to comply with such order within the time prescribed, the public officer may cause such building to be repaired, altered or improved in accordance with the order. If such repairs, alterations or improvements cannot be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the value of the building, said public officer may cause such building to be removed or demolished; the ordinance of the municipality may fix a certain percentage of such cost in relation to the value of a building as being reasonable for such purpose; and the cost of such repairs, alterations, improvements or removal, or demolition, in addition to a penalty not to exceed twenty percent (20%) of the actual costs which may be imposed by the municipality, shall be a lien against such real estate, and assessed and collected as a special tax. The governing authorities of any municipality ordering such assessment shall fix a day for the hearing of objections to such assessment and shall cause the municipal clerk to give to the property owner ten (10) days’ written notice, by mail, if the post-office address of the owner be known, but if the post-office address of the owner be unknown, notice shall be given by posting notice for at least ten (10) days in five (5) public places in the municipality, of the time and place for the hearing of objections to such assessment; one of such public places for posting notice as aforesaid shall be on the land which is the subject matter of such assessment. If the amount of said special tax is not paid in full within six (6) months from and after the date the assessment becomes final, the tax collector shall proceed to advertise and sell the said real estate, or a sufficient amount thereof to recover said special tax and all costs of the sale, after having given notice of the time and place of such sale as is required by law for the sale of land for delinquent ad valorem taxes. From the proceeds of said sale, the tax collector shall first pay the cost of the sale, after which he shall pay the cost of such repairs, alterations, improvement, removal or demolition and any penalty imposed by the municipality; and any amount remaining over shall be deposited by him with the clerk of the circuit court as hereinafter provided. If the building is removed or demolished by the public officer, he may sell the materials of such building and shall credit the proceeds of such sale against the cost of the removal or demolition; and any balance remaining shall be deposited in the circuit court by the public officer, shall be secured in such manner as may be directed by such court, and shall be disbursed by such court to the persons found to be entitled thereto by the final award or judgment of such court. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to impair or limit in any way the power of the municipality to define and declare nuisances and to cause their removal or abatement by summary proceedings or otherwise.

The boundaries of such special parking facility taxing district shall not be modified and special taxes shall not be levied in excess of the maximum set forth in such resolution, unless the governing authorities shall have amended such resolution after a public hearing and notice as described above. The proceeds of any special tax levied on property in a special parking facility taxing district pursuant to this subsection (1) shall be used solely to pay principal of and interest on bonds issued by such municipality under Section 43-35-203 with respect to parking facilities located within such special parking facility taxing district or shall be paid to the urban renewal agency or redevelopment authority to which the power and authority to establish to construct municipal parking facilities shall have been delegated and used by such urban renewal agency or redevelopment authority to pay principal of and interest on bonds issued by such urban renewal agency or redevelopment authority under Section 43-35-203 with respect to parking facilities located within such special parking facility taxing district. The governing authorities of such municipality shall levy such tax at the maximum rate specified in such resolution against all property in such special parking facility taxing district for so long as any bonds issued pursuant to Section 43-35-203 with respect to parking facilities located within such special parking facility taxing district shall be outstanding unless the governing body of the urban renewal agency or redevelopment authority shall certify that a lesser rate will provide revenues sufficient to pay debt service on all bonds payable from such tax and to pay costs of owning, operating and managing parking facilities located in such special parking facility taxing district, in which event such governing authorities shall levy such tax at such lesser rate. The governing authorities of a municipality may also enter into agreements for the benefit of holders of bonds issued by an urban renewal agency or redevelopment authority pursuant to Section 43-35-203 limiting or restricting issuance of bonds by such municipality which would be payable from such special tax to the extent that such governing authorities shall determine that such agreements are necessary or desirable in connection with the issuance of bonds by an urban renewal agency or redevelopment authority pursuant to Section 43-35-203. Such tax shall cease to be levied after all principal of and interest on bonds issued under Section 43-35-203 with respect to parking facilities located within such special parking facility taxing district shall have been paid in full.

      The governing authorities of any municipality which has elected, or hereafter may elect, to exercise or delegate the power and authority to establish and construct municipal parking facilities for motor vehicles belonging to the general public, as provided in Section 43-35-201, and the governing authorities of any urban renewal agency or redevelopment authority to which such power and authority shall have been delegated are hereby authorized and empowered, in their discretion, to issue bonds for the purpose of acquiring land and property for a municipal parking facility and related structures and also for owning, erecting, building, establishing, operating and maintaining such facilities and related structures and to remodel or repair the same, and to refund outstanding bonds and to pay costs relating to the issuance of such bonds and interest on such bonds and to establish any reserves determined to be appropriate. Such bonds may be issued without an election thereon upon the adoption of a resolution by the governing authorities of such issuing authority. Such bonds shall not be subject to any limitation as to amount, and shall not be included in computing the statutory limitation of indebtedness of such issuing authority under any present or future law. Such bonds shall bear date or dates, shall be of such denomination or denominations, shall bear interest at such rates not to exceed the maximum rate specified in Section 75-17-103, shall be payable at such place or places within or without the State of Mississippi, shall mature at such time or times and upon such terms and may be made redeemable prior to maturity with or without premium, shall bear such registration privileges and shall be in substantially such form as shall be determined by resolution of the governing authorities of such issuing authority.
     </p>
     <p>
      Such bonds shall be executed by the manual or facsimile signature of the mayor or chairman and clerk or secretary of such issuing authority, with the seal of the issuing authority affixed thereto or reproduced thereon. Whenever such bonds shall have been signed by the officials designated to sign the same who were in office at the time of such signing but who may have ceased to be such officers prior to the date of the sale and delivery of such bonds, or who may not have been in office on the date such bonds may bear, the signatures of such officers upon such bonds shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes and have the same effect as if the person so officially signing such bonds had remained in office until the delivery of the same to the purchaser or had been in office on the date such bonds may bear.

      The principal proceeds of such bonds shall be paid into a special fund in a bank or banks qualified as depositories for the municipality or for the urban renewal agency or redevelopment authority to which the municipality has delegated its power and authority with respect to such parking facilities. The accrued interest and premium, if any, shall be paid into the fund established for the payment of the principal of and interest on such bonds. The principal proceeds shall be used solely for the purposes for which such bonds were issued, except as hereinafter provided, and shall be disbursed upon order of the board of commissioners of the urban renewal agency or redevelopment authority having jurisdiction of said parking facilities, or upon order of the governing authorities of such municipality, as the case may be. If the proceeds of such bonds, by error of calculation or otherwise, shall be less than the cost of the project for which such bonds were issued and the redeeming of any outstanding bonds, then and in such event, unless otherwise provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of such bonds, additional bonds may in like manner, be issued to provide the amount of such deficit. Unless otherwise provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of bonds, such additional bonds shall be deemed to be of the same issue as the original bonds and shall be entitled to payment from the same funds without preference or priority to the bonds first issued for the same purpose. If the proceeds of the bonds of any issue shall exceed the amount required for the project for which the bonds were issued, such surplus shall be paid into the fund established for the payment of the principal of and interest on such bonds.

     <p>
      A resolution issuing bonds in compliance with this article may include any covenants with the bondholders deemed necessary to make such bonds secure and marketable, including, but without limitation, covenants regarding the application of the bond proceeds; the pledging, application and securing of special taxes, parking facility tax increment financing revenues, payments from municipalities and counties, other revenues and the revenues of the parking facilities; the creation and maintenance of reserves; covenants to levy special taxes and other taxes; covenants to enforce agreements; the investment of funds; the issuance of additional bonds; the maintenance of minimum fees, charges and rentals; the operation and maintenance of facilities; insurance and insurance proceeds; accounts and audits; the sale of properties; remedies of bondholders; the vesting in a trustee or trustees such powers and rights as may be necessary to secure the bonds and the revenues and funds from which they are payable; the terms and conditions upon which bondholders may exercise their rights and remedies; the replacement of lost, destroyed or mutilated bonds; the definition, consequences and remedies of an event of default; and the appointment of a receiver in the event of a default.
     </p>
     <p>
      All taxes and revenues pledged to the payment of such bonds shall be subject to a lien in favor of the holders of such bonds, and all such taxes and revenues received by the issuing authority shall be immediately subject to such lien without any physical delivery thereof or further act by the issuing authority, and such lien shall be effective as against all parties asserting claims against the issuing authority, whether by way of tort, contract or otherwise, whether or not such parties may have had notice of such lien. Such pledge or trust agreement creating the same need not be filed or recorded except in the official minutes of the issuing authority.
     </p>
     <p>
      The state does hereby covenant with the holders of any such bonds that it will not, while any such bonds shall be outstanding, limit or diminish the right and power of any county, municipality or urban renewal agency or redevelopment authority to establish, maintain and collect rates, fees, rentals and other charges pledged to the payment of such bonds, or to levy the special taxes authorized by this article, to fulfill any covenants with or for the benefit of such bondholders, or to make or receive payments pursuant to a parking facility tax increment financing plan.

    Trust agreements.

     </h3>
     <p>
      In the discretion of the issuing authority, all bonds may be further secured by a trust agreement between the issuing authority and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having powers of a trust company within or without the state. Any such trust agreement or any resolution providing for the issuance of such bonds may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as are reasonable and proper and not in violation of law. The trust agreement may contain provisions for the issuance of additional bonds under the procedures established by this article for any of the purposes authorized by this law which shall be secured by the revenues pledged thereunder for such bonds to the extent provided therein.
     </p>
     <p>
      The trust agreement may include provisions to the effect that, if there is any default in the payment of principal or interest on any of said bonds, any court of competent jurisdiction may appoint a receiver to administer the properties and facilities of the authority described in the trust agreement on behalf of the municipality or urban renewal agency or redevelopment authority, including authority to sell or make contracts for the sale of any services, facilities or commodities of the authority or to renew such contracts, subject to the approval of the court appointing the said receiver; and with power to provide for the payment of such bonds outstanding, or the payment of operating expenses, and to apply the income and revenues to the payment of the said bonds and interest thereon in accordance with the resolution of the authority authorizing the issuance of such bonds and the said trust agreement. The fee for the services of any corporate trustee shall not exceed the normal charges for acting as paying agent, plus any additional amount or amounts allowed by the court as the reasonable value of services rendered by the corporate trustee.
     </p>
     <p>
      The powers herein granted may be exercised whether or not a trust agreement is entered into and, if no trust agreement is entered into, such provisions as are above authorized may be set out in the resolution authorizing the bonds.

     <p>
      For the purposes of this article the following terms shall have the meanings given in this section unless a different meaning is clearly indicated by the context:
     </p>
     <p>
      “Base year value” shall mean the appraised value of a property used in assessing ad valorem taxes for the year in which a parking facility tax increment financing plan covering such property shall have been adopted or, if later, the year in which such property was included in a parking facility tax increment financing plan; provided that, if any property shall have been exempt from ad valorem taxation for the year in which a parking facility tax increment financing plan shall have been adopted or, if later, the year in which such property was included in a parking facility tax increment financing plan, and shall thereafter become subject to ad valorem taxation, the base year value shall be the appraised value of such property used in assessing taxes during the first year that such property shall be subject to ad valorem taxation or, if lesser, the appraised value, as certified by the applicable tax assessor, which would have been used in assessing taxes during the preceding year if the property had been subject to ad valorem taxation.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Issuing authority” means any city or town incorporated under the laws of the State of Mississippi or any urban renewal agency or redevelopment authority within such city or town having authority to issue bonds pursuant to Section 43-35-203.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Municipality” means any city or town incorporated under the laws of the State of Mississippi.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Parking facility tax increment financing plan” means a plan for allocating all or a part of any increases in general fund ad valorem taxes arising as a result of increases in the value of specific properties or properties in designated areas (or any combination thereof) to defray costs relating to parking facilities. Such plan shall be sufficiently complete to indicate the anticipated increases in general fund ad valorem taxes, the percentage or dollar amount of such taxes to be allocated to defray costs relating to parking facilities and the specific properties or specific area (or combination) covered by such plan.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Parking facility tax increment financing revenues” means the increases in general fund ad valorem taxes received as a result of increases in the values of specific properties or properties located in a designated area. Such increases, with respect to specific properties during a year, shall be the amount by which general fund ad valorem taxes received during such year as a result of levies on such property exceed the general fund ad valorem taxes which would have been received if such property were assessed based on its base year value. Such increases, with respect to properties located in specific areas during a year, shall be the amount by which general fund ad valorem taxes received during such year as a result of levies on all nonexempt properties in such area exceed the general fund ad valorem taxes which would have been received if such nonexempt properties were assessed based on the base year value of each such property.

         Real property shall be appraised before the initiation of negotiations, except that the acquiring person, agency or other entity may adopt a procedure in compliance with federal regulations to waive the appraisal in cases involving the acquisition by sale or donation of property with a low fair market value. For the purposes of this chapter, property with a low fair market value is property with a fair market value of Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000.00) or less. The owner or his designated representative shall be given an opportunity to accompany the appraiser during his inspection of the property.

Any decrease or increase in the fair market value of real property prior to the date of valuation caused by the public improvement for which the property is acquired or by the likelihood that the property would be acquired for such improvement, other than that due to physical deterioration within the reasonable control of the owner, will be disregarded in determining the compensation for the property. The owner of the real property to be acquired shall be provided with a written statement of, and summary of the basis for, the amount established as just compensation. Where appropriate, the just compensation for the real property acquired and for damages to remaining real property shall be separately stated.

When state funds pay for all or a portion of the acquisition, the purchasing person, agency or other entity shall prepare a written statement explaining the reasons that justified the purchase price exceeding the amount offered as just compensation, including any anticipated trial risks, and any available information supporting an administrative settlement.

         If the acquisition of only part of the property would leave its owner with an uneconomic remnant, an offer to acquire that remnant shall be made.

       Section 43-37-3(c) (now 43-37-3(1)(c)(i)) prohibits a municipality from offering an amount less than the approved appraisal of the fair market value of the subject property to the owner. This statute does not specifically state that the city may or may not pay more than the appraised fair market value of the subject real property. However, the negotiated price paid by a municipality for real property is a matter left to the sound discretion of the governing authorities of the municipality, but must be reasonable and consistent with the property’s appraised fair market value. Dorrill, November 1, 1996, A.G. Op. #96-0636.
      </p>
      <p>
       A property owner may not waive either the appraisal requirement or any other procedures set forth in the statute; however, a property owner may forego receipt of fair market value for the property. Mitchell, Oct. 20, 2000, A.G. Op. #2000-0597.
      </p>
      <p>
       The process for acquisition of property is set forth in the statute, which states that every reasonable effort must be made to negotiate for the purchase of real property, but only after the county has an appraisal performed.
   Wolfe, Feb. 2, 2001, A.G. Op. #2001-0018.
      </p>
      <p>
       A county must follow Sections 43-37-1 and 43-37-3 in the purchase of a lot located across from the county jail to be used to store county maintenance equipment and as an impound lot for the sheriff’s department, and the county must have the property appraised. Fortier, May 9, 2003, A.G. Op. 03-0196.
      </p>
      <p>
       There may be circumstances where a county may pay more than an amount contained in an appraisal for the purchase of property;
   however, while the final amount paid is to be determined within the discretion of the board of supervisors, and while it may exceed a specific appraisal value, it must be commensurate with the fair market value. Fortier, May 9, 2003, A.G. Op. 03-0196.
      </p>
      <p>
       A county must offer just compensation in an amount no less than the appraisal for the purchase of property; if the seller then offers to accept less than that amount, the county can pay less. Fortier, May 9, 2003, A.G. Op. 03-0196.
      </p>
      <p>
       When acquiring real property, a governing authority must comply with the provisions of Section 43-37-3 and may, within its discretion, establish a purchase price which exceeds the appraised value of the property when the determined purchase price is commensurate with the fair market value of the property. Shoemake, Nov. 17, 2006, A.G. Op. 06-0570.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no authority for a county to pay delinquent land taxes or to bid on or purchase real property at a county tax sale. Hudson, February 9, 2007, A.G. Op. #07-00038, 2007 Miss. AG LEXIS 19.

   Because appellant billboard company’s billboard was clearly a structure within the meaning of Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c37s43-37-11" target="_self">43-37-11</a></cite>, the special court erred when it found that the company did not have a compensable interest in the eminent domain proceedings.

      <p>
       Company, which was leasing the property that was taken by the Mississippi Transportation Commission, was not entitled to any of the condemnation award of the lessor because it had no leasehold interest as its leases had terminated. Thus, the special court properly granted the Commission’s motion for partial summary judgment finding that (1) the company was only entitled to compensation for the value of the billboards on the property that was taken and (2) compensation could only be calculated using the cost analysis, which would provide the company with the new cost of its signs, less depreciation.

       In an eminent domain case, the special court properly granted the Mississippi Transportation Commission’s motion for summary judgment awarding the company, which was leasing the property that was taken and on which it had placed three billboard signs, $ 57,700 for each billboard sign because the parties had entered into and filed a stipulation that the cost new, less depreciation, for each billboard on the property was $ 57,700.

      “Displacing agency” means the state, a state agency or an authorized political subdivision, or any person carrying out a program or project with public financial assistance which causes a person to be a displaced person.

Any funds so advanced shall be withheld from the contract reimbursement payments and in no case shall the final reimbursement payment to the contractor exceed the actual cost incurred in providing services. Any contractor receiving such advance payments shall be strictly liable to ensure that same is adjusted to actual cost, including repayment of excess cash advances if necessary, prior to the final closeout of the purchase of service contract.

      “Abuse” means the commission of a willful act, or the willful omission of the performance of a duty, which act or omission contributes, tends to contribute to, or results in the infliction of physical pain, injury or mental anguish on or to a vulnerable person, the unreasonable confinement of a vulnerable person, or the willful deprivation by a caretaker of services which are necessary to maintain the mental or physical health of a vulnerable person. “Abuse” includes the sexual abuse delineated in Section 43-47-18. “Abuse” does not mean conduct that is a part of the treatment and care of, and in furtherance of the health and safety of, a patient or resident of a care facility, nor shall it mean a normal caregiving action or appropriate display of affection. “Abuse” includes, but is not limited to, a single incident.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Care facility” means:
     </p>

     </p>
     <p>
      Any hospice as defined in, and required to be licensed under, the provisions of Chapter 85 of Title 41; and
     </p>
     <p>
      Any adult day services facility, which means a community-based group program for adults designed to meet the needs of adults with impairments through individual plans of care, which are structured, comprehensive, planned, nonresidential programs providing a variety of health, social and related support services in a protective setting, enabling participants to live in the community. Exempted from this definition shall be any program licensed and certified by the Mississippi Department of Mental Health and any adult day services program provided to ten (10) or fewer individuals by a licensed institution for the aged or infirm.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Caretaker” means an individual, corporation, partnership or other organization which has assumed the responsibility for the care of a vulnerable person, but shall not include the Division of Medicaid, a licensed hospital, or a licensed nursing home within the state.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Court” means the chancery court of the county in which the vulnerable person resides or is located.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Department” means the Department of Human Services.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Emergency” means a situation in which:
     </p>
     <p>
      A vulnerable person is in substantial danger of serious harm, death or irreparable harm if protective services are not provided immediately;
     </p>
     <p>
      The vulnerable person is unable to consent to services;
     </p>
     <p>
      No responsible, able or willing caretaker, if any, is available to consent to emergency services; and
     </p>
     <p>
      There is insufficient time to utilize the procedure provided in Section 43-47-13.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Emergency services” means those services necessary to maintain a vulnerable person’s vital functions and without which there is reasonable belief that the vulnerable person would suffer irreparable harm or death, and may include taking physical custody of the person.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Essential services” means those social work, medical, psychiatric or legal services necessary to safeguard a vulnerable person’s rights and resources and to maintain the physical or mental well-being of the person. These services shall include, but not be limited to, the provision of medical care for physical and mental health needs, assistance in personal hygiene, food, clothing, adequately heated and ventilated shelter, protection from health and safety hazards, protection from physical mistreatment and protection from exploitation. The words “essential services” shall not include taking a vulnerable person into physical custody without his consent, except as provided for in Section 43-47-15 and as otherwise provided by the general laws of the state.

   Mississippi Vulnerable Persons Act, was not unconstitutionally vague, because, while the Legislature defined “vulnerable person” broadly, it defined the criminal offense with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people could understand what conduct was prohibited and in a manner that did not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.

   It was improper to convict defendant of using her mother’s money without her consent in violation of the Mississippi Vulnerable Adults Act of 1986, Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c47s43-47-19" target="_self">43-47-19</a></cite> because although the indictment sufficiently informed defendant of the crime and the conduct the grand jury believed constituted the crime, the trial court erroneously issued a jury instruction that materially conflicted with the indictment’s language; the wording of the indictment suggested that the grand jury believed defendant’s use of the money was improper only if the money was used without the mother’s consent, but at trial, the State produced no evidence that defendant had used her mother’s money without her consent, and several witnesses testified that she, in fact, had obtained her mother’s consent. Decker v. State, 2011 Miss. LEXIS 296 (Miss. June 16, 2011), op. withdrawn, 2011 Miss. LEXIS 324 (Miss. June 30, 2011).

       Court did not agree with the contention that defendant’s conviction of abuse of a vulnerable adult was against the weight of the evidence; a nursing assistant testified to having witnessed defendant abuse the adult, other witnesses found the adult in a frightened state and with a bruise on the hand, and although defendant argued that certain testimony was contradicted, the trial court was in the position to determine the credibility of the witnesses.

       Because the Mississippi Vulnerable Adults Act addresses only willful acts or omissions that injure vulnerable adults, they cannot be employed to establish the standard of care applicable in a negligence suit. Mariner Health Care, Inc. v. Estate of Edwards, 964 So. 2d 1138, 2007 Miss. LEXIS 520 (Miss. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Investigator’s report did not mention whether defendant’s elderly mother was in pain, however, in defendant’s sworn guilty plea petition, defendant stated that defendant’s acts did constitute willfully inflicting pain and injury upon defendant’s mother, “by binding and gagging” the victim and then leaving the victim restrained in the house, and that sufficed for defendant’s felony conviction under former Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c47s43-47-19ol13" target="_self">43-47-19(3)</a></cite> (Rev. 2000). Ward v. State, 879 So. 2d 452, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 1200 (Miss. Ct.

      </p>
      <p>
       The evidence established that the defendant willfully committed an act of abuse against a vulnerable adult where (1) two witnesses testified to seeing the defendant physically abuse the victim, (2) three additional witnesses testified that they saw fresh bruises on the victim’s arm immediately subsequent to the report of abuse, and (3) the only evidence adduced at trial that would support the defendant’s theory of the incident came through her own testimony. Ivy v. State, 736 So. 2d 1050, 1999 Miss. App. LEXIS 81 (Miss. Ct. App. 1999).

       The statute is not unconstitutional on the grounds of vagueness and ambiguity as it gives sufficient guidance as to the meaning of the terms “abuse”, “neglect,” and “exploitation.” Boatner v. State, 754 So. 2d 1184, 2000 Miss. LEXIS 57 (Miss. 2000).

       <p>
   It was improper to convict defendant of using her mother’s money without her consent in violation of the Mississippi Vulnerable Adults Act of 1986, Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c47s43-47-19" target="_self">43-47-19</a></cite> because although the indictment sufficiently informed defendant of the crime and the conduct the grand jury believed constituted the crime, the trial court erroneously issued a jury instruction that materially conflicted with the indictment’s language; the wording of the indictment suggested that the grand jury believed defendant’s use of the money was improper only if the money was used without the mother’s consent, but at trial, the State produced no evidence that defendant had used her mother’s money without her consent, and several witnesses testified that she, in fact, had obtained her mother’s consent. Decker v. State, 2011 Miss. LEXIS 296 (Miss. June 16, 2011), op. withdrawn, 2011 Miss. LEXIS 324 (Miss. June 30, 2011).
      </p>
      <p>
       In defendant’s trial for kidnapping, trial court properly refused a jury instruction for the offense of unreasonable confinement of vulnerable adult because defendant was required to present evidence that he did not commit kidnapping, and defendant failed to present evidence to negate an element of kidnapping. Hager v. State, 996 So. 2d 94, 2008 Miss. App. LEXIS 308 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 999 So. 2d 374, 2008 Miss. LEXIS 630 (Miss. 2008).

   Crime of sexual abuse of a vulnerable adult under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t43c47s43-47-19" target="_self">43-47-19</a></cite> does not encompass the crime of sexual battery under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.97.html#t97c03s97-3-95" target="_blank">97-3-95</a></cite>, and a conviction of both offenses does not implicate double jeopardy concerns because the crimes require additional and different elements of proof; specifically, the former offense does not require proof of penetration, while the latter offense does require this proof. Additionally, abuse of a vulnerable adult requires proof that defendant willfully inflicted physical pain or injury upon a vulnerable adult, while sexual battery has no such requirement; there are additional differences in that sexual battery does not require that the victim’s abilities to provide for his or her protection from sexual contact be impaired by the infirmities of aging or that the victim be a patient or resident of a care facility, while the charge of abuse of a vulnerable adult does require this additional element. Simoneaux v. State, 29 So.3d 26, 2009 Miss. App. LEXIS 445 (Miss. Ct. App. 2009), cert. denied, 29 So.3d 774, 2010 Miss.

       § 43-47-21.
    Payment for services; orders to provide custody, care, and maintenance.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      At the time the department makes an evaluation of the case reported, in accordance with the provisions of Section 43-47-9, it shall be determined, according to the regulations set by the department, whether the vulnerable person is financially capable of paying for the essential services. If he is, he shall make reimbursement for the costs of providing the needed essential services. If it is determined that he is not financially capable of paying for such services, they shall be provided at no cost to the recipient of the services. The court may order the department or any public agency to provide for the custody, care and maintenance of such vulnerable person. Provided, however, that the care, custody and maintenance of any vulnerable person shall be within statutory authorization and budgetary means of such institution, facility, agency or department. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, it is not the intent of the Legislature through the adoption of this chapter to authorize any court exercising jurisdiction over a vulnerable person to enlarge or bring about the addition of new groups or categories of recipients or to increase the types of care and services for such persons under the Mississippi Medicaid Law, and any court exercising jurisdiction over a vulnerable person shall not, in any way, enter an order against the Division of Medicaid to provide for the custody, care, or maintenance of a vulnerable person who is not otherwise eligible for medical assistance under Section 43-13-115 or services under Section 43-13-117.

       The definition of “care facility” in Section 43-47-5 applies for abuse, neglect, and exploitation reporting and investigating purposes regardless of whether a facility that is required to be licensed is so licensed. Brittain, May 2, 2003, A.G. Op. 03-0702.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although there is no statutory obligation on the part of the Department of Human Services (DHS) to investigate abuse, neglect and exploitation in a facility that operates as a personal care home but is not licensed by the State Department of Health to operate as such, in limited circumstances, where the alleged perpetrator is not an employee of the home health agency, the DHS has a statutory obligation to investigate and process complaints of abuse, neglect or exploitation or refer same to an appropriate authority.

     <p>
      As used in this chapter, unless the context clearly requires otherwise, the following words and phrases shall have the meanings respectively ascribed to them in this section:
     </p>
     <p>
      “Child at imminent risk of placement” means a minor who may be reasonably expected to face, in the near future, commitment to the care or custody of the state as a result of:
     </p>
     <p>
      Dependency, abuse or neglect;
     </p>
     <p>
      Emotional disturbance;
     </p>
     <p>
      Family conflict so extensive that reasonable control of the child is not exercised; or
     </p>
     <p>
      Delinquency adjudication.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Home Ties Program” means a program under the State Department of Human Services of family preservation and family support services.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Family preservation services” means services designed to help families alleviate risks or crises that might lead to out-of-home placement of children. The services may include procedures to maintain the safety of children in their own homes, support to families preparing to reunify or adopt and assistance to families in obtaining services and other sources of support necessary to address their multiple needs in a culturally sensitive environment.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Family support services” means preventive community-based activities designed to alleviate stress and to promote parental competencies and behaviors that will increase the ability of families to successfully nurture their children and will enable families to use other resources and opportunities available in the community. These services may include supportive networks designed to enhance child-rearing abilities of parents and to help compensate for the increased social isolation and vulnerability of families. Examples of these services and activities include: respite care for parents and other caregivers; early developmental screening of children to assess the needs of these children and assistance in obtaining specific services to meet their needs; mentoring, tutoring and health education for youth; and a range of center-based activities, such as informal interactions in drop-in centers and parent support groups, and home visiting programs.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The Legislature hereby finds and declares that there are many efforts currently under way that seek to forge partnerships to coordinate criminal justice and social services approaches to victimization of senior citizens. The TRIAD program, sponsored by the National Sheriffs’ Association (NSA), the International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP) and the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP), is one such effort. This effort recognizes that senior citizens have the same fundamental desire as other members of our society to live freely, without fear or restriction due to the criminal element, and that the state should seek to expand efforts to reduce crime against this growing and uniquely vulnerable segment of our population.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is the intent of the Legislature, therefore, to promote a coordinated effort among law enforcement and social services agencies to stem the tide of violence against senior citizens and to support media and non-media strategies aimed at increasing both public understanding of the problem and the senior citizens’ skills in preventing crime against themselves and their property, and to address the problem of crime against senior citizens in a systematic and effective manner by promoting and expanding collaborative crime prevention programs, such as the TRIAD model, that assist law enforcement agencies and senior citizens in implementing specific strategies for crime prevention, victim assistance, citizen involvement and public education.

          For purposes of this chapter, “TRIAD Program” means the triad cooperative model developed by the American Association of Retired Persons, the National Sheriff’s Association and the International Association of Chiefs of Police, which calls for the participation of the sheriff, at least one (1) police chief, at least one (1) member of the American Association of Retired Persons and a representative of at least one (1) senior citizens’ organization within a county and may include participation by coalitions of law enforcement, victims’ services and senior citizen advocate organizations. If there is not both a sheriff and a police chief in a county or if the sheriff or a police chief does not participate, a TRIAD may include in the place of the sheriff or police chief other members of the criminal justice system, such as a district attorney.
