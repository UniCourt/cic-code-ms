   Campaign contribution to member of Mississippi Public Service Commission fit comfortably within definition of “gift” within meaning of this section, a gift being something voluntary transferred by one person to another without compensation, and state law makes acceptance of such money illegal because of its source. Court could not conceive of campaign contributions that fall outside enormous scope of statute’s categories of “any gift, pass, money or any other benefits whatsoever”. United States v.

       Under this section, a vendor of goods which sells to the public and also makes sales to a public utility, and which is not interested as an owner, agent or representative of a public utility or acting for an owner, agent or representative of a public utility, may legally contribute to a candidate for the MPSC.

       Under this section, an attorney who performs services for a public utility, is a person “. . . interested as a . . . representative . . .” of the public utility and consequently is an individual who is prohibited from making, either directly or indirectly, a contribution to a candidate for the MPSC whether or not that attorney has multiple clients.

   In an employee’s suit alleging that four officials of the Mississippi Public Service Commission violated the employee’s constitutional rights by requiring him to resign before running for the office of Public Service Commissioner and by refusing to reinstate him after he lost the election, the officials were entitled to qualified immunity; because Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t77c01s77-1-25" target="_self">77-1-25</a></cite> clearly prevented the employee from running for the office of Commissioner, the officials did not violate any of the employee’s rights by not allowing him to take a leave of absence.

Mississippi Public Service Com. v. Illinois C. R. Co., 235 Miss. 46, 108 So. 2d 573, 1959 Miss. LEXIS 401 (Miss. 1959).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the essential facts are not contradicted, the reviewing court may determine as a matter of law whether they are sufficient to support the order of the commission. Citizens of Stringer v. Gulf, M. & O. R. Co., 229 Miss. 1, 90 So. 2d 25, 1956 Miss. LEXIS 580 (Miss. 1956).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where it was uncontradicted that the continuance of an agency station in an unincorporated community would be at a substantial financial loss and result in economic waste, and it clearly appeared that the substitution of a prepay station would adequately meet the reasonable requirements of public convenience and necessity, the order of the Mississippi Public Service Commission refusing to allow the railroad to substitute prepay service was not supported by substantial evidence. Citizens of Stringer v. Gulf, M. & O. R. Co., 229 Miss. 1, 90 So. 2d 25, 1956 Miss. LEXIS 580 (Miss. 1956).
      </p>
      <p>
       Findings of fact of the public service commission are prima facie correct, and the reviewing court cannot disturb the findings, and substitute its judgment for that of the commission, where there is any substantial basis in evidence for such findings or where the ruling of the commission is not capricious or arbitrary. Tri-State Transit Co. v. Dixie Greyhound Lines, Inc., 197 Miss. 37, 19 So. 2d 441, 1944 Miss. LEXIS 273 (Miss. 1944); Citizens of Stringer v. Gulf, M. & O. R. Co., 229 Miss. 1, 90 So. 2d 25, 1956 Miss. LEXIS 580 (Miss. 1956).
      </p>
      <p>
       The rule or principle that reviewing court cannot disturb the findings and substitute its judgment for that of the commission, where there is substantial evidence in support thereof, applies with respect to a cross-appeal from judgment of circuit court reversing judgment of the public service commission. Tri-State Transit Co. v. Dixie Greyhound Lines, Inc., 197 Miss. 37, 19 So. 2d 441, 1944 Miss. LEXIS 273 (Miss. 1944).
      </p>
      <p>
       Order of public service commission denying an intrastate certificate to a motor carrier, which had an interstate certificate of public necessity and convenience, over the same route, where competing carrier had both intrastate as well as interstate certificates, was supported by substantial evidence, although circuit court had reversed the order to the extent of granting the certificate until the expiration of six months after the end of the war. Tri-State Transit Co. v. Dixie Greyhound Lines, Inc., 197 Miss. 37, 19 So. 2d 441, 1944 Miss. LEXIS 273 (Miss. 1944).
      </p>
      <p>
       In determining question whether substantial evidence supported findings of public service commission, the supreme court, on appeal from judgment of circuit court reversing judgment of public service commission, is controlled by its own consideration of the testimony before the commission, and not by the opinion of the circuit court. Tri-State Transit Co. v. Dixie Greyhound Lines, Inc., 197 Miss. 37, 19 So. 2d 441, 1944 Miss. LEXIS 273 (Miss. 1944).
      </p>
      <p>
       That a court of competent jurisdiction has the power to review any order made by an administrative commission to determine whether it is supported by substantial evidence, or is surely arbitrary and capricious, beyond the power of the commission to make, or violate some statutory or constitutional right of an interested party, is recognized by this section [Code 1942, § 7815].Dixie Greyhound Lines, Inc. v. Mississippi Public Service Com., 190 Miss. 704, 1 So. 2d 489, 200 So. 579, 1941 Miss. LEXIS 60 (Miss. 1941).
      </p>
      <p>
       Party attacking order of railroad commission has burden of showing unreasonableness by clear and satisfactory evidence. Mississippi R. Com. v. Mobile & O. R. Co., 115 Miss. 101, 75 So. 778, 1917 Miss. LEXIS 190 (Miss. 1917).
      </p>
      <p>
       The findings of the railroad commission, under this section [Code 1942, § 7815], are not final, but subject to judicial review. Western Union Tel. Co. v. Mississippi R. Com., 74 Miss. 80, 21 So. 15, 1896 Miss. LEXIS 145 (Miss. 1896).

The commission may grant a supersedeas bond on any appeal, in such penalty and with such surety thereon as it may deem sufficient, and may, during the pendency of any appeal, at any time, require the increase of any such supersedeas bond or additional securities thereon. The judge of the Circuit Court of Hinds County may on petition therefor by any party entitled to an appeal, presented to him within six (6) months of the date of the final finding, order, or judgment of the commission appealed from, award a writ of supersedeas to any such final finding, order, or judgment of the commission, upon the filing of a supersedeas bond in an amount to be fixed by said judge. All appeal bonds for the payment of costs, and all supersedeas bonds, shall be made payable to the state and may be enforced in the name of the state by motion or other legal proceedings or remedy in any circuit court of this state having jurisdiction of a motion or action on such bond, and the process and proceedings thereon shall be as provided by law upon bonds of like character required and taken by any court of this state. Such circuit court may render and enter like judgments upon such bonds as may, by law, be rendered and entered upon bonds of like character, and process of execution shall issue upon such judgments, and may be levied and executed as provided by law in other cases.

While the line of authority between the local authorities and the Public Service Commission’s regulation of railroads is not specifically defined by statute, there is a legislative intent that the Public Service Commission has general jurisdiction over common carrier railroads with an official responsibility to the public to see that railroads are operated safely, efficiently, and for the public’s benefit. This responsibility which the Commission has to the entire state manifestly cannot be frustrated by any local ordinance or order, whether by a city or county. Hence, any reasonableness test of a zoning ordinance which applies to a railroad must take into account the obligation of the company to serve efficiently and economically all sections of the state dependent on it for services.

       Whenever the commission, an employee of the commission or any employee of the public utilities staff has reason to believe that a willful and knowing violation of any statute administered by the commission or any regulation or any order of the commission has occurred, the commission may cause a written complaint to be served upon the alleged violator or violators. The complaint shall specify the provisions of such statute, regulation or order alleged to be violated and the facts alleged to constitute a violation thereof and shall require that the alleged violator appear before the commission at a time and place specified in the notice and answer the charges complained of. The time of appearance before the commission shall not be less than twenty (20) days from the date of the service of the complaint, unless the commission finds that the public convenience or necessity requires that such hearing be held at an earlier date.

       The commission shall afford an opportunity for a fair hearing to the alleged violator or violators at the time and place specified in the complaint. On the basis of the evidence produced at the hearing, the commission shall make findings of fact and conclusions of law and enter its order, which in its opinion will be in the best interests of the consuming public. Failure to appear at any such hearing, without prior authorization to do so from the commission, may result in the commission finding the alleged violator guilty of the charges complained of by default, and at such time an order may be entered, including the assessment of a penalty. The commission shall give written notice of such order to the alleged violator and to such other persons as shall have appeared at the hearing or made written request for notice of the order. The commission may assess such penalties as provided in subsection (3) of this section.

       Any person found by the commission, pursuant to a hearing or by default as provided in this section, violating any statute administered by the commission, or any regulation or order of the commission in pursuance thereof, shall be subject to a civil penalty of not more than Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000.00) for each violation, to be assessed and collected by the commission. Each day that a violation continues shall constitute a separate violation. In lieu of, or in addition to, the monetary penalty, the commission, for any violation by a certificate holder, may impose a penalty in accordance with Section 77-3-21, Mississippi Code of 1972, if it finds that the violator is not rendering reasonably adequate service. Appeals from the imposition of the civil penalty may be taken to the Circuit Court of the First Judicial District of Hinds County in the same manner as appeals from orders of the commission constituting judicial findings.

     </h3>
     <p>
      There is hereby established a Public Utilities Staff, which shall be completely separate and independent from the Public Service Commission and the Public Service Commission staff. Such staff shall consist of the personnel positions of the executive director, the economic and planning division, legal division, engineering division and accounting division with a State Personnel Board organizational code of twenty thousand (20,000) or larger which were formerly authorized and appropriated under the provisions of Section 77-3-8, Mississippi Code of 1972. The executive director shall establish the organizational structure of the staff, and shall have the authority to create units as deemed appropriate to carry out the responsibilities of the staff. The Public Utilities Staff shall represent the broad interests of the State of Mississippi by balancing the respective concerns of the residential, commercial or industrial ratepayers, and the state and its agencies and departments, and the public utilities. The staff shall consist of a sufficient number of professional, administrative, technical, clerical and other personnel as may be necessary for the staff to perform its duties and responsibilities as hereinafter provided. All such personnel shall be competitively appointed by the executive director and shall be dismissed only for cause in accordance with the rules and regulations of the State Personnel Board. All equipment, supplies, records and any funds appropriated by the Legislature to the Public Service Commission for and on behalf of the Public Utilities Staff shall be transferred to such staff on September 1, 1990. The Public Utilities Staff shall be funded separately from the Mississippi Public Service Commission. Any appropriated funds to the Public Utilities Staff shall be maintained in an account separate from any funds of the Public Service Commission and shall never be commingled therewith.
     </p>
     <p>
      Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter to the contrary, the personnel positions of the data processing division and the gas pipeline safety division of the Public Utilities Staff shall be the Public Service Commission staff positions authorized under Section 77-3-8, and shall be under the control and supervision of the Public Service Commission from and after March 15, 1991. However, the Public Service Commission staff shall continue to provide at no cost administrative support in the nature of data processing and bookkeeping to the Public Utilities Staff in order to avoid duplication of services.

       Mississippi Public Service Commission did not have jurisdiction to regulate the rates charged to ratepayers on cities’ gas-distribution systems because rate-setting jurisdiction was not conferred on the Commission over certain public-utility systems that were either owned or operated by municipalities, except as to extension of utilities greater than one mile outside corporate boundaries after March 29, 1956.

   Although Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t77c03s77-3-1" target="_self">77-3-1</a></cite> (Rev. 2000) provided an exemption for municipalities from the Mississippi Public Service Commission regulation for areas within one mile of their corporate limits, the statute did not grant municipalities the exclusive right to operate utilities within one mile of their corporate border nor did the statute preclude a private utility from operating within one mile of a municipality’s city limits. A.B.E., Inc. v. City of Oxford, 830 So. 2d 615, 2002 Miss. LEXIS 227 (Miss. 2002).

       Although a town does not need a certificate of public convenience and necessity in order to provide water service within one mile of its boundaries, a town is not thereby given an exclusive right to provide utility services within one mile of its boundaries.

      </p>

       Certificate of public convenience and necessity issued by Public Service Commission (PSC) to utility grants exclusive right to operate in designated area, so long as utility is capable of providing adequate service to customers in area covered by certificate.

      <p>
       Although a city was exempt from certification and rate regulation, this section did not permit an exempt municipal utility to intrude into a regulated utility’s certified area; thus, the trial court properly enjoined a municipally-owned utility from extending electric service into newly annexed areas of the city.

Canton, 274 So. 2d 665, 1973 Miss. LEXIS 1606 (Miss. 1973).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although a municipal electric utility is not subject to the regulation of the Public Service Commission, and the Commission has no authority to issue a cease and desist order against the municipality, as it may do against regulated utilities, nevertheless, the right to operate a public electric utility under the authority of a certificate of public convenience and necessity issued by the Public Service Commission is a valuable right which may be protected by the courts.

       Mississippi Public Service Commission (MPSC) lacks statutory authority to adopt any rule regulating the rates of nonprofit water utility associations and corporations. Accordingly, MPSC lacked authority to adopt a rule requiring utilities to waive utility deposits for certified domestic violence victims for a period of 60 days. Miss. Rural Water Ass'n v. Miss.

   Definition of “rate” encompasses the typical usage of the term “rate,” the unit cost of a service supplied to the public by a utility, and the “formula or method” by which the compensation is determined; when read in conjunction with this definition, Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t77c03s77-3-5" target="_self">77-3-5</a></cite> prohibits the Mississippi Public Service Commission from regulating the amounts charged by nonprofit public utilities and the formula used to calculate that amount and any rules or regulations related to this process.

      </p>
      <p>
       Mississippi Public Service Commission (MPSC), which adopted a rule requiring utilities to waive utility deposits for certified domestic violence victims, did not have statutory authority to regulate the rates of nonprofit water associations because the Public Utilities Act included customer deposits in the definition of the term “rate,” prohibited the MPSC from making rules that regulated the rates of a rural water association’s members.

   Mississippi Public Service Commission (PSC) properly denied a telecommunications company’s requested rate increase for telephone services on the ground that the company failed to provide evidence that the rate increase was just and reasonable pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t77c03s77-3-33ol11" target="_self">77-3-33(1)</a></cite> because the PSC’s interpretation of Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t77c03s77-3-35ol14" target="_self">77-3-35(4)</a></cite> was consistent with the plain language of the statute, and the PSC retained full regulatory authority over switched access service and single-line flat rate voice communication service; if a “retail rate” was somehow different from a tariff “rate,” as the company suggested, it was a distinction without a difference. Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t77c03s77-3-3ol1e" target="_self">77-3-3(e)</a></cite> (Rev. 2000) included all forms of rates within its definition. Bellsouth Telcomms. v. Miss.

       In the case of a billing error by an electric company, the circuit court did not err in denying the customer’s motion to stay the proceedings and by holding that the Mississippi Public Service Commission lacked jurisdiction because the circuit court correctly classified the dispute as one involving rates as the electric company’s failure to apply the correct multiplier to the customer’s account pertained to the formula or method by which its charges could be determined; and because the electric company sought compensation for a charge related to a service, product, or commodity it supplied the customer.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Notwithstanding any other provision of law, and subject only to the limitations imposed in this chapter and in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, the Public Service Commission shall have exclusive original jurisdiction over the intrastate business and property of public utilities and, for purposes of clarification of the existing scope of said exclusive original jurisdiction, such exclusive original jurisdiction extends, but is not limited to: the establishment of retail rates; challenges, including customer complaints, to the amount of a retail rate or customer bill or whether such rate is just and reasonable; and challenges to the validity or accuracy of rates charged by a public utility, or to the accuracy or reliability of information submitted to the Public Service Commission by a public utility or other person in support of or in opposition to a proposed or approved rate, regardless of the legal theory upon which any such challenge is made. However, the commission shall not have jurisdiction over the production and gathering of natural gas or the sale of natural gas in or within the vicinity of the field where produced, or over the facilities and equipment utilized in any such operations, including, but not limited to, such facilities as separators, scrubbers and gasoline plants of all types. Further, the commission shall not have jurisdiction over the governance, management or other internal affairs of entities as described by paragraphs (b) and (c) below. Moreover, the commission shall not have jurisdiction to regulate the rates for the sales and/or distribution:
     </p>
     <p>
      Of gas, water, electricity or sewage disposal services by municipalities to such persons as said municipalities are authorized by law to serve;

     </p>
     <p>
      Of water or sewage disposal service by nonprofit corporations or associations where the governing body of such corporation or association is elected by the consumers thereof or appointed by the county board of supervisors; or

       Mississippi Public Service Commission (MPSC) lacks statutory authority to adopt any rule regulating the rates of nonprofit water utility associations and corporations. Accordingly, MPSC lacked authority to adopt a rule requiring utilities to waive utility deposits for certified domestic violence victims for a period of 60 days. Miss. Rural Water Ass'n v. Miss. PSC, 222 So.3d 288, 2017 Miss. LEXIS 234 (Miss. 2017).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Definition of “rate” encompasses the typical usage of the term “rate,” the unit cost of a service supplied to the public by a utility, and the “formula or method” by which the compensation is determined; when read in conjunction with this definition, Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t77c03s77-3-5" target="_self">77-3-5</a></cite> prohibits the Mississippi Public Service Commission from regulating the amounts charged by nonprofit public utilities and the formula used to calculate that amount and any rules or regulations related to this process. Miss. Rural Water Ass'n v. Miss. PSC, 222 So.3d 288, 2017 Miss. LEXIS 234 (Miss. 2017).
      </p>
      <p>
       Mississippi Public Service Commission (MPSC), which adopted a rule requiring utilities to waive utility deposits for certified domestic violence victims, did not have statutory authority to regulate the rates of nonprofit water associations because the Public Utilities Act included customer deposits in the definition of the term “rate,” prohibited the MPSC from making rules that regulated the rates of a rural water association’s members. Miss. Rural Water Ass'n v. Miss. PSC, 222 So.3d 288, 2017 Miss. LEXIS 234 (Miss. 2017).
      </p>
      <p>
       The public service commission had jurisdiction to settle a dispute regarding whether an agreement between the parties conveyed to the defendant city only that portion of a tract to be utilized as a shopping mall or the right to take the entire tract. Arnold Line Water Ass'n v. Mississippi PSC, 744 So. 2d 246, 1999 Miss. LEXIS 116 (Miss. 1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       Only the Mississippi Public Service Commission may initially decide a matter relating to the regulation of intrastate public utility activity; thus, a circuit court had no jurisdiction to decide that a shopping mall had improperly acted as a public utility. Singing River Mall Co. v. Mark Fields, Inc., 599 So. 2d 938, 1992 Miss. LEXIS 135 (Miss. 1992).

       The Mississippi Public Service Commission has the duty, authority, and therefore jurisdiction, over public utilities who come into the state of Mississippi and attempt to invoke the statutory right of eminent domain. American Tel. & Tel. Co. v. Purcell Co., 606 So. 2d 93, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 790 (Miss. 1990).

   A New York corporation which provided long distance telephone service across the country was required to comply with state law and, as a condition precedent to the exercise of the statutory right of eminent domain pursuant to §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t77c09s77-9-717" target="_self">77-9-717</a></cite>, to submit to the jurisdiction of the Mississippi Public Service Commission and obtain the following: (1) a determination that the telephone company qualified as an entity to which the legislature had granted the power of eminent domain pursuant to §§<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.11.html#t11c27s11-27-1" target="_blank">11-27-1</a></cite> and<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t77c09s77-9-717" target="_self">77-9-717</a></cite>; (2) a determination that the telephone company had complied with state law in invoking the statutory power of eminent domain; and (3) a certificate of public convenience and necessity for the particular taking in question. American Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. v. Purcell Co., 606 So. 2d 93, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 790 (Miss. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Public Service Commission’s (PSC) adoption of a performance evaluation plan for determining a power company’s rates through a formula that was subject to quarterly adjustments of costs of utility services based on revenue and expense figures supplied by the utility violated the state’s public policy and statutory scheme because the plan was a complete abrogation by the PSC of its statutory responsibilities and a relinquishment of control to the very entity the PSC is charged by law to regulate. State ex rel. Pittman v. Mississippi Public Service Com., 538 So. 2d 367, 1989 Miss. LEXIS 12 (Miss. 1989).
      </p>
      <p>
       Terms of contract between telephone company and its subscribers are supplied by tariffs which have been duly filed and approved by Mississippi Public Service Commission, and claim alleging wrongful disconnection of telephone services must necessarily involve breach of subscriber’s tariff or contract. South Cent. Bell v. Epps, 509 So. 2d 886, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2594 (Miss. 1987).

       The legislation establishing the public service commission does not empower it to regulate the rates of an interstate pipeline company for direct sales of natural gas for industrial use.

       In the case of a billing error by an electric company, the circuit court did not err in denying the customer’s motion to stay the proceedings and by holding that the Mississippi Public Service Commission lacked jurisdiction because the circuit court correctly classified the dispute as one involving rates as the electric company’s failure to apply the correct multiplier to the customer’s account pertained to the formula or method by which its charges could be determined; and because the electric company sought compensation for a charge related to a service, product, or commodity it supplied the customer.

     <ol>
      <li id="t77c03s77-3-10ol11">
       All public utilities, the rates of which are subject to regulation under the provisions of this chapter, shall file with the commission copies of contracts, wherein the consideration therefor is One Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) or more, with any holding, managing, operating, constructing, engineering or purchasing company, which is an affiliate of or a subsidiary of, such public utility, and when requested by the commission, copies of such contracts wherein the consideration therefor is less than One Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) and copies of contracts with any person selling service of any kind. The commission may, after hearing on reasonable notice, disallow any payment to be capitalized or included as an operating cost of the public utility in the fixing of rates or as an asset in fixing a rate base under any such contract if it is found by the commission to be unjust or unreasonable, or made for the purpose or with the effect of concealing, unreasonably transferring or unreasonably dissipating the earnings of the public utility. Provided, however, that in the case of a public utility with fewer than twenty-five thousand (25,000) customers, this subsection shall apply only to such contracts as the commission shall request such public utility to file.

      <li id="t77c03s77-3-10ol12">
       No public utility as described in subsection (1) of this section shall pay any fees, commission or compensation of any description whatsoever to any affiliated or subsidiary holding, managing, operating, constructing, engineering or purchasing company for services rendered or to be rendered without first filing copies of all agreements and contracts therefor with the commission. The commission may, after hearing on reasonable notice, disallow any such payment to be capitalized or included as an operating cost of the public utility in the fixing of rates or as an asset in fixing a rate base under such agreement or contract if it is found by the commission to be unjust or unreasonable. Provided, however, that this subsection shall not apply to motor carriers of passengers.
      </li>
      <li id="t77c03s77-3-10ol13">
       The public service commission staff, upon direction of the commission, shall have full power and authority to investigate any such contract, arrangement, purchase or sale, and no payment disallowed by the commission shall be capitalized or included as an operating cost of the public utility in the fixing of rates or as an asset in fixing a rate base. If, in any such investigation, the public utility or affiliate shall unreasonably refuse to comply with any request of the commission for information with respect to relevant accounts and records, whether of such public utility or any affiliate, any portion of which may be applicable to any transaction under investigation, so that such parts thereof as the commission may deem material may be made part of the record, such refusal shall justify the commission in disapproving the transaction under investigation and disallowing payments in pursuance thereof, to be capitalized or included as an operating cost of the public utility in the fixing of rates or as an asset in fixing a rate base.

       If municipally owned plant, project or development, route, line or system or extension thereof is contemplated in area which has been certificated to another utility, certificate authorizing same must first be obtained from Mississippi Public Service Commission. Leslie, July 15, 1992, A.G. Op. #92-0512.

       Since a certificate of public convenience and necessity granted by the Public Service Commission authorizes the intrastate sale of water to the public, the City of Southaven may provide water to a municipal fire station in the Pleasant Hill Water Association certificated area.
   Wise, September 25, 1998, A.G. Op. #98-0539.

       Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality Permit Board’s decision to grant groundwater withdrawal permits to a county utility authority did not violate a utility company’s rights because the permits did not allow the utility authority to sell in the company’s certificated area; the utility authority intended to expand its regional water system by building wells on land it owned in the company’s certificated area and selling water to customers outside of the company’s certificated area.

       The commission shall issue a certificate of convenience and necessity to any person engaged in the construction or operation of such equipment or facility as is mentioned in subsection (1) of Section 77-3-11 on March 29, 1956, for the construction or operation then being conducted, without requiring proof that public convenience and necessity will be served by such construction or operation, and without further proceedings, if application for such certificate is made to the commission within six (6) months after March 29, 1956. Any utility covered by this chapter which has heretofore been under the jurisdiction of the commission shall, upon application within six (6) months of March 29, 1956, be issued a certificate authorizing it to conduct operations and make extensions within any area covered by its service area map or maps on file with the commission on March 29, 1956.

The commission may issue a certificate of public convenience and necessity, or refuse to issue the same or issue it for the establishment or construction of a portion only of the contemplated plant, route, line or system, or extension thereof, or for the partial exercise only of such right or privilege, and may attach to the exercise of the rights granted by the certificate such reasonable terms and conditions as to time or otherwise as, in its judgment, the public convenience, necessity and protection may require, and may forfeit such certificate after issuance for noncompliance with its terms, or provide therein for an ipso facto forfeiture of the same for failure to exercise the rights granted within the time fixed by the certificate. However, nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring such certificate for a municipally owned plant, project or development, route, line or system or extension thereof in areas within one (1) mile of the corporate boundaries which are not certificated to another utility, and nothing in this chapter or other provision of law shall be construed as allowing a municipally owned plant, project or development, route, line or system or extension thereof in areas certificated to another utility.

The commission shall, after issuance of a certificate for facilities estimated to cost Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000.00) or more or estimated to cost an amount equal to one percent (1%) of the rate base allowed by the commission in the utility’s last rate case, whichever is greater, assign the public utilities staff to monitor such projects, to inspect periodically construction in progress, and to report to the commission any variances or deviations as found, if any, and to file progress reports thereon with the commission. Such public utility shall file a similar report with the commission at such times and in such form as the commission shall require, including any substantial changes in plans and specifications, cost allocations, construction schedule and funds available to complete the project.

       A utility has the express right and duty to provide service within its certificated area, and to allow invasion of a certificated area because of a desire of a customer to be served by another utility would cause wasteful duplication and undermine the purpose of the Public Utility Act. Ford v. State, 218 So. 2d 707, 1969 Miss. LEXIS 1611 (Miss. 1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the legislature had the right and power to determine the public necessity, it also had the power to delegate that function to the public service commission. Mississippi Power Co. v. East Mississippi Electric Power Asso., 249 Miss. 869, 164 So. 2d 479, 1964 Miss. LEXIS 442 (Miss. 1964).

       An award of a certificate of public convenience and necessity by the Public Service Commission to an electric utility is an exclusive permit to furnish electricity to the persons using electricity in the area designated and certificated to the utility so long as the utility holding the certificate is capable and willing to provide electric energy to the persons within the area. Capital Electric Power Asso. v. Canton, 274 So. 2d 665, 1973 Miss. LEXIS 1606 (Miss. 1973).
      </p>
      <p>
       It is unnecessary, as a prerequisite to the grant of a certificate of convenience and necessity to serve an undeveloped area, that there had been requests for service in the area. East Mississippi Electric Power Asso. v. Mississippi Power Co., 254 Miss. 832, 182 So. 2d 925, 1966 Miss. LEXIS 1581 (Miss. 1966).
      </p>
      <p>
       The commission should issue certificates of convenience and of necessity on an area basis in the usual case. Mississippi Power & Light Co. v. Delta Electric Power Asso., 252 Miss. 832, 174 So. 2d 356, 1965 Miss. LEXIS 1150 (Miss. 1965).

      </p>
      <p>
       The public service commission was authorized to grant to an electric power association a certificate of public convenience and necessity on an area basis rather than a facility basis, and the exclusiveness of the electric power association’s right in the areas for which a certificate has been awarded depends upon whether it renders adequate service. Mississippi Power Co. v. East Mississippi Electric Power Asso., 244 Miss. 40, 140 So. 2d 286, 1962 Miss. LEXIS 421 (Miss. 1962).
      </p>
      <p>
       The action of the public service commission in granting a certificate of public convenience and necessity cannot be overturned if it is supported by substantial evidence, is not arbitrary or capricious, or beyond its power to make, and does not violate some constitutional right. Mississippi Power & Light Co. v. Blake, 236 Miss. 207, 109 So. 2d 657, 1959 Miss. LEXIS 310 (Miss. 1959); Mississippi Power Co. v.

      </h4>
      <p>
       A certificate of public convenience and necessity issued to an electric power association, under the so-called “Grandfather Clause” under this section, gave it the exclusive right to furnish electric energy to patrons within the area designated in the certificate and the electric power association was entitled to an injunction against a municipality enjoining it from invading the certificated area. Capital Electric Power Asso. v. Canton, 274 So. 2d 665, 1973 Miss. LEXIS 1606 (Miss. 1973).
      </p>
      <p>
       “Grandfather” certificates awarded under this section are on an area, not a facility basis, and the policy of “territorial integrity” of service areas has clearly been recognized. Ford v. State, 218 So. 2d 707, 1969 Miss. LEXIS 1611 (Miss. 1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   A grandfather certificate for a wholesale electric transmission line is a privilege, regulated and controlled by the state within due process limitations and may be terminated when the needs of the public demand it. Mississippi Power Co. v. South Mississippi Electric Power Asso., 254 Miss. 754, 183 So. 2d 163, 1966 Miss. LEXIS 1574 (Miss.), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">385 U.S. 823</cite>, <cite class="s_court">87 S. Ct. 51</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">17 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 60, 1966 U.S. LEXIS 655 (U.S. 1966).

       Under peculiar and special circumstances the commission may authorize the continuance of operations on a facility basis as they were being served on the effective date of the Act.

       Although a municipal electric utility is not subject to the regulation of the Public Service Commission, and the Commission has no authority to issue a cease and desist order against the municipality, as it may do against regulated utilities, nevertheless, the right to operate a public electric utility under the authority of a certificate of public convenience and necessity issued by the Public Service Commission is a valuable right which may be protected by the courts.

       The fact that a college had been a customer of one utility company for many years would go only to the question of “grandfather” rights of the company and not to the right of the college to serve itself by transmission of electricity on lines owned by it within the certificated area of another utility after purchase of the electricity from the first company at a point outside the second company’s certificated area.

      <p>
       The fact that electricity purchased by a college was metered in one utility company’s service area, and the fact that it is transmitted across a continuous tract of land uncrossed by any public street or road does not give the college and the utility company the right to encroach upon the exclusive service area of a second utility and thus deprive it of a valuable property right without due process of law.

       The fact that a college, the consumer of electricity, is not a “public utility” within the meaning of the Public Utility Act does not affect the authority of the commission to issue a cease and desist order against a public utility which is furnishing the energy consumed within the certificated area of a second utility.

       The commission shall develop, publicize and keep current an analysis of the long-range needs for expansion of facilities for the generation of electricity in Mississippi, including its estimate of the probable future growth of the use of electricity, the probable needed generation reserves, the extent, size, mix and general location of generating plants and arrangements for pooling power to the extent not regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and other arrangements with other utilities and energy suppliers to achieve maximum efficiencies for the benefit of the people of Mississippi, and shall consider such analysis in acting upon any petition by any utility for construction. Each public utility engaged in the generation, transmission and distribution of electric energy shall, upon request of the commission, submit to the commission its forecasts and plans for the addition of generating capacity planned by the utility for an ensuing five-year period and shall furnish to the commission such documents and proof with respect to the need therefor as the commission may reasonably require. In considering these analyses and forecasts, the commission shall consult with the University Research Center, the utilities commissions or comparable agencies of neighboring states, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and other agencies having relevant information and/or duties and responsibilities in this area, and particularly with the Department of Economic and Community Development with reference to the accomplishment of the Mississippi Energy Plan provided for in Section 57-39-11, Mississippi Code of 1972.

      <li id="t77c03s77-3-14ol15">
       The commission shall maintain an ongoing review of such construction as it proceeds, and the applicant shall submit at such times as the commission shall require during construction a progress report and any revisions in the cost estimates for the construction.

       The certification requirements of this section shall not apply to persons who construct an electric generating facility primarily for that person’s own use and not for the primary purpose of producing electricity, heat or steam for sale to or for the public for compensation; and the commission may provide for exemption from certification requirements for cogeneration facilities and small standby facilities; provided, however, that such persons shall, nevertheless, be required to report to the commission the proposed construction of such a facility before beginning construction thereof.

       A water and/or sewer utility certificated by the Public Service Commission which has not operated under a previously expired franchise granted by a municipality is not subject to the 2% fee imposed by Section 77-3-17 upon the annexation of all or a portion of its certificated area into a municipality’s corporate limits.

       § 77-3-19.
    Applicant for certificate must obtain a municipal franchise.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Notwithstanding any provision in this article to the contrary, in any case where a utility is located and operates, or proposed to locate and operate in a municipality where streets and other public places are essential to such location and operation, no certificate of convenience and necessity shall be issued thereasto without prior franchise granted by the municipality. Such franchise shall not contain any provision conflicting with or repugnant to the exclusive jurisdiction of the commission to regulate rates and services of the utilities as provided in this article. Applicants for certificates of convenience and necessity shall attach to their applications true and correct copies of franchises issued to them by such municipality as the application may embrace. The commission is authorized so to amend such franchise as to exclude and remove therefrom any provision in conflict with or repugnant to the exclusive jurisdiction of the commission over rates and services and which shall in any way fix or affect rates. Should any municipality arbitrarily refuse to grant a franchise or provide for an election for a franchise as provided by law to a utility now operating within said municipality within ninety (90) days after application for said franchise is made, then the utility may obtain a certificate of convenience and necessity without the necessity of first obtaining a franchise. The commission shall so issue said certificate of convenience and necessity upon proper showing by the utility that said franchise is being arbitrarily withheld.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the event the commission shall rule that a franchise is being arbitrarily withheld and shall issue a certificate of necessity as hereinabove mentioned, the utility obtaining said certificate of convenience and necessity shall not be required to pay to said municipality the two percent (2%) provided for in Section 77-3-17 until such a franchise has been granted to said utility.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the case of a public utility as defined in subparagraph (iii) of paragraph (d) of Section 77-3-3 which has heretofore been under the jurisdiction of the commission and has its service area maps on file with the commission on March 29, 1956, under such reasonable rules and regulations as the commission shall prescribe, the commission is authorized to issue to such utility a certificate of convenience and necessity without requiring such utility to first obtain a municipal franchise as herein provided.

    Hearing on adequacy of service afforded by certificate holder.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The commission may, after a hearing had upon due notice, make such findings as may be supported by proof as to whether any utility holding a certificate under the provisions of this article is rendering reasonably adequate service in any area covered by such utility’s certificate. In the event the commission finds that such utility is not rendering reasonably adequate service the commission may enter an order specifying in what particulars such utility has failed to render reasonably adequate service and order that such failure be corrected within a reasonable time, such time to be fixed in such order. If the utility so ordered to correct such a failure fails to comply with such order of the commission and the commission finds that cancellation of its certificate would be in the best interest of the consuming public served by the holder of the certificate, its certificate for the area affected may be revoked and cancelled by the commission.
     </p>
     <p>
      Prior to any municipality exercising the power of eminent domain as provided in Section 77-3-17, the commission shall determine that the certificate of public convenience and necessity granted to the utility pursuant to Section 77-3-13 for the service area wherein such facilities are located, shall be cancelled as provided in this section. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to include service for water and sewage.

    Placement of privately owned water and sewer systems in receivership; conditions.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      If the commission determines that any privately owned water and/or sewer system within its jurisdiction is unable or unwilling to adequately serve its customers or has been actually or effectively abandoned by its owner, or that its management is grossly inefficient, irresponsible or unresponsive to the needs of its customers, the commission or its designated representative may petition the Chancery Court of the First Judicial District of Hinds County or the chancery court of any county wherein the public utility does business for an order attaching the assets of the privately owned water and/or sewer system and placing such water and/or sewer system under the sole control and responsibility of a receiver. If the court determines that the petition is proper in all respects and finds, after a hearing thereon, the allegations contained in the petition are true, it shall order that the water and/or sewer system be placed in receivership. The court, in its discretion and in consideration of the recommendation of the commission or its designated representative, may appoint a receiver who shall be a responsible individual, partnership, corporation or political subdivision knowledgeable in water or sewer service affairs and who shall maintain control and responsibility for the operation and management of the affairs of such water and/or sewer system. The receiver shall operate the water and/or sewer system so as to preserve the assets of the water and/or sewer system and to serve the best interests of its customers. The receiver shall be compensated from the assets of the water and/or sewer system in an amount to be determined by the court.
     </p>
     <p>
      Control of and responsibility for the water and/or sewer system shall remain in the receiver until the court determines that it is in the best interests of the customers that the water and/or sewer system be returned to the owner, transferred to another owner or assumed by another water and/or sewer system or public service corporation. If the court, after hearing, determines that control of and responsibility for the affairs of the water and/or sewer system should not be returned to the legal owner thereof, the receiver may proceed to liquidate the assets of such water and/or sewer system in the manner provided by law.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mississippi laws and Mississippi Rules of Civil Procedure generally applicable to receivership shall govern receiverships created under this section.

     <p>
      In any county having a population of more than thirty-five thousand (35,000) but less than forty thousand (40,000), according to the most recent federal decennial census, any water or sewer system for which a finding is made under Section 49-17-44.1 or Section 77-3-22 by a court of competent jurisdiction that it is appropriate for a receiver to be appointed, the receiver shall give preference to a municipality within the county or to the governing authorities of the county in making any transfer of ownership of the water or sewer system. The term “preference,” as used in this section, means that no sale or transfer of the water or sewer system shall be approved by a court of competent jurisdiction or otherwise until two (2) years after the date of appointment of the receiver have elapsed. This right of preference may be waived by the local governmental entity given the preference under this section.

    Procedure for sale, assignment, lease or transfer of certificate.

     <p>
      It shall be lawful, under the conditions specified below, for public utilities to sell, assign, lease, transfer or otherwise dispose, including, without limitation, any change in control of (a) certificates of public convenience and necessity issued to them under the provisions of this article, or (b) any substantial part of its property necessary or useful in the performance of its duties to the public, including corporate stock that is not publicly traded.
     </p>
     <p>
      Whenever a purchase, lease, assignment or transfer is proposed, the utility or utilities or the person seeking authority therefor shall present an application to the commission in such form as may be prescribed by the commission. Thereupon the commission shall notify the applicant or applicants and other parties known to have a substantial interest in the proceedings of the time and place for a public hearing at least twenty (20) days prior thereto, unless the commission shall find that public convenience or necessity requires that such hearings be held at an earlier date. Notice of all such hearings shall be given the persons interested therein by mailing such notice to each public utility which may be affected by any order resulting therefrom and by publication in a newspaper having general circulation in the county or counties wherein the facilities or areas that are the subject of the application are located. If, after such hearing, the commission finds that the transaction proposed is in good faith, that the proposed assignee, lessee, purchaser or transferee, is fit and able properly to perform the public utility services authorized by such certificate and to comply with the lawful rules, regulations and requirements of the commission, and that the transaction is otherwise consistent with the public interest, it may enter an order approving and authorizing such sale, lease, assignment or transfer upon such terms and conditions as it shall find to be just and reasonable and with such modifications as it may prescribe. Whenever such a transaction involves facilities that are included in the rate base of a public utility, the commission shall include, as a prerequisite to its finding that the transaction is consistent with the public interest, a finding that, upon the consummation of the transaction proposed: (a)(i) the native load customers of the public utility will continue to have a first priority to the use and/or benefit of such facilities, or (ii) any loss of such first priority by native load customers to the use and/or benefit of such facilities is not contrary to the public interest; and (b) any native load customers served by any transmission facilities shall be served on the same basis as before the transaction.
     </p>
     <p>
      Notwithstanding any provision of this section to the contrary, the application may be granted as applied for without a hearing in uncontested cases; however, the commission may hear any uncontested case if it determines that the public interest will be served thereby.

    Accounts and depreciation reports of utilities.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The commission, by rules and regulations, after notice and hearing shall establish a system of accounts to be kept by the public utilities, the rates of which are subject to regulation by the provisions of this chapter, or the commission may classify said public utilities and establish a system of accounts for each class, and prescribe the manner in which such accounts shall be kept. Every such public utility shall keep and render to the commission in the manner and form prescribed by the commission uniform accounts of all its public utility operations. In the case of any public utility subject to regulation by a federal regulatory agency, compliance with the system of accounts prescribed for the particular class of utilities by such federal regulatory agency may be deemed sufficient compliance with the system prescribed by the commission; provided, however, that the commission may prescribe forms of books, accounts, records and memoranda covering information in addition to that required by such federal regulatory agency, where such do not conflict with those prescribed by such federal regulatory agency.
     </p>
     <p>
      The commission shall, after hearing held upon reasonable notice, from time to time ascertain, determine and by order fix the proper and adequate rates and methods of depreciation, amortization or depletion of the several classes of property of each such public utility or class of public utilities which is subject to regulation by the provisions of this chapter. The commission shall, after hearing had upon reasonable notice, by order in writing require every such public utility or class of public utilities, the rates of which are subject to regulation by the provisions of this chapter, to carry a reasonable and adequate depreciation account in accordance with such rates and methods and with such rules, regulations, orders and forms of accounts as the commission shall prescribe to the extent allowed by the Internal Revenue Code and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. Such public utility shall conform its depreciation accounts to the rates and methods so ascertained, determined and fixed. Such rates, methods and accounts shall be utilized uniformly and consistently throughout the rate setting and appeal proceedings.
     </p>
     <p>
      In determining the allocation of tax savings derived from application of such methods as liberalized depreciation and amortization and the investment tax credit, the commission shall equitably balance the interests of present and future customers and shall apportion such benefits between consumers and the public utilities accordingly, to the extent allowed by the Internal Revenue Code and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. Where any portion of the investment tax credit has been retained by a public utility, that same amount shall be deducted from the original cost of the facilities or other addition to the rate base to which the credit applied, to the extent allowed by the Internal Revenue Code and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the public utility is a member of an affiliated group that is eligible to file a consolidated income tax return, and if it is advantageous to the public utility to do so, income taxes shall be computed as though a consolidated return had been so filed and the utility had realized its fair share of the savings resulting from the consolidated return, unless it is shown to the satisfaction of the commission that it was reasonable to choose not to consolidate returns. The amount of income taxes saved by a consolidated group of which a public utility is a member by reason of the elimination in the consolidated return of the intercompany profit on purchases by the public utility from an affiliate shall be applied to reduce the cost of the property or services so purchased.
     </p>
     <p>
      The commission shall require such public utilities to maintain a reasonably close relationship between their reserve for depreciation and the actual accumulated depreciation, and if such reasonably close relationship is not present, the commission may and should review and make appropriate changes in the annual charge to operating expenses on account of depreciation.
     </p>
     <p>
      The commission, in determining the allowance for materials, equipment or services to be included in costs of operations for rate-making purposes, shall disallow any unreasonable profit made in the sale of materials, equipment or services supplied for any such public utility by any firm or corporation owned or controlled directly or indirectly by such utility or any affiliate, subsidiary, parent or holding company, associate or any corporation whose controlling stockholders are also controlling stockholders of such utility. The burden of proof shall be on the public utility to prove that no unreasonable profit is involved.

       No rate made, deposit or service charge demanded or received by any public utility shall exceed that which is just and reasonable. Such public utility, the rates of which are subject to regulation under the provisions of this article, may demand, collect and receive fair, just and reasonable rates for the services rendered or to be rendered by it to any person. Rates prescribed by the commission shall be such as to yield a fair rate of return to the utility furnishing service, upon the reasonable value of the property of the utility used or useful in furnishing service.

       Such utility shall furnish adequate, efficient and reasonable service, and may establish reasonable rules governing the conduct of its business and the conditions under which it shall be required to render service. The commission may, after hearing upon reasonable notice had, upon its own motion or upon complaint, ascertain and fix just and reasonable standards, regulations and practices of service which are to be furnished, imposed, observed and followed by all public utilities. The commission may require the service, rules and regulations of each public utility to be filed with the commission and subjected to its approval or to such changes therein as the commission reasonably may require.

       Public Service Commission erred in granting rate increases for a power company because it failed to comply with the Base Load Act and exceeded its authority granted by the Act; by stipulation, the Commission improperly deferred prudency hearings, which were a prerequisite to granting an increase in rates, and in the absence of prudency hearings, a rate could not be arbitrarily declared as fair, just, and reasonable.

       <p>
   Mississippi Public Service Commission (PSC) properly denied a telecommunications company’s requested rate increase for telephone services on the ground that the company failed to provide evidence that the rate increase was just and reasonable pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t77c03s77-3-33ol11" target="_self">77-3-33(1)</a></cite> because the PSC’s interpretation of Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t77c03s77-3-35ol14" target="_self">77-3-35(4)</a></cite> was consistent with the plain language of the statute, and the PSC retained full regulatory authority over switched access service and single-line flat rate voice communication service; the PSC did not improperly utilize a “rate of return” methodology to determine the company’s requested rate increase because it did not base its conclusion upon the lack of a cost of service study but merely listed several types of possible evidence the company could have submitted to support its rate increase request. Bellsouth Telcomms. v. Miss. PSC, 18 So.3d 199, 2009 Miss. LEXIS 378 (Miss. 2009).

   Mississippi Public Service Commission’s (Commission) order regarding an increase in rates for water service provided by the company was not supported by substantial evidence and was contrary to the manifest weight of the evidence, Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t77c03s77-3-59" target="_self">77-3-59</a></cite>; in fixing the fate, the Commission did not evidence its expertise by incorporating in its order cogent reasons for its decision based on a finding of facts pertinent to the particular inquiry before it.

      <p>
       Public Service Commission’s (PSC) denial of any rate increase to water utility was unsupported by substantial evidence and was contrary to manifest weight of the evidence in utility rate case, warranting reversal and remand to Commission for determination of amount of rate increase, despite Commission’s finding that utility was not providing adequate service; denial of rate increase was apparently punitive, utility had been receiving the same base monthly rate from customers for five years, experts testified that, despite competent economic management, existing base rate resulted in ongoing losses to utility, even intervenors conceded that utility was entitled to some increase, and services that utility provided were worth more than present base rate.

      <p>
       Public Service Commission’s (PSC) adoption of a performance evaluation plan for determining a power company’s rates through a formula that was subject to quarterly adjustments of costs of utility services based on revenue and expense figures supplied by the utility violated the state’s public policy and statutory scheme because the plan was a complete abrogation by the PSC of its statutory responsibilities and a relinquishment of control to the very entity the PSC is charged by law to regulate.

   On appeal by a public telephone company from an order of the Public Service Commission denying its proposed rate increase and allowing only a 10% overall increase, the chancellor properly exercised his discretion in finding, pursuant to §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t77c03s77-3-67ol14" target="_self">77-3-67(4)</a></cite>, that the denial of the higher increase sought by the telephone company was not supported by substantial evidence and was against the manifest weight of undisputed evidence, where the commission failed to fix a rate base as required by §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t77c03s77-3-43" target="_self">77-3-43</a></cite>, failed to fix a rate of return related to a legally formulated rate base as required by §§<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t77c03s77-3-33ol11" target="_self">77-3-33(1)</a></cite> and<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t77c03s77-3-39" target="_self">77-3-39</a></cite>, and arbitrarily fixed a 10% increase in rates when it appeared certain that compliance with that increase would result in a substantial loss; however, the chancellor erred in fixing a rate base and a rate of return, even though he arrived at amounts warranted by the proof, as §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t77c03s77-3-67ol14" target="_self">77-3-67(4)</a></cite> provides instead for a remand of the cause to the commission.

       Public service commission is not required by statute to use any particular formula in determining the reasonable value of property of a public utility for rate-making purposes, but the rates prescribed shall be such as to yield a fair rate of return upon the reasonable value of the property used and useful in furnishing service.

       Legislature, by enactment of Chapter 372, Laws of 1956, did not intend to impose upon the public service commission a requirement that the so-called “fair value” formula, with its emphasis upon reproduction cost new, be adopted as a measure of value, in determining the reasonable value of the utility’s property for rate-making purposes.

       The rate of a regulated public utility is not to be established by an arbitrary percentage of value of property used by such utility in its operation as sole basis for rate; rates should be fixed by taking into consideration value of such property along with such other factors as operating expenses, service on debt, capital costs and capital structure under prudent and economical management; and another fact for determination is whether revenue produced by such rate will enable utility to secure additional funds for expansion of facilities needed to serve its certificated area, and at the same time, enable it to maintain coverage required by law.

       The 2006 amendment, in (1), substituted “subsections (2) and (4)” for “subsection (2)” and made minor stylistic changes in the first sentence, and deleted “Utilities of the same type as herein covered, engaged in rendering interstate service to and from points and places in the state, shall file with the commission tariffs of rates and charges of such and rates and charges affecting service to or from points and places in the state. Also,” at the beginning of the third paragraph; deleted “Notwithstanding any provisions of this chapter or any other statute” at the beginning of (2)(b); deleted “Notwithstanding any other provisions of this article or any other statute to the contrary” at the beginning of (3)(a); and added (4).

       Power companies are not entitled or authorized to place a power line underground unless the customer agrees to pay for such. However, a power company may violate its standard of care if it fails to place high voltage lines underground at its own expense where it is feasible and practical. Ware v.

       A county board of supervisors in contracting with South Central Bell for telephone service for the county courthouse was not required to resort to public bidding where South Central Bell, as a public utility, was subject to state regulation and was only permitted to charge rates that had been fixed and determined according to the tariffs which it had been required to file with the Mississippi Public Service Commission; however, had the board chosen to purchase or lease equipment from an independent, unregulated equipment supplier, the contract would then have been required to be let on competitive bids because the protection afforded to the public by regulation of South Central Bell would then have been absent.

   Mississippi Public Service Commission (PSC) properly denied a telecommunications company’s requested rate increase for telephone services on the ground that the company failed to provide evidence that the rate increase was just and reasonable pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t77c03s77-3-33ol11" target="_self">77-3-33(1)</a></cite> because the PSC’s interpretation of Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t77c03s77-3-35ol14" target="_self">77-3-35(4)</a></cite> was consistent with the plain language of the statute, and the PSC retained full regulatory authority over switched access service and single-line flat rate voice communication service; the PSC did not improperly utilize a “rate of return” methodology to determine the company’s requested rate increase because it did not base its conclusion upon the lack of a cost of service study but merely listed several types of possible evidence the company could have submitted to support its rate increase request.

Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t77c03s77-3-35ol14" target="_self">77-3-35(4)</a></cite>, the statute’s revocation of regulatory authority does not apply to switched access service and single-line flat rate voice communication service because the statute specifically reserves to the Mississippi Public Service Commission (PSC)regulatory authority over those two types of service; nothing in the statute, either implicitly or explicitly, limits the PSC’s regulatory function to mere ministerial approval or disapproval after “doing the math,” and the cap on the limit of annual increases reads as exactly that: a cap on the amount retail rates for the two particular services may be increased in a given year.

A public utility seeking a change in any rate or rates shall file with the secretary of the commission and the executive director of the public utilities staff a notice of intent to change rates. The commission may promulgate rules and regulations providing for notice to customers of the filing by any public utility for a rate increase. Routine changes in rates and schedules that do not involve any substantial revenue adjustment may go into effect after thirty (30) days’ notice to the commission or after such shorter period of notice as the commission, for good cause shown, may allow. In all other cases, the notice of intent shall contain a statement of the changes proposed to be made in the rates then in force, the new level of revenues sought, the reasons for the proposed changes and the date proposed for such changes to become effective, which date shall not be less than thirty (30) days after the date of filing. The proposed changes may be shown by filing new schedules, by plainly indicating the changes upon schedules filed and in force at the time and kept open to public inspection or by such other manner as will clearly indicate the rates to be changed and the rates proposed. All direct testimony, exhibits and other information which any utility will rely upon in support of the proposed changes shall be filed concurrently with the filing of the notice of intent.

       Public Service Commission improperly sealed information to which the public was entitled because it erred in determining that rate-impact information was confidential and concealed from the ratepayers the amount of the projected increases; the Commission’s decision to govern in a cloak of secrecy and grant confidentiality to rate-impact information was arbitrary and capricious.

   Under the Federal Power Act (16 USCS §§ 791a et seq.) and the United States Constitution’s supremacy clause (Art VI, cl 2), where the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has allocated a specified percentage of the capacity costs of a powerplant that serves the needs of a utility holding company’s entire system to one of the holding company’s operating subsidiaries, the state public utility commission having jurisdiction over the operating subsidiary’s retail electric rates must treat the operating subsidiary’s FERC-mandated payments for the powerplant’s costs as reasonably incurred operating expenses for the purpose of setting the subsidiary’s retail rates; accordingly, state commission proceedings-(1) to determine whether some or all of the costs were not prudently incurred, including evaluation of either the holding company’s decision to invest in the power plant or the operating subsidiary’s decision to be a party to agreements to construct and operate the plant, or (2) to challenge the reasonableness of the FERC’s cost allocation-are pre-empted by federal law, since (1) the FERC has exclusive authority to determine the reasonableness of wholesale rates, (2) the FERC’s exclusive jurisdiction applies not only to rates, but also to power allocations that affect wholesale rates, and (3) states may not bar regulated utilities from passing through to retain consumers FERC-mandated wholesale rates.

       Utility customers who never sought intervention in a rate increase proceeding never became parties and, therefore, did not have standing to appeal from the final order of the Public Service Commission. North Miss. Util. Co. v. Wentworth, 604 So. 2d 218 (Miss. 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   The requirements of both §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t77c03s77-3-39" target="_self">77-3-39</a></cite> and §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t77c03s77-3-47" target="_self">77-3-47</a></cite> must be satisfied whenever there is a request for a rate change, regardless of who initiates it. State ex rel. Pittman v. Mississippi Public Service Com., 538 So. 2d 387, 1989 Miss. LEXIS 10 (Miss. 1989).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Public Service Commission does not have the authority to grant a rate increase for power never delivered; thus, a utility company was not allowed a rate increase to recover revenue lost during a period of storm damage when it was unable to provide service to its customers. State ex rel. Pittman v. Mississippi Public Service Com., 520 So. 2d 1355, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2940 (Miss. 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Commission is authorized to establish just and reasonable rates which lead to fair rate of return for utility, fair rate of return being one which, under prudent and economical management, is just and reasonable to both public and utility. State ex rel. Pittman v. Mississippi Public Service Com., 506 So. 2d 978, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2367 (Miss. 1987), rev'd, <cite class="us_code">487 U.S. 354</cite>, <cite class="s_court">108 S.

      </p>
      <p>
       So long as Public Service Commission examines and considers evidence and testimony of each expert witness who appears in rate change proceeding and does not ignore salient and substantial factors offered into evidence, Commission has prerogative on disputed issue to adopt whichever expert’s view it chooses to give credence to; in such case, court cannot disturb Commission’s ruling.

   Under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t77c03s77-3-39" target="_self">77-3-39</a></cite>, the Mississippi Public Service Commission abused its discretion in adopting a formula for the determination of the rate base of an electric utility which was unsupported by substantial evidence that the formula was reasonable and best suited for that determination, where the formula adopted a projected test year for rate-making purposes, the formula was more speculative than others, its results were substantially eroded by comparison with the results of the first three months of actual use, and under the circumstances, its adoption was arbitrary. State ex rel. Allain v. Mississippi Public Service Com., 435 So. 2d 608, 1983 Miss. LEXIS 2502 (Miss. 1983).

   Mississippi Public Service Commission’s order reducing a power company’s proposed inclusion of $19,000,000 plus $1,138,500 in the overall rate base attributable to contract adjustments between the electric company and another utility with respect to acquisition of one-half interest by each company in a steam generation plant was supported by the evidence; however, it was clear error for the Commission to base its adjustment of the utility company’s maintenance expense projection on a methodology which used trends established in prior years, rather than actual figures for the most recent year. Mississippi Public Service Com. v. Mississippi Power Co., 429 So. 2d 883, 1983 Miss. LEXIS 2524 (Miss.), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">464 U.S. 819</cite>, <cite class="s_court">104 S.

       <p>
   On appeal by a public telephone company from an order of the Public Service Commission denying its proposed rate increase and allowing only a 10% overall increase, the chancellor properly exercised his discretion in finding, pursuant to §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t77c03s77-3-67ol14" target="_self">77-3-67(4)</a></cite>, that the denial of the higher increase sought by the telephone company was not supported by substantial evidence and was against the manifest weight of undisputed evidence, where the commission failed to fix a rate base as required by §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t77c03s77-3-43" target="_self">77-3-43</a></cite>, failed to fix a rate of return related to a legally formulated rate base as required by §§<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t77c03s77-3-33ol11" target="_self">77-3-33(1)</a></cite> and<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t77c03s77-3-39" target="_self">77-3-39</a></cite>, and arbitrarily fixed a 10% increase in rates when it appeared certain that compliance with that increase would result in a substantial loss; however, the chancellor erred in fixing a rate base and a rate of return, even though he arrived at amounts warranted by the proof, as §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t77c03s77-3-67ol14" target="_self">77-3-67(4)</a></cite> provides instead for a remand of the cause to the commission.

      </p>
      <p>
       Where the only major conflict in evidence was difference or opinion of two rate experts, and where Commission did not follow either rate expert and did not make a finding of fact to support its ultimate conclusion, order of Commission disapproving proposed increases in rates was not supported by substantial evidence and was against manifest weight of undisputed evidence, requiring vacation of Commission’s order. Mississippi Power Co. v. Mississippi Public Service Com., 291 So. 2d 541, 1974 Miss. LEXIS 1727 (Miss. 1974), limited, 337 So. 2d 936, 1976 Miss. LEXIS 1602 (Miss. 1976).

   In a consumer’s action against a power company and telephone company challenging the utilities’ statutory authority to raise rates under bond prior to final determination of the authorized rate, the Supreme Court would hold that §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t77c03s77-3-39" target="_self">77-3-39</a></cite> is constitutional, that the consumer had no specific vested property right in a fair and reasonable utility rate, that there was no unlawful delegation of legislative power to the utilities, and that the consumer was not denied due process of law.

   Under Federal Power Act (16 USCS §§ 791a et seq.) and the United States Constitution’s supremacy clause, where Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has allocated a specified percentage of the capacity costs of a power plant that serves the needs of a utility company’s entire system to one of the holding company’s operating subsidiaries, the state public utility commission having jurisdiction over the operating subsidiary’s retail electric rates must treat the operating subsidiary’s FERC-mandated payments for the power plant’s costs as reasonably incurred operating expenses for the purpose of setting the subsidiary’s retail rates; accordingly, state commission proceedings (1) to determine whether some or all of the costs were not prudently incurred, including evaluation of either the holding company’s decision to invest in the power plant or the operating subsidiary’s decision to be a party to agreements to construct and operate the plant, or (2) to challenge the reasonableness of FERC’s cost allocation, are pre-empted by federal law, since (1) FERC has exclusive authority to determine the reasonableness of wholesale rates, (2) FERC’s exclusive jurisdiction applies not only to rates but also to power allocations that affect wholesale rates, and (3) states may not bar regulated utilities from passing through to retail consumers FERC-mandated wholesale rates.

   Under Mississippi law, a fair rate of return for a public utility is one that, under prudent and economical management, is just and reasonable to both the public and the utility.

   States may not regulate in areas in which the FERC has properly exercised its jurisdiction to determine just and reasonable wholesale rates or to insure that agreements affecting wholesale rates are reasonable, Congress having drawn a bright line between state and federal authority in the setting of wholesale rates and in the regulation of agreements that affect wholesale rates. Mississippi Power &amp; Light Co. v. Mississippi, <cite class="us_code">487 U.S. 354</cite>, <cite class="s_court">108 S. Ct. 2428</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">101 L.

       The Public Service Commission may permit, as an item of expense chargeable to ratepayers, the establishment of a reserve for storm damage, and may authorize, as a legitimate expense of operation, annual contributions to those reserves; however, as with expenses for storm damage actually incurred, charges for the establishment of a storm reserve are allowable only after a hearing.

       Since the rate making authority is legislative in character, it rests within the power of the commission; the authority of the court to enjoin or restrain imposition of confiscatory rates does not carry with it the power to establish the rate. Mississippi Public Service Com. v. Mississippi Power Co., 337 So. 2d 936, 1976 Miss. LEXIS 1602 (Miss. 1976).

       Where a franchise granted by a city to a gas company provided that the rates then fixed should be effective as long as they remained fair or were changed or altered as provided by law, and subsequently the legislature withdrew from municipalities the right to fix rates, remedy of city in opposing gas company’s rate change was before the public service commission. United Gas Corp. v. Philadelphia, 238 Miss. 409, 118 So. 2d 618, 1960 Miss. LEXIS 420 (Miss. 1960).

       In rate-making proceedings, rates for the future are usually based on actual operating experience for a representative period, with adjustment for changes that appear definite and certain. Southern Bell Tel. & Tel. Co. v. Mississippi Public Service Com., 237 Miss. 157, 113 So. 2d 622, 1959 Miss. LEXIS 459 (Miss. 1959).
      </p>
      <p>
       The reasonableness or unreasonableness of the rates charged, or to be charged, by a public utility for its service or product is not to be determined by any definite rule or legal formula, and is not measurable with any great degree of exactness, but is a question of fact calling for the exercise of sound discretion, good sense, and a fair, enlightened, and independent judgment, and in determining whether a rate is reasonable, each case must rest on its special facts. Southern Bell Tel. & Tel. Co. v. Mississippi Public Service Com., 237 Miss. 157, 113 So. 2d 622, 1959 Miss. LEXIS 459 (Miss. 1959).
      </p>
      <p>
       A rate of return in the range of 4.96 per cent to 5.08 per cent on the reasonable value of a telephone company’s interstate property, while low as compared with the rates allowed in other jurisdictions, is not confiscatory, and it cannot be said that such rates are unjust or unreasonable, or that the rate of return itself is not a fair rate of return. Southern Bell Tel. & Tel. Co. v. Mississippi Public Service Com., 237 Miss. 157, 113 So. 2d 622, 1959 Miss. LEXIS 459 (Miss. 1959).
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the function of rate making is purely legislative in character, a court is without power to fix the rates to be charged by public utilities, but may restrain the imposition of confiscatory rates, or, under the Public Utility Act, determine whether rates as fixed are supported by substantial evidence, or within the other statutory restrictions set forth in Code 1942, §
   Mississippi Public Service Com. v. Home Tel. Co., 236 Miss. 444, 110 So. 2d 618, 1959 Miss. LEXIS 339 (Miss. 1959).

       A utility is entitled to rates which will yield a fair return upon the reasonable value of property used or usable in furnishing services. Mississippi Public Service Com. v. Home Tel. Co., 236 Miss. 444, 110 So. 2d 618, 1959 Miss. LEXIS 339 (Miss. 1959).
      </p>
      <p>
       A rate established by the commission is not necessarily unreasonable because of uncertainty as to whether it will yield a fair return. Mississippi Public Service Com. v. Home Tel. Co., 236 Miss. 444, 110 So. 2d 618, 1959 Miss. LEXIS 339 (Miss. 1959).

         No public utility, the rates of which are subject to regulation under the provisions of this chapter, shall increase its rate or rate schedule in addition to its base rate as a result of what is commonly referred to as “fuel adjustment clauses” increase or “fuel adjustment riders” if the application of such clause or rider shall result in ultimate cost recovery exceeding the actual cost of fuel burned or consumed in its generating facilities and the cost of purchased energy.

         For the purpose of such fuel adjustment clause or rider, the cost of fuel as used herein shall include only the actual cost of the fuel and its transportation and may include such other cost items which are as of the effective date of this section allowed by the federal energy regulatory commission for inclusion in wholesale fuel adjustment clauses under its jurisdiction. In addition thereto fuel cost may include direct costs associated with burning the fuel at the generating plant such as fuel handling expenses and the cost of fuel sampling and analysis.

         The commission is hereby directed to cause a continuous monitoring by the public utilities staff and a complete audit, as necessary but not less than annually, of all fuel purchases for which fuel adjustment clauses or riders have been placed in effect prior to and after the effective date of this section, which shall totally verify fuel costs as might be consumed in generating plants and all purchased energy of such electric utilities in Mississippi with said audit being based upon generally accepted auditing standards which would accurately provide detailed information as to the actual monthly utility fuel costs. Such audit shall be completely independent of any audit performed on behalf of such utility.

        <li id="t77c03s77-3-42ol11b2b">
         The commission is hereby directed to promulgate rules and regulations, not inconsistent with the laws, (i) to define allowable costs for inclusion in fuel adjustments, (ii) to establish guidelines for defining what elements constitute a just and reasonable fuel adjustment clause or rider, (iii) to establish guidelines for defining what elements constitute efficient and economical procurement and use of energy and fuel, and (iv) to establish general guidelines for making the required review of fuel adjustment clauses or riders as required by this section. Such rules and regulations shall be spread upon the minutes of the commission.
        </li>
        <li id="t77c03s77-3-42ol11b2c">
         Such audits shall include (i) a determination if fuel and associated costs are properly identified and recorded in the appropriate uniform system of accounts, (ii) a determination if purchased energy and associated costs are properly identified, (iii) an assessment of a utility’s practices for economical purchase and use of fuel and electric energy, and (iv) an assessment of the relevant contract terms and conditions and any variations from contract terms.

Public utilities under the jurisdiction of this commission, the rates of which are subject to regulation under the provisions of this chapter, shall not purchase fuel and/or energy from a company or corporation which is owned in whole or in part by that public utility or by the parent company of that public utility unless the selling company or corporation assents to audits as provided for under this section.

The commission shall meet within one (1) week after receipt of the accountant’s summary, and shall spread upon the minutes of the commission that it has reviewed said summary and further shall describe any action which it takes regarding the audit report or the fact that no action was required. Any costs included in a fuel adjustment clause or rider by a public utility under the jurisdiction of the commission found in violation of this section shall, by order of the commission, be refunded to the appropriate person or persons. In lieu of payment, the utility may credit the service account with the amount due under this subsection if the consumer entitled to the refund is, at that time, a consumer of the utility.

       <p>
        If the commission, after following the procedures described above, has reasonable cause to believe that inefficient or uneconomical procurement or use of fuel or purchased energy has resulted in unreasonable or unjust charges or costs to the consumers, then the commission shall initiate a procedure for hearing as provided for in Section 77-3-47 for the purpose of determining whether or not any of the costs or charges included in the fuel adjustment charges to the consumers were unreasonable or unjust. If the commission upon hearing shall find that any charges for the purchase or procurement of fuel or purchased energy were unreasonable or unjust, then the commission shall order that such costs or charges be refunded to the appropriate person or persons together with interest at the same rate prescribed in Section 77-3-39, Section 77-3-69 and Section 77-3-71.

    Determination of rate base.

     <ol>
      <li id="t77c03s77-3-43ol11">
       In regulating the rates of any public utility subject to the provisions of this chapter, the commission shall, on hearing after reasonable notice, ascertain and fix the rate base of the property of the public utility in such manner as to be fair both to the public utility and to the consumer when the same is relevant or material to the exercise of the jurisdiction of the commission. The commission shall make readjustments from time to time, and ascertain the cost of all new construction, extensions and additions to the property of every public utility. In arriving at such rate base, the commission shall give due consideration to: (a) the reasonable original costs of the property used and useful, or to be used and useful within a reasonable time after the test period; (b) the portion of the cost which has been consumed by previous use recovered by depreciation expense; (c) the allowance for funds used during construction, not to exceed on borrowed funds the true net interest cost of such funds, computed according to the actuarial method, and, on the equity component thereof, a rate of return granted on common equity in the last rate proceedings before the commission, or if such rate has not been established within the preceding three (3) years, then the average rate of return actually earned on equity during the preceding three (3) years; (d) any other elements deemed by the commission to be material in determining the rate base for rate-making purposes.
      </li>
      <li id="t77c03s77-3-43ol12">
       Valuations of property of such a public utility for rate-making purposes shall not include property purchased, labor supplied or services rendered by any firm or corporation owned or controlled in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, by such public utility, or which owns or controls in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, such public utility, unless such firm or corporation permits the commission to have access to such of the books and records of such firm or corporation as may be necessary in the opinion of the commission to enable the commission to determine whether such labor, materials, property or services rendered were supplied at reasonable prices. The rate base shall not include property donated to such utility without any consideration nor shall operating expenses include depreciation of such donated property.
      </li>
      <li id="t77c03s77-3-43ol13">
       Whenever the commission is required in administering this chapter to find the value of gas in the field where produced, such value shall be determined as the amount paid therefor by the public utility in the field pursuant to arm’s length contract; and in the absence of such arm’s length contract, the fair market value of such gas as a commodity in the field.
      </li>
      <li id="t77c03s77-3-43ol14">
       The commission, in its discretion, when requested by petition of a rate-jurisdictional public utility providing water service as defined in Section 77-3-3(d) (iv), may allow to be recovered in rates the reasonable costs of used and useful facilities deemed necessary for fire protection. Such facilities include fire hydrants, transmission and distribution mains, storage facilities, pumping equipment or other facilities associated with the provision of adequate water production, storage and distribution for fire protection.

   On appeal by a public telephone company from an order of the Public Service Commission denying its proposed rate increase and allowing only a 10% overall increase, the chancellor properly exercised his discretion in finding, pursuant to §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t77c03s77-3-67ol14" target="_self">77-3-67(4)</a></cite>, that the denial of the higher increase sought by the telephone company was not supported by substantial evidence and was against the manifest weight of undisputed evidence, where the commission failed to fix a rate base as required by §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t77c03s77-3-43" target="_self">77-3-43</a></cite>, failed to fix a rate of return related to a legally formulated rate base as required by §§<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t77c03s77-3-33ol11" target="_self">77-3-33(1)</a></cite> and<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t77c03s77-3-39" target="_self">77-3-39</a></cite>, and arbitrarily fixed a 10% increase in rates when it appeared certain that compliance with that increase would result in a substantial loss; however, the chancellor erred in fixing a rate base and a rate of return, even though he arrived at amounts warranted by the proof, as §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t77c03s77-3-67ol14" target="_self">77-3-67(4)</a></cite> provides instead for a remand of the cause to the commission.

      Any rate-regulated electric or natural gas public utility with certificated service area in Mississippi may undertake economic development activities, whether directly or indirectly, including activities such as providing capital, or investment in or acquisition and development of business or industrial sites and the necessary infrastructure or services needed to attract new or existing businesses or industry, to create or maintain employment opportunities, or otherwise to positively impact or in some manner promote the sale of electric energy or natural gas within its certificated service area. Any facilities developed, constructed or acquired in support of the activities described in this section for which a certificate of public convenience and necessity or other commission approval has been granted after July 1, 2015, as well as any capital investment in natural gas reserves made directly or indirectly by an electric or natural gas public utility to foster long-term stability in the cost of fuel, may be deemed used and useful in the provision of electric or natural gas service regardless of whether or not any end-use customers are taking service from said facilities or investment and otherwise recoverable through the utility’s rates.

     <p>
      To determine accurately the capital costs of a public utility;

   The Mississippi Public Service Commission exceeded its statutory authority in adopting a rule which provided that the deposition of a witness could be taken upon agreement of the parties or in the discretion of the Commission since §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t77c03s77-3-51" target="_self">77-3-51</a></cite> clearly gives the right to take and use a deposition only upon agreement of the parties.

   The Mississippi Public Service Commission exceeded its authority in adopting a rule requiring a utility to provide written notice to its customers of the utility’s filing for any certificate because §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t77c03s77-3-13ol13" target="_self">77-3-13(3)</a></cite> provides that the Commission shall give the notice required, and therefore the rule would transfer this duty to the utilities contrary to the provisions of the statute.

    Management reviews of public utility companies.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, the commission may, in its discretion, initiate a management review of any public utility company, the rates of which are subject to regulation under the provisions of this chapter and which has in excess of twenty-five thousand (25,000) customers, once every five (5) years, and at such other times deemed necessary by the commission as determined by it during a hearing, by a competent, qualified and independent firm, such review to examine thoroughly the efficiency and effectiveness of management decisions among other factors as directed by the commission. Such public utility shall render to the commission for such purpose books, records and other items prescribed by the commission. The cost of such review is to be borne by the particular public utility subject to the review; provided, however, that carriers subject to regulation by and auditing of the interstate commerce commission shall not be required to bear the expense of additional management review required hereunder.
     </p>
     <p>
      Whenever the commission is of the opinion that it is in the public interest to do so, the commission may in its discretion initiate a management review of any other public utility company, the rates of which are subject to regulation under the provisions of this chapter, in accordance with the procedures set forth above in this section.
     </p>
     <p>
      The commission shall not contract for such management review with any firm that has within three (3) years prior thereto performed a financial audit on behalf of such public utility nor on behalf of any affiliate, subsidiary, holding or parent company.

Notice of all such hearings shall be given the persons interested therein by mailing such notice to each public utility which may be affected by any order resulting therefrom and by publication in a newspaper of general circulation published in Jackson, Mississippi, and, in a proceeding for a facility certificate or an area certificate, by publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the county or counties where the facility or area is located. In addition to any other notice requirements prescribed in this section, notice of a hearing regarding a major change in rates and schedules, as defined in Section 77-3-37(8), by a public utility of the type defined in Section 77-3-3(d)(iv) shall be published in a newspaper having general circulation in an area where service is being provided by the public utility.

       Public Service Commission may cut off Attorney General’s cross-examination of expert witness concerning expert’s professional qualifications as compared to qualifications of another expert where Commission is fully familiar with expert’s professional qualifications and nothing would be served by repeating before Commission at hearing what is already matter of public record.

   Supreme court had jurisdiction over the orders of the Mississippi Public Service Commission denying a resident’s motion to amend his complaint challenging the grant of a Supplemental Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity (CCN) to a water, sewer and fire district and dismissing the complaint but not over the grant of the supplemental CCN because the resident attempted to appeal the supplemental CCN decision by way of appealing the Commission’s orders, and the appeal was untimely since it was filed more than four years after the order granting the supplemental CCN; the Commission filed a timely notice in a newspaper that a decentralized system would be implemented, and the resident was notified of the planned implementation when the district adopted an ordinance, published notice concerning the adoption of the ordinance, and then passed the ordinance after a public hearing at which no one expressed opposition.

   Mississippi Public Service Commission’s (Commission) order regarding an increase in rates for water service provided by the company was not supported by substantial evidence and was contrary to the manifest weight of the evidence, Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t77c03s77-3-59" target="_self">77-3-59</a></cite>; in fixing the rate, the Commission did not evidence its expertise by incorporating in its order cogent reasons for its decision based on a finding of facts pertinent to the particular inquiry before it.

       Public Service Commission (PSC) order fixing utility rates should set forth basis on which rates are fixed in accordance with law applicable thereto; otherwise, courts are seriously hampered in review of such order.

      </p>
      <p>
       Public Service Commission (PSC) did not make sufficient findings of fact in its order denying rate increase to water utility; relevant portion of order merely stated that utility was not providing adequate service with money currently available and thus was not entitled to increase, Commission did not set forth persuasive evidence or conclusions drawn from evidence which it used in reaching decision, and Supreme Court on appeal was placed in awkward position of trying to ferret out sufficient evidence from record.

       Letters from public officials and commercial establishments expressing interest in proposed new service were properly considered by the Mississippi Public Service Commission, and supported the Commission’s order granting a certificate of public convenience and necessity to own and operate a radio transmitted paging service.

Mississippi Public Service Com. v. AAA Anserphone, Inc., 372 So. 2d 259, 1979 Miss. LEXIS 2024 (Miss. 1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       In an electric utility rate proceeding, the Chancellor properly found that the Public Service Commission gave no consideration to coverages required for loans and preferred stock sales, where close examination of the commission’s findings and order revealed no treatment therein of coverages, as such, but only as coverages were included in its decision that the rate allowed was sufficient to assure confidence in the integrity of the utility’s finances, so as to maintain its credit and to attract capital. Mississippi Public Service Com. v. Mississippi Power Co., 366 So. 2d 656, 1979 Miss. LEXIS 2204 (Miss. 1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       The basis of judicial review of the actions of the public service commission is the substantial evidence rule. Capital Electric Power Asso. v. Mississippi Power & Light Co., 216 So. 2d 428, 1968 Miss. LEXIS 1229 (Miss. 1968).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence of depreciated original cost of a utility’s property, particularly if a considerable part is of relatively recent construction, is sufficient to support a determination of the reasonable value upon which the utility is entitled to a fair return. Southern Bell Tel. & Tel. Co. v. Mississippi Public Service Com., 237 Miss. 157, 113 So. 2d 622, 1959 Miss. LEXIS 459 (Miss. 1959).

       A Public Service Commission (PSC) ruling, which overruled a prior PSC decision by ordering a reduction of a utility company’s water and sewer rates, was not arbitrary and capricious because the PSC may at any time amend or rescind an order, it is within the purview of the PSC to determine the weight of the evidence and the credibility of the witnesses, and the utility company’s failure to follow its service extension policy amounted to a major change in fact since the issuance of the prior order.

      After an order or decision has been made by the commission, any party to the proceedings may, within thirty (30) days after the entry of the order or decision, apply for a rehearing in respect of any matters determined in said proceedings and specified in the application for rehearing, and the commission may grant and hold such rehearings on such matters.

      The filing of an application for rehearing shall not stay or suspend the effective date of any commission order or the obligation of any person to comply in all respects with such order unless the commission shall, in the exercise of its discretion, stay, suspend or modify such order. Any party to the proceedings shall be entitled to a stay of the order, other than an order resulting from a proceeding under Section 77-3-39, as a matter of right, upon filing with the commission a bond payable to the State of Mississippi in such amount and with sufficient surety, both as determined by the commission, to insure the prompt payment of any damages or refunds to the party or persons entitled thereto, if the order shall, at the conclusion of any subsequent proceedings, become effective. Such damages or refunds shall be paid in full, including interest at the same rate prescribed in Section 77-3-39, Section 77-3-69 and Section 77-3-71. In lieu of payment, the utility may credit the service account with the amount due under this section if the consumer entitled to the damages or refund is, at that time, a consumer of the utility.
     </p>
     <p>
      The commission shall either grant or refuse an application for rehearing within twenty (20) days after the date of application therefor. A failure by the commission to act upon such application within that period shall be deemed refusal thereof. If the application is granted, the commission shall conduct and conclude a rehearing within thirty (30) days of the entry of the order for rehearing and shall enter a new order after the rehearing shall have been concluded, which shall become effective ten (10) days after such order is entered, unless otherwise provided by the commission for reasonable cause.

       In addition to other remedies now available at law or in equity, any party aggrieved by any final finding, order or judgment of the commission, except those final findings, orders or judgments specified in Section 77-3-72, shall have the right, regardless of the amount involved, of appeal to the chancery court of the judicial district in which the principal place of business of the utility in the state of Mississippi is located. If the court shall find that the appeal has been to the improper venue then the cause shall not be dismissed for such reason but shall be transferred to such proper venue. If an application for rehearing has been filed, an appeal must be filed within thirty (30) days after the application for rehearing has been refused or deemed refused because of the commission’s failure to act thereon within the time specified in Section 77-3-65 or, if the application is granted, within thirty (30) days after the rendition of the decision on rehearing. If an application for rehearing has not been filed, an appeal must be filed within thirty (30) days after the entry of the commission’s order. Every appeal shall state briefly the nature of the proceedings before the commission, and shall specify the order complained of. Any person whose rights may be directly affected by said appeal may appear and become a party, or the court may upon proper notice order any person to be joined as a party.
      </li>
      <li id="t77c03s77-3-67ol12">
       Upon the filing of an appeal the clerk of the chancery court shall serve notice thereof upon the commission, whereupon the commission shall, within sixty (60) days (or within such additional time as the court may for cause allow) from the service of such notice, certify to the chancery court the record in the case, which record shall include a transcript of all testimony, together with all exhibits or copies thereof, all pleadings, proceedings, orders, findings and opinions entered in the case. However, the parties and the commission may stipulate that a specified portion only of the record shall be certified to the court as the record on appeal.
      </li>
      <li id="t77c03s77-3-67ol13">
       No new or additional evidence shall be introduced in the chancery court but the case shall be determined upon the record and evidence transferred.
      </li>
      <li id="t77c03s77-3-67ol14">
       The court may hear and dispose of the appeal in termtime or vacation and the court may sustain or dismiss the appeal, modify or vacate the order complained of in whole or in part, as the case may be. In case the order is wholly or partly vacated the court may also, in its discretion, remand the matter to the commission for such further proceedings, not inconsistent with the court’s order as, in the opinion of the court, justice may require. The order shall not be vacated or set aside either in whole or in part, except for errors of law, unless the court finds that the order of the commission is not supported by substantial evidence, is contrary to the manifest weight of the evidence, is in excess of the statutory authority or jurisdiction of the commission, or violates constitutional rights.

   Supreme court had jurisdiction over the orders of the Mississippi Public Service Commission denying a resident’s motion to amend his complaint challenging the grant of a Supplemental Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity (CCN) to a water, sewer and fire district and dismissing the complaint but not over the grant of the supplemental CCN because the resident attempted to appeal the supplemental CCN decision by way of appealing the Commission’s orders, and the appeal was untimely since it was filed more than four years after the order granting the supplemental CCN; the Commission filed a timely notice in a newspaper that a decentralized system would be implemented, and the resident was notified of the planned implementation when the district adopted an ordinance, published notice concerning the adoption of the ordinance, and then passed the ordinance after a public hearing at which no one expressed opposition. Green v. Cleary Water, Sewer &amp; Fire Dist., 17 So.3d 559, 2009 Miss. LEXIS 430 (Miss. 2009), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">559 U.S. 971</cite>, <cite class="s_court">130 S.

       Utility customers who never sought intervention in a rate increase proceeding never became parties and, therefore, did not have standing to appeal from the final order of the Public Service Commission. North Miss. Util. Co. v. Wentworth, 604 So. 2d 218 (Miss. 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       So long as Public Service Commission examines and considers evidence and testimony of each expert witness who appears in rate change proceeding and does not ignore salient and substantial factors offered into evidence, Commission has prerogative on disputed issue to adopt whichever expert’s view it chooses to give credence to; in such case, court cannot disturb Commission’s ruling.

       <p>
   On appeal by a public telephone company from an order of the Public Service Commission denying its proposed rate increase and allowing only a 10% overall increase, the chancellor properly exercised his discretion in finding, pursuant to §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t77c03s77-3-67ol14" target="_self">77-3-67(4)</a></cite>, that the denial of the higher increase sought by the telephone company was not supported by substantial evidence and was against the manifest weight of undisputed evidence, where the commission failed to fix a rate base as required by §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t77c03s77-3-43" target="_self">77-3-43</a></cite>, failed to fix a rate of return related to a legally formulated rate base as required by §§<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t77c03s77-3-33ol11" target="_self">77-3-33(1)</a></cite> and<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t77c03s77-3-39" target="_self">77-3-39</a></cite>, and arbitrarily fixed a 10% increase in rates when it appeared certain that compliance with that increase would result in a substantial loss; however, the chancellor erred in fixing a rate base and a rate of return, even though he arrived at amounts warranted by the proof, as §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t77c03s77-3-67ol14" target="_self">77-3-67(4)</a></cite> provides instead for a remand of the cause to the commission. Mississippi Public Service Com. v. Hughes Tel. Co., 376 So. 2d 1074, 1979 Miss. LEXIS 2512 (Miss. 1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       The chancellor, in reversing the Public Service Commission’s order in an electric utility rate case on the grounds that it was contrary to the overwhelming weight of the evidence, was unsupported by substantial evidence, and was confiscatory in its effect on the public utility company, did not undertake to substitute himself in place of the Commission, but rather properly confined himself to the duties and authority specifically reserved to him by statute. Mississippi Public Service Com. v. Mississippi Power Co., 366 So. 2d 656, 1979 Miss. LEXIS 2204 (Miss. 1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the rate making authority is legislative in character, it rests within the power of the commission; the authority of the court to enjoin or restrain imposition of confiscatory rates does not carry with it the power to establish the rate. Mississippi Public Service Com. v. Mississippi Power Co., 337 So. 2d 936, 1976 Miss. LEXIS 1602 (Miss. 1976).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where record of commission proceeding revealed that the commission’s order denying a rate change was not supported by any substantial evidence and amounted to the imposition of a confiscatory rate, chancery court order remanding matter to commission was reversed and judgment was entered approving increase. Mississippi Public Service Com. v. Mississippi Valley Gas Co., 327 So. 2d 296, 1976 Miss. LEXIS 1782 (Miss.), limited, Mississippi Public Service Com. v. Mississippi Power Co., 337 So. 2d 936, 1976 Miss. LEXIS 1602 (Miss. 1976).
      </p>
      <p>
       It was not necessary to remand case to Public Service Commission where Supreme Court determined that order of the Commission denying rate increase requested by Mississippi power company was not supported by substantial evidence and amounted to imposition of confiscatory rates which might be restrained by Supreme Court. Mississippi Power Co. v. Mississippi Public Service Com., 291 So. 2d 541, 1974 Miss. LEXIS 1727 (Miss. 1974), limited, 337 So. 2d 936, 1976 Miss. LEXIS 1602 (Miss. 1976).
      </p>
      <p>
       The basis of judicial review of the actions of the public service commission is the substantial evidence rule. Capital Electric Power Asso. v. Mississippi Power & Light Co., 216 So. 2d 428, 1968 Miss. LEXIS 1229 (Miss. 1968).
      </p>
      <p>
       No appeal lies to the chancery court from interlocutory orders of the public service commission. Mississippi Power Co. v. Mississippi Public Service Com., 240 Miss. 621, 128 So. 2d 351, 1961 Miss. LEXIS 492 (Miss. 1961).
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the function of rate making is purely legislative in character, a court is without power to fix the rates to be charged by public utilities, but may restrain the imposition of confiscatory rates, or, under the Public Utility Act, determine whether rates as fixed are supported by substantial evidence, or within the other statutory restrictions set forth in this section. Mississippi Public Service Com. v. Home Tel. Co., 236 Miss. 444, 110 So. 2d 618, 1959 Miss. LEXIS 339 (Miss. 1959).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section supersedes Code 1942, § 7699, providing for appeals to the circuit court of Hinds County within six months. Mississippi Valley Gas Co. v. Jackson, 236 Miss. 81, 109 So. 2d 637, 1959 Miss. LEXIS 297 (Miss. 1959).
      </p>
      <p>
       Appeal, and not certiorari, is the proper way to obtain review of a commission order granting a certificate of convenience and necessity to a gas company. Mississippi Valley Gas Co. v. Jackson, 236 Miss. 81, 109 So. 2d 637, 1959 Miss. LEXIS 297 (Miss. 1959).

   Chancery court erred in finding that it was without jurisdiction to hear the resident’s appeal of the denial of his motion to amend his complaint challenging the Mississippi Public Service Commission’s grant of a Supplemental Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity to a water, sewer, and fire district because the resident appealed within the thirty-day statutory deadline of the final order dismissing his complaint, Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t77c03s77-3-67ol11" target="_self">77-3-67(1)</a></cite>; the resident was not required to appeal the denial of his motion to amend within thirty days of the order because the thirty-day appeal deadline applied only to the final order.

       The pendency of proceedings to review shall not of itself stay or suspend the operation of the order of the commission. However, any party may, as a matter of right, secure from the court in which a review of or an appeal from the order of the commission not related to changing rates or rate design is sought, an order suspending or staying the operation of the order of the commission pending a review of such order, by adequately securing the other parties against loss due to the delay in the enforcement of the order in case the order under review is affirmed, the security to be in such form and amount as shall be directed by the court granting the stay or suspension.

       If an appeal to the chancery court be taken from an order of the commission reducing existing rates or refusing to approve rates proposed by a utility, the utility, if it is not then collecting under refunding bond rates in excess of rates which have been ordered by the commission, may request upon motion filed in the chancery court an order allowing the utility to place into effect forthwith interim rates which may be charged and collected, subject to refund as hereinafter provided, pending final determination of the rate proceeding. The court may, in its discretion, upon a finding that undue hardship or irreparable injury to the utility or the public interest would probably result otherwise, allow the utility to place into effect such interim rates at a revenue level up to, but not exceeding, the proposed rates. The court may allow the utility to collect all or part of a proposed rate increase. However, before such increased rates can take effect, the utility shall file with the court a bond in a reasonable amount approved by the court, with sureties approved by the court, conditioned upon the refund, with interest at the same rate prescribed in Section 77-3-39, Section 77-3-69 and Section 77-3-71, to the parties entitled thereto, of the amount of the excess if the existing rate or rates or the rate or rates so put into effect are finally determined to be excessive. In lieu of payment, the utility may credit the service account with the amount due under this subsection if the consumer entitled to the refund is, at that time, a consumer of the utility. If the court does not dispose of the motion for interim rates as contemplated herein within thirty (30) days of the filing of such motion, then the public utility, as a matter of right, may place into effect forthwith fifty percent (50%) of that portion of the proposed rate schedule not allowed by the commission’s order, pending final determination of the appeal, upon filing with the court a surety bond in the same manner as previously provided for herein.

       If the court does not make a final determination and adjudication of the rate proceeding within one hundred eighty (180) days after the record has been certified and filed, or if the court remands the matter to the commission for further proceedings and the commission has not entered its order allowing rates within forty-five (45) days from the time of receipt of the mandate of the court, or if the commission has at any time entered its order after remand and an appeal therefrom has been taken, then, in any such case, the public utility may, as a matter of right, place into effect the entire proposed rate schedule, under refunding bond, as provided for in this section or in Section 77-3-39, whichever is applicable. Interim rates under refunding bond charged by the utility under this subsection shall terminate upon final disposition of the rate proceeding without timely appeal.

       § 77-3-71.
    Appeals to supreme court.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Appeals in accordance with law may be had to the Supreme Court of the State of Mississippi from any final judgment of the chancery court.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the party taking the appeal has theretofore furnished security as provided in Sections 77-3-39 and 77-3-69, and has filed a bond conditioned as provided in Sections 77-3-39 and 77-3-69, the taking of an appeal to the supreme court shall operate as a supersedeas without the furnishing of further security or bond. In such cases the supreme court may, upon application to it, require such additional security, or such additional bond conditioned as provided in Sections 77-3-39 and 77-3-69, as in its opinion will adequately secure the other party to the appeal, or parties who may become entitled to refunds, against loss in the event the judgment under review is affirmed.
     </p>
     <p>
      If an appeal to the supreme court be taken from a final judgment of the chancery court which alters an order of the commission by approving a level of revenue in excess of that allowed by the commission’s order, the public utility may, as a matter of right, place such level of revenue which has been so approved by the chancery court in such final judgment into effect, pending final determination of the appeal to the supreme court, upon filing with the supreme court a bond in a reasonable amount approved by such court, with sureties approved by such court, conditioned upon the refund with interest at the lawful rate to the parties entitled thereto, of the amount of the excess if the rates so put into effect are finally determined to be excessive. In lieu of payment, the utility may credit the service account with the amount due under this section if the consumer entitled to the refund, is at that time, a consumer of the utility.
     </p>
     <p>
      In addition to the foregoing, if an appeal to the supreme court be taken from a final judgment of the chancery court with respect to a proceeding for determination of rates, and the public utility is not then collecting under refunding bond rates in excess of rates which have been ordered by the commission, such utility may request upon motion filed in the supreme court an order allowing the utility to place into effect forthwith interim rates which may be charged and collected, subject to refund as hereinafter provided, pending final determination of the rate proceeding. The court may, in its discretion, upon a hearing by not fewer than three (3) justices and upon a finding that undue hardship or irreparable injury to the utility or the public interest would probably result otherwise, allow the utility to place into effect such interim rates at a revenue level up to, but not exceeding, the proposed rates. The court may allow the utility to collect all or part of a proposed rate increase. However, before such increased rates can take effect, the utility shall file with the court a bond in a reasonable amount approved by the court, with sureties approved by the court, conditioned upon the refund, with interest at the lawful rate, to the parties entitled thereto, of the amount of the excess after the existing rate or rates or the rate or rates so put into effect are finally determined to be excessive. In lieu of payment, the utility may credit the service account with the amount due under this section if the consumer entitled to the refund is, at that time, a consumer of the utility.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the court does not dispose of the motion for interim rates as contemplated herein within thirty (30) days of the filing of such motion, then the public utility, as a matter of right, may place into effect forthwith fifty percent (50%) of that portion of the proposed rate schedule not allowed by the commission’s order, pending final determination of the appeal, upon filing with the court a surety bond in the same manner as previously provided for herein. If the court does not make a final determination and adjudication of the rate proceeding within one hundred eighty (180) days after the record has been certified and filed, or if the court remands the matter to the commission for further proceedings and the commission has not entered its order allowing rates within forty-five (45) days from the time of receipt of the mandate of the court, or if the commission has at any time entered its order after remand and an appeal therefrom has been taken, then, in any such case, the public utility may, as a matter of right, place into effect the entire proposed rate schedule, under refunding bond, as provided for in this section or in Section 77-3-39, whichever is applicable. Interim rates under refunding bond charged by the utility under this subsection shall terminate upon final disposition of the rate proceeding without timely appeal.

     <ol>
      <li id="t77c03s77-3-72ol11">
       Any party aggrieved by any final finding, order or judgment of the commission in any utility rate proceedings involving a filing for a rate change of any public utility as described in Section 77-3-3(d)(i), (d)(ii), or (d)(iii), shall have the right, regardless of the amount involved, of direct appeal to the Mississippi Supreme Court. If an application for rehearing has been filed, an appeal must be filed within thirty (30) days after the application for rehearing has been refused or deemed refused because of the commission’s failure to act thereon within the time specified in Section 77-3-65 or, if the application is granted, within thirty (30) days after the rendition of the decision on rehearing. If an application for rehearing has not been filed, an appeal must be filed within thirty (30) days after the entry of the commission’s order. Every appeal shall state briefly the nature of the proceedings before the commission, and shall specify the order complained of. Any person whose rights may be directly affected by said appeal may appear and become a party or the court may, upon proper notice, order any person to be joined as a party.
      </li>
      <li id="t77c03s77-3-72ol12">
       Upon the filing of an appeal the clerk of the supreme court shall serve notice thereof upon the commission, whereupon the commission shall, within sixty (60) days (or within such additional time as the court may for cause allow) from the service of such notice, certify to the court the record in the case, which record shall include a transcript of all testimony, together with all exhibits or copies thereof, all pleadings, proceedings, orders, findings and opinions entered in the case. However, the parties and the commission may stipulate that a specified portion only of the record shall be certified to the court as the record on appeal.

The court may in its discretion, upon a hearing by not fewer than three (3) justices and upon a finding that undue hardship or irreparable injury to the utility or the public interest would probably result otherwise, allow the utility to place into effect such interim rates at a revenue level up to, but not exceeding, the proposed rates.

However, before such increased rates can take effect, the utility shall file with the court a bond in a reasonable amount approved by the court, with sureties approved by the court, conditioned upon the refund, with interest at the same rate prescribed in Section 77-3-39, Section 77-3-69 and Section 77-3-71, to the parties entitled thereto, of the amount of the excess if the existing rate or rates or the rate or rates so put into effect are finally determined to be excessive.

The court may hear and dispose of the appeal in termtime or vacation and the court may sustain or dismiss the appeal, modify or vacate the order complained of in whole or in part, as the case may be. In case the order is wholly or partly vacated the court may also, in its discretion, remand the matter to the commission for such further proceedings, not inconsistent with the court’s order as, in the opinion of the court, justice may require. The order shall not be vacated or set aside either in whole or in part, except for errors of law, unless the court finds that the order of the commission is not supported by substantial evidence, is contrary to the manifest weight of the evidence, is in excess of the statutory authority or jurisdiction of the commission, or violates constitutional rights.

       Public Service Commission improperly sealed information to which the public was entitled because it erred in determining that rate-impact information was confidential and concealed from the ratepayers the amount of the projected increases; the Commission’s decision to govern in a cloak of secrecy and grant confidentiality to rate-impact information was arbitrary and capricious. Miss. Power Co. v. Miss. PSC, 168 So.3d 905, 2015 Miss. LEXIS 315 (Miss. 2015).
      </p>
      <p>
       Public Service Commission erred in granting rate increases for a power company because it failed to comply with the Base Load Act and exceeded its authority granted by the Act; by stipulation, the Commission improperly deferred prudency hearings, which were a prerequisite to granting an increase in rates, and in the absence of prudency hearings, a rate could not be arbitrarily declared as fair, just, and reasonable. Miss. Power Co. v. Miss. PSC, 168 So.3d 905, 2015 Miss. LEXIS 315 (Miss. 2015).
      </p>
      <p>
       Public Service Commission’s (PSC) denial of any rate increase to water utility was unsupported by substantial evidence and was contrary to manifest weight of the evidence in utility rate case, warranting reversal and remand to Commission for determination of amount of rate increase, despite Commission’s finding that utility was not providing adequate service; denial of rate increase was apparently punitive, utility had been receiving the same base monthly rate from customers for five years, experts testified that, despite competent economic management, existing base rate resulted in ongoing losses to utility, even intervenors conceded that utility was entitled to some increase, and services that utility provided were worth more than present base rate. White Cypress Lakes Water v. Mississippi PSC, 703 So. 2d 246, 1997 Miss. LEXIS 462 (Miss. 1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Public Service Commission (PSC) is an arm of the legislature. While the utility has the burden of proving by substantial evidence that it clearly is entitled to a requested rate increase, the order of the PSC presumptively is considered valid. Due to its expertise, the PSC is the trier of fact and within this province it has the right to determine the weight of the evidence, the reliability of estimates and the credibility of the witnesses, and it is free to accept or reject the recommendations of any of the witnesses.

     <p>
      The commission may require, by order served on any public utility in the manner provided in this chapter for the service of orders, the filing of such relevant reports, information or data at such time and place as it may reasonably designate.
     </p>
     <p>
      The commission shall at all reasonable times have access to and the right to inspect and examine all accounts, records, memoranda and property of the public utilities, and it shall be the duty of such public utilities to furnish to the commission, within such reasonable time as the commission may order, any information with respect thereto which the commission may by order require, including copies of maps, contracts, reports of engineers, and other data, records and papers, and to grant to all agents of the commission free access to its property and accounts, records and memoranda when requested so to do. It shall be unlawful for any member, officer, agent or employee of the commission knowingly and willingly to divulge any fact or information which may come to his knowledge during the course of any examination or inspection made under authority of this chapter, except as he may be directed by the commission or by a court or a judge thereof.
     </p>
     <p>
      The commission shall require an annual reporting from each public utility, the rates of which are subject to regulation under the provisions of this chapter, of all its expenditures for business gifts and entertainment, and institutional, consumption-inducing and other advertising or public relations expenses which the utility claims should be allowed for rate-making purposes. The commission shall not allow as costs or expenses for rate-making purposes any of these expenditures which the commission determines not to be in the public interest. The cost of legislative-advocacy expenses shall not in any case be allowed as costs or expenses for rate-making purposes. Reasonable charitable or civic contributions shall be allowed as cost of service not to exceed amounts established by regulations adopted by the commission.
     </p>
     <p>
      The commission shall establish filing deadlines for any required periodical reports but in no event shall the filing of such reports exceed sixty (60) days from the due date established by the commission. The commission shall have the authority to extend by order the time of compliance upon a finding that a matter of great urgency exists which would make compliance inequitable. The order extending the time for compliance shall fully set forth the facts justifying such extension. Any public utility which does not furnish such reports, information or other data by the deadlines established by the commission or within the extended time authorized by the commission shall be fined not more than One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00) per day for each day in violation of the requirements herein that such reports, information or other data are not furnished to the commission.

     <p>
      All reasonable and necessary expenses of the administration of the duties imposed on the public utilities staff and on the commission by Title 77, Mississippi Code of 1972, excluding the reasonable and necessary expenses of the administration and enforcement by the commission of the laws of this state pursuant to Chapters 7 and 9, Title 77, Mississippi Code of 1972, shall be provided as follows: There is hereby levied a tax upon (a) all utilities, the rates of which are subject to regulation by the provisions of this chapter and upon (b) all utilities not subject to such rate regulation which furnish to the ultimate consumer utility services of the type described by subparagraph (i) of paragraph (d) of Section 77-3-3 and otherwise subject to regulation by the provisions of this chapter, such levy to be effective on the first day of each year and to be calculated as follows: The rate of the tax shall be one hundred sixty-four thousandths of one percent (164/1000 of 1%) per year, of the gross revenues from the intrastate operations of the utilities taxed under this section. The rate of the tax for electric power associations and rural electrification authorities shall be ninety thousandths of one percent (90/1000 of 1%) per year of the gross revenues from the intrastate operations of electric power associations and rural electrification authorities taxed under this section. Effective July 1, 2017, the sum of all taxes levied by this section shall not exceed the total legislative appropriation of monies for the Public Utilities staff and the Public Service Commission for the ensuing fiscal year. The commission and the executive director of the public utilities staff shall certify to the Department of Revenue the amount of legislative appropriations of monies for the regulation of utilities. The Department of Revenue shall adjust the tax rates on a pro rata basis to generate the necessary revenues established by such legislative appropriations. Each utility which is subject to the tax levied by this section shall file a statement of its gross revenue by April 1 of each year showing the gross revenue for the preceding year’s operation. These statements of gross revenue shall be filed with the Department of Revenue on forms prescribed and furnished by the Department of Revenue. The Department of Revenue shall file a copy of these statements of gross revenue with the public utilities staff and the commission. The Department of Revenue shall calculate the amount of tax to be paid by each of the utilities and shall submit a statement thereof to the respective utilities, and the amount shown due in the statements to the utilities shall be paid by them within thirty (30) days thereafter to the Department of Revenue. The Department of Revenue shall furnish the public utilities staff and the commission with an itemized list showing gross and net revenues, assessments, tax collections and other related information for the respective utilities. The Department of Revenue shall deposit these funds into the General Fund if the State Treasury on the same day collected.
     </p>
     <p>
      All administrative provisions of the Mississippi Sales Tax Law, including those which fix damages, penalties and interest for nonpayment of taxes and for noncompliance with the provisions of such chapter, and all other duties and requirements imposed upon taxpayers, shall apply to all persons liable for taxes under the provisions of this chapter, and the Commissioner of Revenue shall exercise all the power and authority and perform all the duties with respect to taxpayers under this chapter as are provided in the Mississippi Sales Tax Law except where there is a conflict, then the provisions of this chapter shall control. The term “gross revenue ” as used in this section is the total amount of all revenue derived by each of the utilities from its intrastate operations, which are subject to rate regulation under the provisions of this chapter or which constitute utility services of the type described by subparagraph (i) of paragraph (d) of Section 77-3-3 and which are regulated by this chapter and furnished to ultimate consumers. The Department of Revenue is hereby authorized to use all tax returns of any utilities available to it and to make audits as may be deemed necessary of all records of utilities in order to correctly determine the amount of such gross revenue.
     </p>
     <p>
      All proceeds of the above-mentioned tax are hereby allocated to the public utilities staff and to the commission in the manner provided in this section for the purpose of this chapter.
     </p>
     <p>

       The 2016 amendment substituted “Department of Revenue” for “State Tax Commission” and “Commissioner of Revenue” for “Tax Commissioner” throughout; added the last two paragraphs; and made a minor stylistic change in the first sentence of the first paragraph.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 2017 amendment, effective June 23, 2017, in the first paragraph, rewrote the third sentence, which read: “The sum of all taxes levied by this section shall not exceed the total legislative appropriation of monies from the ‘Public Utilities Staff Regulation Fund’ and the ‘Public Service Commission Regulation Fund’ for the ensuing fiscal year,” and rewrote the last sentence, which read: “The Department of Revenue shall pay these funds into the State Treasury on the same day collected to the credit of the ‘Public Utilities Staff Regulation Fund’ and to the ‘Public Service Commission Regulation Fund’ in the proportion that the legislative appropriation of monies from each fund for the regulation of utilities for the ensuing fiscal year bears to the total legislative appropriation of monies from both funds for the regulation of utilities for the ensuing fiscal year.”

      The Legislature finds, determines and declares the following to be in the public interest and the policy of the State of Mississippi:
     </p>
     <p>
      To promote and foster the prudent, timely expansion and construction of, and long-term availability of, adequate and appropriate levels of electric generation by electric public utilities, as described in Section 77-3-3(d) (i), with diversity as to the means of such generation and as to the sources of fuel for such generation, including nuclear fuel, coal and other reliable fuel sources;
     </p>
     <p>
      That such availability is essential to the orderly and effective operation of a reliable electric system in this state and will be vital to economic stability and growth within the State of Mississippi and to the public interest, and that the generation and related operations of electric public utilities are affected with the public interest;
     </p>
     <p>
      That new base load electric generating technologies are and will continue to be important in the planning and development of public utility electric generation, and that the State should take advantage of advances in nuclear, coal and other technologies, including technologies that reduce or minimize, or that facilitate the future reduction or minimization of, regulated air emissions;
     </p>
     <p>
      To take advantage of financial and other incentives afforded and provided by the federal Energy Policy Act of 2005 for the construction of certain electric generating facilities and any federal or state legislative or other incentives that may from time to time become available and to require that all such incentives be utilized for the benefit of such generating facilities;
     </p>
     <p>
      To promote and foster economic development; and
     </p>
     <p>
      To promote and foster the State of Mississippi’s energy independence by encouraging the development and utilization of fuel sources derived from the State of Mississippi’s natural resources.

       There was no authorization to impose “mirror construction work in progress” in the Base Load Act; the ratepayers’ money was placed into a regulatory liability account controlled by the Public Service Commission, and thus, the money exacted was not being used to pay for funds used during construction as expenses were incurred but was confiscated through governmental decree by a rate increase imposed by a privately owned corporation that could not spend it.

       Public Service Commission does not have unbridled authority to adopt recovery mechanisms which are not authorized by existing law; while the Base Load Act permits the Commission to include construction work in progress (CWIP) in the utility’s rate base and rates, the Act does not authorize the Commission to adopt an entirely new mechanism, i.e., “mirror CWIP,” a concept not previously recognized in Mississippi rate-making practices.

       By approving increased rates based on “mirror construction work in progress” recovery, the Public Service Commission deprived the ratepayers of their money, and the increased rates were not being used to pay for funds during construction as provided by the Base Load Act but were confiscated through governmental decree by rate increase imposed by a privately owned corporation that could not spend it; the taking of private funds is a transfer of property and results in the deprivation of property.

       If any public utility, other than a municipality, shall fail or refuse to construct within its certificated area any facilities necessary to provide public utility service, or shall fail or refuse to make written commitment to do so, within a reasonable time after written request for such service by any owner of property, which request shall specify with reasonable particularity the type of service desired, such owner may, in addition to any other legal or administrative remedy provided by law and either separately or jointly with any other owner or owners in the area affected, pursue either of the following alternatives or a combination thereof:
      </p>
      <p>
       In the name of such owner or jointly with any other person, firm or corporation, pursuant to the provisions of Section 77-3-13, apply to the Mississippi Public Service Commission for a certificate of public convenience and necessity to construct the appropriate facilities for furnishing such service or services and to furnish the same within the area affected, and, provided the commission finds that the cancellation of the outstanding certificate would be in the best interest of the consuming public as provided by Section 77-3-21, the fact that a certificate for the same type service or services may have been previously issued to the public utility failing or refusing to furnish such service shall not be prejudicial to such application; or
      </p>
      <p>
       File with the Mississippi Public Service Commission a set of proposed plans for construction of such facilities and connection of the same with the system or systems of the utility or utilities affected, such plans to conform in all respects to all reasonable requirements of said commission and any other public body having lawful authority to establish standards of construction. The owner shall give twenty (20) days’ notice of such filing to said commission and any other public bodies aforesaid and to the public utility or utilities holding a certificate for the area affected. If, after such notice and opportunity for protest and hearing thereon, the commission shall approve such plans or any modification thereof as being supported by present or future public convenience and necessity, the owner may give notice as hereinafter provided and then proceed to let contracts for the construction of the same or to construct the same and, upon proper completion thereof and conveyance or assignment of such facilities and easements to the utility, the holder of the certificate for the area and service affected shall be obliged promptly to connect the same to its systems and provide such service.

       If such plans or any modification thereof shall be approved by the commission as provided by paragraph (b) of Section 77-3-203, the commission may enter an order either in conjunction with such approval, if notice has sufficiently dealt with the subject matter, or pursuant to special application and notice thereof to the parties, that will determine whether the right and responsibility of constructing the facilities for making such connection shall devolve on the owner or the utility and whether the whole or any part of the reasonable expense of connecting such facilities with the system or systems of the utility or utilities affected should be borne initially by such utility or utilities. If the commission should relieve any utility affected from initially undertaking the whole or any part of such connection expense, the commission may nevertheless include the portion of such expense to be initially borne by the owner in the cost of facilities for which the owner may be reimbursed as hereinafter provided.

If no such agreement can be reached, the owner may publish notice that bids will be received for construction of the same, which notice shall be published in the manner and for the time as required by law for publication of such notices with respect to contracts for construction by boards of supervisors of counties of this state.

      In the event any domestic telephone or telegraph company has, within eighteen months prior to May 7, 1940, sold, leased or transferred any of its franchises or properties within the State of Mississippi, then that person, firm or corporation to whom such properties were sold, leased or transferred, or any successor in title thereto, shall be under the obligation to render such telephone or telegraph service in a reasonably adequate manner, and the commission shall have the authority, upon petition of the attorney general, to proceed to investigate the operation of the telephone or telegraph business of the vendee, lessee or transferee, or any successor in title, in the same manner as is provided for in this article as to the domestic corporations. If the commission shall find, after such hearing as provided for domestic corporations, that such vendee, lessee or transferee, or any successor in title, is not rendering such service in a reasonably adequate manner, then the commission shall have the authority to require such changes to be made as it could in the case of domestic corporations, and if such changes are not made as required by the commission, then the commission shall have the authority to forfeit the right of such vendee, lessee, transferee, or any successor in title thereto, to operate a telephone or telegraph business. If the commission shall find that such vendee, lessee, transferee, or any successor in title, cannot be reasonably expected to render such service in a reasonably adequate manner, then the commission shall have the authority to forfeit the right of such vendee, lessee or transferee, or any successor in title, to operate a telephone or telegraph business within Mississippi, and shall appoint trustees for such business, as provided for in Section 77-3-419.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Any telephone solicitor shall apply for a certificate of registration from the Office of the Attorney General as a condition for doing business in this state. The certificate of registration shall be in a form as prescribed by the Attorney General.
     </p>
     <p>
      The application for a certificate of registration shall be accompanied by a surety bond in the penal sum of Seventy-five Thousand Dollars ($75,000.00) with conditions and in a form prescribed by the Attorney General. The bond shall provide for the indemnification of any person suffering loss as the result of any fraud, misrepresentation or violation of Sections 77-3-601 through 77-3-619 by the principal. The term of the bond shall be continuous, but it shall be subject to cancellation by the surety in the manner described in this section. The surety may terminate the bond upon giving a sixty-day written notice to the principal and to the Attorney General, but the liability of the surety for acts of the principal and its agents shall continue during the sixty (60) days of cancellation notice. The notice does not absolve the surety from liability which accrues before the cancellation becomes final but which is discovered after that date and which may have arisen at any time during the term of the bond. Unless the bond is replaced by that of another surety before the expiration of the sixty (60) days’ notice of cancellation, the certificate of registration shall be suspended. Any person required pursuant to this section to file a bond with an application for a certificate of registration may file, in lieu thereof, cash, a certificate of deposit, or government bonds in the amount of Seventy-five Thousand Dollars ($75,000.00). Such deposit is subject to the same terms and conditions as are provided for in the surety bond required herein. Any interest or earnings on such deposits are payable to the depositor.

      “Established business relationship” means a prior or existing relationship formed by a voluntary two-way communication between a person or entity and a consumer, with or without an exchange of consideration, on the basis of an inquiry, application, purchase or transaction by the consumer, which relationship is currently existing or was terminated within six (6) months of the telephone solicitation; however, the act of purchasing consumer goods or services under an extension of credit does not create an existing business relationship between the consumer and the entity extending credit to the consumer for such purchase. The term does not include the situation wherein the consumer has merely been subject to a telephone solicitation by or at the behest of the telephone solicitor within the six (6) months immediately preceding the contemplated telephone solicitation.

    Commission’s discretion to exempt some telephone solicitors from purchase and use of no-calls database.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The commission, in its discretion, may allow telephone solicitors to make telephone solicitations without requiring them to purchase the “no-calls” database, and regardless of whether a telephone solicitation may be made to a consumer who has given notice of his objection to receiving such solicitations, provided that it adopts a written policy incorporating the following criteria:
     </p>
     <p>
      The telephone solicitor must demonstrate to the commission that its proposed telephone solicitation is reasonably related to an established business relationship as defined in Section 77-3-705(h), or is being made in response to an invitation or notice from a consumer which clearly signifies that he is open to a contact being initiated;
     </p>
     <p>
      The telephone solicitation is to be made by a person or entity for the purpose of soliciting a contribution or donation to a bona fide nonprofit corporation, regardless of whether consumer goods or services will be provided to the consumer in return for the contribution or donation; or
     </p>
     <p>
      The consumer will not be telephoned for a telephone solicitation as defined in Section 77-3-705(d), but he will be telephoned for a bona fide religious or charitable purpose, including an invitation to attend an event or a request for a contribution or donation.
     </p>
     <p>
      In all cases, the telephone solicitor must demonstrate that it will not use an automated dialing system or a method that will block or otherwise circumvent the consumer’s use of a caller identification service.
     </p>
     <p>
      In making its determination of whether to allow a telephone solicitation to be made under the policy which will include the limitations set forth in this section, the commission shall exercise due care in investigating previous conduct of the telephone solicitor seeking such authority. The commission may deny any telephone solicitor the privilege of making telephone solicitations under this section, notwithstanding that any of the criteria set forth in this section have been met.

       In light of 47 USCS § 227(e)(1)’s carefully-drafted language and legislative history, and in spite of presumption against preemption that attaches to State’s exercise of its police power, there is inherent federal objective in Truth in Caller ID Act of 2009 to protect non-harmful spoofing; Mississippi Caller ID Anti-Spoofing Act’s proscription of non-harmful spoofing (spoofing done without intent to defraud, cause harm, or wrongfully obtain anything of value) frustrates this federal objective and is, therefore, conflict-preempted. Teltech Sys. v. Bryant, 702 F.3d 232, 2012 U.S. App. LEXIS 25217 (5th Cir. Miss. 2012).

       Because court held that Mississippi Caller ID Anti-Spoofing Act was conflict-preempted by Truth in Caller ID Act of 2009, court did not need to consider its validity under dormant Commerce Clause or First Amendment.

     <p>
      Whenever a district shall, by resolution of its board, determine that it is in the public interest and in the interest of efficient and economical operation of a utility to alter the territorial limits of a district, it shall so order and certified copies of such order shall be filed with the secretary of state, the clerk of each municipality in the district and the clerk of the board of supervisors of each county in which any portion of the district is located. Thereupon the territorial limits of a district shall be considered altered in accordance with such order. However, any territory added to a district must be coterminous with an election unit or units. No additional territory may be added to a district except upon the petition of not less than one-third (1/3) of the qualified voters residing therein, certified as provided in Section 77-5-109. The order of the board hereinabove referred to shall contain a statement of the number and percentage of such petitioners, if any. In the event the boundaries of any election unit or units are changed subsequent to the creation of a district, then the whole of any election unit, any part of which was theretofore within the district, shall automatically become a part of said district.

    Exercise of eminent domain by district.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Any district shall have the power to condemn any land, easements, or rights of way either on, under or above the ground as the board may deem necessary for any of the purposes mentioned in this article, and such property or interest in such property may be so acquired whether or not the same is owned or held for public use by corporations, associations or persons having the power of eminent domain, or otherwise held or used for public purposes. Such power of condemnation may be exercised in the mode or method of procedure prescribed by Chapter 27 of Title 11, Mississippi Code of 1972, or in the mode or method or procedure prescribed by any other applicable statutory provisions now in force or hereafter enacted for the exercise of the power of eminent domain. Where condemnation proceedings become necessary the judge of the circuit court in which such proceedings are filed shall upon application of the district and upon the deposit in the court, to the use of the person or persons lawfully entitled thereto, of such an amount as the judge may deem necessary to assure just compensation, order that the right of possession shall issue immediately or as soon and upon such terms as the judge in his discretion, may deem proper and just. Upon application of the parties in interest, the judge may order that the money deposited in the court, or any part thereof, be paid forthwith for or on account of the just compensation to be awarded in said proceedings.

      Each district shall have power and is hereby authorized from time to time to issue its bonds in anticipation of its revenues. Said bonds may be issued for any corporate purpose or purposes of such district. Said bonds shall be authorized by resolution of the board of such district and may be issued in one or more series, may bear such date or dates, mature at such time or times not exceeding forty years from their respective dates, be in such denominations, be in such form, either coupon or registered, be executed in such manner, be payable in such medium of payment, at such place or places, be subject to such terms of redemption, with or without premium, and be declared or become due before the maturity date thereof, as such resolution or resolutions may provide. Said bonds may be issued for money or property, at public or private sale for such price or prices, as the board shall determine, provided that the interest cost to maturity of the money or property (at its value as determined by such board, the determination of which shall be conclusive), received for any issue of said bonds, shall not exceed six (6) per centum per annum, payable semiannually. Said bonds may be repurchased by the district out of any funds available for such purpose at a price of not more than the principal amount thereof and accrued interest, and all bonds so repurchased shall be canceled. Pending the preparation or execution of definitive bonds, interim receipts or certificates or temporary bonds may be delivered to the purchaser of said bonds. Any provision of law to the contrary notwithstanding, any bonds and the interest coupons appertaining thereto, if any, issued pursuant to this article shall possess all of the qualities of negotiable instruments.

     </p>
     <p>
      By action or suit in equity to enjoin any acts or things which may be unlawful or a violation of the rights of such bondholder.

    Amendment of certificate of incorporation.

     <p>
      A corporation may amend its certificate of incorporation to change its corporate name, to increase or reduce the number of its directors, or to change any other provisions therein. Notwithstanding any provisions of a corporation’s certificate of incorporation to the contrary, if a corporation’s certificate of incorporation provides that the period of duration of the corporation is a limited number of years, the corporation may amend its certificate to provide that the duration of the corporation is perpetual if such an amendment is authorized by the board of directors of the corporation pursuant to the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the directors. Otherwise, and not withstanding any provisions of a corporation’s certificate of incorporation to the contrary, a corporation may amend its certificate of incorporation if (a) the amendment is authorized by the board of directors of the corporation pursuant to the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the directors, and (b) the amendment authorized by the board of directors is ratified by sixty percent (60%) of the corporation’s members voting, at either the corporation’s annual meeting or at a meeting of the members called for the special purpose of considering and voting on the amendment. Written notice of any meeting at which an amendment to the corporation’s certificate of incorporation will be voted on by the members must be sent to the corporation’s members at least thirty (30) days prior to the date of the meeting. The notice shall set forth the date, time, location and purpose of the meeting, and identify and describe the purpose of the amendment authorized by the corporation’s board of directors. In the event an amendment is fully authorized in accordance with the foregoing, a certificate reflecting the amendment to the certificate of incorporation shall be prepared and executed by the president and by the secretary of the corporation who shall both affirm therein, under oath, that they have been authorized by the corporation to execute and file such certificate. Such certificate of amendment shall then be filed by the corporation in the Office of the Secretary of State, who shall forthwith cause this certificate to be handled in the manner prescribed in Section 77-5-211 for original certificates of incorporation; and the amendment of the corporation’s certificate or articles of incorporation shall be effective as of the date on which the certificate of amendment is filed with the Secretary of State, and the powers specified in the certificate of amendment shall thereupon be vested in the corporation without further formalities.

However, no corporation shall amend its certificate of incorporation to embody therein any purpose, power or provision which would not be authorized if its original certificate including such additional or changed purpose, power or provision were offered for filing at the time a certificate under this section is offered.

      </p>

       “(a) The name of the corporation, and if it has been changed the name under which it was originally incorporated.

     <p>
      A corporation shall have a board of directors, and the powers of the corporation shall be vested in and exercised by such board of directors. The directors of the corporation, other than those named in a certificate of incorporation, shall be elected annually by the members entitled to vote. The initial directors of the corporation, including directors elected to succeed those named in a certificate of incorporation, shall be elected as follows: one-third (1/3) to be elected for a term of one (1) year, one-third (1/3) for a term of two (2) years, and one-third (1/3) for a term of three (3) years. Thereafter, all directors shall be elected for a term of three (3) years, or for such other term(s) as may be subscribed by the corporation’s certificate of incorporation. Only members of the corporation shall be entitled to vote. The directors of a corporation must be members of the corporation. In order to qualify as a candidate for director of a corporation by petition, a candidate shall obtain not less than fifty (50) signatures of members of the corporation on whose board such candidate wishes to serve; however, a corporation shall be empowered, in its discretion, to adopt, through its bylaws, provisions which allow a person to qualify as a candidate for director by petition by obtaining less than fifty (50) signatures or by other less restrictive means. The directors shall be entitled to reimbursement for expenses incurred by them in the performance of their duties. In addition to reimbursement for expenses, the board may authorize compensation and benefits to be paid to and on behalf of such directors for the performance of their duties, including for the time it takes for them to travel to and from meetings and to board functions. The board shall elect periodically from its own number officers as prescribed by the corporation’s bylaws. Directors may elect to attend the board meetings by telephone or video conference. All board meetings, unless in executive session, shall be open to any member of a corporation. Subject to the limitations below, any member or customer of a corporation shall be entitled to address the board at any regular meeting regarding any suggestions for better service, grievances or any other matter affecting the corporation. The board shall have the right to impose reasonable limitations upon the number of members or customers addressing any one (1) board meeting and the amount of time allotted to each presentation, and also to require members and customers to give the board reasonable advance notice of their desire to address the board so that the board may investigate and be able to respond to the presentation.

       The 2016 amendment substituted references to “mediate” and “mediation” for “arbitrate” and “arbitration” throughout the section; in (1), added “Subject to the limitations herein” at the beginning, and divided the former third sentence, which read: “Investigation, review and arbitration shall be commenced upon the filing of a petition with the Public Service Commission by a member or customer of a corporation,” into the present third and fourth sentences; in (2), in the first sentence, inserted “and the member or customer” and substituted “reports concerning the dispute which” for “reports concerning operation of the corporation which,” rewrote the second sentence, which read: “The Public Service Commission is further authorized to conduct and shall conduct, or direct the corporation staff to conduct, investigation of and informal hearings in the dispute and may negotiate with the corporation and the customer for the resolution thereof,” and in the third sentence, substituted “Commission may perform only such” for “Commission shall perform such,” inserted “relating to the dispute” and deleted “without commencement of litigation” preceding “between the corporation”; and rewrote (3), which read: “Participation in any investigation, proceeding, negotiation or settlement under the provisions of this section shall be voluntary by the corporation and the member or customer; however, no suit may be commenced in any court of this state by either the corporation or member or customer based upon the facts giving rise to the dispute for a period of sixty (60) days after a petition is filed with the Public Service Commission under this section.”

       As used herein, the phrase “generation and transmission cooperative” or “G&T cooperative” shall mean a corporation that is formed under this article for the primary purpose of providing wholesale power supply to its members as a wholesale power supply cooperative, and whose membership is comprised of a group of corporations that are formed under this article and have certificates of public convenience and necessity providing the exclusive right and authority to provide retail electric service within their respective certificated service territories.
      </li>
      <li id="t77c05s77-5-256ol12">
       The following additional provisions apply to G&T cooperatives:
       <ol type="a">
        <li id="t77c05s77-5-256ol12a">
         A G&T cooperative may amend its certificate of incorporation to change its corporate name, to increase or reduce the number of its directors, or to change any other provisions therein. Notwithstanding any provisions of a G&T cooperative’s certificate of incorporation to the contrary and notwithstanding any provisions of Section 77-5-215, a G&T cooperative may amend its certificate of incorporation if the amendment is authorized by the board of directors of the G&T cooperative pursuant to the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the directors. In the event an amendment is authorized in accordance with the foregoing, a certificate reflecting the amendment to the certificate of incorporation shall be prepared and executed by the president and by the secretary of the G&T cooperative who shall both affirm therein, under oath, that they have been authorized by the G&T cooperative to execute and file such certificate. Such certificate of amendment shall then be filed by the G&T cooperative in the Office of the Secretary of State, who shall forthwith cause this certificate to be handled in the manner prescribed in Section 77-5-211 for original certificates of incorporation; and the amendment of the G&T cooperative’s certificate or articles of incorporation shall be effective as of the date on which the certificate of amendment is filed with the Secretary of State, and the powers specified in the certificate of amendment shall thereupon be vested in the G&T cooperative without further formalities.
        </li>
        <li id="t77c05s77-5-256ol12b">
         A G&T cooperative shall have a board of directors, and the powers of the G&T cooperative shall be vested in and exercised by such board of directors. The directors of the G&T cooperative, other than those named in a certificate of incorporation, shall be elected by the members of the G&T cooperative. The board of directors shall include two (2) directors from each member of the G&T cooperative, with one of those directors being the general manager or chief executive of the member and the other being a sitting director on the member’s board of directors. The bylaws of a G&T cooperative may also provide for up to three (3) at-large directors to be elected by sitting members of the board of directors, with such qualifications to be an at-large director within the discretion of the board of directors. All directors shall be elected for a term of three (3) years, or for such other term(s) as may be prescribed by the corporation’s certificate of incorporation. The directors shall be entitled to reimbursement for expenses incurred by them in the performance of their duties. In addition to causing the G&T cooperative to reimburse directors for expenses, the board may authorize compensation and benefits to be paid to and on behalf of such directors for the performance of their duties including for the time it takes for them to travel to and from meetings and to board functions. The board shall elect periodically from its own number officers as prescribed by the corporation’s bylaws. Directors may elect to attend the board meetings by telephone or video conference. The board may set procedures by which its meetings will be conducted and rule will be by majority vote except where a super majority is required by its articles of incorporation or bylaws.

        <li id="t77c05s77-5-256ol12c">
         The corporate purpose of a G&T cooperative shall be to render service primarily to its members. After initial incorporation, any corporation formed or operating under this article may become and remain a member if such corporation is accepted into membership by a unanimous vote of the board of directors and complies with the terms and conditions in respect to membership contained in the bylaws of such G&T cooperative. The membership fee of the G&T cooperative shall be fixed by the board of directors. A G&T cooperative may provide capacity, energy, or transmission to a regional transmission market, and independent system operator, or other similar organized market, to the extent provision of such service is expected to provide a direct or indirect benefit to the G&T cooperative’s membership. A G&T cooperative has the power to operate across state lines.
        </li>
        <li id="t77c05s77-5-256ol12d">
         A G&T cooperative has the power to provide support to its members in their operations, including, but not limited to, accounting, legal, regulatory, engineering, and other areas in which its members determine it is desirable for the generation and transmission corporation to house certain expertise.
        </li>
        <li id="t77c05s77-5-256ol12e">
         These provisions are in addition to those applicable to corporations formed or operating under this article that are not G&T cooperatives and are not to be construed as limitations on the powers or authorities of G&T cooperatives in comparison to corporations that are not G&T cooperatives.
        </li>
        <li id="t77c05s77-5-256ol12f">
         It is hereby recognized that generation and transmission cooperatives are subject to rules, regulations and requirements from the Rural Utilities Service, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, as well as the rules and requirements of regional transmission organizations to which they belong and to competitive pressures from the wholesale market. In order to clarify the extent to which a generation and transmission cooperative is subject to regulation by the Mississippi Public Service Commission pursuant to Section 77-3-5, the Legislature declares that a generation and transmission cooperative is only subject to the provisions of Sections 77-3-11, 77-3-13, 77-3-14, 77-3-23, 77-3-25 and 77-3-27, and also subject to the provisions of Section 77-3-45, and any rules promulgated thereby to the extent such rules are necessary for the Mississippi Public Service Commission to carry out its responsibilities under such code sections. The policy objectives identified in Section 77-3-2 and the definitions provided in Section 77-3-3 shall be applicable to such code sections listed above as applied to generation and transmission cooperatives.

In order to avoid the inefficiencies and confusion caused by duplicative, overlapping and conflicting jurisdiction and regulations, it is hereby declared that the Mississippi Public Service Commission and political subdivisions of the state shall not have jurisdiction over and shall not regulate those portions or aspects of a corporation’s operations, facilities, services, or rates that are regulated by the Tennessee Valley Authority. In the event of a dispute between the Mississippi Public Service Commission (commission) and the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) over the existence or scope of TVA’s regulatory authority, the commission shall defer to TVA’s asserted authority unless and until the commission has obtained a favorable, final, and nonappealable declaratory judgment against TVA in a court of competent jurisdiction. In any such suit, the commission shall not force a corporation(s) to incur legal fees and expenses by naming them as a party, though a corporation shall maintain the right to seek voluntary intervention under the rules of the court in which the action is pending.

For this purpose the boards of supervisors of the counties, and/or the governing authorities of the municipalities, are authorized and empowered to arrange by contract all the details for the erection, construction, maintenance, operation, and control of such property, the sharing of the costs, and/or the distribution of power, and the selection of a governing body to control and handle said property.

      In the event the board of supervisors of any county shall decide to exercise the powers authorized by this article, it shall adopt an ordinance expressing such intention and outlining the nature of the project and/or projects to be undertaken, and fix the maximum sum to be expended on said project for the erection, construction, improvement, and/or purchase of any of the property authorized to be acquired by this article. The board shall give notice of such intention by publication in a newspaper having a general circulation in or published in said county for at least once a week for three successive weeks. It shall only be necessary that said notice shall state that the board has declared its intention to avail itself of the powers granted by this article, and to name the maximum amount proposed to be invested in the projects proposed.

      In the event that twenty percent (20%) of the qualified voters shall file such written petition protesting against such proposed projects, the board must call a special election, before proceeding further, giving notice of the date of such election by publication in a newspaper published in the county or having a general circulation in said county, at least once each week for three successive weeks, the first publication of which must be at least thirty (30) days before the date of the election. The board of supervisors shall have the power to fix the date of such election, and such election shall be conducted as other special elections are conducted. If a majority of the qualified electors voting in such election shall vote in favor of such project, the board of supervisors shall have the power to put the same into effect. The board of supervisors may, in its discretion, call a special election without a petition of protest being filed, which shall be conducted in the same manner as heretofore outlined.

       Owner of an electrical distribution system may question validity of a municipal bond issue for construction of a competing system without inviting other taxpayers to join.

       Statement in an election notice that the purpose of raising funds was to “acquire by construction or purchase or both by construction and purchase,” an electric plant was sufficient without stating specifically whether the acquisition was to be by construction or by acquiring the electric plant of another.

      The board shall be created in the following manner. At the time the governing body of a municipality issuing bonds under the provisions of this article determines that a majority of the qualified voters voting on the electric resolution have assented to the bond issue for the acquisition of an electric plant, the chief executive officer of the municipality shall, or if no such bonds are issued or if the municipality has a population of less than two thousand (2,000), then at any time he may, with the consent of the governing body of the municipality, appoint two (2) or four (4) men from among the property holders of such municipality who are residents of the municipality and have resided therein for not less than one (1) year next preceding the date of appointment to such board. No regular compensated officer or employee of a municipality shall be eligible for such appointment until at least one (1) year after the expiration of the term of his public office.

The term of such member shall be for such time as the appointing officer may fix, but in no event shall it extend beyond such appointee’s term of office in such governing body. Appointments to complete unexpired terms of office shall be made in the same manner as original appointments.

      The supervisory body of a municipality proceeding under the terms of this article shall devote all moneys derived from any source other than the issuance of bonds to or for the payment of all operating expenses; bond interest and retirement and/or sinking fund payments; the acquisition and improvement of the electric plant; contingencies; the payment of other obligations incurred in the operation and maintenance of the electric plant and the furnishing of electric service; the redemption and purchase of electric plant bonds in which case such bonds shall be canceled; the creation and maintenance of a cash working fund; the payment of an amount to the general funds of the municipality not to exceed a cumulative return of six percent (6%) per annum of the equity or investment, if any, of the municipality; and, if the governing body of the municipality shall by resolution so request, payments to the municipality in lieu of ad valorem taxes on the property of the electric plant within the corporate or county limits of the municipality not to exceed the amount of taxes payable on privately owned property of similar nature. Any surplus thereafter remaining after establishment of proper reserves, if any, shall be devoted solely to the reduction of rates. In computing the equity or investment of the municipality, the value of the electric plant shall be taken as its historical cost, less the accrued depreciation as of the date of the first exercise by the municipality of the powers conferred by this article. The payment of bonds or the acquisition or improvement of property from the receipts derived from electric service or any other operation of the supervisory body as such shall not be considered to increase the equity or investment of the municipality.

    Declaration of purpose.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The legislature of the State of Mississippi hereby finds and determines that:
     </p>
     <p>
      A critical situation exists with respect to the present and future supply of electric power and energy in the State of Mississippi;
     </p>
     <p>
      The cost of energy either purchased at wholesale or generated by said electrical utilities has caused the cost of electricity to consumers to increase dramatically during the past few years;
     </p>
     <p>
      Many municipalities in the state have for many years owned and operated systems for the generation and/or distribution of electric power and energy to customers in their respective areas and are empowered severally to engage in the generation and transmission of electric power and energy.
     </p>
     <p>
      Such municipalities owning electric generation and/or distribution systems have an obligation to provide their inhabitants and customers the most adequate, reliable and economical source of electric power and energy in the future that may be available to them;
     </p>
     <p>
      In order to achieve the economies and efficiencies made possible by the proper planning, acquisition, construction, financing, sizing and location of facilities for the generation and/or transmission of electric power and energy which may not be practical for any municipality acting alone, and to insure an adequate, reliable and economical supply of electric power and energy to the people of the state, it is desirable for the State of Mississippi to authorize municipal electric systems and/or joint agencies created pursuant to this article to jointly or severally plan, acquire, construct, finance, develop, own, operate and maintain electric generation and/or transmission facilities with each other, or any person, firm, association or corporation, public or private, engaged in the generation, transmission or distribution of electric power and energy within this state or any other state, all as may be appropriate to their needs in order to provide for their present and future power requirement for all uses without supplanting or displacing the service at retail of other electric suppliers operating in the state; and
     </p>
     <p>
      The joint planning, financing, development, ownership and operation of electric generation and/or transmission facilities by municipalities which own electric generation and/or distribution systems or by joint agencies created pursuant to this article and the issuance of revenue bonds for such purposes as provided in this article is for public use and for public and municipal purposes and is a means of achieving economies, adequacy and reliability in the generation and/or transmission of electric power and energy and the meeting of future needs of the state and its inhabitants.

    Powers of municipality; determining power and energy needs; filing of determination.

     </h3>
     <p>
      In addition and supplemental to the powers otherwise conferred on municipalities by the laws of the state, and in order to accomplish the purposes of this article and to obtain a supply of electric power and energy for the present and future needs of its inhabitants and customers, a municipality may plan, finance, develop, construct, reconstruct, acquire, improve, enlarge, better, own, operate and maintain an undivided interest as a tenant in common in a project situated within or without the state jointly with one or more other municipalities, or with a joint agency created pursuant to this article, or with municipal corporations or political subdivisions of other states (to the extent permitted by the laws of such other states), or with any other federal, state or municipal agency which owns electric generation, transmission or distribution facilities or with any person, firm, association or corporation, public or private, engaged in the generation, transmission or distribution of electric power and energy either within or without this state, and may make such plans and enter into such contracts in connection therewith, not inconsistent with the provisions of this article, as are necessary or appropriate.
     </p>
     <p>
      Prior to acquiring any such undivided interest, the utility commission shall determine the needs of the municipality for power and energy based upon engineering studies and reports, and shall not acquire an undivided interest as a tenant in common in a project in excess of that amount of capacity and the energy associated therewith required to provide for its projected needs for power and energy from and after the date the project is estimated to be placed in normal continuous operation and for such reasonable period of time thereafter as shall be determined by the utility commission. In determining the future power requirements of a municipality, there shall be taken into account the following:
     </p>
     <p>
      The economies and efficiencies estimated to be achieved in acquiring, constructing and operating the proposed facilities for the generation and transmission of electric power and energy;
     </p>
     <p>
      The municipality’s estimated requirements for power and energy from the project and for reserve capacity and to meet obligations under pooling and reserve sharing agreements reasonably related to its needs for power and energy to which it is or may become a party; and
     </p>
     <p>
      The cost of existing or alternative power supply sources.
     </p>
     <p>
      A determination by such utility commission approved by the governing authorities as herein provided, based upon appropriate findings of the foregoing matters, shall be conclusive as to the quantity of the interest which a municipality may acquire in a project. Any determination by the utilities commission shall be filed with the governing authorities of the municipality and recorded in the official minutes of the governing authorities. Notice of the filing of such determination shall be published one (1) time in a newspaper having a general circulation in the municipality, and shall specify a date, not less than ten (10) days after the publication of such notice at which the governing authorities of such municipality shall meet to hear any objections or remonstrances that may be made. At said meeting, the governing authorities shall consider the objections or protests, if any, and shall at said meeting or at any adjourned meeting, ratify or reject the determination of the utility commission. Any person or party objecting or protesting the determination at said meeting, who is aggrieved by the ratification thereof, shall file an appeal pursuant to Section 11-51-75.
     </p>
     <p>
      Nothing herein contained shall prevent a municipality or municipalities from undertaking studies to determine whether there is a need for a project or whether such project is feasible.
     </p>
     <p>
      For the purposes of this section, the terms “municipality” and “utility commission” shall not include a joint agency or the board of commissioners thereof.

     </p>
     <p>

       § 77-5-717.
    Creation of joint agencies; application process; issuance of certificate of incorporation.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The utility commissions of two (2) or more municipalities may, by resolution or ordinance, determine that it is in the best interests of the municipalities in accomplishing the purposes of this article to create a joint agency as prescribed herein for the purpose of undertaking the planning, financing, development, acquisition, construction, reconstruction, improvement, enlargement, betterment, operation and maintenance of a project or projects to supply electric power and energy for their present or future needs as an alternative or supplemental method of obtaining the benefits and assuming the responsibilities of ownership in a project. In determining whether or not the creation of a joint agency for such purpose is in the best interests of the municipalities, the utility commissions shall take into consideration, but shall not be limited to, the following:
     </p>
     <p>
      Whether or not a separate entity may be able to finance the cost of projects in a more efficient and economical manner;
     </p>
     <p>
      Whether or not better financial market acceptance may result if one (1) entity is responsible for issuing all of the bonds required for a project or projects in a timely and orderly manner and with a uniform credit rating instead of multiple entities issuing separate issues of bonds;
     </p>
     <p>
      Whether or not savings and other advantages may be obtained by providing a separate entity responsible for the acquisition, construction, ownership and operation of a project or projects; and
     </p>
     <p>
      Whether or not the existence of such a separate entity will foster the continuation of joint planning and undertaking of projects, and the resulting economies and efficiencies to be derived from such joint planning and undertaking.
     </p>
     <p>
      If each utility commission shall determine that it is in the best interest of the municipality to create a joint agency to provide power and energy to the municipality as provided in this article, each shall adopt a resolution so finding (which need not prescribe in detail the basis for the determination) and which shall set forth the names of the municipalities which are proposed to be initial members of the joint agency. Said resolution shall be certified to the governing authorities who shall thereupon disapprove or ratify the determination of said utility commission by resolution or ordinance spread upon its official minutes. The governing authority shall cause notice of such determination to be given to the presiding officer of the utility commission of the municipality, which utility commission shall thereupon appoint in writing one (1) commissioner of the joint agency, which commissioner may, in the discretion of the utility commission be an officer or employee of the municipality.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any two (2) or more commissioners so named may file with the secretary of state an application signed by them setting forth (i) the names of all proposed member municipalities; (ii) the name and official residence of each of the commissioners so far as known to them; (iii) a certified copy of the appointment evidencing their right to office; (iv) a statement that each utility commission of each respective municipality appointing a commissioner has made the aforesaid determination; (v) a statement that each governing authority of each respective municipality has ratified the determination of the utility commission; (vi) the desire that a joint agency be organized as a public body and a body corporate and politic under this article; and (vii) the name which is proposed for the joint agency.
     </p>
     <p>
      The application shall be subscribed and sworn to by such commissioners before an officer or officers authorized by the laws of the state to administer and certify oaths, and shall be accompanied by a fee in the amount of fifty dollars ($50.00) payable to the secretary of state as a filing fee.
     </p>
     <p>
      The secretary of state shall examine the application and, if he finds that the name proposed for the joint agency is not identical with that of any other corporation of this state or of any agency or instrumentality thereof, or so nearly similar as to lead to confusion and uncertainty, he shall receive and file it and shall record it in an appropriate book of record in his office.
     </p>
     <p>
      When the application has been made, filed and recorded as herein provided, the joint agency shall constitute a public body and a body corporate and politic under the name proposed in the application. The secretary of state shall make and issue to the commissioners executing the application a certificate of incorporation pursuant to this article under the seal of the state, and shall record the same with the application. The certificate shall set forth the names of the member municipalities.
     </p>
     <p>
      In any suit, action or proceeding involving the validity or enforcement of, or relating to, any contract of the joint agency, the joint agency, in the absence of establishing fraud in the premises, shall be conclusively deemed to have been established in accordance with the provisions of this article upon proof of the issuance of the aforesaid certificate by the secretary of state. A copy of such certificate, duly certified by the secretary of state, shall be admissible in evidence in any such suit, action or proceeding, and shall be conclusive proof of the filing and contents thereof.
     </p>
     <p>
      Notice of the issuance of such certificate shall be given to all of the proposed member municipalities by the secretary of state. If a commissioner of any such municipality has not signed the application to the secretary of state and such municipality does not notify the secretary of state of the appointment of a commissioner within forty (40) days after receipt of such notice, such municipality shall be deemed to have elected not to be a member of the joint agency. As soon as practicable after the expiration of such period of forty (40) days, the secretary of state shall issue a new certificate of incorporation, if necessary, setting forth the names of those municipalities which have elected to become members of the joint agency. The failure of any proposed member to become a member shall not affect the validity of the corporate existence of the joint agency.

    Board of commissioners of joint agency; officers; quorum; voting; expenses.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The joint agency shall consist of a board of commissioners appointed by the respective utility commissions of the municipalities which are members of the joint agency. Each municipality shall appoint one (1) commissioner who may, at the discretion of the municipality, be an officer or employee of the municipality, the appointment to be made by resolution. Each commissioner shall have not less than one (1) vote and may have in addition thereto such additional votes as the utility commissions of a majority of the municipalities which are members of the joint agency shall determine. After any initial determination of the number of additional votes which the commissioners may have has been made, such additional votes shall not thereafter be changed except by unanimous consent of the municipalities which are members of the joint agency. Each commissioner shall serve at the pleasure of the utility commission by which he was appointed. Each appointed commissioner before entering upon his duties shall enter into bond with a corporate surety in an amount not less than ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00), conditioned on the faithful performance of his duties, and shall take and subscribe to an oath before some person authorized by law to administer oaths to execute the duties of his office faithfully and impartially, and such bond and oath shall be filed with the governing authority of the appointing municipality and spread upon its minutes. The premiums on such bonds shall be paid by the joint agency.
     </p>
     <p>
      The board of commissioners of the joint agency shall annually elect one (1) of the commissioners as chairman, another as vice chairman, and another person or persons, who may but need not be commissioners, as treasurer, secretary, and if desired, assistant secretary. The treasurer shall enter into bond with a corporate surety in such amount of not less than twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000.00), as may be determined by the commissioners. The office of treasurer may be held by the secretary or assistant secretary. The board of commissioners may also appoint such additional officers as it deems necessary. The secretary or assistant secretary of the joint agency shall keep a record of the proceedings of the joint agency, and the secretary shall be the custodian of all records, books, documents and papers filed with the joint agency, the minute book or journal of the joint agency and its official seal. Either the secretary or the assistant secretary of the joint agency may cause copies to be made of all minutes and other records and documents of the joint agency and may give certificates under the official seal of the joint agency to the effect that such copies are true copies, and all persons dealing with the joint agency may rely upon such certificates.
     </p>
     <p>
      A majority of the commissioners of a joint agency then in office shall constitute a quorum. A vacancy in the board of commissioners of the joint agency shall not impair the right of a quorum to exercise all the rights and perform all the duties of the joint agency. Any action taken by the joint agency under the provisions of this article may be authorized by resolution at any regular or special meeting, and each such resolution shall take effect immediately and need not be published or posted. A majority of the votes which the commissioners present are entitled to cast shall be necessary and sufficient to take any action or to pass any resolution, provided that such commissioners present are entitled to cast a majority of the votes of all commissioners of the board.
     </p>
     <p>
      No commissioner of a joint agency shall receive any compensation for the performance of his duties hereunder, provided, however, that each commissioner may be paid his necessary expenses incurred while engaged in the performance of such duties.

    Determining appropriateness of projects to be undertaken by joint agencies; objections; appeal process.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      No joint agency shall undertake any project required to be financed, in whole or in part, with the proceeds of bonds without the approval of a majority of its members. Before undertaking any project, a joint agency shall, based upon engineering studies and reports, determine that such project is required to provide for the projected needs for power and energy of its members from and after the date the project is estimated to be placed in normal and continuous operation and for a reasonable period of time thereafter. In determining the future power requirements of the members of a joint agency, there shall be taken into account the following:
     </p>
     <p>
      The economies and efficiencies estimated to be achieved in acquiring, constructing and operating the proposed facilities for the generation and transmission of electric power and energy;
     </p>
     <p>
      The estimated requirements for power and energy and for reserve capacity and to meet obligations under pooling and reserve sharing agreements reasonably related to its needs for power and energy to which the joint agency is or may become a party; and
     </p>
     <p>
      The cost of such existing alternative power supply sources.
     </p>
     <p>
      A determinationby the joint agency based upon appropriate findings of the foregoingmatters shall be conclusive as to the appropriateness of a projectto provide the needs of the members of a joint agency for power andenergy unless an interested party aggrieved by the determination ofsaid joint agency shall file an appeal therefrom as herein provided.Notice of the determination by the joint agency shall be publishedone (1) time in one or more newspapers having general circulationin each of the municipalities constituting the membership of the jointagency and shall specify a date, not less than ten (10) days afterthe publication of such notice, at which the joint agency shall meetto hear any objections or remonstrances that may be made. At saidmeeting, the commissioners of the joint agency shall consider theobjections or protests, if any, and shall at said meeting, or at anyadjourned meeting, affirm, modify or rescind the determination. Anyperson or party objecting or protesting the determination at saidmeeting who is aggrieved by the action of said joint agency may appealwithin ten (10) days from the date of adjournment at which sessionthe joint agency rendered said determination, and may embody the factsand determination in a bill of exceptions which shall be signed bythe person acting as chairman of the board of commissioners of thejoint agency. The secretary thereof shall transmit at once the billof exceptions to the circuit court of the county in which the principaloffice of the joint agency is located, and the court shall eitherin termtime or in vacation hear and determine the same on the caseas presented by the bill of exceptions as an appellate court, andshall affirm or reverse the determination of the joint agency. Ifthe determination of the joint agency be reversed, the circuit courtshall certify the same to the board of commissioners of the jointagency. Costs shall be awarded as in other cases. The joint agencymay employ counsel to defend such appeals to be paid out of the fundsof the joint agency. Any such appeal may be heard and determined invacation in the discretion of the court on motion of either partyon written notice of ten (10) days to the other party or parties orthe attorney of record, and the hearing of the same shall be heldin the county where the suit is pending unless the judge in his ordershall otherwise direct. Provided, however, no appeal to the circuitcourt shall be taken from any order or determination of the jointagency which authorizes the issuance or sale of bonds, but all objectionsto any matters relating to the issuance or sale of bonds shall beadjudicated and determined by the chancery court, in accordance withthe provisions of Sections 31-13-5 through 31-13-11.

     <p>
      Nothing herein contained shall prevent a joint agency from undertaking studies to determine whether there is a need for a project or whether such project is feasible.

       § 77-5-729.
    Member municipalities may contract to buy power from joint agencies.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Any municipality which is a member of the joint agency may contract to buy from the joint agency power and energy required for its present or future requirements, including the capacity and output of one or more specified projects. As the creation of a joint agency is an alternative method whereby a municipality may obtain the benefits and assume the responsibilities of ownership in a project, any such contract may provide that the municipality so contracting shall be obligated to make the payments required by the contract whether or not a project is completed, operable, operating, retired or decommissioned and notwithstanding the suspension, interruption, interference, reduction, curtailment or termination of the output of a project or the power and energy contracted for, and that such payments under the contract shall not be subject to any reduction whether by offset or otherwise, and shall not be conditioned upon the performance or nonperformance of the joint agency or any other member of the joint agency under the contract or any other instrument. Any contract with respect to the sale or purchase of capacity or output of a project entered into between a joint agency and its member municipalities may also provide that if one or more of such municipalities shall default in the payment of its or their obligations, with respect to the purchase of said capacity or output, then in that event the remaining member municipalities which are purchasing capacity and output under the contract shall be required to accept and pay for and shall be entitled proportionately to and may use or otherwise dispose of the capacity or output which was to be purchased by the defaulting municipality.
     </p>
     <p>
      Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law to the contrary, any such contracts with respect to the sale or purchase of capacity, output, power or energy from a project may extend for a period not exceeding fifty (50) years from the date a project is estimated to be placed in normal continuous operation; and the execution and effectiveness thereof shall not be subject to any authorizations or approvals by the state or any agency, commission or instrumentality or political subdivision thereof except as in this article specifically required and provided.
     </p>
     <p>
      Payments by a municipality under any contract for the purchase of capacity and output from a joint agency shall be made solely from the revenues derived from the ownership and operation of the electric system of said municipality and any obligation under such contract shall not constitute a legal or equitable pledge, charge, lien or encumbrance upon any property of the municipality or upon any of its income, receipts or revenues, except the revenues of its electric system, and neither the faith and credit nor the taxing power of the municipality are, or may be, pledged for the payment of any obligation under any such contract. A municipality shall be obligated to fix, charge and collect rents, rates, fees and charges for electric power and energy and other services, facilities and commodities, sold, furnished or supplied through its electric system sufficient to provide revenues adequate to meet its obligations under any such contract and to pay any and all other amounts payable from or constituting a charge and lien upon such revenues, including amounts sufficient to pay the principal of and interest on bonds heretofore or hereafter issued by the municipality for purposes related to its electric system.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any municipality which is a member of a joint agency may furnish the joint agency with money derived solely from the ownership and operation of its electric system or facilities and may make available for the use of the joint agency any personnel, equipment and property, both real and personal, which is a part of its electric system or facilities.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any member of a joint agency may contract for, advance or contribute funds derived solely from the ownership and operation of its electric system or facilities to a joint agency as may be agreed upon by the joint agency and the member, and the joint agency shall repay such advances or contributions from proceeds of bonds, from operating revenues or from any other funds of the joint agency, together with interest thereon as may be agreed upon by the member and the joint agency.

Provided, however, that sales of excess capacity or output of a project to electric power associations, public or private utilities, and other persons the interest on whose securities and other obligations are not exempt from taxation by the federal government shall not be made in such amounts, for such periods of time, and under such terms and conditions as will cause the interest on bonds issued to finance the cost of a project to become taxable by the federal government.

       Each municipality and joint agency is hereby authorized to issue at one (1) time or from time to time its bonds for the purpose of paying all or any part of the cost of any of the purposes authorized by this article. The principal of, premium, if any, and the interest on such bonds shall be payable solely from the respective funds herein provided for such payment. The bonds of each issue shall bear interest at such rate or rates as may be determined by the issuer, provided that the bonds of any issue shall not bear a greater overall interest rate to maturity than that allowed in Section 75-17-103. The bonds of each issue shall be dated and shall mature in such amounts and at such time or times, either as serial bonds or term bonds or a combination of serial and term bonds, not exceeding fifty (50) years from their respective date or dates, as may be determined by the governing board of the issuer, and may be made redeemable before maturity at such price or prices and under such terms and conditions as may be fixed by the governing board of the issuer prior to the issuance of the bonds. The governing board of the issuer shall determine the form and the manner of execution of the bonds, including any interest coupons to be attached thereto, and shall fix the denomination or denominations of the bonds and the place or places of payment of principal and interest, which may be at any bank or trust company within or without the state. In case any officer whose signature or a facsimile of whose signature shall appear on any bonds or coupons shall cease to be such officer before the delivery of such bond, such signature or such facsimile shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes the same as if he had remained in office until such delivery. The governing board of the issuer may also provide for the authentication of the bonds by a trustee or fiscal agent. The bonds may be issued in coupon or in fully registered form, or both, as the governing board of the issuer may determine, and provisions may be made for the registration of any coupon bonds as to principal alone and also as to both principal and interest, and for the reconversion into coupon bonds of any bonds registered as to both principal and interest, and for the interchange of registered and coupon bonds. No bond shall bear more than one (1) rate of interest. All bonds of the same maturity shall bear the same rate of interest from date to maturity. All interest accruing on such bonds so issued shall be payable semiannually or annually, except that the first interest coupon attached to any such bond may be for any period not exceeding one (1) year.
       <p>
        All bonds issued pursuant to this article shall be advertised and sold on sealed bids in the manner provided under the provisions of Section 31-19-25; provided that on bond sales in excess of Fifty Million Dollars ($50,000,000.00) the joint agency may sell its bonds by negotiated sale at not less than ninety-eight percent (98%) of par, plus accrued interest, when the joint agency has employed a nationally recognized financial advisor for the proposed bond issue. The duties of the financial advisor shall include the responsibility of preparing a statement to be submitted to the Governor, the chairman of the house ways and means committee and the chairman of the senate finance committee which shall clearly set forth the reasons why the negotiated sale was considered to be in the best interest of the joint agency and member municipalities, including the estimated savings in cost by selling the bonds at a negotiated sale.

The municipality or joint agency may issue interim receipts or temporary bonds, with or without coupons, exchangeable for definitive bonds when such bonds shall have been executed and are available for delivery.

      For the purposes of this article, the following words shall have the meaning ascribed herein unless the context shall otherwise require:
     </p>
     <p>
      “Municipal utility” means any municipality of the State of Mississippi and any board, commission or other governing or supervisory body created by law, ordinance or resolution, that includes in its operations a system for the distribution of electric power from a federal agency, as defined in Section 77-5-403(h), that both owns the generation and transmission facilities for the sale of electric power; and shall include any county utility that includes in its operation an electric system operated under the Local Governmental Power Development Under Laws of 1934, as provided in Sections 77-5-301 through 77-5-315, and any municipal utility operating under the provisions of Chapter 27 of Title 21.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Safety incentive” means any award in the form of cash, property or other remuneration rendered on a contingent and prospective basis and available to all employees of a municipal utility whose governing body has adopted a safety incentive program that provides the incentive on a contingent and prospective basis subject to the municipal utility achieving certain safety goals prescribed by the governing body.

    Authorization of safety incentive program; form of incentive; eligibility for incentives; sources of funding for payment of incentives.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      A municipal utility as defined in this article may adopt a safety incentive program and may pay safety incentives from the revenues of the municipal utility, but not from tax revenues, subject to the following conditions and limitations:
     </p>
     <p>
      The safety incentive shall be in the form of contingent compensation which shall be established prospectively before the commencement of the time period for which certain safety goals are to be in effect and in such levels and amounts as prescribed under eligibility standards established by the municipal utility. The safety incentives may be in the form of cash, property, merchandise certificates or other forms of award.
     </p>
     <p>
      No tax revenues of the municipality may be used for payment of the safety incentive, and all safety incentives shall be payable only from revenues received from the sale of utility services and matching funds obtained pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section.
     </p>
     <p>
      All employees of the municipal utility shall be eligible to receive safety incentives upon the municipal utility achieving its prescribed goals.
     </p>
     <p>
      The aggregate amount payable from the revenues of the municipal utility in the form of safety incentives shall not exceed the sum of One Hundred Dollars ($100.00) annually per employee; however, this limitation shall be increased in an amount equal to the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index, as established by the United States Department of Labor, with the January, 1995, index to be used as the base month and year for calculating increases.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any safety incentive program adopted by a municipal utility shall be conditioned upon an amount not less than fifty percent (50%) of the aggregate value of safety incentive awards being derived from nonpublic sources such as, without limiting the scope of qualifying, nonpublic sources, private foundations, corporations, nonprofit organizations, insurance companies, associations, cooperatives, and other private sources; however, any matching funds received by grants or awards from any federal agency, as defined in Section 77-5-403(h), may be used for matching purposes. This paragraph (e) shall not apply to a municipal utility located in a city which has a state-supported institution of higher learning within its corporate limits and which is located on the Tennessee-Tombigbee River.

    Municipal Gas Authority of Mississippi created; purpose; initial membership; principal office.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      There shall be created a local distribution company of the state to be known as the Municipal Gas Authority of Mississippi for the purpose of undertaking the planning, financing, development, acquisition, construction, reconstruction, improvement, enlargement, betterment, operation and maintenance of a project or projects to supply gas for present or future needs as an alternative or supplemental method of obtaining the benefits and assuming the responsibilities of ownership in a project. In determining whether or not membership in the authority for such purpose is in the best interests of the municipalities, the utility commissions shall take into consideration, but shall not be limited to the following:
     </p>
     <p>
      Whether or not a separate entity may be able to finance the cost of projects in a more efficient and economical manner;
     </p>
     <p>
      Whether or not better financial market acceptance may result if one (1) entity is responsible for issuing all of the bonds required for a project or projects in a timely and orderly manner and with a uniform credit rating instead of multiple entities issuing separate issues of bonds;
     </p>
     <p>
      Whether or not savings and other advantages may be obtained by providing a separate entity responsible for the acquisition, construction, ownership and operation of a project or projects; and
     </p>
     <p>
      Whether or not the existence of such a separate entity will foster the continuation of joint planning and undertaking of projects, and the resulting economies and efficiencies to be derived from such joint planning and undertaking.
     </p>
     <p>
      If a utility commission shall determine that it is in the best interest of the municipality to become a member of the Municipal Gas Authority of Mississippi, it shall adopt a resolution so finding, which need not prescribe in detail the basis for the determination, and which shall set forth the names of the municipalities which are proposed to be initial members of the authority. Said resolution shall be certified to the governing authorities who shall thereupon disapprove or ratify the determination of said utility commission by resolution or ordinance spread upon its official minutes. The governing authorities shall cause notice of such determination to be given to the presiding officer of the utility commission of the municipality, which utility commission shall thereupon appoint in writing one (1) commissioner of the authority, which commissioner may, in the discretion of the utility commission, be an officer or employee of the municipality.
     </p>
     <p>
      All such resolutions of intent to become initial members of the authority shall be presented, by the appointed commissioner of such utility commission, at its organizational meeting which shall be held in the old Supreme Court chamber of the New Capitol at 2:00 p.m. on May 16, 1988. The commissioners shall organize and elect a chairman and other such officers as may be desirable in the determination of the commissioners.
     </p>
     <p>
      The authority shall have its principal office in Hinds County and its legal situs or residence for the purposes of this chapter shall be Hinds County.

       A municipality in Mississippi may contract with a public non-profit corporation to obtain natural gas; however, no authority is found for a municipality to become a member of a nonprofit corporation of another state or to enter into an interlocal agreement with a nonprofit corporation of another state. Neither is authority found for municipalities of other states to become members of the Municipal Gas Authority of Mississippi. Collins, July 18, 2003, A.G. Op. 03-0294.

       § 77-6-11.
    Board of commissioners.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The authority shall consist of a board of commissioners appointed by the respective utility commissions of the municipalities which are members of the authority. Each municipality shall appoint one (1) commissioner who may, at the discretion of the municipality, be an officer or employee of the municipality, the appointment to be made by resolution. Each commissioner shall have one (1) vote. Each commissioner shall serve at the pleasure of the utility commission by which he was appointed. Each appointed commissioner before entering upon his duties shall enter into bond with a corporate surety in an amount not less than Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000.00), conditioned on the faithful performance of his duties, and shall take and subscribe to an oath, before some person authorized by law to administer oaths, to execute the duties of his office faithfully and impartially, and such bond and oath shall be filed with the governing authority of the appointing municipality and spread upon its minutes. The premiums on such bonds shall be paid by the municipality.
     </p>
     <p>
      The board of commissioners of the authority shall annually elect one (1) of the commissioners as chairman, another as vice-chairman, and another person or persons who may but need not be commissioners to serve as treasurer, secretary and, if desired, assistant secretary. The treasurer shall enter into bond with a corporate surety in such amount of not less than Twenty-five Thousand Dollars ($25,000.00), as may be determined by the commissioners. The office of treasurer may be held by the secretary or assistant secretary. The board of commissioners may also appoint such additional officers as it deems necessary. The secretary or assistant secretary of the authority shall keep a record of the proceedings of the authority, and the secretary shall be the custodian of all records, books, documents and papers filed with the authority, the minute book or journal of the authority and its official seal. Either the secretary or the assistant secretary of the authority may cause copies to be made of all minutes and other records and documents of the authority and may give certificates under the official seal of the authority to the effect that such copies are true copies, and all persons dealing with the authority may rely upon such certificates.
     </p>
     <p>
      A majority of the commissioners of the authority then in office shall constitute a quorum. A vacancy in the board of commissioners of the authority shall not impair the right of a quorum to exercise all the rights and perform all the duties of the authority. Any action taken by the authority under the provisions of this chapter may be authorized by resolution at any regular or special meeting, and each such resolution shall take effect immediately and need not be published or posted. A majority of the votes which the commissioners present are entitled to cast shall be necessary and sufficient to take any action or to pass any resolution, provided that such commissioners present are entitled to cast a majority of the votes of all commissioners of the board. Any commissioner may participate and vote in regular or special meetings of the board, as well as meetings of various committees of the board, via telecommunications or electronic means, and such participation and voting shall have the same effect as if the commissioner were physically present at such meetings. Any meeting of the board of commissioners or of a committee of the board at which one or more of the commissioners is participating via telecommunications or electronic means shall be subject to the Open Meetings Law (Chapter 41, Title 25, Mississippi Code of 1972), and all discussions during the meeting via telecommunications or electronic means, other than discussions held in executive session, must be open to the public. Notice of any meeting at which one or more commissioners may be participating via telecommunications or electronic means shall specify the location at which the meeting will be open to the public.
     </p>
     <p>
      No commissioner of the authority shall receive any compensation for the performance of his duties hereunder; however, each commissioner, other than a commissioner participating in a meeting via telecommunications or electronic means, may be paid a per diem as provided by Section 25-3-69 while engaged in the performance of such duties.

    Projects requiring financing by bonds; approval required; determination by authority; notice of determination; hearing; appeal from determination.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The authority shall not undertake any project required to be financed, in whole or in part, with the proceeds of bonds without the approval of sixty percent (60%) of its members. Before undertaking such project, required to be financed in whole or in part with the proceeds of bonds, the authority shall, based upon engineering studies and reports, determine that such project is required to provide for the projected needs for gas of its members from and after the date the project is estimated to be placed in normal and continuous operation and for a reasonable period of time thereafter. In determining the future gas requirements of the members of the authority, there shall be taken into account the following:
     </p>
     <p>
      The economies and efficiencies estimated to be achieved in acquiring, constructing and operating the proposed facilities for the transmission of gas.
     </p>
     <p>
      The estimated requirements for gas and for reserve capacity and to meet obligations under pooling and reserve sharing agreements reasonably related to its needs for gas to which the authority is or may become a party; and
     </p>
     <p>
      The cost of such existing alternative gas supply sources.
     </p>
     <p>
      A determination by the authority based upon appropriate findings of the foregoing matters shall be conclusive as to the appropriateness of a project to provide the needs of the members of the authority for gas unless an interested party aggrieved by the determination of said authority shall file an appeal therefrom as herein provided. Notice of the determination by the authority shall be published one (1) time in one or more newspapers having general circulation in each of the municipalities constituting the membership of the authority and shall specify a date, not less than ten (10) days after the publication of such notice, at which the authority shall meet to hear any objections or remonstrances that may be made. At said meeting, the commissioners of the authority shall consider the objections or protests, if any, and shall at said meeting, or at any adjourned meeting, affirm, modify or rescind the determination. Any person or party objecting or protesting the determination at said meeting who is aggrieved by the action of said authority may appeal within ten (10) days from the date of adjournment at which session the authority rendered said determination, and may embody the facts and determination in a bill of exceptions which shall be signed by the person acting as chairman of the board of commissioners of the authority. The secretary thereof shall transmit at once the bill of exceptions to the circuit court of the county in which the principal office of the authority is located, and the court shall either in termtime or in vacation hear and determine the same on the case as presented by the bill of exceptions as an appellate court, and shall affirm or reverse the determination of the authority. If the determination of the authority be reversed, the circuit court shall certify the same to the board of commissioners of the authority. Costs shall be awarded as in other cases. The authority may employ counsel to defend such appeals to be paid out of the funds of the authority. Any such appeal may be heard and determined in vacation in the discretion of the court on motion of either party on written notice of ten (10) days to the other party or parties or the attorney of record, and the hearing of the same shall be held in the county where the suit is pending unless the judge in his order shall otherwise direct. Provided, however, no appeal to the circuit court shall be taken from any order or determination of the authority which authorizes the issuance or sale of bonds, but all objections to any matters relating to the issuance or sale of bonds shall be adjudicated and determined by the chancery court, in accordance with the provisions of Sections 31-13-5 through 31-13-11, Mississippi Code of 1972.
     </p>
     <p>
      Nothing herein contained shall prevent the authority from undertaking studies to determine whether there is a need for a project or whether such project is feasible.

       § 77-6-21.
    Contracts to buy gas from authority.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Any municipality which is a member of the authority may contract to buy from the authority gas required for its present or future requirements, including the capacity and output of one or more specified projects. As the creation of the authority is an alternative method, among other things, whereby a municipality may obtain the benefits and assume the responsibilities of ownership in a project, any such contract may provide that the municipality so contracting shall be obligated to make the payments required by the contract whether or not a project is completed, operable, operating, retired or decommissioned and notwithstanding the suspension, interruption, interference, reduction, curtailment or termination of the output of a project or the gas contracted for, and that such payments under the contract shall not be subject to any reduction whether by offset or otherwise, and shall not be conditioned upon the performance or nonperformance of the authority or any other member of the authority under the contract or any other instrument. Any contract with respect to the sale or purchase of capacity or output of a project entered into between the authority and its member municipalities may also provide that if one or more of such municipalities shall withdraw from the authority or default in the payment of its or their obligations, with respect to the purchase of said capacity or output, then in that event the remaining member municipalities which are purchasing capacity and output under the contract shall be required to accept and pay for and shall be entitled proportionately to and may use or otherwise dispose of the capacity or output which was to be purchased by the defaulting municipality.
     </p>
     <p>
      Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law to the contrary, any such contracts with respect to the sale or purchase of capacity, output or gas from a project may extend for a period not exceeding fifty (50) years from the date a project is estimated to be placed in normal continuous operation; and the execution and effectiveness thereof shall not be subject to any authorizations or approvals by the state or any agency, commission or instrumentality or municipality thereof except as in this chapter specifically required and provided.
     </p>
     <p>
      Payments by a municipality under any contract for the purchase of capacity and output from the authority shall be made solely from the revenues derived from the ownership and operation of the gas system of said municipality, or other revenues when applicable, and any obligation under such contract shall not constitute a legal or equitable pledge, charge, lien or encumbrance upon any property of the municipality or upon any of its income, receipts or revenues, except the revenues of its gas system, and neither the full faith and credit nor the taxing power of the municipality are, or may be, pledged for the payment of any obligation under any such contract. A municipality, when applicable, shall be obligated to fix, charge and collect rents, rates, fees and charges for gas and other services, facilities and commodities, sold, furnished or supplied through its gas system sufficient to provide revenues adequate to meet its obligations under any such contract and to pay any and all other amounts payable from or constituting a charge and lien upon such revenues, including amounts sufficient to pay the principal of and interest on bonds heretofore or hereafter issued by the municipality for purposes related to its gas system.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any municipality which is a member of the authority may furnish the authority with money derived solely from the ownership and operation of its gas system or facilities and may make available for the use of the authority any personnel, equipment and property, both real and personal, which is a part of its gas system or facilities, and any other agency or end-user shall pay from any and all revenues available.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any member of the authority may contract for, advance or contribute funds derived solely from the ownership and operation of its gas system or facilities to the authority as may be agreed upon by the authority and the member, and the authority shall repay such advances or contributions from proceeds of bonds, from operating revenues or from any other funds of the authority, together with interest thereon as may be agreed upon by the member and the authority.

Provided, however, that sales of excess capacity or output of a project to gas associations, public or private utilities, and other persons the interest on whose securities and other obligations are not exempt from taxation by the federal government shall not be made in such amounts, for such periods of time, and under such terms and conditions as will cause the interest on bonds issued to finance the cost of a project to become taxable by the federal government.

       Each municipality and the authority are hereby authorized to issue at one (1) time or from time to time revenue bonds for the purpose of paying all or any part of the cost of any of the purposes authorized by this chapter. The principal of, premium, if any, and the interest on such bonds shall be payable solely from the respective funds herein provided for such payment. The bonds of each issue shall bear interest at such rate or rates as may be determined by the issuer, provided that the bonds of any issue shall not bear a greater overall interest rate to maturity than that allowed in Section 75-17-103, Mississippi Code of 1972. The bonds of each issue shall be dated and shall mature in such amounts and at such time or times, either as serial bonds or term bonds or a combination of serial and term bonds, not exceeding fifty (50) years from their respective date or dates, as may be determined by the governing board of the issuer, and may be made redeemable before maturity at such price or prices and under such terms and conditions as may be fixed by the governing board of the issuer prior to the issuance of the bonds. The governing board of the issuer shall determine the form and the manner of execution of the bonds, including any interest coupons to be attached thereto, and shall fix the denomination or denominations of the bonds and the place or places of payment of principal and interest, which may be at any bank or trust company within or without the state. In case any officer whose signature or a facsimile of whose signature shall appear on any bonds or coupons shall cease to be such officer before the delivery of such bond, such signature or such facsimile shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes the same as if he had remained in office until such delivery. The governing board of the issuer may also provide for the authentication of the bonds by a trustee or fiscal agent. The bonds may be issued in coupon or in fully registered form, or both, as the governing board of the issuer may determine, and provisions may be made for the registration of any coupon bonds as to principal alone and also as to both principal and interest, and for the reconversion into coupon bonds of any bonds registered as to both principal and interest, and for the interchange of registered and coupon bonds. No bond shall bear more than one (1) rate of interest. All bonds of the same maturity shall bear the same rate of interest from date to maturity. All interest accruing on such bonds so issued shall be payable semiannually or annually, except that the first interest coupon attached to any such bond may be for any period not exceeding one (1) year.

        All bonds issued pursuant to this chapter shall be advertised and sold on sealed bids in the manner provided under the provisions of Section 31-19-25; provided that on bond sales in excess of Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000.00) the authority may sell its bonds by negotiated sale at not less than ninety-eight percent (98%) of par, plus accrued interest, when the authority has employed a qualified financial advisor for the proposed bond issue. The duties of the financial advisor shall include the responsibility of preparing a statement to be submitted to the Governor, the Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee and the Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee which shall clearly set forth the reasons why the negotiated sale was considered to be in the best interest of the authority and member municipalities, including the estimated savings in cost by selling the bonds at a negotiated sale.

       The authority is hereby authorized to make temporary borrowings through revenue anticipation notes for the purpose of meeting the current and necessary expenses of the authority (including the purchase of gas supplies) and paying the costs of issuing the revenue anticipation notes. The authority is authorized to make such temporary borrowings through revenue anticipation notes for a period not to exceed thirteen (13) months. To provide for such temporary borrowings, the authority may provide for the private sale of such revenue anticipation notes and may enter into any purchase, loan or credit agreements or other agreements with any banks, trust companies or other lending institutions, investment banking firms or persons in the United States having power to enter into the same. The authority shall provide for repayment of any revenue anticipation note issued hereunder within thirteen (13) months from the issuance date thereof from all or a portion of any available revenues of the system.

      It is hereby declared to be the policy of the legislature to regulate motor carriers in the public interest to the end that the safety and welfare of the public in its use of the highways and of the transportation agencies by motor vehicle used thereon may be practiced; that the property of the state in its highways may be protected from unreasonable, improper and excessive use; that the inherent advantages of highway transportation may be recognized and preserved; that sound economic conditions in such transportation and among such carriers may be fostered; that the service by motor carriers may be adequate, economical, and efficient; that reasonable charges may be made therefor, without unjust discriminations, undue preferences or advantages, and unfair or destructive competitive practices; that relations between motor carriers and other carriers may be improved and coordinated; and that cooperation may be maintained with the governments of the United States and the several states, and with their duly authorized officials in carrying out the purposes and provisions of this chapter. This chapter shall apply to persons and motor vehicles engaged in interstate commerce to the extent permitted by the Constitution and laws of the United States and as provided herein.

       Commission’s power is circumscribed by its statutorily granted power to protect public interest with respect to use of highways, and no where in statute did legislature authorize Public Service Commission to inquire into transactions between corporations and their fiduciaries to determine whether they were inherently fair to shareholders or creditors. It is not within purview of Public Service Commission to enforce creditors’ liens and set aside transfer of certificate of necessity made to evade creditors, except as they affect public interest in regulating motor carriers. Dorman v. Rowell, 515 So. 2d 1214, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2918 (Miss. 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       A rule of the public service commission limiting the right of common carriers of household goods to establish bases of operations and to domicile their equipment is within its power, notwithstanding such carriers hold certificates of public convenience and necessity to operate to and from all points in the state, where lack of regulation has resulted in unsound economic conditions and permitted unfair and destructive competitive practices. Mississippi Public Service Com. v. Holloway Transfer & Storage Co., 247 Miss. 184, 150 So. 2d 411, 1963 Miss. LEXIS 292 (Miss. 1963).
      </p>
      <p>
       It was the intent and purpose of the legislature to exempt from the provisions of the Motor Carrier Regulatory Law purely local operations of motor vehicles within an area or zone adjacent to municipality or municipalities not to exceed five miles from the corporate limits. Seal v. Andrews, 214 Miss. 215, 58 So. 2d 504, 1952 Miss. LEXIS 460 (Miss. 1952).
      </p>
      <p>
       The language of this section declares the policy of the state with respect to the granting of certificates of public necessity and convenience to motor carriers. Tri-State Transit Co. v. Dixie Greyhound Lines, Inc., 197 Miss. 37, 19 So. 2d 441, 1944 Miss. LEXIS 273 (Miss. 1944).
      </p>
      <p>
       The term public convenience and necessity, used throughout the statute, is not to be confused with the idea of public convenience or necessity, since while it may be convenient to have a bus going in each direction every hour of the day from the various stations along a route, public necessity does not so require. Dixie Greyhound Lines, Inc. v. Mississippi Public Service Com., 190 Miss. 704, 1 So. 2d 489, 200 So. 579, 1941 Miss. LEXIS 60 (Miss. 1941).
      </p>
      <p>
       State could not, on relation of district attorney, sue to restrain bus companies, having franchise from railroad commission to use highway, from continuing to use state highway, on ground they were wrongfully using highway to extent constituting public nuisance. Capitol Stages, Inc. v. State, 157 Miss. 576, 128 So. 759, 1930 Miss. LEXIS 342 (Miss. 1930).

      <p>
       Where a carrier held a certificate giving it authority to serve certain points, the public service commission did not have authority to grant to an applicant certificate to serve the same points in interstate commerce despite the fact there was a determination that existing service was inadequate, without first giving the carrier reasonable time within which to render such additional service as might be required. West Bros., Inc. v. H & L Delivery Service, Inc., 220 Miss. 323, 70 So. 2d 870, 1954 Miss. LEXIS 444 (Miss. 1954).
      </p>
      <p>
       Certificate of public convenience and necessity should not be granted to a motor carrier where there is existing adequate service over the route applied for, or, even if inadequate, unless the existing carrier has been given an opportunity to furnish such additional service as may be required. Tri-State Transit Co. v. Dixie Greyhound Lines, Inc., 197 Miss. 37, 19 So. 2d 441, 1944 Miss. LEXIS 273 (Miss. 1944); Southern Bus Lines, Inc. v. Mississippi Public Service Com., 210 Miss. 606, 50 So. 2d 149, 1951 Miss. LEXIS 298 (Miss. 1951); Dixie Greyhound Lines v. Am. Buslines, 209 Miss. 874, 48 So. 2d 584, 1950 Miss. LEXIS 453 (Miss. 1950).
      </p>

       Order of public service commission denying to a motor carrier an intrastate certificate of public necessity and convenience over the same route for which it already had an interstate certificate, where a competing carrier had both intrastate as well as interstate certificates, was supported by substantial evidence, although circuit court had reversed the order to the extent of granting the certificate until the expiration of six months after the end of the war.

       Whether a railroad should have been given a preference and allowed to operate busses over highways paralleling their lines of railway, through subsidiary bus companies, before any certificates of public convenience and necessity were ever issued to other motorbus transportation companies over such routes, was a legislative question and not a judicial one.

       Evidence, including a showing that carrier was free to accept or reject any offered shipments, never held itself out as a public utility, and each shipment hauled was based upon an individual agreement, established that carrier was a private or contract carrier and not a common carrier.

       A motor carrier of cotton was not a common carrier where he conditioned his willingness to carry upon the negotiations of a satisfactory price, had no tariffs or any schedule of rates and charges, and in arriving at an agreeable rate or price, or in determining whether he would accept a shipment at a tendered rate, took into account such elements as the amount of cargo offered, previous relationships with the shipper, whether the shipper provided cargo insurance, the nature, duration and time of the trip, availability of equipment to meet his own needs or other transportation commitments and the like.

      <p>
       Mississippi motor carrier regulations contain provisions very similar to federal statutes and expressly provide that state rules and regulations are to conform as nearly as practicable to those of Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC), therefore ICC standards apply in judging reasonableness of motor common carrier’s attempt to retroactively collect higher rates than those negotiated, based on filed tariffs. Orr v. ICC, 912 F.2d 119, 1990 U.S. App. LEXIS 14501 (6th Cir. Tenn. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       The public service commission is not automatically bound under the provisions of this section to establish classifications of groups of carriers identical with the classifications established by the West Bros., Inc. v. Mississippi Public Service Com., 186 So. 2d 202, 1966 Miss. LEXIS 1294 (Miss. 1966).
      </p>
      <p>
       A rule of the public service commission limiting the right of common carriers of household goods to establish bases of operations and to domicile their equipment is within its power, notwithstanding such carriers hold certificates of public convenience and necessity to operate to and from all points in the state, where lack of regulation has resulted in unsound economic conditions and permitted unfair and destructive competitive practices. Mississippi Public Service Com. v. Holloway Transfer & Storage Co., 247 Miss. 184, 150 So. 2d 411, 1963 Miss. LEXIS 292 (Miss. 1963).
      </p>
      <p>
       The public service commission’s power to adopt reasonable rules for common carriers may not conflict with the statutes or revoke a previously granted right, but may be exercised in other areas. Mississippi Public Service Com. v. Holloway Transfer & Storage Co., 247 Miss. 184, 150 So. 2d 411, 1963 Miss. LEXIS 292 (Miss. 1963).
      </p>
      <p>
       This chapter does not confer jurisdiction on the public service commission to issue certificates of public convenience and necessity for the operation of airlines along designated wholly intrastate air routes. South Mississippi Airways v. Chicago & Southern Airlines, 200 Miss. 329, 26 So. 2d 455, 1946 Miss. LEXIS 297 (Miss. 1946).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Tariff of rates, filed by motor bus carrier with commission as required by law, allowing passenger to check baggage not to exceed $25 in value without additional charge but providing that value in excess thereof must be declared an additional compensation paid, limited carrier’s liability for loss of passenger’s baggage to $25 where passengers did not declare a greater value, notwithstanding that passenger had no knowledge of such tariff provisions and had no conversation with carrier’s agent on the subject. Campbell v. Tri-State Transit Co., 196 Miss. 367, 17 So. 2d 327, 1944 Miss. LEXIS 202 (Miss. 1944); Boston &amp; M. Railroad v. Hooker, <cite class="us_code">233 U.S. 97</cite>, <cite class="s_court">34 S. Ct. 526</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">58 L. Ed. 868</cite>, 1914 U.S. LEXIS 1275 (U.S. 1914).
      </p>
      <p>
       The requirement of this section means that state decisions on related questions ought to conform to that of the federal Supreme Court. Campbell v. Tri-State Transit Co., 196 Miss. 367, 17 So. 2d 327, 1944 Miss. LEXIS 202 (Miss. 1944).
      </p>
      <p>
       This statute is modelled after the Federal Motor Carrier Act of 1935, and since the two statutes are strikingly similar in their provisions, the decisions of the United States Supreme Court in exercising the power of judicial review of the action of the Interstate Commerce Commission in the granting or denying of certificates of public convenience and necessity to motor carriers engaged in interstate commerce is ample authority as to the right of judicial review, especially in view of subsection (c) of this section. Dixie Greyhound Lines, Inc. v. Mississippi Public Service Com., 190 Miss. 704, 1 So. 2d 489, 200 So. 579, 1941 Miss. LEXIS 60 (Miss. 1941).

       This statute is modelled after the Federal Motor Carrier Act of 1935, and since the two statutes are strikingly similar in their provisions, the decisions of the United States Supreme Court in exercising the power of judicial review of the action of the interstate commerce commission in the granting or denying of certificates of public convenience and necessity to motor carriers engaged in interstate commerce is ample authority as to the right of judicial review, especially in view of §

       Where the public service commission issued order granting to motor carrier a certificate to carry commodities over regular routes among various points already served by another carrier which provided only call and demand service, this was not a determination that the respective carriers were in different, uncompeting classes.

      <p>
       Where a motor carrier and railroad subsidiary each sought a certificate of convenience for the establishment of a bus line over a designated route, over a portion of which the motor carrier was at the time maintaining a route, it was not necessary that an order of the public service commission, denying the application of the railroad subsidiary, should have recited more than the fact that the rival application had been granted over the proposed new route and that the duplication of certificate rights over the existing route was unjustified.

       Whether a railroad should have been given preference and allowed to operate busses over highways paralleling its lines of railway, through subsidiary bus companies, before any certificates of public convenience and necessity were ever issued to other motorbus transportation companies over such routes, was a legislative question and not a judicial one.

       In determining public convenience and necessity, the commission must at one view consider the entire public need, the condition of the highways, the extent and hazards of travel, especially the danger caused by large busses frequently stopping along highways to discharge and take on passengers, the economic situation, cost to the public, the financial condition and ability of public operators to render proper service, and many other questions.

       Where the railroad discontinued its passenger train and therefore brought about the lack of express service along the route and later sought a certificate to operate the trucks for the transportation of express, the public service commission was entitled to consider the interests of the public even though the serving of the need of express by granting the application would result in some benefit to the railroad. West Bros. v. Illinois C. R. Co., 222 Miss. 335, 75 So. 2d 723, 1954 Miss. LEXIS 650 (Miss. 1954).

       A certificate of public convenience and necessity to operate as a common carrier, granted to a bus line which duplicates the routes of two other bus lines is contrary to the law and certificate should be canceled. Southern Bus Lines, Inc. v. Mississippi Public Service Com., 210 Miss. 606, 50 So. 2d 149, 1951 Miss. LEXIS 298 (Miss. 1951).

      <p>
       Application for extension of the authority of a motorbus carrier was properly denied where the route proposed was already covered by another carrier that was willing to alter its operations to eliminate delays in transfers of passengers for a large city; that the applicant, if the authority were extended, would be in a position to issue to and from a large city interchangeable tickets with a railroad and would have transportation into that city, already adequately served, were not controlling. Tri-State Transit Co. v. Gulf Transport Co., 201 Miss. 744, 29 So. 2d 825, 1947 Miss. LEXIS 444 (Miss. 1947).

       Findings of the public service commission that appellee was entitled to a certificate as a common carrier of commodities generally over designated routes upon proof of bona fide operations within the purview of this section [Code 1942, § 7639] would not be disturbed, notwithstanding that documents introduced to establish such operation, consisting of numerous freight bills, appeared to be those of the Luter Truck Lines Inc., overstamped in the name of appellee, where the ambiguities thus presented were supplemented by oral proof not inconsistent with the commission’s findings and there was substantially more than a scintilla of evidence of a bona fide operation by appellee over the designated routes. Gulf Mobile & O. R. R. v. Luter Motor Express, 194 Miss. 407, 12 So. 2d 420, 1943 Miss. LEXIS 68 (Miss. 1943).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence did not constitute substantial proof of public convenience and necessity to sustain the granting of a certificate to applicant over a portion of the route applied for which was being adequately served by an existing motor carrier, but justified granting of a certificate as to another portion of the route where convenience and necessity required it, the operation to be with “closed doors” between certain points and with restrictions as to taking on passengers. Dixie Greyhound Lines, Inc. v. Mississippi Public Service Com., 190 Miss. 704, 1 So. 2d 489, 200 So. 579, 1941 Miss. LEXIS 60 (Miss. 1941).

      <p>
       The commission properly refused a certificate of convenience and necessity applied for by a corporation engaged primarily in compressing and warehousing cotton on the ground that it had no charter power to conduct the business of a carrier for hire either as a common or restricted carrier, where its corporate charter gave it the right to construct, purchase and maintain gins, compressors, and warehouses with the incidental power to construct, hire, purchase, operate and maintain all or any conveyances for the transportation in cold storage by land or by water of any and all products, goods or manufactured articles, the latter provision being incidental to its warehouse and compress business and not giving it authority to operate as a public utility. Mississippi-Gulfport Compress & Warehouses, Inc. v. Public Service Com., 189 Miss. 166, 196 So. 793, 1940 Miss. LEXIS 121 (Miss. 1940).

      If the commission should decide that an emergency exists at any time, said commission is hereby authorized and empowered to issue a temporary certificate of convenience and necessity or temporary contract carrier permit to fit applicants, and the State Tax Commission is hereby authorized to collect inspection fees and issue temporary identification credentials to any owner or operator to whom a temporary certificate of convenience and necessity or a temporary contract carrier permit has been issued by the Public Service Commission. The State Tax Commission is also hereby authorized to issue to holders of temporary certificates of convenience and necessity or temporary contract carrier permits the necessary road and bridge privilege license tax temporary permits in the same manner as temporary or seasonal permits are now issued under the provisions of Chapter 19 of Title 27, Mississippi Code of 1972. No temporary certificate of convenience and necessity or contract carrier permit shall be issued by the commission for a period of time less than one (1) month or longer than six (6) months. Reissue of such certificate or permit is hereby authorized if, in the opinion of the commission, such is justified.

       Security interest transaction does not transfer control over certificate, and thus does not fall within statute. Dorman v. Rowell, 515 So. 2d 1214, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2918 (Miss. 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       Commission’s power is circumscribed by its statutorily granted power to protect public interest with respect to use of highways, and no where in statute did legislature authorize Public Service Commission to inquire into transactions between corporations and their fiduciaries to determine whether they were inherently fair to shareholders or creditors. It is not within purview of Public Service Commission to enforce creditors’ liens and set aside transfer of certificate of necessity made to evade creditors, except as they affect public interest in regulating motor carriers. Dorman v. Rowell, 515 So. 2d 1214, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2918 (Miss. 1987).
      </p>

       Where the commission’s approval of the transfer of a certificate of convenience and necessity from an individual to a corporation controlled by him was obtained without disclosure of a sale of his stock to others, the commission, instead of requiring that operations under such certificate be discontinued, should have required the parties to show cause why its approval of the transfer should not be set aside. Mississippi Public Service Com. v. Chambers, 235 Miss. 133, 108 So. 2d 550, 1959 Miss. LEXIS 411 (Miss. 1959).

       Refusal of railroad commission to permit bus company, which had leased its franchise to operate bus schedule to competing company, to operate bus schedule, did not deprive bus company of its franchise without due process, since bus company had remedy in court if deprived of franchise rights.

     <p>
      Any person, state board, organization or body politic may make complaint in writing to the commission that any such rate, fare, charge, classification, rule, regulation or practice in effect, or proposed to be put into effect, is or will be in violation of Sections 77-7-153, 77-7-187, 77-7-211 through 77-7-215.The provisions of this section shall not apply to common carriers of household goods.
     </p>
     <p>
      Whenever, after hearing, upon complaint or in an investigation on its own initiative, the commission is of the opinion that any individual or joint rate, fare or charge, demanded, charged or collected by any common carrier or carriers by motor vehicle or by any common carrier or carriers by motor vehicle in conjunction with any common carrier or carriers by railroad or express, or water, or any classification, rule, regulation or practice whatsoever of such carrier or carriers affecting such rate, fare or charge or the value of the service thereunder, is or will be unjust or unreasonable, or unjustly discriminatory or unduly preferential or unduly prejudicial, it shall determine and prescribe the lawful rate, fare or charge thereunder to be observed, or the lawful classification, rule, regulation or practice thereafter to be made effective.
     </p>
     <p>
      The commission shall, whenever deemed by it to be necessary or desirable in the public interest, after hearing, upon complaint or upon its own initiative without a complaint, establish through routes, and joint rates, fares, charges, regulations or practices, applicable to the transportation of passengers by common carriers by motor vehicle, or the maxima or minima, to be charged, and the terms and conditions under which the through routes shall be operated.
     </p>
     <p>
      Whenever, after hearing, upon complaint or upon its own initiative, the commission is of opinion that the divisions of joint rates, fares or charges, applicable to the transportation of passengers by common carriers by motor vehicle or by such carriers in conjunction with common carriers by railroad or express, or water are, or will be unjust, unreasonable, inequitable or unduly preferential or prejudicial as between the carriers parties thereto (whether agreed upon by such carriers, or any of them, or otherwise established), the commission shall by order prescribe the just, reasonable and equitable divisions thereof to be received by the several carriers. In cases where the joint rate, fare or charge was established pursuant to a finding or order of the commission and the divisions thereof are found by it to have been unjust, unreasonable or inequitable, or unduly preferential or prejudicial, the commission may also by order determine what would have been the just, reasonable and equitable divisions thereof to be received by the several carriers, and require adjustment to be made in accordance with the order, from the date of filing the complaint or entry of order of investigation or such other date subsequent as the commission finds justified and, in the case of joint rates prescribed by the commission, the order as to divisions may be made effective as a part of the original order.

    Suspension of rates proposed by common carriers.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Whenever there shall be filed with the commission any schedule stating a new individual or joint rate, fare, charge or classification for the transportation of passengers by a common carrier or carriers by motor vehicle, or by any such carrier or carriers in conjunction with a common carrier or carriers by railroad, express or water, or any rule, regulation or practice affecting such rate, fare or charge, or the value of the service thereunder, the commission is hereby authorized and empowered, upon complaint of any interested party or upon its own initiative, if it so orders, without answer or other formal pleading by the interested carrier or carriers, but upon reasonable notice, to enter upon a hearing concerning the lawfulness of such rate, fare or charge, or such rule, regulation or practice, and pending such hearing and the decision thereon the commission, by filing with such schedule and delivering to the carrier or carriers affected thereby, a statement in writing of its reasons for such suspension, may suspend the operation of such schedule and defer the use of such rate, fare or charge, or such rule, regulation or practice, for a period of ninety (90) days. If the proceeding has not been concluded and a final order made within such period, the commission may, from time to time, extend the period of suspension by order, but not for a longer period in the aggregate than one hundred eighty (180) days beyond the time when it would otherwise go into effect. After hearing, whether completed before or after the rate, fare, charge, classification, rule, regulation or practice goes into effect, the commission may make such order with reference thereto as would be proper in a proceeding instituted after it had become effective. If the proceeding has not been concluded and an order made within the period of suspension, the proposed change of rate, fare or charge, or classification, rule, regulation or practice shall go into effect at the end of such period.

     <p>
      In the exercise of its power to prescribe just and reasonable rates for the transportation of passengers by common carriers by motor vehicle, the commission shall give due consideration, among other factors, to the inherent advantages of transportation by such carriers; to the effect of rates upon the movement of traffic by such carriers; to the need, in the public interest, of adequate and efficient transportation service by such carriers at the lowest cost consistent with the furnishing of such services; and to the need of revenues sufficient to enable such carriers, under honest, economical and efficient management, to provide such service.
     </p>
     <p>
      In any proceeding to determine the justness or reasonableness of any rate, fare or charge of any such carrier, there shall not be taken into consideration or allowed as evidence or elements of value of the property of such carrier, either goodwill, earning power, or the certificate under which such carrier is operating. In applying for and receiving a certificate under this chapter, any such carrier shall be deemed to have agreed to the provisions of this paragraph, on its own behalf and on behalf of all transferees or lessees of such certificate.

    Minimum charges of contract carriers to be filed with commission; reductions.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      It shall be the duty of every contract carrier by motor vehicle to file with the commission, publish, and keep open for public inspection, in the form and manner prescribed by the commission, schedules, or in the discretion of the commission, copies of contracts containing the minimum charges of such carrier for the transportation of passengers in intrastate commerce, and any rule, regulation, or practice affecting such charges and the value of the service thereunder. No such contract carrier, unless otherwise provided by this chapter, shall engage in the transportation of passengers in intrastate commerce unless the minimum charges for such transportation by the carrier have been published, filed and posted in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.
     </p>
     <p>
      No reduction shall be made in any such charge, either directly or by means of any change in any rule, regulation or practice affecting such charge or the value of service thereunder, except after thirty (30) days’ notice of the proposed change filed in the aforesaid form and manner. However, the commission may, in its discretion and for good cause shown, allow such change upon less notice, or modify the requirements of this section with respect to posting and filing of such schedules or copies of contracts, either in particular instances, or by general order applicable to special or peculiar circumstances or conditions. Such notice shall plainly state the change proposed to be made and the time when such change will take effect.
     </p>
     <p>
      No such carrier shall demand, charge or collect a less compensation for such transportation than the charges filed in accordance with this section, as affected by any rule, regulation or practice so filed, or as may be prescribed by the commission from time to time, and it shall be unlawful for any such carrier, by the furnishing of special services, facilities, or privileges, or by any other device whatsoever, to charge, accept or receive less than the minimum charges so filed or prescribed. Any such carrier or carriers or any class or group thereof, may apply to the commission for relief from the provisions of this section, and the commission may, after hearing, grant the relief to such extent and for such time, and in such manner as in its judgment is consistent with the public interest and the policy declared in Section 77-7-3.

      Whenever, after hearing upon complaint or its own initiative, the commission finds that any charge of any contract carrier or carriers by motor vehicle, or any rule, regulation or practice of any such carrier or carriers affecting such charge, or the value of the service thereunder, for the transportation of passengers in intrastate commerce, contravenes the policy declared in Section 77-7-3, the commission may prescribe such minimum charge, or such rule, regulation or practice as in its judgment may be necessary or desirable in the public interest and to promote the policy declared in said section. Such minimum charge, or such rule, regulation or practice so prescribed by the commission, shall give no advantage or preference to any such carrier in competition with any common carrier by motor vehicle subject to this chapter, which the commission may find to be undue or inconsistent with the public interest and the policy declared in said section. The commission shall give due consideration to the cost of the services rendered by such carriers and to the effect of such minimum charge, or such rules, regulations or practices upon the movement of traffic by such carriers. All complaints shall state fully the facts complained of and the reasons for such complaint and shall be made under oath.

    Suspension of charges proposed by contract carriers.

     <p>
      Whenever there shall be filed with the commission by any contract carrier any schedule or contract stating a reduced charge directly, or by means of any rule, regulation or practice, for the transportation of passengers in intrastate commerce, the commission is hereby authorized and empowered, upon complaint of interested parties or upon its own initiative at once and, if it so orders, without answer or other formal pleading by the interested party, but upon reasonable notice, to enter upon a hearing concerning the lawfulness of such charge, or such rule, regulation or practice, and pending such hearing and the decision thereon the commission, by filing with such schedule or contract and delivering to the carrier affected thereby, a statement in writing of its reasons for such suspension, may suspend the operation of such schedule or contract and defer the use of such charge, or such rule, regulation or practice, for a period of ninety (90) days. If the proceeding has not been concluded and a final order made within such period, the commission may, from time to time, extend the period of suspension, but not for a longer period in the aggregate than one hundred eighty (180) days beyond the time when it would otherwise go into effect. After hearing, whether completed before or after the charge, or rule, regulation or practice goes into effect, the commission may make such order with reference thereto as would be proper in proceeding instituted after it had become effective. If the proceeding has not been concluded and an order made within the period of suspension, the proposed change in any charge or rule, regulation or practice shall go into effect at the end of such period. The carrier may voluntarily suspend such schedule, rule, regulation or practice for further periods beyond the one hundred eighty (180) days and until the proceeding be concluded.

     <p>
      The commission is hereby authorized to require annual, periodical, or special reports from all motor carriers except those exempted in this chapter, to prescribe the manner and form in which such reports shall be made, and to require from such carriers specific answers to all questions upon which the commission may deem information to be necessary. Such reports shall be under oath whenever the commission so requires. The commission may also require any motor carrier to file with it a copy of each or any contract, agreement, or arrangement between such carrier and any other carrier or person in relation to any traffic affected by the provisions of this chapter.
     </p>
     <p>
      The commission may, in its discretion, prescribe the forms of any and all accounts, records, and memoranda, including those of the movement of traffic as well as of the receipts and expenditures of money, to be kept by common carriers and restricted common carriers by motor vehicle and the length of time such accounts, records and memoranda shall be preserved. The commission or its employees shall at all reasonable times have access to all lands, buildings, or equipment of motor carriers used in connection with their operations and also all accounts, records, and memoranda, including all documents, papers, and correspondence now or hereafter existing, and kept or required to be kept, by motor carriers. The commission and its employees shall have authority to inspect and examine any and all such lands, buildings, equipment, accounts, records, and memoranda, including all documents, papers, and correspondence now or hereafter existing and kept or required to be kept by such carriers. This section shall apply to receivers of carriers, to operating trustees, and to the extent deemed necessary by the commission, to persons affiliated with or having control, direct or indirect, over any motor carrier.

       § 77-7-295.
    Appeal of final finding, order or judgment of commission.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      In addition to other remedies now available, the state, or any party aggrieved by any final finding, order or judgment of the commission, shall have the right, regardless of the amount involved, of appeal to the First Judicial District Circuit Court of Hinds County, Mississippi. If an application for rehearing has been filed, an appeal must be filed within thirty (30) days after the application for rehearing has been refused or deemed refused because of the commission’s failure to act thereon within the time specified in Section 77-7-293, or if the application is granted, within thirty (30) days after the rendition of the decision on rehearing. If an application for rehearing has not been filed, an appeal must be filed within thirty (30) days after the entry of the commission’s order. In those cases wherein an administrative order of the commission is involved, the circuit court may affirm or reverse for further proceedings as justice may require. In those cases wherein the commission’s order appealed from is a judicial finding, the circuit court shall review, affirm, reverse or modify the same and enter therein such order or judgment as may be right and just. Without excluding any other finding, order or judgment of the commission as constituting a judicial finding, the granting or denial by the commission of an application for a certificate of public convenience and necessity, or the granting of denial of an application for a permit to operate as a contract carrier, shall be construed as a judicial finding, and appealable as such. All such appeals shall be taken and perfected, heard and determined either in term time or in vacation, on the record, including a transcript of pleadings and testimony, both oral and documentary, filed and heard before the commission; and such appeal shall be heard and disposed of promptly by the court as a preference cause. In perfecting any appeal provided by this section, the provisions of law respecting notice to the reporter and the allowance of bills of exception, now or hereafter in force respecting appeals from circuit courts to the Supreme Court, shall be applicable.

     <p>
      Any railroad corporation heretofore or hereafter organized under the laws of the State of Mississippi may issue one or more classes of capital stock with or without nominal or par value. Such classes of capital stock may be issued with such designations, preferences and restrictions, if any, as may be stated and expressed in the charter of incorporation or in any amendment thereto, including restrictions and qualifications upon the voting powers of any such stock not in conflict with Section 194 of the Constitution of 1890, or the provisions of this section.
     </p>
     <p>
      Preferred capital stock with or without nominal or par value may be made subject to redemption in such manner, at such time or times, and at such price or prices; be given such preferences as to net assets upon dissolution or winding up of the corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary; be given the right to receive such cumulative or non-cumulative dividends payable quarterly, semiannually or annually, and payable as a whole or in part before any dividends shall be set apart or paid on the common stock; be authorized to be issued in more than one series of the same class, each series carrying the same or different rates of dividends; be given full, qualified or no voting power (except as required by Section 194 of the Constitution of 1890); be made convertible into shares of other classes of preferred or common stock with or without nominal or par value; and be made subject to such other restrictions, limitations and qualifications, if any, as shall be stated and prescribed or provided in the charter of incorporation, or in any amendment thereto.
     </p>

      Capital stock without nominal or par value, whether common or preferred, may be issued by the railroad corporation from time to time for such consideration as may be stated in the charter of incorporation or any amendment thereto, or as may thereafter from time to time be fixed by the board of directors (by whatever name called), pursuant to authority granted them in the charter of incorporation or any amendment thereto. If the power to fix said consideration be not granted in such charter or amendment, then said power shall be given, by the consent of the holders of two-thirds (2/3) of each class of stock then outstanding and entitled to vote, at a meeting called for that purpose in a manner to be prescribed, by the by-laws. All shares without nominal or par value so issued, for which the full consideration, so fixed, has been paid or delivered, shall be deemed full paid stock, and not liable to any further call or assessment thereon, and the holder of such shares shall not be liable for any further payment thereon.
     </p>
     <p>
      In any case in which the law requires that the par value of shares of stock of a corporation be stated in any certificate or paper, it shall be stated, in respect to shares without nominal or par value, that such shares are without par value. Whenever the amount of stock, authorized or issued, is required to be stated, with respect to shares without nominal or par value, the number of shares authorized or issued shall be stated, and it shall also be stated that such shares are without par value.
     </p>
     <p>
      Every certificate of preferred stock issued shall show upon its face all of the privileges, restrictions, limitations and qualifications affecting the same, and the total amount of authorized capital stock of the class to which it belongs. Every certificate of common stock issued shall show upon its face the total amount of authorized common capital stock. Every certificate of stock issued, whether common or preferred, shall show upon its face the par value per share thereof, if any, otherwise the fact that such shares are without nominal or par value, and shall bear the words: “incorporated in Mississippi.”

     <p>
      No outstanding stock of any railroad corporation shall be retired if the corporation would be thereby rendered insolvent or its paid in capital be thereby reduced to less than the minimum amount required by its charter or amendments thereto, except upon dissolution.

      In the event the board of directors of a railroad corporation, incorporated, chartered and organized prior to March 18, 1938, desire, they may, with the consent of the majority of the stockholders, exchange such stock as may be issued under the provisions of this section for stock previously issued, the par value of which was fixed at One Hundred Dollars ($100.00) per share by the projectors at the time of the organization of the railroad. In making such exchange the par value of the stock so issued shall be fixed at the actual value, at the time of the exchange, of the previously issued outstanding stock, and in no event shall any stock be issued of a fictitious value in exchange for any stock or for any other purpose.

If the opinion be that the application conforms to law, and the governor believes that the charter should be amended as desired, he shall indorse his approval thereon. The resolution, together with the indorsements of the attorney-general and the governor, shall be filed with the secretary of state, who shall record the same and certify the fact under the great seal. The resolution shall likewise be recorded in the records of deeds of each county through which the railroad constructed or to be constructed under such charter may run.

       Travelers on a highway have a right to insist that the signals required by this section [Code 1942, § 7777] be given, not only that they may be warned thereby to keep off the tracks, but that they may extricate themselves and their property from a position of danger before the arrival of a train. Archer v. Gulf, M. & O. R. Co., 186 So. 2d 470, 1966 Miss. LEXIS 1314 (Miss. 1966).

       Where the driver of an automobile, when within 50 feet of a railroad crossing, saw a locomotive about 100 feet away approaching at a speed of four or five miles per hour, and, after coming practically to a stop, proceeded upon the crossing at about ten miles per hour, and the automobile was struck by the locomotive, failure to give the statutory warning did not render the railroad liable for damages to the automobile, since under the circumstances warning was not necessary. Gulf, M. & O. R. Co. v. Baggett, 193 Miss. 356, 8 So. 2d 246, 1942 Miss. LEXIS 99 (Miss. 1942).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a motorist, by his own admission, saw railroad cars occupying the crossing for a distance of from 150 to 200 feet, the warning required by this section [Code 1942, § 7777] was not necessary, since the occupancy of the crossing by a railroad train was a sufficient warning within itself of the presence of the cars on the crossing. Gulf, M. & N. R. Co. v. Addkison, 189 Miss. 301, 194 So. 593, 1940 Miss. LEXIS 96 (Miss. 1940).
      </p>

       In absence of “peculiar environment,” railroad had no duty to give warning upon or at crossing over which flat cars were passing in addition to signals required by statute. Spilman v. Gulf & S. I. R. Co., 173 Miss. 725, 163 So. 445, 1935 Miss. LEXIS 256 (Miss. 1935).
      </p>
      <p>
       Under statute requiring locomotive to sound warning signal at public crossing until crossing is passed, no duty is imposed to give signal warning so that it may be heard for greater distance than 300 yards from crossing, and crossing is “passed” when it has become entirely occupied by train, whereupon obligation to continue signals no longer exists. Spilman v. Gulf & S. I. R. Co., 173 Miss. 725, 163 So. 445, 1935 Miss. LEXIS 256 (Miss. 1935).

       Summary judgment against wrongful death action granted; record contained uncontroverted evidence that bell on the train was rung continuously from a distance of more than 300 yards before railroad crossing where it struck decedent’s car. In addition, any failure to sound the whistle or other warning, or any malfunction of the equipment, did not proximately cause the accident, for the evidence showed that the wife was aware of the train, and tried to pass in front of it. Wilson v. Kan. City S. Ry. Co., 276 F. Supp. 2d 614, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14177 (S.D. Miss. 2003).

      <p>
       Engineer’s failure to give statutory warning at proper distance from crossing where view was obstructed, held properly found to be proximate negligence proximately causing a collision with an automobile. Illinois C. R. Co. v. McDaniel, 246 Miss. 600, 151 So. 2d 805, 1963 Miss. LEXIS 486 (Miss. 1963).
      </p>
      <p>
       The failure to ring the bell or blow the whistle would not of itself impose liability for an accident at a crossing, it being necessary to a cause of action for negligence for such failure to show that it was the proximate, or a contributing, cause of the accident, and where the evidence showed that a locomotive hauling a long freight train was equipped with an electric light producing a radiance for a distance of not less than 150 to 200 feet in the drizzling rain, and the roar of the train was distinctly heard a mile and a half away, was struck by a motor truck at a crossing along a stretch of track plainly visible for a quarter of a mile, and the plaintiff truck driver claimed to have been unaware of the approaching train until he was within 4 or 5 feet of it, the plaintiff was not entitled to judgment, it not being shown that the failure to ring the bell or blow the whistle was the proximate or a contributing cause of the accident. New Orleans & N. E. R. Co. v. Burge, 191 Miss. 303, 2 So. 2d 825, 1941 Miss. LEXIS 160 (Miss. 1941).
      </p>
      <p>
       Violation of statute requiring trains to sound bell or whistle on approaching highway intersection is negligence on part of railroad, and, if such negligence is proximate cause of injury, railroad is liable.

      </p>

       Railroad held liable for injuries to traveler at crossing caused by team becoming frightened at steam escaping from engine, where railroad failed to give statutory signals although engineer stopped engine before reaching crossing and thereby avoided collision.

       Though administrator’s amended declaration based cause of action solely on allegation that railroad violated Code requiring warnings on approaching public crossing, notices filed by railway company under plea of general issue showed that railroad company was aware that case was actually to proceed on common-law liability for failure to give warning to trespasser on its tracks after railroad had become aware of the danger, and entire course of trial showed that railway was in no way surprised or misled by the amended declaration, and no demurrer was interposed to amended declaration, and no objection was made to testimony on ground of variance.

       Railroad was properly granted summary judgment dismissing appellants’ negligence claims, as the evidence established that the train was traveling below the speed limit, that the crew kept a proper lookout, that the train’s whistle blew 900 feet before the crossing as required by statute, and that the emergency brake was activated before impact, and appellants did not support their claim that the railroad failed to clear vegetation near crossing or to maintain an adequate crossing warning system.

   In a personal injury case arising from a collision at a railroad crossing in which it was undisputed that the train’s bell was sounded continuously in excess of 6000 feet prior to the crossing, while the crossing was occupied, and remained on even after the accident, that far exceeded the requirements of Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t77c09s77-9-225" target="_self">77-9-225</a></cite>. Joiner v. AMTRAK, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 38753 (S.D. Miss. Mar. 25, 2008).

       Jury’s verdict that railroad was not liable for death of individual in railroad crossing accident was supported by evidence that train was ringing its bell and blowing its horn upon approaching railroad crossing.

      <p>
       In an action by the wife and children of decedent, who was killed when his truck was hit by a train at a crossing, against the railroad and the train’s engineer, the jury’s verdict for the plaintiffs was against the overwhelming weight of the evidence where three witnesses, not employees of the railroad, had testified that the train blew its whistle and rang its bell at or near a whistle post 900 feet from the crossing, such testimony corroborating that of the engineer and the fireman, and where plaintiffs’ witnesses had testified merely that they heard the whistle more or less concurrently with the collision (though one witness suggested he thought he might have heard an earlier warning) and they did not testify affirmatively that there had been no prior whistle or bell soundings. Illinois C. G. R. Co. v. Yates, 334 So. 2d 364, 1976 Miss. LEXIS 1923 (Miss. 1976).

       Failure to give statutory signals, held not established by testimony of witnesses that they did not hear them, where others testified that they were given. New Orleans & N. R. Co. v. Burney, 248 Miss. 290, 159 So. 2d 85, 1963 Miss. LEXIS 395 (Miss. 1963).

       In an action for wrongful injury and death to a child who was killed when automobile in which he was riding was struck by a train at a grade-crossing, testimony of witnesses, who were so situated that in the ordinary course of events they would have heard statutory signals if they had been sounded, that the signals were not given, was sufficient to warn the jury in finding that such signals were not given despite the positive testimony of the train crew.

      <p>
       When a person is injured or killed on a public railroad crossing, the failure to ring the bell or sound the whistle as required by this section [Code 1942, § 7777] will raise the presumption prima facie that the injured person would have heard and acted upon the warning had it been given, and that if an opposite conclusion is to be reached the burden is upon the railroad company to meet the presumption by proof. New Orleans & N. E. R. Co. v. Miles, 197 Miss. 846, 20 So. 2d 657, 1945 Miss. LEXIS 316 (Miss. 1945).
      </p>

       Refusal of the court to permit a witness to answer the question whether he would have heard the bell if it had been ringing, was erroneous since the question did not call for mere matter of opinion. Heafner v. Columbus & G. R. Co., 185 Miss. 773, 190 So. 1, 1939 Miss. LEXIS 195 (Miss. 1939).

       The statutory presumption of negligence was held to have been overcome by testimony that the train and its appliances were in good order, that the warning signals required by this section [Code 1942, § 7777] were given, that the engineer did not see deceased on railroad right of way until about 240 feet away, and immediately applied brakes.

       Although motorist’s failure to stop before attempting to cross railroad tracks constituted negligence contributing to the collision between his automobile and a switch engine, trial court properly refused to grant to railroad company a peremptory instruction where there were jury questions as to whether the proximate cause of the accident was the failure of the railroad to ring the bell on its engine, or the failure of the engineer to stop when he saw that the motorist was not going to.

   In a case where the decedent was struck and killed by a train, the trial court properly instructed the jury regarding the railroad company’s duty to warn of a train’s approach in light of the statutory guidelines in Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t77c09s77-9-225" target="_self">77-9-225</a></cite>. Clark v. Ill. Cent. R.R., 872 So. 2d 773, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 423 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Since this section [Code 1942, § 7777] does not require both signals to be given, it was reversible error, in an action arising out of a collision between a switch engine and an automobile at a street crossing, to instruct that a railroad, in operation of trains where the track crosses a municipal street, is required to give a signal or alarm 300 yards before reaching the street crossing by ringing its bell and blowing its whistle. New Orleans & N. R. Co. v. Ready, 238 Miss. 199, 118 So. 2d 185, 1960 Miss. LEXIS 396 (Miss. 1960).

      <p>
       An instruction in an action against a railroad for death of an automobile passenger arising from a collision at a railroad crossing, to the effect that there could be no recovery against the railroad because of any alleged failure on its part to equip its locomotive with such a bell and whistle as the law required, was erroneous where one of the principal issues was whether the bell had been rung continuously for a distance of 900 feet before the crossing and until the locomotive had passed the crossing, and the evidence failed to disclose whether the train was equipped with a bell and the declaration was silent with respect thereto.

       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       In a personal injury action arising when the decedent’s van was struck by a train at a railroad crossing, the trial court’s directed verdict for the railroad would be reversed where the questions of negligence in failing to give the signal required by statute and proximate cause were appropriate for determination by the jury. Walker v. Louisville & N. R. Co., 571 F.2d 866, 1978 U.S. App. LEXIS 11589 (5th Cir. Miss. 1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where there was conflicting testimony as to whether auditory warnings were made as required by this section [Code 1942, § 7777], the questions of negligence and proximate cause were for the jury. New Orleans & N. R. Co. v. Weary, 217 So. 2d 274, 1968 Miss. LEXIS 1260 (Miss. 1968).
      </p>
      <p>
       The question of whether the warning signals required by this section [Code 1942, § 7777] were sounded is squarely within the province of the jury to determine, and it is likewise the function of the jury to determine whether a railroad’s failure to give the required signals was the proximate cause of the plaintiff’s injuries. Archer v. Gulf, M. & O. R. Co., 186 So. 2d 470, 1966 Miss. LEXIS 1314 (Miss. 1966).
      </p>
      <p>
       The testimony of a witness, riding in his truck at night at 50 miles per hour and going in the opposite direction from a train which struck a stalled automobile at a crossing, that he did not hear the locomotive engineer sound either bell or whistle when approaching the crossing was sufficient to take the wrongful death action to the jury, as against a requested peremptory instruction. New Orleans & N. R. Co. v. Phillips, 252 Miss. 438, 172 So. 2d 414, 1965 Miss. LEXIS 1118 (Miss. 1965).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a death action arising out of a collision between decedent’s truck and defendant’s freight train at a railroad crossing, conflicting testimony as to the speed of the train and as to the giving of the statutory signals, when considered in connection with the alleged obstruction of the decedent’s view by a packing shed, depot building, and two box cars along the west side of the packing shed, all tending to show that the decedent could not have seen the train even by exercising reasonable care until he was in the act of crossing the track, presented an issue of fact for the jury as to whether or not the negligence of the defendant railroad company was a concurring or contributing cause of the accident. Illinois C. R. Co. v. Sanders, 229 Miss. 139, 90 So. 2d 366, 1956 Miss. LEXIS 595 (Miss. 1956), overruled,
   Sheffield v. Sheffield, 405 So. 2d 1314, 1981 Miss. LEXIS 2053 (Miss. 1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where there was conflicting testimony as to whether warning signals of an approach of a train were given, this was sufficient to take the case to the jury on a question of liability of railroad for the death of passenger when automobile in which she was riding was struck by freight train at grade crossing. Gulf, M. & O. R. Co. v. White, 219 Miss. 342, 68 So. 2d 458, 1953 Miss. LEXIS 394 (Miss. 1953).
      </p>
      <p>
       In an action for wrongful injury and death of a boy of the age of twelve years who was killed when automobile in which he was riding was struck at a grade-crossing by train, questions as to whether the statutory warning signals were given and as to whether the failure to give such signals directly and proximately caused or contributed to the injury and death of decedent, and as to whether the driver of the car saw the train and attempted to beat the train across the crossing were factual issues to be determined by the jury. Louisville & N. R. Co. v. Whisenant, 214 Miss. 421, 58 So. 2d 908, 1952 Miss. LEXIS 485 (Miss. 1952).
      </p>
      <p>
       In action for death of motorist struck by train at crossing, whether railroad gave statutory signals held for jury. Yazoo & M. R. Co. v. Pittman, 169 Miss. 667, 153 So. 382, 1934 Miss. LEXIS 60 (Miss. 1934).
      </p>
      <p>
       Railroad’s negligence in failing to give statutory signals before reaching crossing and striking automobile held for jury. Gulf & S. I. R. Co. v. Simmons, 150 Miss. 506, 117 So. 345, 1928 Miss. LEXIS 182 (Miss. 1928).
      </p>
      <p>
       In action for death of motorist killed at crossing, whether railroad was negligent and whether negligence caused death held for jury. Columbus & G. R. Co. v. Lee, 149 Miss. 543, 115 So. 782, 1928 Miss. LEXIS 73 (Miss. 1928).
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether crossing signals were given held for jury. Gulf & S. I. R. Co. v. Carlson, 137 Miss. 613, 102 So. 168, 1924 Miss. LEXIS 210 (Miss. 1924).
      </p>

       Whether railroad company overcame prima facie case held question for the jury. Young v. Illinois C. R. Co., 88 Miss. 446, 40 So. 870, 1906 Miss. LEXIS 144 (Miss. 1906).

Mobile & O. R. Co. v. Campbell, 114 Miss. 803, 75 So. 554, 1917 Miss. LEXIS 87 (Miss. 1917).

      <p>
       This section [Code 1942, § 7771] held not repealed, altered, or modified by contributory negligence statute (Code 1942, § 1454). Mobile & O. R. Co. v. Campbell, 114 Miss. 803, 75 So. 554, 1917 Miss. LEXIS 87 (Miss. 1917).
      </p>
      <p>
       Railroad company not complying with this section [Code 1942, § 7771] in backing car which killed decedent held liable though decedent was guilty of contributory negligence. Illinois C. R. Co. v. Archer, 113 Miss. 158, 74 So. 135, 1916 Miss. LEXIS 37 (Miss. 1916).
      </p>
      <p>
       One injured while attempting to pass through opening of about six feet in train after he saw that portion had begun to move towards the other part, was not within statute, since provision against contributory negligence as a defense is not available to one whose injuries are the result of his own voluntary, deliberate, wilful, or reckless exposure of himself. Sledge v. Yazoo & M. V. R. Co., 87 Miss. 566, 40 So. 13, 1905 Miss. LEXIS 169 (Miss. 1905).

       Where a train running at a much greater rate of speed than that allowed in a much frequented part of the city and without giving signals strikes a pedestrian going in the same direction, the company is reckless amounting to wilfulness and the party injured may recover regardless of whether he was rightfully or wrongfully on the track.

       Where there was evidence that a railroad without giving signals ran an extra train at night at a speed in excess of the lawful rate over frequented street crossings, there being a controversy as to the conduct of the deceased, one view of the facts exculpating him from negligence, the question of his contributory negligence was properly left to the jury.

       Where, although plaintiff attempted to cross over in front of a rapidly moving train, there was evidence that the train was exceeding the lawful rate and that it increased its speed from the point where it was first noticed until it struck plaintiff’s wagon, question whether proper diligence on the part of the engineer would have avoided the collision should have been submitted to the jury, notwithstanding plaintiff’s contributory negligence.

       Section 77-9-237 applies only to steam locomotives and not to locomotives operated by diesel fuel or electricity. In a wrongful death action arising from a collision between an automobile and a train not powered by a steam locomotive, an instruction with respect to the speed limit established by this section was prejudicial error. Illinois C. G. Railroad v. Stedman, 344 So. 2d 468, 1977 Miss. LEXIS 2440 (Miss. 1977).
      </p>
      <p>
       In an action arising from a train-automobile collision, an instruction to the effect that the engineer operating the train had no right under the law to run it across the intersection in question at a greater rate of speed than was reasonably prudent or careful at the time, taking into consideration all of the facts and circumstances, was not erroneous for failing to give the jury any guide to what was a reasonable or prudent rate of speed, where the facts were sufficient to warrant the jury in finding that the intersection was unusually hazardous and that the speed of 52 miles an hour at which the train was proceeding through a town was not a reasonable and prudent rate of speed. Illinois C. R. Co. v. Pilgrim, 220 So. 2d 598, 1969 Miss. LEXIS 1465 (Miss. 1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       In guest’s action against railroad for injuries sustained in collision between automobile and freight train, instruction with respect to liability of railroad if train was operated at speed exceeding six miles per hour in municipality, which omitted qualification that speed must be proximate cause of accident or contributing proximate cause thereto where railroad relied on evidence that speed was not proximate cause of accident, held prejudicial error. Yazoo & M. V. R. Co. v. Aultman, 179 Miss. 109, 173 So. 280, 1937 Miss. LEXIS 5 (Miss. 1937).
      </p>
      <p>
       In action for railroad brakeman’s death, giving instruction based on inapplicable statute forbidding greater train speed than six miles an hour in town held prejudicial error. Gulf, M. & N. R. Co. v. Walters, 161 Miss. 313, 134 So. 831, 1931 Miss. LEXIS 248 (Miss. 1931).
      </p>
      <p>
       In an action for the loss of property alleged to have been negligently set on fire, an instruction for a railroad company is erroneous which assumes to state its duties under the circumstances but excludes the imputation of negligence arising from the excessive speed at which its train was run. Mississippi Home Ins. Co. v. Louisville, N. O. & T. R. Co., 70 Miss. 119, 12 So. 156, 1892 Miss. LEXIS 99 (Miss. 1892).

       In an action against the railroad by a motorist for injury suffered when he collided with a flatcar standing on a public crossing which exact location he did not know because he was looking for a stop sign, evidence of reasonable care of the motorist was for the jury where the motorist proceeded on a dark night over a highway which had a slight dip near the crossing and the railroad did not provide a stop sign or any warning of the presence of the train on the crossing.

      <p>
       It was error, in an action for the death of a person who fell or jumped from a truck at a railroad crossing, to instruct the jury peremptorily that the failure of the defendant railroad to maintain the stop sign was negligence, in view of other instructions given to the effect that if the railroad company was guilty of any negligence the jury should find for the plaintiffs, where the proof failed to disclose any causal connection between the failure of the railroad company to maintain the stop sign and the accident complained of, it being shown without dispute that the driver of the truck was thoroughly familiar with the crossing and its location on the highway.

       While Mississippi legislature in 1974 changed law requiring stop at all railroad crossings to one requiring stop only when train is in hazardous proximity to crossing and is plainly visible, among other enumerated conditions, distance of unobstructed vision is not based upon motorist driving at maximum speed limit without regard to fact that he is approaching railroad crossing; motorist must take such measures as will allow him to come to stop not less than 15 feet from nearest rail. Mitcham v. Illinois C. G. R. Co., 515 So. 2d 852, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2779 (Miss. 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section [Code 1942, § 7776] presupposes that a railroad company will not by its own act, except in cases of emergency, so obstruct the view at the crossing that the driver of an automobile will be unable to see an approaching train if he complies with the requirements of the statute and when it becomes necessary to obstruct the view or crossing, it becomes the duty of the railroad’s servants in charge of its trains in approaching the crossing to exercise greater caution to avoid striking persons lawfully using the crossing. New Orleans & N. R. Co. v. Lewis, 214 Miss. 163, 58 So. 2d 486, 1952 Miss. LEXIS 456 (Miss. 1952).

       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       Driver did not have a duty to stop at the railroad crossing, and was not negligent per se, when he could not see the approaching train until the last minute due to the railroad’s failure to maintain the vegetation in its right of way. Ala. Great S. R.R. Co. v. Lee, 826 So. 2d 1232, 2002 Miss. LEXIS 167 (Miss. 2002).
      </p>
      <p>
       Proof of violation of statute is not necessary in order to prove negligence, and injured party established prima facie case of negligence by proving that driver violated statute by not stopping at crossing even though approaching train was plainly visible and in dangerous proximity to crossing, and by proving that driver was negligent in that he failed to keep proper lookout by looking back as he approached railroad crossing, rejecting contention of driver that because there was no evidence crossing was marked by signal or stop sign, injured party had failed to prove driver had violated statute and therefore had failed to prove negligence. Dale v. Bridges, 507 So. 2d 375, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2525 (Miss. 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although this section [Code 1942, § 7776] requires motorists to stop prior to reaching a railroad crossing, it also specifies that a failure to do so does not necessarily defeat recovery, and in fact states that negligence on the part of the driver is a question for the jury. New Orleans & N. R. Co. v. Weary, 217 So. 2d 274, 1968 Miss. LEXIS 1260 (Miss. 1968).
      </p>
      <p>
       Violation of this requirement held to establish negligence of driver of truck struck by train at crossing. Illinois C. R. Co. v. Nelson, 245 Miss. 395, 146 So. 2d 69, 1962 Miss. LEXIS 560, 1963 Miss. LEXIS 527, 1963 Miss. LEXIS 547 (Miss. 1962).
      </p>
      <p>
       Since there was no substantial evidence of negligence on the part of the railroad, and the sole proximate cause of decedent’s death was his failure to look and listen prior to driving his automobile onto the crossing in front of defendant’s approaching train, judgment for plaintiff would be reversed and judgment entered in the supreme count for the railroad. Illinois C. R. Co. v. Smith, 243 Miss. 766, 140 So. 2d 856, 1962 Miss. LEXIS 406 (Miss. 1962).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a railroad train collided with a truck at a country crossing, situated in the middle of a curve so that the lights of the train did not show the crossing until it was too late to stop the train to avoid a collision in view of the railroad speed of about 55 or 60 miles per hour, the statutory signals had been given, and the plaintiff had failed to stop, look and listen before driving upon the crossing, no negligence could be charged against the railroad but plaintiff’s negligence precluded his recovery for damage to the truck. Illinois C. R. Co. v. Roberson, 186 Miss. 507, 191 So. 494, 1939 Miss. LEXIS 265 (Miss. 1939).
      </p>
      <p>
       Bus passenger held entitled, as matter of law, to recover against bus company for injuries sustained in crossing collision, where driver made no attempt to stop bus which was traveling about 25 miles per hour until within less than 10 feet of crossing. Teche Lines, Inc. v. Pope, 175 Miss. 393, 166 So. 539, 1936 Miss. LEXIS 34 (Miss. 1936).
      </p>
      <p>
       Automobilist’s failure to stop at crossing held no defense to action based on railroad’s failure to blow whistle or ring bell. New Orleans & N. E. R. Co. v. Hegwood, 155 Miss. 104, 124 So. 66, 1929 Miss. LEXIS 262 (Miss. 1929).

       Failure of driver of vehicle to stop held not to prevent recovery for injury proximately caused by railroad’s negligence in failing to keep track reasonably safe. Gulf & S. I. R. Co. v. Saucier, 139 Miss. 497, 104 So. 180, 1925 Miss. LEXIS 162 (Miss. 1925).

       The failure of a truckdriver to stop before crossing a railroad track as required by this section [Code 1942, § 7776] does not prevent him from recovering damages where the negligence of the railroad is a proximate cause of the injury.

       The mere fact that an automatic flashing signal and bell is in operation at a railroad crossing at the time a motorist attempts to cross the tracks is not of itself sufficient to require the trial court to hold as a matter of law that the failure of the motorist to heed such warning renders his act the sole proximate cause of the accident complained of.

   Although trial judge refused a peremptory instruction that the driver was negligent, there was ample evidence that by proceeding onto the railroad tracks before she assured herself that she would not be blocked on them, she violated the standard under Miss.

   District court was not required to give the personal injury case of the driver of an automobile who was involved in an automobile-train collision to the jury under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t77c09s77-9-249" target="_self">77-9-249</a></cite> because the statute established a state procedural rule that was not binding on a federal court. King v.

       In action for wrongful death of person killed when car he was driving was struck by train at grade crossing, alleged violation of statute by driver did not preclude recovery and question of proximate cause was to be left to jury.

       Decedent’s compliance with or breach of duties imposed on him by statute was question for jury, although there was no testimony at trial concerning decedent’s compliance with or breach of duties imposed. Slay v. Illinois C. G. R. Co., 511 So. 2d 875, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2495 (Miss. 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although this section [Code 1942, § 7776] requires motorists to stop prior to reaching a railroad crossing, it also specifies that a failure to do so does not necessarily defeat recovery, and in fact states that negligence on the part of the driver is a question for the jury. New Orleans & N. R. Co. v. Weary, 217 So. 2d 274, 1968 Miss. LEXIS 1260 (Miss. 1968).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although motorist’s failure to stop before attempting to cross railroad tracks was negligence contributing to the collision between his automobile and a railroad switch engine, trial court properly refused railroad’s requested peremptory instruction where there were questions for the jury as to whether the proximate cause of the collision was failure of the railroad to ring the bell on its engine, or the negligence of the railroad’s engineer in failing to stop the engine when the engineer saw that motorist’s automobile was not going to stop. New Orleans & N. R. Co. v. Ready, 238 Miss. 199, 118 So. 2d 185, 1960 Miss. LEXIS 396 (Miss. 1960).

      <p>
       In a death action arising out of a collision between decedent’s truck and defendant’s freight train at a railroad crossing, conflicting testimony as to the speed of the train and the giving of the statutory signals, when considered in connection with the alleged obstruction of the decedent’s view by a packing shed, depot building, and two box cars along the west side of the packing shed, all tending to show that the decedent could not have seen the train even by exercising reasonable care until he was in the act of crossing the track, presented an issue of fact for the jury as to whether or not the negligence of the defendant railroad company was a concurring or contributing cause of the accident. Illinois C. R. Co. v. Sanders, 229 Miss. 139, 90 So. 2d 366, 1956 Miss. LEXIS 595 (Miss. 1956), overruled,

      <p>
       In an action against a railroad for wrongful death sustained in collision of train and automobile in which decedent was riding, the question whether negligent operation of a train at speed of fifty-five miles per hour at the crossing proximately caused or contributed to the collision and consequent death of the decedent was a question for the jury.

       Trial court correctly gave the jury instruction which informed the jury that a driver had a statutory duty to stop, not only if a train was plainly visible and was in hazardous proximity to the crossing, but also if a train was approaching within approximately nine-hundred feet of the crossing when emitting a signal and that the train, due to its speed or close proximity to the crossing, was an immediate hazard; a driver was required to slow to a reasonable speed in approaching a grade crossing with railroad crossbuck signs, and to stop, if necessary, for safety purposes, and to then proceed only upon being able to do so safely. Richardson v. Norfolk & Southern Ry., 923 So. 2d 1002, 2006 Miss. LEXIS 48 (Miss. 2006).

   In a case where the decedent was struck and killed by a train, the administratrix’s jury instruction ignored the decedent’s duty under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t77c09s77-9-249ol14" target="_self">77-9-249(4)</a></cite> when arriving at a crossing marked only by a crossbuck, which is to slow down, yield the right-of-way, and stop if required for safety. Thus, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to instruct the jury as requested by the administratrix and the jury was adequately instructed as to a driver’s duty, in this case the decedent, when approaching a railroad crossing. Clark v. Ill. Cent. R.R., 872 So. 2d 773, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 423 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).

     <p>
      Where a railroad is constructed so as to cross a highway, and it be necessary to raise or lower the highway, it shall be the duty of the railroad company to make proper and easy grades in the highway, so that the railroad may be conveniently crossed, and to keep such crossings in good order. It shall be the duty of the railroad company to erect and keep in order all bridges on any highway, at such points as bridges may be necessary to cross the railroad. Any company which shall fail to comply with these provisions within sixty (60) days from the filing of written notice by the board of supervisors of the county in which said crossing is located, served upon the agent of said railroad company located in said county by the sheriff, as other processes are served, shall forfeit the sum of the cost of construction of said bridge or crossing, to be recovered by action in the name of the county in which the bridge or crossing is situated, upon an itemized bill of cost of said work.

       Under this section [Code 1942, § 7779] railroad is not absolved from liability to one injured because of defective crossing because track was constructed before highway. Mississippi C. R. Co. v. Alexander, 169 Miss. 620, 152 So. 653, 1934 Miss. LEXIS 21 (Miss. 1934).

      <p>
       The fact that a railroad company had constructed its track and put the same in operation before a highway was laid out does not relieve it of its duty under this section [Code 1942, § 7770] to erect a bridge over the track or grade the approaches for the highway.

       The duty to erect and maintain a bridge applies to a highway laid out after the railroad was constructed; The section [Code 1942, § 7779] is within the police power and as so construed, does not deprive owners of a previously constructed road of property, without due process of law nor impair charter rights.

       A railroad company which constructed an underpass for highway traffic, and which failed to post warning signs with respect to its height, was not relieved of responsibility for an injury to the driver of the truck which, being higher than the clearance of the underpass, collided therewith, by the fact that a county was under the duty of maintaining the road and posting signs and that the road might have been raised by resurfacing job, since both parties owed a duty to the traveling public, and the protection afforded the county by law did not affected the liability of the railroad company.

       Where a railroad company constructed a sufficient stock-gap and cattle-guard both where its track entered and where it passed out of inclosed lands used as one tract and belonging to one person, it complied with the requirements of this section [Code 1942, § 7781].

       Expert’s opinion did not support appellants’ claim that a train crew’s view of a crossing was obstructed by vegetation in violation because his opinion regarding sight-distance deficiencies was based on calculations of a train traveling at 79 mph, while the evidence established that it had been traveling at approximately 49 mph as it approached the crossing.

       Railroad was properly granted summary judgment dismissing appellants’ negligence claims, as the evidence established that the train was traveling below the speed limit, that the crew kept a proper lookout, that the train’s whistle blew 900 feet before the crossing as required by statute, and that the emergency brake was activated before impact, and appellants did not support their claim that the railroad failed to clear vegetation near crossing or to maintain an adequate crossing warning system.

      The Mississippi Transportation Commission shall have every railroad inspected whenever it shall deem the same necessary, but at least once in each year. The results must be entered upon the minutes of the commission and embraced in its reports, and must embrace information as to the condition of the roadbed, rolling stock and depots, and such other facilities and equipment as the commission may deem proper. Whenever the commission shall find any roadbed, tunnel, switch or any part of a railroad track, or any rolling stock in actual use, in an unsafe condition, it shall direct the railroad company to make the necessary repairs.

While the line of authority between the local authorities and the Public Service Commission’s regulation of railroads is not specifically defined by statute, there is a legislative intent that the Public Service Commission has general jurisdiction over common carrier railroads with an official responsibility to the public to see that railroads are operated safely, efficiently, and for the public’s benefit. This responsibility which the Commission has to the entire state manifestly cannot be frustrated by any local ordinance or order, whether by a city or county. Hence, any reasonableness test of a zoning ordinance which applies to a railroad must take into account the obligation of the company to serve efficiently and economically all sections of the state dependent on it for services.

     <p>
      A person who has chartered a car for the purpose of transporting livestock shall have the right to ship in the same car, at his own risk, different kinds of livestock. The shipper shall have the right to load said car by separating his stock with gates or bars, or by putting upper-decks at his own expense and without injury to the car; the shipper shall be responsible for all damage that may occur by reason of its being so loaded. Any railroad company refusing, without sufficient reason, to move or transport a car so loaded, shall be liable to the party injured thereby to double damages, to be recovered before any court having jurisdiction.

       Railroad company owed plaintiff, who was assisting passenger with baggage, duty not to start train until he had time to get off when those in charge of train knew his purpose and that he intended to get off, and if train was started while his intention to get off was momentarily forgotten by those in charge, it was their duty to offer to stop train.

       Railroad company cannot defend action for injuries to plaintiff on ground plaintiff should have remained on train until it stopped at next station when train porter opened door and told plaintiff to jump, and conductor had agreed to let plaintiff off at that station. McClellan v. Illinois C. R. Co., 204 Miss. 432, 37 So. 2d 738, 1948 Miss. LEXIS 379 (Miss. 1948).

      <p>
       Evidence that plaintiff in presence of conductor of train was assured by porter he had time to assist passenger with baggage before train started, that conductor, after train started, assured him he could leave train and that porter opened door and told plaintiff to jump, was sufficient to show that conductor understood and acquiesced in plaintiff’s undertaking to leave train without stopping train for that purpose and opening of door was invitation for plaintiff to jump.

       As general rule, where there is breach both of contract and of duty imposed by law, as in case of loss or injury by common carrier, plaintiff may elect to sue either in contract or in tort. New Orleans & N. E. R. Co. v. Elias, 205 Miss. 658, 39 So. 2d 274, 1949 Miss. LEXIS 457 (Miss. 1949).
      </p>
      <p>
       Tort is the natural and habitual foundation of action for breach of ordinary contract of carriage, and declaration will be so construed, unless facts of case clearly show that plaintiff has elected to sue on contract.

       Rules of pleading in common law cases prevailing in state courts control action against carrier on liability for interstate shipment imposed by Carmack Amendment to Interstate Commerce Act, since act has no specifications as to pleadings in such causes.

      <p>
       In action against carrier for damage to interstate shipment, Carmack Amendment to Interstate Commerce Act may be invoked although declaration does not aver that any connecting carrier exists, or show any facts to allow Carmack Amendment to operate but asserts pure common law claim, where facts, as shown in evidence, make it clear that cause of action comes within sphere of statute.

       § 77-9-493.
    Tax for regulation of railroads.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      All reasonable and necessary operating expenses of the administration of the duties imposed by law upon the Mississippi Transportation Commission, including the salaries of personnel, in its regulation and supervision of railroad companies operating within the State of Mississippi, shall be provided through the levying of the following tax. The amount of said tax is the sum of Two Hundred One Thousand Dollars ($201,000.00) per year. Such tax shall be prorated by the State Tax Commission among the railroad companies which are subject to the tax levied by this section each year, according to the railroad track miles of each of such railroad company operated during the calendar year preceding the assessment. Each railroad company which is subject to the tax levied by this section shall file a statement of such railroad track miles by April 1 of each year showing the railroad track miles operated in the preceding year’s operation. “Railroad track miles” means the miles of road of the railroad system within this state. These statements of railroad track miles shall be filed with the commission and a copy thereof filed with the State Tax Commission. The State Tax Commission shall thereupon calculate the pro rata amount of tax to be paid by each of said railroad companies in order to provide the total amount above stated and shall thereupon submit a statement thereof to the respective railroad companies and the amounts shown due in such statements to the respective railroad companies shall be paid by the respective railroad companies within thirty (30) days thereafter to the State Tax Commission. The State Tax Commission shall pay such funds into the State Treasury on the same day collected to the credit of the Mississippi Transportation Commission.
     </p>
     <p>
      All administrative provisions of the Mississippi Sales Tax Law, including those which fix damages, penalties and interest for nonpayment of taxes and for noncompliance with the provisions of such chapter, and all other duties and requirements imposed upon taxpayers, shall apply to all persons liable for taxes under the provisions of this chapter, and the Tax Commissioner shall exercise all the power and authority and perform all the duties with respect to taxpayers under this chapter as are provided in the Mississippi Sales Tax Law except where there is a conflict, then the provisions of this chapter shall control.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Mississippi Transportation Commission and the State Tax Commission are hereby authorized to use all tax returns of any such railroad companies available to them and to make such audits as may be deemed necessary of any and all records of such railroad companies in order to correctly determine the amount of railroad track miles. It shall be the duty of the Department of Finance and Administration to advise the commission of the amount of money on hand from time to time. All expenses of the Mississippi Transportation Commission in its regulation and supervision of railroad companies, including salaries of personnel, shall be paid by the State Treasurer upon warrants issued by the Department of Finance and Administration. Said warrants shall be issued upon requisition signed by the executive secretary or the chairman and said requisition shall show upon its face the purpose for which the payment is being made, by reference to the purchase order and/or invoice number and objective code. It shall be unlawful for any person to withdraw any money from said fund other than by requisition issued as herein provided. A record of all requisitions issued by the Mississippi Transportation Commission showing to whom, for what purpose, and date issued, shall be placed upon the minute books of the commission and shall become a part of the official record of said commission.
     </p>
     <p>
      The books and accounts of the Mississippi Transportation Commission shall be audited at the end of each fiscal year, and at any other time deemed necessary, by the State Auditor and a copy of such audits shall be furnished to the Governor and the Mississippi Transportation Commission. The State Auditor may prescribe such further accounting procedure as he deems necessary for the withdrawal of funds by the said commission from said fund. All requisitions drawn in compliance with this section shall be honored by the Department of Finance and Administration and the funds disbursed in accordance therewith. The Mississippi Transportation Commission shall file a report at each regular session of the Legislature showing the expenditure of all funds by the Mississippi Transportation Commission. All proceeds of the above-mentioned tax are hereby allocated to the Mississippi Transportation Commission for the purposes of this section. In the event the funds provided by said tax exceed the amount necessary for the purposes of this section at the end of each year, the Mississippi Transportation Commission shall certify the amount which the said commission estimates will be necessary for the commission for the next year to the State Tax Commission, and the State Tax Commission shall reduce the tax imposed to such amount for the next year and shall collect the proportionate amount thereof as above provided.

      The states which are parties to this compact (hereinafter referred to as the “party states”) do hereby establish and create a joint interstate authority which shall be known as the “Mississippi-Alabama Railroad Authority” (hereinafter referred to as the “authority”). The authority shall be governed and all powers thereof exercised by a board of directors (hereinafter referred as the “board”). The membership of the board shall consist of the Mayor of the Town of Belmont, Mississippi; two (2) other citizens of the State of Mississippi to be appointed by the governing authorities of the Town of Belmont, Mississippi; the Mayor of the City of Red Bay, Alabama, and two (2) other citizens of the State of Alabama to be appointed by the governing authorities of the City of Red Bay, Alabama. Each of the appointive members of the board shall be a qualified elector in a state named in Article I and shall serve for a term of four (4) years. Directors shall be eligible for reelection. If any director should die, resign or become incapable or ineligible to act as a director, a successor thereto for the remaining portion of the unexpired term shall be appointed by the governing body which appointed the director whose unexpired term is to be filled. The board shall hold such regular and special meetings as its business may require and as the board may determine. Any meeting of the board may be adjourned from time to time by a majority of the members present. A majority of the members of the board shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of any business. No vacancy in the membership of the board shall impair the right of a quorum to exercise all powers and duties of the authority. Members of the board shall receive no compensation for their services as directors; however, each member may be reimbursed for expenses actually incurred in the performance of his duties as provided by law. The authority shall adopt rules and regulations for the transaction of its business and the secretary shall keep a record of all its business and furnish copies thereof to each member of the board. The meetings and records of the board and of the authority shall be open to the public. The board shall establish the location of the principal office of the authority, which shall be in one (1) of the states named in Article I. The officers of the authority shall consist of a chairman, a vice chairman, a secretary, a treasurer and such other officers as the board shall deem necessary. The chairman and vice chairman shall be elected by the board from its membership and the chairmanship shall rotate each year among the party states in order of their acceptance of this compact. Neither the secretary nor the treasurer nor any other officer of the authority need be a member of the board. Each officer shall be elected by the board for a term of one (1) year. Officers shall be eligible for reelection. The duties of the officers of the authority shall be such as are customarily performed by such officers and as may be prescribed by the board.

Dickerson v. Western Union Tel. Co., 114 Miss. 115, 74 So. 779, 1917 Miss. LEXIS 10 (Miss. 1917), overruled,
   Western Union Tel. Co. v. Norman, 121 Miss. 128, 83 So. 465, 1919 Miss. LEXIS 154 (Miss. 1919).

       It was error to refuse to submit question of punitive damages to jury where servants of telegraph company through neglect and without excuse failed to deliver message within proper limits. Postal Telegraph-Cable Co. v. Ross, 111 Miss. 649, 71 So. 904, 1916 Miss. LEXIS 356 (Miss. 1916).
      </p>

       Punitive damages held not recoverable where delay caused by strike; punitive damages not recoverable in absence of malice, fraud, oppression, wilful wrong, or such wanton, reckless, or grossly careless conduct as is equivalent thereto. Western Union Tel. Co. v. Miller, 97 Miss. 225, 52 So. 701, 1910 Miss. LEXIS 267 (Miss. 1910).

The maximum civil penalty shall not exceed two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000.00) for any related series of violations.

       Any such civil penalty may be imposed by the chancery court of the county in which the violation occurs or in which the person violating the same resides or has his or its principal place of business, upon complaint of the commission and after opportunity for a hearing thereon. Any such civil penalty may be compromised by the commission, subject to the approval of the court. In determining the amount of such penalty, or the amount agreed upon in compromise, the appropriateness of such penalty to the size of the business of the person charged, the gravity of the violation and the good faith of the person charged in attempting to achieve compliance, after notification of a violation, shall be considered. The amount of such penalty, when finally determined, or the amount agreed upon in compromise, may be deducted from any sums owing by the State of Mississippi to the person charged or may be recovered under judgment of said chancery court, and upon collection shall be paid to the treasury of the State of Mississippi.

      All reasonable and necessary operating expenses of the administration of the duties imposed by law upon the Public Service Commission, including the salaries of personnel, in its regulation, inspection and supervision of municipally owned and/or operated gas utilities operating within the State of Mississippi shall be provided as follows: There is hereby levied a tax. The amount of said tax is the sum of Twenty-five Thousand Dollars ($25,000.00) per year which shall be prorated by the State Tax Commission among the municipally owned and/or operated gas utilities which are subject to the tax levied by this section each year, according to the gross revenue of each of such utilities from their intrastate operation during the calendar year preceding the assessment. Each utility which is subject to the tax levied by this section shall file a statement of such gross revenue by April 1 of each year showing the gross revenue for the preceding year’s operation. These statements of gross revenue shall be filed with the commission and a copy thereof filed with the State Tax Commission. The State Tax Commission shall thereupon calculate the pro rata amount of tax to be paid by each of said utilities in order to provide the total amount above stated and shall thereupon submit a statement thereof to the respective utilities and the amount shown due in such statements to the respective utilities shall be paid by the respective utilities within thirty (30) days thereafter to the State Tax Commission. The State Tax Commission shall pay such funds into the State Treasury on the same day collected to the credit of the “Municipality Owned and/or Operated Gas Utilities Special Fund.” All administrative provisions of the Mississippi Sales Tax Law, including those which fix damages, penalties and interest for nonpayment of taxes and for noncompliance with the provisions of such chapter, and all other duties and requirements imposed upon taxpayers, shall apply to all persons liable for taxes under the provisions of this chapter, and the Tax Commissioner shall exercise all the power and authority and perform all the duties with respect to taxpayers under this chapter as are provided in the Mississippi Sales Tax Law except where there is a conflict, then the provisions of this chapter shall control. The term “gross revenue” as used in this section shall be deemed to be the total amount of all revenue derived by each of such utilities from its intrastate operations and the State Tax Commission is hereby authorized to make such audits as may be deemed necessary of any and all records of such utilities in order to correctly determine the amount of such gross revenue. It shall be the duty of the Department of Finance and Administration to advise the commission of the amount of money on hand from time to time. All expenses of the commission authorized by this section or any other act of the Legislature shall be paid by the State Treasurer upon warrants issued by the Department of Finance and Administration, which warrants shall be issued upon requisition signed by the chairman of the commission and countersigned by one (1) of the commissioners, and said requisition shall show upon its face the purpose for which the payment is being made by reference to the minute book in which such payment was authorized. It shall be unlawful for any person to withdraw any money from said fund other than by requisition issued as provided herein. A record of all requisitions issued by the commission showing to whom, for what purpose, and date issued shall be placed upon the minute books of the commission and shall become a part of the official records of the commission.
     </p>
     <p>
      The books and accounts of the commission shall be audited at the end of each fiscal year, and at any other time deemed necessary, by the State Auditor and a copy of such audits shall be furnished to the Governor and the commission. The State Auditor may prescribe such further accounting procedure as he deems necessary for the withdrawal of funds by the commission from said special fund. All requisitions drawn in compliance with this section shall be honored by the Department of Finance and Administration and the funds disbursed in accordance therewith.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The Legislature of the State of Mississippi hereby finds that the public interest will be served by fostering the construction and operation of intrastate gas pipelines in order to secure for public and private needs a dependable supply of gas which will be produced within this state. The Legislature further finds that an emergency exists because numerous commercial enterprises have been closed or restricted in operation due to a shortage of gas resulting in a loss of employment and industrial capacity within this state and threatens irreparable injury to life or property, and the possibility exists that supplies of gas for residential and health related purposes may be restricted in the future. In order to assist in alleviating these shortages, both actual and potential, the Legislature enacts this legislation.

       Every person owning or operating underground utility lines or underground facilities shall, upon receiving advance notice of the commencement of excavation, in accordance with Section 77-13-7, make an investigation, and may report through the use of the PRIS the status of the work performed, within two (2) working days from the time notice is provided in accordance with this chapter to Mississippi 811, Inc., to determine the approximate location of its underground utility lines or underground facilities in the area of the proposed excavation, and shall either: (a) mark the approximate location of underground utility lines and underground facilities in or near the area of the excavation, so as to enable the person engaged in excavation work to locate the lines and facilities in advance of and during the excavation work; (b) advise in writing or by telephone or electronic means that it has no underground utility lines or underground facilities in the excavation area; or (c) advise in writing or by telephone or electronic means that it can locate its underground utility lines or underground facilities in the excavation area only by excavation. If an operator can locate its underground utility lines or underground facilities in the excavation area only by excavation and has given proper notice of such, that operator shall be allowed a reasonable amount of additional time, not to exceed four (4) working days from the day the original notice was provided in accordance with this chapter, to mark the approximate location of the underground utility lines or underground facilities.
      </li>
      <li id="t77c13s77-13-9ol12">
       In lieu of such marking, the operator may request to be present at the site upon commencement of the excavation, so long as the operator complies within two (2) working days of the receipt of the notice.
      </li>
      <li id="t77c13s77-13-9ol13">
       When an excavator, upon arriving at an excavation site, sees evidence of unmarked underground utility lines or underground facilities or encounters an unmarked underground utility line or underground facility on an excavation site after excavation has commenced where notice of intent has been made in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, that excavator must immediately contact Mississippi 811, Inc. All operator(s) thus notified must contact the excavator within four (4) hours and inform the excavator of any of their known underground facilities, active or abandoned, at the site of the excavation.
      </li>
      <li id="t77c13s77-13-9ol14">
       When marking the approximate location of the facilities, the operator shall follow the color code designated and described herein, unless otherwise provided for by specific administrative rule or regulation promulgated pursuant to this chapter, namely:
