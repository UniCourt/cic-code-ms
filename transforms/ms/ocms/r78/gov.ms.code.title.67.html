   Since the Native Wine Act (§§<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t67c05s67-5-1" target="_self">67-5-1</a></cite> et seq.) consists of laws relating specifically to one form of alcoholic beverage, it is, as such, special legislation which will prevail over the general statutes dealing with alcohol that are contained in Chapter 1 of Title 67 (67-1-1 et seq).

      </h4>
      <p>
       The general rule is that municipalities may not regulate activity that has been preempted by state law and regulation. Regulation of the manufacture, sale, distribution, possession and transportation of intoxicating liquor is preempted by state law. Likewise, designation of qualified resort areas is a matter preempted by state law. Diaz, Oct. 23, 1991, A.G. Op. #91-0681.
      </p>
      <p>
       The regulation of sales of alcoholic beverages containing 5% or more of alcohol, or intoxicating liquor, is an area wholly within the authority of the State Tax Commission; there is no authority for a municipality to adopt an ordinance that would further regulate the sale of intoxicating liquors by extending the hours during which the sale of such beverages by certain permitted retailers may be lawfully made.
   Tyner, March 5, 1999, A.G. Op. #99-0074.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The policy of this State is reannounced in favor of prohibition of the manufacture, sale, distribution, possession and transportation of intoxicating liquor; and the provisions against such manufacture, sale, distribution, possession and transportation of intoxicating liquor, as contained in Chapter 31 of Title 97, Mississippi Code of 1972 and elsewhere, are hereby redeclared the law of this state. The purpose and intent of this chapter is to vigorously enforce the prohibition laws throughout the state, except in those counties and municipalities voting themselves out from under the prohibition law in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, and, in those counties and municipalities, to require strict regulation and supervision of the manufacture, sale, distribution, possession and transportation of intoxicating liquor under a system of state licensing of manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers, which licenses shall be subject to revocation for violations of this chapter.
     </p>
     <p>
      All laws and parts of laws in conflict with this chapter are repealed only to the extent of such conflict; however, except as is provided in this chapter, all laws prohibiting the manufacture, sale, distribution and possession of alcoholic beverages, which are not in conflict with this chapter shall remain in full force and effect, and all such laws shall remain in full force and effect in counties and municipalities wherein the manufacture, sale, distribution and possession of alcoholic beverages has not been authorized as a result of an election held under Section 67-1-11 or Section 67-1-14, Mississippi Code of 1972, or as otherwise provided in this chapter.

   Under the provisions of the Native Wine Act (§§<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t67c05s67-5-1" target="_self">67-5-1</a></cite> et seq.), the manufacturer, possession, and sale of native wines are legal throughout the state. Martin v. State, 501 So. 2d 1124, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2285 (Miss. 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       It is apparent from the enumerated powers, functions, duties, and responsibilities reposed in and imposed upon the state tax commission in widely separated parts of the Local Option Alcoholic Beverage Control Law, that it was the intent of the legislature to grant the commission wide latitude and discretion in considering and acting upon applications for permits to operate retail liquor stores.

       Subsection 3 of Code 1942, § 7545-71 under which all laws and ordinances of a city were made applicable to a noncontiguous municipal airport was repealed by implication by this section to the extent that it conflicted with the provisions of the Local Option Beverage Control Law, so although the city was located in a county where the sale of alcoholic beverages was legal this did not authorize the sale of such beverages at the municipal airport which was located in a “dry” county.

The words “alcoholic beverage” shall not include ethyl alcohol manufactured or distilled solely for fuel purposes or beer of an alcoholic content of more than eight percent (8%) by weight if the beer is legally manufactured in this state for sale in another state.
     </p>
     <p>

      No member, officer, agent or employee of which is paid, or directly or indirectly receives, in the form of a salary or other compensation any profit from the distribution or sale of alcoholic beverages to the club or to members or guests of the club beyond such salary or compensation as may be fixed and voted at a proper meeting by the board of directors or other governing body out of the general revenues of the club.
     </p>
     <p>
      The department may, in its discretion, waive the five-year provision of this paragraph. In order to qualify under this paragraph, a club must file with the department, at the time of its application for a license under this chapter, two (2) copies of a list of the names and residences of its members and similarly file, within ten (10) days after the election of any additional member, his name and address.

     </p>
     <p>
      “Qualified resort area” means any area or locality outside of the limits of incorporated municipalities in this state commonly known and accepted as a place which regularly and customarily attracts tourists, vacationists and other transients because of its historical, scenic or recreational facilities or attractions, or because of other attributes which regularly and customarily appeal to and attract tourists, vacationists and other transients in substantial numbers; however, no area or locality shall so qualify as a resort area until it has been duly and properly approved as such by the department. The department may not approve an area as a qualified resort area after July 1, 2018, if any portion of such proposed area is located within two (2) miles of a convent or monastery that is located in a county traversed by Interstate 55 and U.S. Highway 98. A convent or monastery may waive such distance restrictions in favor of allowing approval by the department of an area as a qualified resort area. Such waiver shall be in written form from the owner, the governing body, or the appropriate officer of the convent or monastery having the authority to execute such a waiver, and the waiver shall be filed with and verified by the department before becoming effective.
     </p>
     <p>
      The department may approve an area or locality outside of the limits of an incorporated municipality that is in the process of being developed as a qualified resort area if such area or locality, when developed, can reasonably be expected to meet the requisites of the definition of the term “qualified resort area.” In such a case, the status of qualified resort area shall not take effect until completion of the development.

       Phrase “alcoholic beverage” does not as matter of law exclude beer when phrase is used outside Chapter 1 of Title 67 of Mississippi Statutes. Wilson ex rel. Wilson v. United States Fidelity & Guaranty Ins. Co., 830 F.2d 588, 1987 U.S. App. LEXIS 14063 (5th Cir. Miss. 1987).

       Policy of liability insurance covering convenience store, which policy excluded coverage for bodily injury for which insured may be held liable by reason of selling, serving or giving of any alcoholic beverage to minor, excludes coverage for bodily injury by reason of selling, serving or giving of “beer”, even though definition of alcoholic beverage under state law excludes beer, as common and ordinary meaning of beer is beverage containing alcohol; liability policy which excluded coverage for bodily injury for which store was liable by reason of selling of alcoholic beverage to minor did not cover bodily injuries sustained in accident caused by underaged motorist’s intoxication from drinking beer which he bought at store, despite statute which excluded beer from definition of alcoholic beverages. Wilson ex rel. Wilson v. United States Fidelity & Guaranty Ins. Co., 659 F. Supp. 553, 1987 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13856 (S.D. Miss.), aff'd, 830 F.2d 588, 1987 U.S. App. LEXIS 14063 (5th Cir. Miss. 1987).

       Inasmuch as Code 1942, § 10625-05 excludes from the definition of “alcoholic beverage” beer and wine of not more than 4 percent of alcohol by weight, the authority conferred upon agents of the alcoholic beverage commission under Code 1942, §§ 10265-11 and 10265-17 does not authorize and empower them to check a retailer’s beer license to see whether it was in date or to inspect beer stock to determine whether it was Mississippi-taxed beer.

      <p>
       The 2004 amendment rewrote (2) to authorize the sale of alcoholic beverages at clubhouses associated with certain subdivisions regardless of whether the county in which the clubhouse is located has voted in favor of coming out from under the dry law.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 2006 amendment inserted “Except as otherwise provided in Section 67-1-51 for holders of a caterer’s permit” at the beginning of the next-to-last sentence of (1).
      </p>
      <p>
       The 2008 amendment, in (2), substituted “that has been declared” for “which has been declared,” “within any qualified resort area as defined under Section 67-1-5(o)(iii)” for “any clubhouse or golf course that is a qualified resort area under Section 67-1-5(o)(iii),” and “issued for the qualified resort area” for “issued for the clubhouse.”
      </p>
      <p>
       The 2009 amendment substituted “qualified resort area is located” for “park or clubhouse is located” in (2).

       Ordinance prohibiting commercial establishments from allowing consumption of alcoholic beverages between midnight and 7:00 a.m., which defined “consumption” to include possession in open containers as well as ingestion, was not preempted be statute expressly permitting possession of alcoholic beverages in “wet” municipalities absent clear expression of legislative intent to permit consumption, as opposed to mere possession, without limitation in wet areas, given broad grant of authority to municipalities to regulate impact of alcoholic beverages upon public health, morals, and safety and public policy favoring prevention of alcohol-related altercations and motor vehicle accidents, as limiting possession of opened containers was reasonable and necessary to enforce limitations on consumption.

       In counties where the general prohibition laws have been suspended through legalization of the sale of alcoholic liquors by an election held under the local option alcoholic beverage control law, in order to charge an unlawful sale the indictment or affidavit must charge that the local option law is in effect in that county, and sufficient facts to show a violation of one of the provisions of the local option law.

       In a county in which the general prohibition laws had been suspended, it was error to permit the amendment of an indictment charging a violation of those laws so as to charge the commission of an offense prohibited under the local option beverage control law. Wortham v. State, 219 So. 2d 923, 1969 Miss. LEXIS 1435 (Miss. 1969).

       An indictment which charges an unlawful sale of intoxicating liquor in violation of the general prohibition laws fails to charge an indictable offense where the act occurred in a county where those laws had been suspended by an election held under the local option alcoholic beverage control law.

       The state tax commission not only has the authority as a legislative administrative agency to hold a hearing upon the application of a county board of supervisors to determine “resort areas” but it was the commission’s duty to hold a public hearing upon the application; and a failure to conduct a hearing which is required by statute would have been unlawful, arbitrary, and capricious.

       Sections 67-1-17, 67-1-93, 67-1-95 and 67-1-97, which govern the seizure and disposal of personal property which is in violation of the prohibition law, do not provide for the return of the property prior to a hearing on the forfeiture proceeding. Thus, a defendant was not entitled to the return of her seized car pending the outcome of the forfeiture hearing where the defendant admitted that the intoxicating liquors being transported in her automobile belonged to her, and that she was in the vehicle and was participating in the actual transportation of the contraband.

   Forfeiture applies when the prohibition law is violated using a vehicle for concealing or transporting of liquor in excess of 6 gallons; the burden is upon the State to prove that the forfeiture comes within the statute imposing liability by a preponderance of the evidence. Thus, an automobile which was used by the defendant to transport more than 6 gallons of intoxicating liquor into a “dry” county, was subject to forfeiture following the defendant’s conviction for unlawful possession of intoxicating liquor in violation of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.97.html#t97c31s97-31-27" target="_blank">97-31-27</a></cite>.

       Sufficient-cause language within subsection (b) was an express grant of power that did not grant to the State Tax Commission arbitrary and capricious discretion; the commission was given authority to revoke, suspend or cancel a permit for noncompliance or other sufficient cause, and there was sufficient cause to find the business to have
   disregarded the authority and power of the Alcohol Beverage Control division. D. J. Koenig & Assocs. v. Miss. State Tax Comm'n, 838 So. 2d 246, 2003 Miss. LEXIS 61 (Miss. 2003).

       Business was given due process consisting of notice and an opportunity to be heard; the statute was discussed in the first hearing, and this put the owner on notice that it was at issue in the second hearing.

   Chancery Court jurisdiction in case under local option alcoholic beverage control law (§§<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t67c01s67-1-1" target="_self">67-1-1</a></cite> et seq.) is appellate only; Chancery Court has no original authority to initially hear and determine merits of case under law and may not issue order quashing subpoena duces tecum issued by Alcoholic Beverage Control Division.

   A chancery court order, removing the disabilities of a 19-year-old woman and empowering her to engage “in any profession or avocation which she could do if she were 21 years of age”, as decreed pursuant to Code 1972 §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.93.html#t93c19s93-19-9" target="_blank">93-19-9</a></cite>, would take precedence over an Alcoholic Beverage Control Division regulation prohibiting the employment of persons under age 21 from the handling of alcoholic beverages, since the regulatory authority vested in the Division by Code 1972 §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t67c01s67-1-37ol1h" target="_self">67-1-37(h)</a></cite> requires that such regulations not be inconsistent with other laws of the state.

      </p>
      <p>
       Although this section, gives the state tax commission authority to designate hours when alcoholic beverages may be sold indifferent localities in the state which permit such sale, and the state tax commission did in fact approve the sale of alcoholic beverages in a certain municipality by hotels, restaurants, and clubs between the hours of 9 o’clock a.m. and 2 o’clock a.m. on all days except Sundays and election days, the allegation in a restaurant owners’ bill of complaint alleging that the sheriff of the county had publicly stated that he would repeatedly arrest the complainant if he continued to sell alcoholic beverages between midnight and 2 a.m. was not sufficient to show that complainant’s property rights were in danger of repeated arrest and prosecution by the sheriff, and was insufficient to support an injunction. Watkins v. Navarrette, 227 So. 2d 853, 1969 Miss. LEXIS 1375 (Miss. 1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       The state tax commission not only has the authority as a legislative administrative agency to hold a hearing upon the application of a county board of supervisors to determine “resort areas” but it was the commission’s duty to hold a public hearing upon the application; and a failure to conduct a hearing which is required by statute would have been unlawful, arbitrary, and capricious. Graves v. Rhoden, 218 So. 2d 424, 1969 Miss. LEXIS 1598 (Miss. 1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       Inasmuch as Code 1942, § 10265-05 excludes from the definition of “alcoholic beverage” beer and wine of not more than 4 percent of alcohol by weight, the authority conferred upon agents of the alcoholic beverage commission under this section and Code 1942, § 10265-11 does not authorize and empower them to check a retailer’s beer license to see whether it was in date or to inspect beer stock to determine whether it was Mississippi-taxed beer. Jolliff v. State, 215 So. 2d 234, 1968 Miss. LEXIS 1338 (Miss. 1968), overruled,

     <p>
      Any appeal from an order of the Board of Tax Appeals regarding an action taken under this chapter shall be filed without supersedeas to the Chancery Court of the First Judicial District of Hinds County, Mississippi, if the appellant is the department, or to the county of the domicile of any other appellant. Any such appeal shall be based on the record made before the Board of Tax Appeals and shall be filed within thirty (30) days from the date of the order being appealed. There may be an appeal therefrom to the Supreme Court as in other cases provided, but it shall be without supersedeas on the order of the Board of Tax Appeals to them made and finally determined either by the chancery court or the Supreme Court. Actions taken by the department in suspending a permit when required by Section 93-11-157 or 93-11-163 are not actions resulting in an order from which an appeal may be taken under this section. Any appeal of a permit suspension that is required by Section 93-11-157 shall be taken in accordance with the appeal procedure specified in Section 93-11-157 or 93-11-163, as the case may be, rather than the procedure specified in this section.

      <p>
       The first 2006 amendment (ch. 352) deleted “provided that retailers and consumers may purchase native wines directly from the producer” at the end of the second sentence in (1).
      </p>
      <p>
       The second 2006 amendment (ch. 529), in (1), inserted “intoxicating” preceding “liquors at retail shall purchase” in the second sentence, substituted “intoxicating liquors” for “same” following “may deem desirable and sell the” in the last sentence, and deleted the former second and third paragraphs, which read “The commission is empowered to borrow such working capital as may be required, not to exceed the sum of Nine Hundred Thousand Dollars ($900,000.00). Such loan shall be repaid from the earnings of the wholesale liquor business.
      </p>

       <p>
   Wholesale markup applied to liquor sold to federal military installations in Mississippi constituted a sales tax, the legal incidence of which rested upon instrumentalities of the United States as the purchasers, and therefore the markup was unconstitutional as a tax imposed upon the United States and its instrumentalities. Since the legal incidence of the tax was upon the United States, the federal immunity with respect to sales of liquor to the two exclusively federal enclaves was preserved by § 107(a) of the Buck Act (4 USCS §§ 105-110); The Twenty-First Amendment did not abolish federal immunity with respect to taxes on the sales of liquor to the concurrent jurisdiction bases. United States v. Tax Comm'n of Mississippi, <cite class="us_code">421 U.S. 599</cite>, <cite class="s_court">95 S. Ct. 1872</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">44 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 404, 1975 U.S. LEXIS 120 (U.S. 1975).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Nothing occurs within a state giving it jurisdiction to regulate the initial wholesale transaction with respect to the initial sale and delivery of liquor by suppliers to military facilities located in exclusively federal enclaves when the goods are ordered by officers’ clubs and other nonappropriated fund activities and are then delivered within military bases over which the United States claims exclusive jurisdiction. United States v. State Tax Com., <cite class="us_code">412 U.S. 363</cite>, <cite class="s_court">93 S. Ct. 2183</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">37 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 1, 1973 U.S. LEXIS 126 (U.S. 1973).
      </p>
      <p>
       An indictment originally charging a violation of subsection (2) of this section by the unlawful and wilful storage of alcoholic beverages without authority of law could not thereafter be validly amended to include therein several essential elements of the offense sought to be charged, such as the holding of valid election whereby the county voted out from under the prohibition law and that the defendant did not possess a permit from the State of Mississippi authorizing him to store alcoholic liquors. Price v. State, 227 So. 2d 858, 1969 Miss. LEXIS 1378 (Miss. 1969).

A tasting or sampling event shall be conducted completely within an area that is cordoned off by barriers clearly separating the event from the point of sale of any alcoholic beverage and may last not longer than four (4) hours. No one under twenty-one (21) years of age may participate in a tasting or sampling event and a sign indicating this shall be placed in a clearly visible location at the entrance to the area where the tasting or sampling event will be conducted. No food may be served or sold at a tasting or sampling event. Each sample of wine served at the event shall not exceed one and one-fourth (1-1/4) ounces and no more than a cumulative total of five (5) ounces of wine may be dispensed to any one (1) person during a tasting or sampling event. Each sample of a distilled spirit served at the event shall not exceed one-fourth (1/4) of an ounce and no more than a cumulative total of one (1) ounce of distilled spirits may be dispensed to any one (1) person during a tasting or sampling event. All product tasted or sampled at the event must be provided by the package retailer from its inventory. Such product cannot be sample product provided by a manufacturer and must have been purchased from the department warehouse or from a licensed wholesaler. Only employees of the package retailer may serve any product for tasting or sampling at the event. Tickets for a tasting or sampling event shall not be sold in the permitted place of business or any other location. The holder of a tasting or sampling event shall keep an accurate accounting of the various alcoholic beverages and amounts consumed at each tasting or sampling event and must provide a copy of the accounting to the department within ten (10) days of completion of the event.

    Applicants for permits must disclose persons financially interested in business; penalty.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      No permit of any type shall be issued by the commission until the applicant has first filed with the commission a sworn statement disclosing all persons who are financially involved in the operation of the business for which the permit is sought. If an applicant is an individual, he will swear that he owns one hundred percent (100%) of the business for which he is seeking a permit. If the applicant is a partnership, all partners and their addresses shall be disclosed and the extent of their interest in the partnership shall be disclosed. If the applicant is a corporation, the total stock in the corporation shall be disclosed and each shareholder and his address and the amount of stock in the corporation owned by him shall be disclosed. If the applicant is a limited liability company, each member and their addresses shall be disclosed and the extent of their interest in the limited liability company shall be disclosed. If the applicant is a trust, the trustee and all beneficiaries and their addresses shall be disclosed. If the applicant is a combination of any of the above, all information required to be disclosed above shall be required.
     </p>
     <p>
      All the disclosures shall be in writing and kept on file at the commission’s office and shall be available to the public.
     </p>
     <p>
      Every applicant must, when applying for a renewal of his permit, disclose any change in the ownership of the business or any change in the beneficiaries of the income from the business.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any person who willfully fails to fully disclose the information required by this section, or who gives false information, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be fined a sum not to exceed Five Hundred Dollars ($500.00) or imprisoned for not more than one (1) year, or both, and the person or applicant shall never again be eligible for any permit pertaining to alcoholic beverages.

       The licensing power for retail liquor permits is placed in the state tax commission, not the courts, and the commission is given a wide latitude and discretion in acting upon applications for such permits. Mississippi State Tax Com. v. Moore, 209 So. 2d 832, 1968 Miss. LEXIS 1476 (Miss. 1968).
      </p>
      <p>
       No person has a vested right to have a license for the sale of intoxicating liquors issued to him, and qualifications prescribed by statute are construed as strict limitations on the granting of such licenses. Mississippi State Tax Com. v. Moore, 209 So. 2d 832, 1968 Miss. LEXIS 1476 (Miss. 1968).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where another person who is himself disqualified from holding a license for operation of a retail liquor store has a financial interest in the premises or business and would dominate the applicant in operating the business, the license may be refused. Mississippi State Tax Com. v. Moore, 209 So. 2d 832, 1968 Miss. LEXIS 1476 (Miss. 1968).
      </p>
      <p>
       In determining whether to grant a retail liquor dealer’s license the state tax commission can consider the evidence and all reasonable inferences from it, and where the applicant for the license was a young woman college student whose father had previously been denied a license to operate a package store on the same premises by reason of his judgment indebtedness to the commission, that body could reasonably conclude that it was highly probable that the applicant, in the operation of the business, would be under the direction and control of her father. Mississippi State Tax Com. v. Moore, 209 So. 2d 832, 1968 Miss. LEXIS 1476 (Miss. 1968).

       § 67-1-57.
    Qualification of applicants.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Before a permit is issued the department shall satisfy itself:
     </p>
     <p>
      That the applicant, if an individual, or if a partnership, each of the members of the partnership, or if a corporation, each of its principal officers and directors, or if a limited liability company, each member of the limited liability company, is of good moral character and, in addition, enjoys a reputation of being a peaceable, law-abiding citizen of the community in which he resides, and is generally fit for the trust to be reposed in him, is not less than twenty-one (21) years of age, and has not been convicted of a felony in any state or federal court.
     </p>
     <p>
      That, except in the case of an application for a solicitor’s permit, the applicant is the true and actual owner of the business for which the permit is desired, and that he intends to carry on the business authorized for himself and not as the agent of any other person, and that he intends to superintend in person the management of the business or that he will designate a manager to manage the business for him. All managers must be approved by the department prior to completing any managerial tasks on behalf of the permittee and must possess all of the qualifications required of a permittee; however, a felony conviction, other than a crime of violence, does not automatically disqualify a person from being approved as a manager if the person was released from incarceration at least three (3) years prior to application for approval as a manager. A felony conviction, other than a crime of violence, may be considered by the department in determining whether all other qualifications are met.
     </p>
     <p>
      That the applicant for a package retailer’s permit, if an individual, is a resident of the State of Mississippi. If the applicant is a partnership, each member of the partnership must be a resident of the state. If the applicant is a limited liability company, each member of the limited liability company must be a resident of the state. If the applicant is a corporation, the designated manager of the corporation must be a resident of the state.
     </p>
     <p>
      That the place for which the permit is to be issued is an appropriate one considering the character of the premises and the surrounding neighborhood.
     </p>
     <p>
      That the place for which the permit is to be issued is within the corporate limits of an incorporated municipality or qualified resort area or club which comes within the provisions of this chapter.
     </p>
     <p>
      That the applicant is not indebted to the state for any taxes, fees or payment of penalties imposed by any law of the State of Mississippi or by any rule or regulation of the commission.
     </p>
     <p>
      That the applicant is not in the habit of using alcoholic beverages to excess and is not physically or mentally incapacitated, and that the applicant has the ability to read and write the English language.
     </p>
     <p>
      That the commission does not believe and has no reason to believe that the applicant will sell or knowingly permit any agent, servant or employee to unlawfully sell liquor in a dry area or in any other manner contrary to law.
     </p>
     <p>
      That the applicant is not residentially domiciled with any person whose permit or license has been cancelled for cause within the twelve (12) months next preceding the date of the present application for a permit.
     </p>
     <p>
      That the commission has not, in the exercise of its discretion which is reserved and preserved to it, refused to grant permits under the restrictions of this section, as well as under any other pertinent provision of this chapter.
     </p>
     <p>
      That there are not sufficient legal reasons to deny a permit on the ground that the premises for which the permit is sought has previously been operated, used or frequented for any purpose or in any manner that is lewd, immoral or offensive to public decency. In the granting or withholding of any permit to sell alcoholic beverages at retail, the commission in forming its conclusions may give consideration to any recommendations made in writing by the district or county attorney or county, circuit or chancery judge of the county, or the sheriff of the county, or the mayor or chief of police of an incorporated city or town wherein the applicant proposes to conduct his business and to any recommendations made by representatives of the commission.
     </p>
     <p>
      That the applicant and the applicant’s key employees, as determined by the commission, do not have a disqualifying criminal record. In order to obtain a criminal record history check, the applicant shall submit to the commission a set of fingerprints from any local law enforcement agency for each person for whom the records check is required. The commission shall forward the fingerprints to the Mississippi Department of Public Safety. If no disqualifying record is identified at the state level, the Department of Public Safety shall forward the fingerprints to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for a national criminal history record check. Costs for processing the set or sets of fingerprints shall be borne by the applicant. The commission shall not deny employment to an employee of the applicant prior to the identification of a disqualifying record or other disqualifying information.

       Statute only applied to those seeking a permit; it did not apply where the business owner already had a solicitor’s permit and no other section of the code stated that the statute applied to maintaining the permit.

       The common law of agency is not the proper criterion to determine whether the state tax commission abused its discretion in refusing to issue a retail liquor dealer’s license, and the commission may satisfy itself as to whether the applicant or another will be or become the true and actual owner of the business for which the permit is sought.

      Permits must be revoked or suspended for the following causes:
     </p>
     <p>
      Conviction of the permittee for the violation of any of the provisions of this chapter;
     </p>
     <p>
      Willful failure or refusal by any permittee to comply with any of the provisions of this chapter or of any rule or regulation adopted pursuant thereto;

     <p>
      The making of any materially false statement in any application for a permit;
     </p>
     <p>
      Conviction of one or more of the clerks, agents or employees of the permittee, of any violation of this chapter upon the premises covered by such permit within a period of time as designated by the rules or regulations of the department;
     </p>
     <p>
      The possession on the premises of any retail permittee of any alcoholic beverages upon which the tax has not been paid;
     </p>
     <p>
      The willful failure of any permittee to keep the records or make the reports required by this chapter, or to allow an inspection of such records by any duly authorized person;
     </p>
     <p>
      The suspension or revocation of a permit issued to the permittee by the federal government, or conviction of violating any federal law relating to alcoholic beverages;
     </p>
     <p>
      The failure to furnish any bond required by Section 27-71-21 within fifteen (15) days after notice from the department; and
     </p>
     <p>
      The conducting of any form of illegal gambling on the premises of any permittee or on any premises connected therewith or the presence on any such premises of any gambling device with the knowledge of the permittee.
     </p>
     <p>
      The provisions of paragraph (i) of this section shall not apply to gambling or the presence of any gambling devices, with knowledge of the permittee, on board a cruise vessel in the waters within the State of Mississippi, which lie adjacent to the State of Mississippi south of the three (3) most southern counties in the State of Mississippi, or on any vessel as defined in Section 27-109-1 whenever such vessel is on the Mississippi River or navigable waters within any county bordering on the Mississippi River. The department may, in its discretion, issue on-premises retailer’s permits to a common carrier of the nature described in this paragraph.
     </p>
     <p>
      The provisions of paragraph (i) of this section shall not apply to the operation of any game or lottery authorized by Chapter 115, Title 27.
     </p>
     <p>
      No permit shall be suspended or revoked until after the permittee has been provided reasonable notice of the charges against him for which suspension or revocation is sought and the opportunity to a hearing before the Board of Tax Appeals to contest such charges and the suspension or revocation proposed. Opportunity to a hearing is provided without an actual hearing if the permittee, after receiving reasonable notice, including notice of his right to a hearing, fails to timely request a hearing. The permittee may also at any time waive his rights to reasonable notice and/or to the opportunity to a hearing by agreeing to a suspension or revocation offered by the department. Notwithstanding the requirement above that a permit may not be suspended without notice and opportunity to a hearing, sales of alcoholic beverages by a permittee under a permit for which the bond under Section 27-71-21 has been cancelled shall be suspended from and after issuance of the notice provided in paragraph (h) above and shall continue to be suspended until the bond is reinstated, a new bond is posted or sufficient cash or securities as provided under Section 27-71-21 are deposited with the State Treasurer for this permit.
     </p>
     <p>
      In addition to the causes specified in this section and other provisions of this chapter, the department shall be authorized to suspend the permit of any permit holder for being out of compliance with an order for support, as defined in Section 93-11-153. The procedure for suspension of a permit for being out of compliance with an order for support, and the procedure for the reissuance or reinstatement of a permit suspended for that purpose, and the payment of any fees for the reissuance or reinstatement of a permit suspended for that purpose, shall be governed by Section 93-11-157 or 93-11-163, as the case may be. If there is any conflict between any provision of Section 93-11-157 or 93-11-163 and any provision of this chapter, the provisions of Section 93-11-157 or 93-11-163, as the case may be, shall control.

       Although Mississippi statutes relating to the sale of alcoholic beverages have sometimes been referred to as the Mississippi Dram Shop Law, such references are misleading because true dram shop acts are civil liability acts wherein the legislature specifically imposes liability on the seller of intoxicating liquors when a third party is injured as a result of the intoxication of the buyer where the sale caused or contributed to such intoxication.

       Although Mississippi statutes relating to the sale of alcoholic beverages have sometimes been referred to as the Mississippi Dram Shop Law, such references are misleading because true dram shop acts are civil liability acts wherein the legislature specifically imposes liability on the seller of intoxicating liquors when a third party is injured as a result of the intoxication of the buyer where the sale caused or contributed to such intoxication.

       Where the ABC Division had been informed by a trusted former employee that he had personally seen the defendant, who had been repeatedly convicted of violating the prohibition laws, enter a liquor package store empty-handed and had personally seen him depart therefrom with a brown bag full of purchases, and agents did not attempt to stop the defendant in Hinds County which is wet, but attempted to stop him and to check his purchases on a road in Rakin County which is dry, there was probable cause for the agents to stop the defendant and to search his car.

       An agent of the alcoholic beverage control division did not have authority to serve a search warrant issued for the purpose of making a search for illegal gambling equipment, since such agents have no police powers other than those expressly granted by the provisions of the local option alcoholic beverage control law.

       Inasmuch as Code 1942, § 10265-05 excludes from the definition of “alcoholic beverage” beer and wine of not more than 4 percent of alcohol by weight, the authority conferred upon agents of the alcoholic beverage commission under Code 1942, §§ 10265-11 and 10265-17 does not authorize and empower them to check a retailer’s beer license to see whether it was in date or to inspect beer stock to determine whether it was Mississippi-taxed beer.

       An owner of property seized, other than an owner of alcoholic beverages or raw materials, shall file a verified answer within twenty (20) days after the completion of service of process. If no answer is filed, the court shall hear evidence that the property is subject to forfeiture and forfeit the property to the agency which seized the property. If an answer is filed, a time for hearing on forfeiture shall be set within thirty (30) days of filing the answer or at the succeeding term of court if court would not be in progress within thirty (30) days after filing the answer. Provided, however, that upon request by the agent or agency, or the owner of the property, the court may postpone the forfeiture hearing to a date past the time any criminal action is pending against such owner.

       At the hearing any claimant of any right, title or interest in the property may prove his lien, security interest or other interest in the nature of a security interest, to be bona fide and created without knowledge or consent that the property was to be used so as to cause the property to be subject to forfeiture.
      </li>
      <li id="t67c01s67-1-95ol14">
       If it is found that the property is subject to forfeiture, then the judge shall forfeit the property to the agency which seized the property. If proof at the hearing discloses that the interest of any bona fide lienholder, secured party or other person holding an interest in the property in the nature of a security interest is greater than or equal to the present value of the property, the court shall order the property released to him. If such interest is less than the present value of the property and if the proof shows that the property is subject to forfeiture the court shall order the property forfeited to the agency.

       Upon a petition filed in the name of the state of Mississippi with the clerk of the circuit or county court of the county in which the seizure is made, the court having jurisdiction may order the property summarily forfeited except when lawful possession and title can be ascertained. If a person is found to have had lawful possession and title prior to seizure, the court shall order the property returned to the owner, if the owner so desires.

Such notices shall contain a description of the property to be sold and a statement of the time and place of the sale. It shall not be necessary to the validity of such sale either to have the property present at the place of the sale or to have the name of the owner thereof stated in such notice.

Such county or municipal law enforcement agency may purchase the interest of a bona fide lienholder, secured party or other party who holds an interest so that the property can be released for its use.

       Sections 67-1-17, 67-1-93, 67-1-95 and 67-1-97, which govern the seizure and disposal of personal property which is in violation of the prohibition law, do not provide for the return of the property prior to a hearing on the forfeiture proceeding. Thus, a defendant was not entitled to the return of her seized car pending the outcome of the forfeiture hearing where the defendant admitted that the intoxicating liquors being transported in her automobile belonged to her, and that she was in the vehicle and was participating in the actual transportation of the contraband.

      The purpose of this chapter is to legalize the sale within this state of light wines and beer, to legalize the manufacture of beer, and to regulate the business of manufacturing and of selling light wines and beer so as to prevent the illicit manufacture, sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages as defined in Section 67-1-5, the manufacture and sale of which it is not the purpose of this chapter to legalize.

      </h4>
      <p>
       The matter of issuing permits and the investigation of the validity of information presented in permit applications for the manufacture, sale, distribution, possession, and transportation of light wines and beer is strictly within the province of the State Tax Commission and a municipality has no power to act to block, prevent, restrict, refuse, or revoke alcoholic beverage permits; however, there is certainly nothing to prohibit interested parties from forwarding information they may consider relevant to the issuance or suspension or revocation of a permit to the attention of the State Tax Commission, the district attorney, or the county prosecuting attorney, as the situation demands.
   Thomas, April 10, 1998, A.G. Op. #98-0142.
      </p>
      <p>
       A city cannot enact regulations to require that the applicant for a beer and/or light wine permit is the actual owner of the business, that the owner or the owner’s employees do not have a criminal records, or to require that the applicant and employees be fingerprinted and photographed.
   Thomas, April 10, 1998, A.G. Op. #98-0142.
      </p>
      <p>
       A municipality may not adopt an ordinance which would further regulate the sale of intoxicating liquors by requiring commercial establishments holding a valid permit issued by the State Tax Commission to sell such beverages to achieve a mandatory ratio of food sales to alcoholic beverage sales. Rutledge, June 5, 1998, A.G. Op. #98-0278.
      </p>
      <p>
       A city has no authority to require a retailer who has been issued a permit for the sale of beer and light wine by the State Tax Commission to also make application and pay for a second, “city” permit, separate and in addition to a local privilege license, as a condition of engaging in the sale of such beverages within the city; the only permits required by state law are not granted by municipalities but by the State Tax Commission.

       The legislature had the power to enact statute authorizing sale of beer within the state and also authorizing county by election to prohibit the sale of beer within that county. Hays v. State, 219 Miss. 808, 69 So. 2d 845, 1954 Miss. LEXIS 389 (Miss. 1954).

       Where an indictment charged only that the accused did unlawfully sell intoxicating liquor, namely home brew, and there was no allegation that the sale of beer has been outlawed by an election in the county, the indictment was insufficient because no crime was stated.

       Evidence that defendant’s place of business had a reputation of being place where intoxicating liquors were sold was properly excluded in a prosecution for unlawful possession of beer. State v. Sisk, 209 Miss. 174, 46 So. 2d 191, 1950 Miss. LEXIS 377 (Miss. 1950).
      </p>
      <p>
       In prosecution for unlawful possession of intoxicating liquor the affidavit must allege and the proof must show an alcoholic content in excess of 4 per cent by weight. Hall v. State, 199 Miss. 560, 24 So. 2d 780, 1946 Miss. LEXIS 224 (Miss. 1946).
      </p>
      <p>
       Mere fact that the malt liquor or beer may be intoxicating does not of necessity show that the alcoholic content exceeded 4 per cent by weight. Hall v. State, 199 Miss. 560, 24 So. 2d 780, 1946 Miss. LEXIS 224 (Miss. 1946).
      </p>
      <p>
       Refusal of requested instruction in prosecution for unlawful possession of intoxicating liquor submitting to jury the factual issue whether the malt liquor or beer contained over the maximum alcoholic content of 4 per cent by weight, constituted reversible error, where the testimony, although showing that the liquor or beer was intoxicating, did not disclose what percentage of alcohol by weight it contained. Hall v. State, 199 Miss. 560, 24 So. 2d 780, 1946 Miss. LEXIS 224 (Miss. 1946).

       Evidence that accused believed wine in his possession did not contain over four per cent of alcohol, was inadmissible. Lowe v. Jackson, 181 Miss. 296, 179 So. 568, 1938 Miss. LEXIS 71 (Miss. 1938).
      </p>
      <p>
       The intent of possessor of wine having an alcoholic content of more than 4% is immaterial. Lowe v. Jackson, 181 Miss. 296, 179 So. 568, 1938 Miss. LEXIS 71 (Miss. 1938).

       Omission of the phrase “as amended” in referring to the statute in petitions to the board of supervisors, upon which a local option election was held under Chapter 252, Laws of 1956, asking that the board call an election to submit to the electors the proposition of whether or not wines and beer should continue to be sold, transported, stored, distributed, received or manufactured in the named county, as provided by Code 1942, § 10208, did not constitute such substantial defect or error in the jurisdiction of the board as to warrant reversal and nullification of the election, where the voters were not misled at the election, and the correct proposition had been submitted to them. Stennis v. Board of Supervisors, 232 Miss. 212, 98 So. 2d 636, 1957 Miss. LEXIS 462 (Miss. 1957).

       Although county in which city was located had voted out beer under this section in 1939, this would not prevent city from holding an election under Code 1942, § 10208.5, to determine whether or not beer could be sold therein; chapter 252, Laws of 1956, neither expressly nor by implication repealed Code 1942, § 10208.5.

       The legislature had the power to enact statute authorizing sale of beer within the state and also authorizing county by election to prohibit the sale of beer within that county. Hays v. State, 219 Miss. 808, 69 So. 2d 845, 1954 Miss. LEXIS 389 (Miss. 1954).

       Where the ordinance of a board of supervisors prohibited the sale and consumption of wines and beer in all territory of the county within five miles of any church, school, storehouse, filling station or any other public place, the ordinance was unreasonable because it usurped the function of electorate to decide the question of determining whether the entire county should be wet or dry. State v. Hoyle, 211 Miss. 342, 51 So. 2d 730, 1951 Miss. LEXIS 362 (Miss. 1951).

       Early decision of Martin v. Board of Supervisors (1938) 181 Miss 363, 178 So 315, on subject of outlawing beer and wine by local option election, which has stood as law of state for more than eleven years and has been relied upon by boards of supervisors in many counties and which cannot be said to be manifestly wrong or mischievous in operation, will be adhered to as established law of state, although question of whether it is necessary jurisdictional fact to be adjudicated by board of supervisors that no election on beer and wine has been held within past five years was not raised or passed upon by court in that case. Caruthers v. Panola County, 205 Miss. 403, 38 So. 2d 902, 1949 Miss. LEXIS 438 (Miss. 1949).

      </p>
      <p>
       Board of supervisors, after an election wherein it was determined that traffic in light wines and beer should be excluded from the county, must allow protestants a hearing on issue whether the petition for the election contained the required 20 per cent of the qualified electors. Costas v. Board of Sup'rs, 198 Miss. 440, 22 So. 2d 229, 1945 Miss. LEXIS 213 (Miss. 1945).
      </p>
      <p>
       Fact that county is divided into two judicial districts does not require that 20 per cent of the qualified voters in each judicial district petition for election hereunder, but the requirement for the holding of such election is satisfied if 20 per cent of the qualified voters of the whole county, disregarding the districts, petition for the election.

      </p>
      <p>
       The statute authorizing counties to prohibit sale of beer and wine by local election is not unconstitutional as unlawful delegation of legislative power; and the calling of a local election to prohibit sale of beer and wine within county was not unconstitutional as taking previous licensees’ property without due process.

       Hearing before county board of supervisors to determine whether petition to exclude beer and wine from county contains requisite signatures is a judicial proceeding, and members of board of supervisors, convened as court to hear written protest denying fact that twenty percent of qualified electors of county signed petition for election, were correct in their refusal to permit themselves to be cross-examined as witnesses on issues before them, and such refusal is not denial of full and complete hearing of protests where protestants were given right to introduce other evidence, which they declined to do. Duggan v. Board of Sup'rs, 207 Miss. 854, 43 So. 2d 566, 1949 Miss. LEXIS 396 (Miss. 1949).
      </p>
      <p>
       It is not essential to jurisdiction of board of supervisors to order election under this section that it affirmatively adjudicate fact to be that no such election has been held within past five years and absence of such adjudication in proceedings does not make same void. Caruthers v. Panola County, 205 Miss. 403, 38 So. 2d 902, 1949 Miss. LEXIS 438 (Miss. 1949).
      </p>
      <p>
       It is not necessary that the board of supervisors find and recite as a jurisdictional fact that no election has been had within five years prior to the making of its order. Henry v. Board of Sup'rs, 203 Miss. 780, 34 So. 2d 232, 1948 Miss. LEXIS 321 (Miss. 1948).
      </p>
      <p>
       The hearing before the board of supervisors to determine whether a petition filed under this statute contains the names of a sufficient number of qualified electors is a judicial proceeding from which interested parties and their attorneys may not be excluded and from whom relevant facts may not be withheld. Miles v. Board of Sup'rs, 33 So. 2d 810 (Miss. 1948).
      </p>
      <p>
       The board of supervisors must adjudicate the facts requisite to an order calling an election to legalize the sale of light wine and beer before the order is entered; and, while it is better practice for the board of supervisors in its order expressly to find and adjudicate the total number of qualified electors in the county and on the petition, it is sufficient if the order recites that the petition is that of not less than twenty percentum of the qualified voters of the county; and failure of the board before entering the order to determine the number of qualified voters in the county and the percentage on the petition as of the time that the matter was considered was not cured by the appointment of a man at that time to ascertain such facts and his reporting back after the election had been held. Miles v. Board of Sup'rs, 200 Miss. 214, 26 So. 2d 541, 1946 Miss. LEXIS 285 (Miss. 1946).
      </p>
      <p>
       Finding of trial court that order of board of supervisors ordering referendum election upon issue whether traffic in beer and light wines should be excluded from county was properly and timely signed by the president of the board, was not manifestly wrong or without sufficient basis so as to require reversal. Miller v. Board of Sup'rs, 198 Miss. 320, 22 So. 2d 372, 1945 Miss. LEXIS 200 (Miss. 1945).
      </p>
      <p>
       Adjudication of board of supervisors as to sufficiency of signatures to petition for an election to determine whether traffic in light wines and beers should be excluded from the county, was interlocutory, and entire cause, including that issue, must on pertinent and competent protest be adjudicated by the board upon trial before the final judgment could be entered in the case. Costas v. Board of Sup'rs, 198 Miss. 440, 22 So. 2d 229, 1945 Miss. LEXIS 213 (Miss. 1945).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the order of the board of supervisors found as a fact that a certain number of qualified electors had duly signed the petition for the holding of an election hereunder, being more than 20 per cent of the qualified electors of the county, there was no merit to the contention that such order was insufficient to adjudge that fact in that reference was made therein to a certificate of the circuit court of the circuit clerk as to the number of qualified electors in the county, instead of the board making the finding as a result of its own investigation; and upon attack upon the validity of the election on certiorari, the circuit court did not err in refusing to hear evidence outside the record to support appellants’ contention that the board of supervisors failed to adjudicate the required fact that the petition for election was signed by the requisite percentage of qualified electors. Sides v. Board of Sup'rs, 190 Miss. 420, 200 So. 595, 1941 Miss. LEXIS 64 (Miss. 1941).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the order of the board of supervisors of a county, in passing upon the sufficiency of a petition for local option in the county signed by 810 qualified voters thereof in regard to the requisite jurisdictional facts, recited that the total registration for the county at the time the petition was presented did not exceed 2,600 voters, and therefore more than 20 per cent of the duly qualified voters of the county signed such petition, and a special election was ordered in which a majority voted for local option, and thereafter an order prohibiting the sale of beer and light wine was entered, which recited that due, legal and proper notice was given of such election as required by Mississippi Code 1930, §§ 310 and 6,265, and it was found that legal and proper notice was in fact given and a proof of publication was made and filed, such election was legal. Day v. Board of Sup'rs, 184 Miss. 611, 185 So. 251, 1939 Miss. LEXIS 16 (Miss. 1939).
      </p>
      <p>
       Jurisdictional facts supporting a judgment calling local option election must appear in the record, but language in which they are recited need not be such as a skillful lawyer would use. Martin v. Board of Supervisors, 181 Miss. 363, 178 So. 315, 1938 Miss. LEXIS 80 (Miss. 1938).
      </p>
      <p>
       County board of supervisors is without power to call election on question of discontinuing sale of beer and light wines in county in response to petition therefor until adjudication that petition contains sufficient number of signatures of qualified electors has been made and has been actually entered on minutes of board. Simpson County v. Burkett, 178 Miss. 44, 172 So. 329, 1937 Miss. LEXIS 184 (Miss. 1937).

      <p>
       An order by the board of supervisors adjudicating the sufficiency of the petition and ordering an election, and a final judgment of the board excluding wine and beer from a county, pursuant to such election, is without authority of law and a denial of due process where the hearing on the petition is a star-chamber proceeding. Miles v. Board of Sup'rs, 33 So. 2d 810 (Miss. 1948).
      </p>
      <p>
       Fact that some citizens not in privity with present protestants had appeared before board of supervisors and contested sufficiency of petition for an election to determine whether traffic in light wines and beer should be excluded from county, on ground that petition did not contain the required 20 per cent of the qualified electors when the board adjudicated the petition to be sufficient, did not estop other taxpayers from subsequently contesting the petition on the same grounds, where the present protestants had no notice of the hearing on the original petition and did not participate therein, since the hearing on the original petition did not close the question as to the sufficiency of the petition. Costas v. Board of Sup'rs, 198 Miss. 440, 22 So. 2d 229, 1945 Miss. LEXIS 213 (Miss. 1945).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the order of the board of supervisors recited the jurisdictional facts, and showed compliance with the requirements of law leading to the issuance of an order prohibiting the sale of light wine and beer, their judgment became conclusive and could not be attacked by new proof on certiorari in the circuit court, since that court is confined to the examination of the proceedings appearing of record in the bill of exceptions, and cannot look to matters extraneous and foreign to the bill of exceptions; and accordingly evidence presented on certiorari that no proof of publication with respect to notice of the local option election was on file at the time the board of supervisors adjudicated the validity of the election, and the proceedings leading thereto, to prohibit the sale of light wines and beer in the county, could not affect the board’s adjudication of validity. Hall v. Franklin County, 184 Miss. 77, 185 So. 591, 1939 Miss. LEXIS 37 (Miss. 1939).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where board of supervisors finds a jurisdictional fact, in support of judgment calling local option election, judgment is entitled to the same force and effect with respect to such fact as judgment of a court of general jurisdiction. Martin v. Board of Supervisors, 181 Miss. 363, 178 So. 315, 1938 Miss. LEXIS 80 (Miss. 1938).
      </p>
      <p>
       A fact finding of board of supervisors, in order calling local option election, that petition for election was signed by twenty per cent or more of qualified voters, was conclusive on appeal with respect to whether petition was signed by voters personally. Martin v. Board of Supervisors, 181 Miss. 363, 178 So. 315, 1938 Miss. LEXIS 80 (Miss. 1938).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where correctness of petition for local option election was not challenged at meeting of board of supervisors, and no appeal or certiorari was taken from board’s order for election based on petition, board’s fact finding in such order, that signatures on petition represented twenty per cent or more of the qualified electors as required by statute, was conclusive on appeal.

   In the absence of a notice provision in §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t67c03s67-3-7" target="_self">67-3-7</a></cite> with respect to local option elections, the general statute requiring 30 days’ notice of election was applicable. Howard v. Crider, 341 So. 2d 477, 1977 Miss. LEXIS 2271 (Miss. 1977).
      </p>
      <p>
       When the law requires that 30 days notice of election be given by newspaper publication, the first publication of the notice must be made at least 30 days prior to the election and the publication must be continued in each successive weekly issue of the newspaper until the date of the election, and not more than 7 days should be allowed to intervene between the last publication of the notice and the election. Neal v. Board of Supervisors, 217 Miss. 102, 63 So. 2d 540, 1953 Miss. LEXIS 414 (Miss. 1953).
      </p>
      <p>
       Notice of local option election under this section on question of outlawing wine and beer, given for thirty days in newspaper published and circulated in county, is correct and proper notice of election, as notice required to be given of such election is governed by Code 1942, § 3018, and not by Code 1942, § 3294. Duggan v. Board of Sup'rs, 207 Miss. 854, 43 So. 2d 566, 1949 Miss. LEXIS 396 (Miss. 1949).
      </p>
      <p>
       A published notice of election on local option was sufficient where it recited the fact and date of the order of the board of supervisors, the fact and date that an election would be held pursuant to the specified statutory enactments, and the purpose of the election. Henry v. Board of Sup'rs, 203 Miss. 780, 34 So. 2d 232, 1948 Miss. LEXIS 321 (Miss. 1948).

       The contemplated method of giving notice of election on local option is by publication in a newspaper. Henry v. Board of Sup'rs, 203 Miss. 780, 34 So. 2d 232, 1948 Miss. LEXIS 321 (Miss. 1948).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section makes no provision for notice to anybody interested except notice to the electors by the board of election commissioners concerning the holding of the election and such notice thereafter brings into the situation everybody affected thereby, and those failing thereafter before final judgment to seek to contest any phase of the issues, would be estopped. Costas v. Board of Sup'rs, 198 Miss. 440, 22 So. 2d 229, 1945 Miss. LEXIS 213 (Miss. 1945).
      </p>
      <p>
       Objection that notice for election hereunder, for the exercise of local option in the county, was signed by the president and clerk of the board of supervisors instead of by the election commissioners of the county, was without merit where the notice given was sufficient in form and substance, and pursuant thereto the election commissioners proceeded to hold the election and certify the result thereof as required by law. Sides v. Board of Sup'rs, 190 Miss. 420, 200 So. 595, 1941 Miss. LEXIS 64 (Miss. 1941).
      </p>
      <p>
       Six weeks’ publication of notice of local option election, effected by order of clerk of board of supervisors rather than of election commissioners, without board’s issuing commission to election commissioners directing the commissioners to hold election, was proper irrespective of applicability of general statute authorizing board of supervisors to call election, where election commissioners actually held the election in conformity with law. Martin v. Board of Supervisors, 181 Miss. 363, 178 So. 315, 1938 Miss. LEXIS 80 (Miss. 1938).

       A proposition submitted on the ballot in a local option election held under Chapter 252, Laws of 1956, in the exact terms of subsection (a) thereof, to the effect that the proposition was to exclude from a named county the transportation, storage, sale, distribution, the receipt and/or manufacture of wine and beer of alcoholic content of not more than four percent by weight, but which did not state that, by virtue of subsection (b) thereof, the possession of such beverages would also be prohibited, submitted the correct proposition to the voters. Stennis v. Board of Supervisors, 232 Miss. 212, 98 So. 2d 636, 1957 Miss. LEXIS 462 (Miss. 1957).

       The fact that the order of the board of supervisors and the ballots used in the election to determine whether transportation, storage, sale, etc., of wine and beer should be excluded from the county, submitted to the voters the right also to exclude the possession of wine and beer in the county did not vitiate the election.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Any city in this state, having a population of not less than two thousand five hundred (2,500) according to the latest federal census; or any city in this state having a population of not less than one thousand five hundred (1,500) according to the latest federal census and located within three (3) miles of a city or county that permits the sale, receipt, storage and transportation for the purpose of sale of beer or light wine; at an election held for the purpose, under the election laws applicable to such city, may either prohibit or permit, except as otherwise provided under Section 67-9-1, the sale and the receipt, storage and transportation for the purpose of sale of beer and light wine. An election to determine whether such sale shall be permitted in cities wherein its sale is prohibited by law shall be ordered by the city council or mayor and board of aldermen or other governing body of such city for such city only, upon the presentation of a petition for such city to such governing board containing the names of twenty percent (20%) of the duly qualified voters of such city asking for such election. In like manner, an election to determine whether such sale shall be prohibited in cities wherein its sale is permitted by law shall be ordered by the city council or mayor and board of aldermen or other governing board of such city for such city only, upon the presentation of a petition to such governing board containing the names of twenty percent (20%) of the duly qualified voters of such city asking for such election. No election on either question shall be held by any one (1) city more often than once in five (5) years.
     </p>
     <p>
      Thirty (30) days’ notice shall be given to the qualified electors of such city in the manner prescribed by law upon the question of either permitting or prohibiting such sale, and the notice shall contain a statement of the question to be voted on at the election. The tickets to be used in the election shall have the following words printed thereon: “For the legal sale of light wine of an alcoholic content of not more than five percent (5%) by weight and beer of an alcoholic content of not more than eight percent (8%) by weight”; and the words “Against the legal sale of light wine of an alcoholic content of not more than five percent (5%) by weight and beer of an alcoholic content of not more than eight percent (8%) by weight,” next below. In making up his ticket the voter shall make a cross (X) opposite the words of his choice.
     </p>
     <p>
      If in the election a majority of the qualified electors voting in the election shall vote “For the legal sale of light wine of an alcoholic content of not more than five percent (5%) by weight and beer of an alcoholic content of not more than eight percent (8%) by weight,” then the city council or mayor and board of aldermen or other governing body shall pass the necessary order permitting the legal sale of such light wine and beer in such city. If in the election a majority of the qualified electors voting in the election shall vote “Against the legal sale of light wine of an alcoholic content of not more than five percent (5%) by weight and beer of an alcoholic content of not more than eight percent (8%) by weight,” then the city council or mayor and board of aldermen or other governing body shall pass the necessary order prohibiting the sale of such light wine and beer in such city.

   Under the provisions of the Native Wine Act (§§<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t67c05s67-5-1" target="_self">67-5-1</a></cite> et seq.), the manufacturer, possession, and sale of native wines are legal throughout the state. Martin v. State, 501 So. 2d 1124, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2285 (Miss. 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the petition filed on January 15, 1985 was 126 registered voters short of the statutorily required 20 percent necessary to call a beer sales referendum, whereupon the board of alderman requested Attorney General opinion for guidance and, upon release of Attorney General’s opinion, petitioners gathered additional signatures, board properly accepted 126 validated names submitted on March 26, 1985 to supplement those on the petition as first filed, adjudged that the petition met the 20 percent requirement, and called the election. City of Clinton v. Smith, 493 So. 2d 331, 1986 Miss. LEXIS 2555 (Miss. 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where no express deadline for the filing of petitions is fixed by statutes or order of the governing authority, additional signatures of registered voters may be added after the original filings if added within a reasonable time following the original filings, and provided further, that the governing authority be required to adjudge as of the date it determines to call the election that the number of validated signatures as of that day is adequate, and, where, as in this case, the delay was some 2 months and 10 days, several weeks of which were consumed in effort to obtain an Attorney General opinion, none of the 126 signatures submitted on March 25, 1985, and validated by the city clerk, was disqualified from consideration because of tardy filing. City of Clinton v. Smith, 493 So. 2d 331, 1986 Miss. LEXIS 2555 (Miss. 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       Each signature of a registered voter, before that signature may be validated and counted toward the number of signatures required by statute, must appear upon a page which contains language expressing in an intelligible manner the desire of the signing party that a particular referendum election be called, that is, language sufficient that one reading it before signing would not likely be mislead as to the import of his or her signature. City of Clinton v. Smith, 493 So. 2d 331, 1986 Miss. LEXIS 2555 (Miss. 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       Forty-five validated signatures on 6 petition pages containing no language advising signatories of the reason for affixing their signatures thereon could not be counted toward the 20 percent requirement to call a beer sales referendum election. City of Clinton v. Smith, 493 So. 2d 331, 1986 Miss. LEXIS 2555 (Miss. 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       A petition asking the board of aldermen to call an election to determine whether or not beer could be lawfully sold in the city, which was regular and sufficient on its face, and contained an attorney’s affidavit that the signatures thereon were genuine, as well as the city clerk’s affidavit that the names of more than 20 per cent of the city’s qualified electors were on the petition, was sufficient to make a prima facie case for petitioners. Lee County Drys v. Anderson, 231 Miss. 222, 95 So. 2d 224, 1957 Miss. LEXIS 508 (Miss. 1957).
      </p>
      <p>
       It was the duty of the mayor and board of aldermen to canvass the names on petition asking that an election be called to determine whether or not beer could be lawfully sold in the city, in order to determine whether or not such petition contained the required number of qualified voters, and to adjudicate this fact. Lee County Drys v. Anderson, 231 Miss. 222, 95 So. 2d 224, 1957 Miss. LEXIS 508 (Miss. 1957).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where, upon appeal, the circuit judge correctly reversed the action of the mayor and board of supervisors in dismissing a petition asking that an election be held to determine whether or not beer could be lawfully sold in the city, it was error to fail to enter a judgment directing the mayor and the board of aldermen to call an election in accordance with this section. Lee County Drys v. Anderson, 231 Miss. 222, 95 So. 2d 224, 1957 Miss. LEXIS 508 (Miss. 1957).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the county in which the city was located had voted out beer under Code 1942, § 10208, in 1939, this would not prevent the city from holding an election under this section to determine whether or not beer could be sold therein.

       Where police found a bottle of vodka and four cans of beer in defendant’s vehicle, he was arrested and charged with the offenses of possession of whiskey and possession of beer in a dry county; the failure of the police justice affidavit to cite to the Mississippi statute did not render the affidavit invalid, and the defendant was adequately notified of the nature and cause of the accusations against him.

       Where enforcement agents of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Division, in the course of a lawful search for intoxicating liquor, discovered beer which was contraband in that county, it was lawful under the circumstances for the officers to seize the beer, and their testimony with respect to it was properly admitted in a prosecution for the illegal possession of beer. Gann v. State, 234 So. 2d 627, 1970 Miss. LEXIS 1415 (Miss. 1970).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the qualified electors of a county had rejected the proposition that beer had not more than four percent alcohol by weight be legalized, possession of beer in the county was illegal and continued to be so after the election whether its alcoholic content was more or less than four percent, and proof that an accused’s beer contained more than four percent of alcohol by weight was not necessary in order to convict the accused of the illegal possession of the beer.

       A charge of unlawfully possessing beer must allege that it was in violation of this statute. Brown v. State, 241 Miss. 838, 133 So. 2d 529, 1961 Miss. LEXIS 408 (Miss. 1961).
      </p>
      <p>
       The local option statutes, Chapter 171, Laws of 1934, and chapter 279, Laws of 1958, are so closely related that a valid affidavit charging an offense under subsection (b) of the 1958 Act must charge, among other averments, that the defendant had possession of alcoholic beverages in violation of the provisions of Chapter 279, Laws of 1958. Kelly v. State, 237 Miss. 112, 113 So. 2d 540, 1959 Miss. LEXIS 453 (Miss. 1959).
      </p>
      <p>
       A charge that one had in his possession beer when the same was prohibited in the county as the result of an election to prohibit its transportation, storage, sale, distribution or manufacture, contrary to that form of the statute in such case made and provided, fails to state an offense. Kelly v. State, 237 Miss. 112, 113 So. 2d 540, 1959 Miss. LEXIS 453 (Miss. 1959).
      </p>
      <p>
       In prosecution for unlawful distribution of beer in a county where such distribution has been outlawed by the vote of the people, this distribution is violation of this section regardless of the fact that the alcoholic content may be 4 per cent or less and it is unnecessary for the charge or the proof to show whether the alcoholic content was 4 per cent or more or less than that amount. Walton v. State, 219 Miss. 72, 68 So. 2d 87, 1953 Miss. LEXIS 371 (Miss. 1953).
      </p>
      <p>
       Under a statute allowing the county to determine that it shall be unlawful to transport beer of alcoholic content of not more than 4 per cent, an indictment which charged violation of the statute but did not set out each step by which county effected its “determination” but stated what the county determined was sufficient. Hoyle v. State, 216 Miss. 330, 62 So. 2d 380, 1953 Miss. LEXIS 641 (Miss. 1953).

     </h3>
     <p>
      Where application is made for a permit to engage in the business of a retailer of light wine or beer, the applicant shall show in his application that he possesses the following qualifications:
     </p>
     <p>
      Applicant must be a person at least twenty-one (21) years of age, of good moral character and a resident of the State of Mississippi.
     </p>
     <p>
      Applicant shall not have been convicted of a felony, or of pandering or of keeping or maintaining a house of prostitution, or have been convicted within two (2) years of the date of his application of any violation of the laws of this state or the laws of the United States relating to alcoholic liquor.
     </p>
     <p>
      Applicant shall not have had revoked, except for a violation of Section 67-3-52, within two (2) years next preceding his application, any license or permit issued to him pursuant to the laws of this state, or any other state, to sell alcoholic liquor of any kind.
     </p>
     <p>
      Applicant shall be the owner of the premises for which the permit is sought or the holder of an existing lease thereon.
     </p>
     <p>
      Applicant shall not be residentially domiciled with any person whose permit has been revoked for cause, except for a violation of Section 67-3-52, within two (2) years next preceding the date of the present application for a permit.
     </p>
     <p>
      The applicant has not had any license or permit to sell beer or light wine at retail revoked, within five (5) years next preceding his application, due to a violation of Section 67-3-52.
     </p>
     <p>
      Applicant shall not employ any person whose permit has been revoked when such person owned or operated the business on the premises for which a permit is sought or allow such person to have any financial interest in the business of the applicant, until such person is qualified to obtain a permit in his own name.
     </p>
     <p>
      The applicant is not indebted to the State of Mississippi for any taxes.
     </p>
     <p>
      If applicant is a partnership, all members of the partnership must be qualified to obtain a permit. Each member of the partnership must be a resident of the State of Mississippi.

      If applicant is a corporation, all officers and directors thereof, and any stockholder owning more than five percent (5%) of the stock of such corporation, and the person or persons who shall conduct and manage the licensed premises for the corporation shall possess all the qualifications required herein for any individual permittee. However, the requirements as to residence shall not apply to officers, directors and stockholders of such corporation.

     </p>
     <p>
      The commissioner may refuse to issue a permit to an applicant for a place that is frequented by known criminals, prostitutes, or other law violators or troublemakers who disturb the peace and quietude of the community and frequently require the assistance of peace officers to apprehend such law violators or to restore order. The burden of proof of establishing the foregoing shall rest upon the commissioner.

       In a suit for the breach of a commercial lease, the tenant was not prohibited from claiming lost profits resulting from the club’s sale of beer where he did not have a license to sell beer and any failure in obtaining a liquor license was not a contributing cause of the damages that he tenant sought. Evans v. Clemons, 872 So. 2d 23, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 821 (Miss. Ct. App. 2003), cert. denied, 873 So. 2d 1032, 2004 Miss. LEXIS 475 (Miss. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where local option applies, the state proposes to maintain control as to who may sell beer, as well as when and where. Powell v. State Tax Com., 233 Miss. 185, 101 So. 2d 350, 1958 Miss. LEXIS 368 (Miss. 1958).
      </p>
      <p>
       The rejection of an application for a license to sell beer at retail may not be arbitrary or capricious. Powell v. State Tax Com., 233 Miss. 185, 101 So. 2d 350, 1958 Miss. LEXIS 368 (Miss. 1958).
      </p>
      <p>
       By the terms of this section it is meant that the applicant for a license to sell beer at retail should make apparent or clear by evidence, testimony or reasoning, or prove or demonstrate that he possesses the requisite qualifications. Powell v. State Tax Com., 233 Miss. 185, 101 So. 2d 350, 1958 Miss. LEXIS 368 (Miss. 1958).
      </p>
      <p>
       The burden of showing the necessary moral character ordinarily rests upon the applicant for a license to sell beer. Powell v. State Tax Com., 233 Miss. 185, 101 So. 2d 350, 1958 Miss. LEXIS 368 (Miss. 1958).
      </p>
      <p>
       The granting of a permit to sell beer at retail ordinarily rests in the sound discretion of the official to whom the duty is committed, and the refusal to grant such permit deprives no one of any personal property right, but merely deprives him of the privilege which it is in the discretion of the proper authorities to grant or withhold. Powell v. State Tax Com., 233 Miss. 185, 101 So. 2d 350, 1958 Miss. LEXIS 368 (Miss. 1958).
      </p>
      <p>
       While if the law specially enjoined upon the state tax commissioner the duty to issue a permit to sell beer at retail, mandamus would be a proper remedy, but since the question whether the applicant possessed the requisite qualifications had to be determined by the commissioner, when he acted, he did so in the exercise of discretion and not ministerially. Powell v. State Tax Com., 233 Miss. 185, 101 So. 2d 350, 1958 Miss. LEXIS 368 (Miss. 1958).
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the commissioner, in denying the applicant a permit to sell beer at retail, was not acting ministerially but in the exercise of discretion, the action of the trial judge in refusing to grant the writ of mandamus was affirmed. Powell v. State Tax Com., 233 Miss. 185, 101 So. 2d 350, 1958 Miss. LEXIS 368 (Miss. 1958).

       In a suit for the breach of a commercial lease, the tenant was not prohibited from claiming lost profits resulting from the club’s sale of beer where he did not have a license to sell beer and any failure in obtaining a liquor license was not a contributing cause of the damages that he tenant sought. Evans v. Clemons, 872 So. 2d 23, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 821 (Miss. Ct. App. 2003), cert. denied, 873 So. 2d 1032, 2004 Miss. LEXIS 475 (Miss. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where local option applies, the state proposes to maintain control as to who may sell beer, as well as when and where. Powell v. State Tax Com., 233 Miss. 185, 101 So. 2d 350, 1958 Miss. LEXIS 368 (Miss. 1958).
      </p>
      <p>
       The applicant for a license to sell beer at retail has no inherent right to the permit. Powell v. State Tax Com., 233 Miss. 185, 101 So. 2d 350, 1958 Miss. LEXIS 368 (Miss. 1958).
      </p>
      <p>
       The granting of a permit to sell beer at retail ordinarily rests in the sound discretion of the official to whom the duty is committed, and the refusal to grant such permit deprives no one of any personal property right, but merely deprives him of the privilege which it is in the discretion of the proper authorities to grant or withhold. Powell v. State Tax Com., 233 Miss. 185, 101 So. 2d 350, 1958 Miss. LEXIS 368 (Miss. 1958).
      </p>
      <p>
       The burden of showing the necessary moral character ordinarily rests upon the applicant for a license to sell beer. Powell v. State Tax Com., 233 Miss. 185, 101 So. 2d 350, 1958 Miss. LEXIS 368 (Miss. 1958).
      </p>
      <p>
       The rejection of an application for a license to sell beer at retail may not be arbitrary or capricious. Powell v. State Tax Com., 233 Miss. 185, 101 So. 2d 350, 1958 Miss. LEXIS 368 (Miss. 1958).
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the commissioner, in denying the applicant a permit to sell beer at retail, was not acting ministerially but in the exercise of discretion, the action of the trial judge in refusing to grant the writ of mandamus was affirmed. Powell v. State Tax Com., 233 Miss. 185, 101 So. 2d 350, 1958 Miss. LEXIS 368 (Miss. 1958).
      </p>
      <p>
       Those who avail themselves of legislative privilege of engaging in sale of beer accept the privilege under the conditions attached to its exercise. Stone v. Farish, 199 Miss. 186, 23 So. 2d 911, 1945 Miss. LEXIS 280 (Miss. 1945).

       The commissioner, or a hearing officer or the board of review, as designated by the commissioner, after a show cause hearing, shall revoke or suspend any permit granted by authority of this chapter to any person who shall violate any of the provisions of this chapter or the revenue laws of this state relating to engaging in transporting, storing, selling, distributing, possessing, receiving or manufacturing of wines or beers, or any person who shall hereafter be convicted of the unlawful sale of intoxicating liquor, or any person who shall allow or permit any form of illegal gambling or immorality on the premises described in such permit. The commissioner shall not revoke or suspend a permit of a retailer for the sale of light wine or beer to a person under the age of twenty-one (21) years until there has been a conviction of the permit holder or an employee of the permit holder for such violation.

       If any person exercising any privilege taxable under the provisions of Chapter 71 of Title 27, Mississippi Code of 1972, shall willfully neglect or refuse to comply with the provisions of such chapter, or any rules or regulations promulgated by the commissioner under authority of such chapter, or the provisions of this chapter, including maintaining the qualifications of an applicant under Section 67-3-19, during the permit period, the commissioner shall be authorized to revoke or suspend the permit theretofore issued to the person. Any person whose permit shall have been revoked by the commissioner shall be thereafter prohibited from exercising any privilege under the provisions of Chapter 71 of Title 27, Mississippi Code of 1972, for a period of two (2) years from the date of the revocation. The commissioner may, however, for good cause shown, grant a new permit upon such conditions as the commissioner may prescribe. Any person whose permit shall have been suspended by the commissioner shall be prohibited from exercising any privilege under the provisions of Chapter 71 of Title 27, Mississippi Code of 1972, during the period of the suspension. Failure of the person to comply with the terms of the suspension shall be cause for revocation of his permit, in addition to the other penalties provided by law.

       In addition to the reasons specified in this section and other provisions of this chapter, the commissioner shall be authorized to suspend the permit of any permit holder for being out of compliance with an order for support, as defined in Section 93-11-153. The procedure for suspension of a permit for being out of compliance with an order for support, and the procedure for the reissuance or reinstatement of a permit suspended for that purpose, and the payment of any fees for the reissuance or reinstatement of a permit suspended for that purpose, shall be governed by Section 93-11-157 or Section 93-11-163, as the case may be. If there is any conflict between any provision of Section 93-11-157 or Section 93-11-163 and any provision of this chapter, the provisions of Section 93-11-157 or 93-11-163, as the case may be, shall control.

       Pursuant to Section 1-1-109, the Joint Legislative Committee on Compilation, Revision and Publication of Legislation corrected a publishing error in subsection (1) of this section. The sentence “The commissioner shall not revoke or suspend a permit of a retailer for the sale of light wine or beer to a person under the age of twenty-one (21) years until there has been a conviction of the permit holder or an employee of the permit holder for such violation” was added at the end.

       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       Sections authorizing revocation of permit for wholesale distribution of beer under certain prescribed circumstances upon giving notice as required by Code 1942, § 10257, are constitutional. Stone v. Farish, 199 Miss. 186, 23 So. 2d 911, 1945 Miss. LEXIS 280 (Miss. 1945).
      </p>
      <p>
       A permit or license for the wholesale distribution of beer is not a property or contract right, and its revocation need seek no judicial sanction, nor is a judicial proceeding available to forbid the proper exercise of such revocation. Stone v. Farish, 199 Miss. 186, 23 So. 2d 911, 1945 Miss. LEXIS 280 (Miss. 1945).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although ordinarily a license may have aspects of property, the control retained in respect to the granting of a permit for wholesale distribution of beer strips the permit of that quality which requires divestiture only by judicial process. Stone v. Farish, 199 Miss. 186, 23 So. 2d 911, 1945 Miss. LEXIS 280 (Miss. 1945).
      </p>
      <p>
       Those who avail themselves of legislative privilege of engaging in sale of beer accept the privilege under the conditions attached to its exercise. Stone v. Farish, 199 Miss. 186, 23 So. 2d 911, 1945 Miss. LEXIS 280 (Miss. 1945).
      </p>
      <p>
       While absolute administrative power to revoke permit for wholesale distribution of beer excludes judicial review where exercised under condition of its bestowal, it does not imply arbitrary or capricious exercise. Stone v. Farish, 199 Miss. 186, 23 So. 2d 911, 1945 Miss. LEXIS 280 (Miss. 1945).
      </p>
      <p>
       Administrative questions regarding revocation of permit for wholesale distribution of beer belong within the legislative orbit, and, although judicial oversight can never be absolutely forbidden, it is measured by the same considerations which apply to direct legislative acts. Stone v. Farish, 199 Miss. 186, 23 So. 2d 911, 1945 Miss. LEXIS 280 (Miss. 1945).
      </p>
      <p>
       Order of commissioner revoking permit for wholesale distribution of beer upon sufficient grounds prescribed in the sections authorizing such revocation, after notice as required by Code 1942, § 10257 and a hearing, was final, where the notice to the permit holder set out the grounds for such revocation which were confirmed by the commissioner’s order. Stone v. Farish, 199 Miss. 186, 23 So. 2d 911, 1945 Miss. LEXIS 280 (Miss. 1945).

     <p>
      Proceedings for the revocation or suspension of any permit authorizing the sale of beer or wine at retail for a violation of any of the provisions of Section 67-3-53 may be brought in the circuit or county court of the county in which the licensed premises are located. Such proceedings shall be entitled in the name of the state and against the permittee and shall be instituted by filing a complaint with the clerk of the court. The complaint may be filed by the county prosecuting attorney of the county upon his own initiative or, then by the district attorney of the district in which the county is located, and it shall be mandatory upon the county prosecuting attorney, or district attorney, as the case may be, to file a complaint when requested to do so by a peace officer or any person as provided in this section. Any peace officer within his jurisdiction or any enforcement officer of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Division within the Department of Revenue who learns that a retail permittee within his jurisdiction has violated any of the provisions of such section shall file with the county prosecuting attorney of the county in which the licensed premises are located, or, then with the district attorney of the district in which such county is located, an affidavit specifying in detail the facts alleged to constitute such violation, and requesting that a complaint be filed against the permittee for the revocation or suspension of his permit. A like affidavit may be filed with the county prosecuting attorney, or district attorney, as the case may be, by any person who resides, and has for at least one (1) year prior thereto resided within the county in which the licensed premises are located requesting that a complaint be filed for the revocation or suspension of the permittee’s permit. Promptly upon receiving any such affidavit the county prosecuting attorney, or district attorney, shall prepare a proper complaint, which shall be signed and sworn to by the person or persons filing the affidavit with him, and the county prosecuting attorney or district attorney shall file the complaint with the clerk of the circuit or county court.

     <p>
      The complaint shall be heard by the court without a jury. If the court shall find upon the hearing that the offense or offenses charged in the complaint have been established by the evidence, the court shall order the revocation or suspension of the permit. If the court finds that the permittee has not previously violated the law in the operation of his licensed business, and that no permit or license held by him has previously been suspended or revoked, and if it appears to the satisfaction of the court that there is reasonable ground to expect that the permittee will not again commit the offense or offenses charged in the complaint and that to revoke the permit would be unduly severe, then the court may suspend the permit for such period of time as the court deems proper. However, if the permittee has previously had his permit suspended or revoked, it shall be mandatory upon the court upon a finding of guilty to revoke the said permit. The judgment of the court revoking or suspending such permit shall not be superseded or stayed during the pendency of an appeal therefrom. A certified copy of the final order or decree of the court shall be forwarded by the clerk of the court to the commissioner.
     </p>
     <p>
      After the filing of a complaint with the clerk of the court for the revocation or suspension of a permit, the court in which the complaint is filed shall retain jurisdiction to hear and determine such complaint and to enter judgment revoking or suspending such permit. For the purpose of such hearing and as to the effect of the judgment of the court entered pursuant thereto, the permit shall be in full force and effect even though the permittee, after filing of such complaint, may have surrendered his permit, or such permit may have expired, or the rights of the permittee thereunder may have otherwise terminated. It is the purpose of this section to preclude the permittee from avoiding the effect of a judgment of revocation by a court by reason of conditions arising subsequent to the filing of a complaint.

      The jurisdiction conferred upon the circuit and county courts to hear and determine complaints for the revocation or suspension of permits shall not be exclusive and any authority conferred on the commissioner to revoke or suspend licenses shall remain in full force and effect, and the commissioner shall have authority to revoke or suspend permits for a violation of Section 67-3-53 in the manner provided in subsection (2) of Section 67-3-29 for the revocation of permits. However, when a complaint is filed with the court any proceedings which may then be pending before the commissioner against the same permittee on the same charges shall abate and no proceedings for the revocation or suspension of a permit for a violation of the provisions of Section 67-3-53 shall be filed with the commissioner when proceedings are pending before the court against the permittee on the same charges. The revocation or suspension of a permittee’s state permit by the court or by the commissioner shall automatically revoke or suspend any municipal license or permit held by such person. The revocation or suspension of a permittee’s permit shall be in addition to and not in lieu of or limitation of any other penalty imposed by law.

       In an action arising from a motor vehicle accident caused by an intoxicated minor who allegedly smoked marijuana and drank beer purchased other than at the defendant restaurant, the defendant could be found liable if its negligence in selling beer consumed by the minor was a contributing case to the accident; it was not necessary that the defendant’s negligence be the sole proximate cause of the accident.

       In an action arising from a motor vehicle accident caused by a minor who alleged that he did not purchase beer from the defendant restaurant, judgment for the defendant restaurant was reversed based on inadequate jury instruction; the jury should have been instructed that it could find negligence per se if it found that the restaurant sold alcohol to another minor and that it could then hold the restaurant liable if it concluded that it was foreseeable that the minor to whom the alcohol was sold would share that alcohol with other minors.

       Policy of liability insurance covering convenience store, which policy excluded coverage for bodily injury for which insured may be held liable by reason of selling, serving or giving of any alcoholic beverage to minor, excludes coverage for bodily injury by reason of selling, serving or giving of “beer”, even though definition of alcoholic beverage under state law excludes beer, as common and ordinary meaning of beer is beverage containing alcohol; liability policy which excluded coverage for bodily injury for which store was liable by reason of selling of alcoholic beverage to minor did not cover bodily injuries sustained in accident caused by underaged motorist’s intoxication from drinking beer which he bought at store, despite statute which excluded beer from definition of alcoholic beverages.

       Sale of beer to minor in violation of statute constitutes negligence per se and trial court errs in refusing to grant such jury instruction. Bryant v. Alpha Entertainment Corp., 508 So. 2d 1094, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2584 (Miss. 1987).

       Although Mississippi statutes relating to the sale of alcoholic beverages have sometimes been referred to as the Mississippi Dram Shop Law, such references are misleading because true dram shop acts are civil liability acts wherein the legislature specifically imposes liability on the seller of intoxicating liquors when a third party is injured as a result of the intoxication of the buyer where the sale caused or contributed to such intoxication.

       The statute which prohibits the sale of beer or wine to a minor was adopted for the protection of the general public and a minor is a member of the protected class. Cuevas v. Royal D'Iberville Hotel, 498 So. 2d 346, 1986 Miss. LEXIS 2755 (Miss. 1986).

       In a wrongful death action alleging that defendant market was negligent in selling beer to a minor who was subsequently killed in an automobile accident, the trial court did not err in overruling defendant’s demurrer where the complaint alleged a violation of the statute prohibiting the sale of beer to minors and that such negligence had contributed to the car wreck and decedent’s death; although such statute was enacted for the legalization and regulation of the manufacture and sale of beer and wine, it was also adopted for the protection of the general public.

       An indictment charging the holder of a permit for the sale of beer and wine at retail with selling, giving or furnishing beer to a person under 18 years of age, was not defective in failing to charge the defendant with knowledge that his employee sold or gave beer to the minor, since the defendant’s lack of knowledge of the acts of his employee was a defense and a question of fact for submission to the jury, and neither matters of evidence nor matters of defense need be averred in an indictment or information.

       Subsection (a) of this section, when read in conjunction with Code 1942, § 10224, as a whole, and one section in context with the other, merely makes for the conclusion that though Code 1942, § 10224 refers to the authority of municipalities to prescribe hours opening or closing of businesses selling light wines and beer, those hours prescribed by the municipality must come within the limits of the hours established by state law.

       In a suit against a bar for furnishing alcohol to a minor who later caused an auto accident, the trial court properly excluded evidence of prior sales of alcohol to minors by the bar, as there was no purpose for such evidence other than to show that the bar had a propensity to sell alcohol to minors.

       Section 67-3-53(a) provides that a holder of a permit for the sale of beer and light wine may not sell or give to be consumed in or upon any licensed premises beer or light wine between the hours of midnight and seven o’clock the following morning. The statute applies only to businesses where beer or light wine is sold or given to be consumed in or upon the premises and does not apply to businesses where beer and light wine are sold for off premises consumption, such as grocery stores and convenience stores with permits for the sale of beer and light wine. Baker, November 1, 1996, A.G. Op. #96-0737.
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   An ordinance regulating the hours of sale of beer and light wines falls within the authority of a municipality to regulate hours of opening and closing pursuant to §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t67c03s67-3-65" target="_self">67-3-65</a></cite>; however, any specific hours prescribed by the municipality for the sale of such beverages must come within the limits of this section. Tyner, March 5, 1999, A.G. Op. #99-0074.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 67-3-53(a) allows the on-premises sale of beer and light wine beyond midnight by
   anyone who has a permit to sell beer or light wine in areas where the Alcoholic Beverage Control Division (ABC) of the State Tax Commission has extended the hours of on-premises sale for alcoholic beverages beyond midnight. Parker, May 12, 2003, A.G. Op. 03-0219.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because, based on the language of Section 67-3-53, the Legislature has shown a clear intent to allow the on-premises sale of beer and light wine beyond midnight in areas where the on-premises sale of alcoholic beverages have been extended beyond midnight, therefore, the Legislature has preempted this area with a specific statute that would make any local ordinance to the contrary void. Parker, May 12, 2003, A.G. Op. 03-0219.

       Code 1942, § 10223(a), when read in conjunction with Code 1942, § 10224, as a whole, and one section in context with the other, merely makes for the conclusion that though Code 1942, § 10224 refers to the authority of municipalities to prescribe hours opening or closing of businesses selling light wines and beer, those hours prescribed by the municipality must come within the limits of the hours established by state law.

       Provision of statute relating to regulation of sale of wine and beer by municipalities and boards of supervisors outside of municipalities that nothing in statute shall prohibit the designation of the territory surrounding churches and schools in which such beverages shall not be sold or consumed, did not limit power to prohibit to territory surrounding churches and schools.

       Statute relating to sale of wine and beer which provided that municipalities and boards of supervisors of territory lying outside of municipalities may enforce regulations “for fixing zones and territories” and for prescribing hours of opening and closing and such other measures as will promote public health, morals, and safety held to confer upon municipalities and on boards of supervisors in such territory the power to fix zones in which sale might be conducted and other zones in which sale might be prohibited, “zone” connoting within itself a fixed territory.

       In a suit against a bar for furnishing alcohol to a minor who later caused an auto accident, the trial court erred by directing a verdict for the bar, as the evidence created a fact question as to whether the bar knew or should have known that the buyer of drinks (who presented a false Mississippi driver’s license showing he was 21) was giving them to minors.

       If a person under the age of twenty-one (21) years is convicted or enters a plea of guilty of violating subsection (1) or subsection (2) of this section, the trial judge, in lieu of the penalties otherwise provided under this section, shall suspend the minor’s driver’s license by taking and keeping it in the custody of the court for a period of time not to exceed ninety (90) days. The judge so ordering the suspension shall enter upon his docket “DEFENDANT’S DRIVER’S LICENSE SUSPENDED FOR_______________DAYS IN LIEU OF CONVICTION” and such action by the trial judge shall not constitute a conviction. During the period that the minor’s driver’s license is suspended, the trial judge shall suspend the imposition of any fines or penalties that may be imposed under this section and may place the minor on probation subject to such conditions as the judge deems appropriate. If the minor violates any of the conditions of probation, then the trial judge shall return the driver’s license to the minor and impose the fines, penalties, or both, that he would have otherwise imposed, and such action shall constitute a conviction.

If the court determines that such person was dismissed and the proceedings against him discharged or that such person had satisfactorily served his sentence and/or paid his fine, it shall enter such order.

However, the petitioner pleaded guilty to burglary on October 9, 1979, 3 years prior to October 1, 1982, and admitted that he did not fall within the criterion in any of the statutes authorizing expungement, and thus the trial court did not err in denying his petition for expungement.

Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t67c03s67-3-73" target="_self">67-3-73</a></cite>, expert testimony that the driver who killed decedent was visibly intoxicated when he was served alcohol precluded the entry of summary judgment for defendants under Miss.

   Casino offered assistance to the adult invitee who had been drinking for hours and the record reflected that she was attended by casino staff after she fell to the floor. A casino staff member suggested that she seek the attention of a physician and further offered to summon an ambulance, however the adult invitee refused that suggestion as well; thus, the casino did not breach a duty of care, and in any event, where the record showed the invitee became voluntarily intoxicated (she later died at home as a result of aspirating on her own vomit), she was not a member of the class protected by Miss. Code. Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t67c03s67-3-73" target="_self">67-3-73</a></cite> and summary judgment for the casino was proper. Estate of White v.

       In an action against a retail business that sold beer to a visibly intoxicated driver about two hours before an accident which killed a five year old child, the defendant was not entitled to summary judgment on the basis of an affidavit by the driver that she did not drink the alcoholic beverages purchased from it on the day of the accident and an affidavit by the driver’s boyfriend and future husband which corrobrated that statement where (1) the driver had reason to lie, given her pending criminal trial arising from the same accident, (2) the credibility of the driver’s boyfriend and future husband was suspect given his relationship to the driver, and (3) the plaintiff presented circumstantial evidence that the driver’s level of intoxication increased throughout the day, that she must have consumed a large volume of alcohol to have been as visibly drunk as she was by the time of the accident, and that such volume must have consisted in significant part of some beer purchased from the defendant.

       Nightclub owners were entitled to summary judgment when an accident victim alleged that the nightclub negligently served alcohol to a visibly intoxicated person because the victim failed to prove that the nightclub served a visibly intoxicated person, or that the person’s intoxication proximately caused the victim’s injuries when the victim fell out the backseat of the truck which the person was driving, after leaving the nightclub, and was run over by the truck.

   Casino patron’s claim of negligence per se in connection with injuries she allegedly sustained when a cocktail waitress dropped a tray of drinks on or near the patron, while attempting to serve another customer, failed because there was no evidence that the casino violated Mississippi’s dram shop act, Miss Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t67c03s67-3-73" target="_self">67-3-73</a></cite>, where there was nothing to show that the customer was visibly intoxicated.

     <p>
      The legislative purpose of this chapter is to provide a structure for the business relations between a wholesaler and a supplier of light wine or beer. Regulation in this area is considered necessary for the following reasons:
     </p>
     <p>
      To maintain stability and healthy competition in the light wine and beer industry in this state.
     </p>
     <p>
      To promote and maintain a sound, stable and viable system of distribution of light wine and beer to the public.
     </p>
     <p>
      To provide for the private settlement of disputes between wholesalers and suppliers of light wine or beer as an alternative to civil litigation which consumes the time and resources of the parties and the judicial system.
     </p>
     <p>
      To promote the public health, safety and welfare.
