       This section [Code 1942, § 831] is applicable to devises by will, as well as to conveyances by deed, since a will is a writing signed under an authorization for delivery upon the happening of the event which is to vest title in the devisee.

       A purported conveyance of “all my right, title, interest and claim in and to” described lands, stating that it is understood that the grantor “shall have and hold all her right and title to above described property so long as she shall live, but at her death [grantee] shall claim and hold all right and title”, operates as a present conveyance with reservation of a life estate, and is not invalid as an attempted testamentary disposition. Buchanan v. Buchanan, 236 Miss. 751, 112 So. 2d 224, 1959 Miss. LEXIS 372 (Miss. 1959).
      </p>
      <p>
       An instrument, which was executed and acknowledged in form of a deed and duly delivered and the consideration therefor paid, and which by its plain terms immediately vested the title to the land in the grantee, subject only to the reservation of the right of possession of the grantor as long as he lived, must be given effect as a valid deed. Tanner v. Foreman, 212 Miss. 355, 54 So. 2d 483, 1951 Miss. LEXIS 456 (Miss. 1951).
      </p>
      <p>
       An instrument in the words and form of, and describing itself as, a deed, acknowledged and recorded as a deed, is a deed and not a will notwithstanding a provision reserving a life estate to grantor and that title should vest in grantee at grantor’s death. Watts v. Watts, 198 Miss. 246, 22 So. 2d 625, 1945 Miss. LEXIS 190 (Miss. 1945).
      </p>
      <p>
       Instrument purporting to convey land to grantee for consideration of $10 and other valuable consideration, providing that grantee was to cultivate the land free of rent, pay the taxes, and support grantor during the remainder of her life, title not to pass until grantor’s death, was a “deed” rather than a “will,” whereby grantee acquired, during grantor’s lifetime, title charged with obligation to support grantor for balance of her life. Hald v. Pearson, 197 Miss. 410, 20 So. 2d 71, 1944 Miss. LEXIS 308 (Miss. 1944).
      </p>
      <p>
       In determining whether an instrument is a deed or a will, the court must ascertain and give effect to intention of the parties as gathered from entire instrument, in light of circumstances surrounding its execution. Carter v. Dabbs, 196 Miss. 692, 18 So. 2d 747, 1944 Miss. LEXIS 250 (Miss. 1944).
      </p>
      <p>
       The difference between a deed and a will is that by means of the former a present interest passes, while the latter takes effect only at the death of the testator. Hald v. Pearson, 197 Miss. 410, 20 So. 2d 71, 1944 Miss. LEXIS 308 (Miss. 1944); Watts v. Watts, 198 Miss. 246, 22 So. 2d 625, 1945 Miss. LEXIS 190 (Miss. 1945).
      </p>
      <p>
       Instruments labeled warranty deeds, containing operative words of conveyance usual to warranty deeds, whereby grantors, who intended to execute deeds, purported to convey land in fee simple reserving to themselves a house and the use of pasture and ten acres, were deeds and not wills, notwithstanding provision, following grantee’s promise to pay specified annual amounts to grantors until their deaths, that at that time the property is to be the grantee’s, where instruments also provided that if grantee failed to make full annual payments the “deeds” are null and void. Carter v. Dabbs, 196 Miss. 692, 18 So. 2d 747, 1944 Miss. LEXIS 250 (Miss. 1944).

       Instrument executed by owner and wife purporting to convey land to son, containing provision that “this deed of conveyance is not to be delivered, or so considered delivered during” the lives of the grantors, but death of both shall constitute a full and complete delivery, and the land shall immediately vest in fee simple in him, was testamentary in character and ineffective as a deed; and the surviving grantor and widow of the owner could not effectively make a delivery upon her deathbed, as she was without power to amend the intention and purpose of her deceased husband. Palmer v. Riggs, 197 Miss. 256, 19 So. 2d 807, 1944 Miss. LEXIS 293 (Miss. 1944).
      </p>
      <p>
       Conveyances by instruments to take effect at maker’s death are not within rule that conveyances may be made to vest in future, since instruments conveying interests to vest in future must take effect in praesenti, and maker must part with all right to thereafter dispose of land otherwise.

       The grantees of a deed, who had a fiduciary relationship with the grantor, overcame the presumption of undue influence in the execution of the deed, where the grantor, along with her 3 children, initiated seeking preparation of the deed, the grantor expressed her intent to convey the property to the grantees several weeks prior to the execution of the deed, the attorney who prepared the deed testified that the grantor knew what she was doing when the deed was executed, and the grantor remained in complete control of her finances at all times.

       Marriage ties alone do not constitute a “confidential relationship” sufficient to raise a presumption of undue influence. Smith v. Smith, 574 So. 2d 644, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 787 (Miss. 1990), aff'd, 672 So. 2d 1194, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 226 (Miss. 1996).

       The date of execution of the deed should be the critical time when considering the standard of “weakness of intellect” or “great weakness of mind” with respect to the mental capacity to execute a deed. Furthermore, the “before and after” rule, applied in cases of permanent insanity, should not apply in cases involving a “weakness of intellect. Smith v. Smith, 574 So. 2d 644, 1990 Miss.

      </p>
      <p>
       There was sufficient evidence to rebut a presumption of undue influence with respect to the conveyance of a farm by a father to his sons where the father was “very sharp” mentally, aware of his family and finances, strong-willed, and, although he lived with one of the grantees at the time of the conveyance, also lived at various times with others and, therefore, was not solely dependant on the grantees.

       Where a widow assigned and acknowledged a warranty deed conveying her farm to her niece, reserving a life estate to herself, which deed was handed to her brother with the instructions to keep and deliver it to the niece upon the widow’s death, which instructions were followed, there was a valid delivery from the widow to the niece in view of the undisputed testimony that the grantor reserved no right to recall the deed, and that the delivery to the brother was unequivocally to hold for the niece.

       While the trend of the law in the construction of deeds has been extremely strict, and the words of the deed have been paramount in determining the type of conveyance executed rather than the true intent of the grantor, the new trend and interpretation of this rule of law is toward ascertaining the true intent of the grantor when dealing with conveyances by deed, as has been done in construing conveyances by will in this state for almost a hundred years.

       Where a widow assigned and acknowledged a warranty deed conveying her farm to her niece, reserving a life estate to herself, which deed was handed to her brother with the instructions to keep and deliver it to her niece upon the widow’s death, which instructions were followed, there was a valid delivery from the widow to the niece in view of the undisputed testimony that the grantor reserved no right to recall the deed, and that the delivery to the brother was unequivocally to hold for the niece. Myers v. Laird, 230 Miss. 675, 93 So. 2d 828, 1957 Miss. LEXIS 409 (Miss. 1957).
      </p>

United Miss. Bank v. GMAC Mortgage Co., 615 So. 2d 1174, 1993 Miss. LEXIS 21 (Miss. 1993).

      <p>
       The wording of a deed which provided that “we hereby bargain, sell, convey and warrant to the Trustees of Oakgrove Consolidated High School and their successors the following described land. . . ” could only connote a conveyance absolute and the grantors’ children would not be heard some 50 years later to say that the grantors’ intent was something entirely different from what was expressed in the plain and simple legalese in the recorded instrument of conveyance. Garraway v. Yonce, 549 So. 2d 1341, 1989 Miss. LEXIS 453 (Miss. 1989).
      </p>
      <p>
       A conveyance of land executed to a corporation in violation of the Mississippi Blue Sky Law (Laws, 1916, ch. 97) was utterly void and imparted no notice to subsequent purchasers, nor did it set in motion the running of the 10-year statute of limitations. Mississippi State Highway Com. v. Smith, 197 So. 2d 212, 1967 Miss. LEXIS 1503 (Miss. 1967).
      </p>
      <p>
       Alteration of deed by deletion of name of one of two grantees named in deed when it was delivered does not operate to pass title to grantee whose name remains in deed as title to one-half interest in property which has vested in grantee whose name was deleted can pass only by instrument of writing. Prater v. Prater, 208 Miss. 59, 43 So. 2d 582, 1949 Miss. LEXIS 408 (Miss. 1949).
      </p>
      <p>
       One who purchases real property on faith of public records from wife does not occupy position of innocent purchaser for value as to interest of husband when deed conveying property to husband and wife has been altered before recording by deletion of husband’s name from deed as one of the grantees. Prater v. Prater, 208 Miss. 59, 43 So. 2d 582, 1949 Miss. LEXIS 408 (Miss. 1949).
      </p>
      <p>
       Deed to property executed by wife conveys only interest in property owned by her, which is an undivided one-half interest when wife owns interest by reason of deed naming husband and wife as grantees, and deletion of husband’s name from deed after its delivery to grantees does not increase interest of wife in property. Prater v. Prater, 208 Miss. 59, 43 So. 2d 582, 1949 Miss. LEXIS 408 (Miss. 1949).
      </p>
      <p>
       Instrument purporting to be a deed, which has no grantee, either corporation or person, in being is void; deed for school and church purposes to Collins Graveyard and Collins School House was ineffectual, where no corporations so named were known in the community. Morgan v. Collins School House, 160 Miss. 321, 133 So. 675, 1931 Miss. LEXIS 172 (Miss. 1931).

      </p>
      <p>
       A deed conveying lands in a legal subdivision described as a corner or fractional corner of the same containing a certain area is not void for uncertainty. Swan v. New England Mortg. & Sec. Co., 75 Miss. 907, 23 So. 627, 1898 Miss. LEXIS 40 (Miss. 1898).
      </p>
      <p>
       A deed conveying “lot 36 in the town of Webb” is not void for uncertainty, since the courts will take judicial notice of the municipal subdivisions of the state and that they are in the counties to which they belong. Wilkerson v. Webb, 75 Miss. 403, 23 So. 180 (Miss. 1897).
      </p>
      <p>
       A verbal agreement by the owner to convey land to a county for school purposes, by which third parties are induced to erect a schoolhouse thereon, is an irrevocable license for the purpose for which it was made as long as the house is used for the purpose specified. Agnew v. Jones, 74 Miss. 347, 23 So. 25, 1896 Miss. LEXIS 186 (Miss. 1896).
      </p>

       Section 89-1-5, which provides, in part, that “the words deemed necessary by the common law to transfer an estate of inheritance” are no longer necessary to create a fee simple, does not alter the principle that reservations or exceptions expressed in doubtful or ambiguous language are, as a general rule, construed most strongly against the grantor and in favor of the grantee. Deason v. Cox, 527 So. 2d 624, 1988 Miss. LEXIS 209 (Miss. 1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       Under a land sale contract providing for reconveyance to the vendor in the event that industrial facilities were not developed on the property within five years, a condition which was not satisfied, the purchaser was required to convey fee simple title (including timber rights) where, although timber rights had been reserved to the vendor in the original deed and were later conveyed to the purchaser for separate consideration, the rights under the timber deed expired while the property was possessed by the purchaser and thus, merged into the ownership under the original deed. Forbes v. Columbia Pulp & Paper Co., 340 So. 2d 734, 1976 Miss. LEXIS 1732 (Miss. 1976).
      </p>

       Language in a will that all of the testator’s property was to pass to his wife and daughter and their descendents created a fee simple in the wife and daughter and not a life estate. Bradford v. Federal Land Bank, 338 So. 2d 388, 1976 Miss. LEXIS 1620 (Miss. 1976).
      </p>

       A devise of all testator’s property, except a certain parcel, to his wife, was construed to give her the fee notwithstanding an expressed desire that testator’s daughter should receive all property that her mother should have at her death. Wheeler v. Williams, 235 Miss. 142, 108 So. 2d 578, 1959 Miss. LEXIS 412 (Miss. 1959).

      <p>
       Under this section decedent’s transfer of land to herself as trustee for the benefit of her four children and the heirs at law of any of such children who should die during the continuance of the trust, with provision for distribution of the trust to the beneficiaries upon death of the trustee or her termination of the trust, vested the property in the trustee and the beneficiaries, so that the trust property was not part of decedent’s gross estate so as to be subject to federal estate taxes.

       Devise to two daughters providing that in case of daughters’ predeceasing testatrix, their children were to inherit each mother’s share, or if one died without children whole estate was to go to other, or if both died without children estate was to go over, was a contingency providing against death of daughters before testatrix, and upon their survival of testatrix they took a fee simple. Nations v. Colonial & United States Mortg. Co., 115 Miss. 741, 76 So. 642, 1917 Miss. LEXIS 260 (Miss. 1917).

   While Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t89c01s89-1-5" target="_self">89-1-5</a></cite> contained a presumption that a fee simple title passes unless expressly limited, there also existed a presumption of an easement when a deed failed to specifically identify a tract of land to be used for a railway, and where the railroad’s deed gave it a right to enter upon and hold the property, but did not convey the land itself, and the language that the conveyance was against the grantors and their heirs and assigns forever was not in the granting clause, the railroad only had a right of way, and thus, the interest that plaintiff potential purchasers of an industrial plant acquired from the railroad, through a quit claim deed for the property that adjoined the industrial plant, was only a right of way, and the potential purchasers’ claim of trespass against defendants, the industrial plant seller and the ultimate buyer, failed on defendants’ motion for summary judgment.

     </h3>
     <p>
      All conveyances or devises of land made to two (2) or more persons, including conveyances or devises to husband and wife, shall be construed to create estates in common and not in joint tenancy or entirety, unless it manifestly appears from the tenor of the instrument that it was intended to create an estate in joint tenancy or entirety with the right of survivorship. But an estate in joint tenancy or entirety with right of survivorship may be created by such conveyance from the owner or owners to himself, themselves or others, or to himself, themselves and others.
     </p>
     <p>
      An estate in joint tenancy or entirety with right of survivorship between spouses may be terminated by deed of one spouse to the other without necessity of joinder of the grantee spouse and without regard to whether the property constitutes any part of the homestead of the spouses.

       A reservation or conveyance of a fractional interest in minerals creates a tenancy-in-common between the parties as to the minerals. Thornhill v. System Fuels, Inc., 523 So. 2d 983, 1988 Miss. LEXIS 172 (Miss. 1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       The rule which prevents one tenant in common from purchasing an outstanding title to the common property and setting it up against his cotenant is founded upon a confidential relation which is presumed to exist between them, and has no application where the circumstances surrounding them negative any such relation, and show that they, though in law tenants in common, are not such in fact, and are asserting hostile claims against each other with reference to the common property. Bayless v. Alexander, 245 So. 2d 17, 1971 Miss. LEXIS 1349 (Miss. 1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a will provided that two legatees were to take the dividends from certain bank stock for life with the power to sell stock upon agreement among themselves, the remainder to go to two named remaindermen, the relationship created was that of tenancy in common between the legatees, so that upon the death of one legatee his interest would pass to the remaindermen.

       Where a trustee, who was the owner of a one-half interest in land, and a woman, who was the record owner of a one-half interest of the surface and three-tenths of the minerals in the land, were tenants in common, upon the conveyance by the trustee to a third person of his one-half interest, the third person became a tenant in common with the woman. Anderson v. Boyd, 229 Miss. 596, 91 So. 2d 537, 1956 Miss. LEXIS 642 (Miss. 1956).

       A deed conveying property to a husband and wife specifically created a joint tenancy, where it was conveyed to them “as joint tenants, not as tenants in common, but with the rights of survivorship in each upon death of either.” Ayers v. Petro, 417 So. 2d 912, 1982 Miss. LEXIS 2087 (Miss. 1982).

      <p>
       Because the debtors owned their homestead as tenants by the entirety, any non-exempt equity in the debtors’ homestead could be administered only to the extent of the joint claims against the debtors. In re Pace, 521 B.R. 124, 2014 Bankr. LEXIS 4341 (Bankr. N.D. Miss. 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       Plaintiffs contended and defendant agreed that because defendant failed to have both plaintiffs, as tenants by the entirety, execute the construction contract, the lien did not attach to the property as a means of securing the debt owed only by one plaintiff to defendant, but the other plaintiff’s alleged knowledge and consent to work being done on property she owned might amount to authorization, regardless of whether or not she was a signatory to the contract, and summary judgment was inappropriate at this stage. Ward v. McCammon (In re Ward), 2014 Bankr. LEXIS 1200 (Bankr. N.D. Miss. Mar. 28, 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       Property was held by plaintiffs as tenants by the entirety, and by virtue of each spouse possessing an undivided interest in the entire estate, the property was not subject to unilateral action of less than all the owners. Ward v. McCammon (In re Ward), 2014 Bankr. LEXIS 1200 (Bankr. N.D. Miss. Mar. 28, 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chapter 13 debtor who owned real property with her husband as a tenant by the entireties, which she claimed as her homestead, was allowed under 11 U.S.C.S. § 522(b)(3)(B) to exempt the full value of the property from unsecured creditors’ claims for debts she incurred separately, when her husband did not join her in filing bankruptcy. Mississippi was a common law state, the common law of Mississippi constituted “applicable nonbankruptcy law” under § 522(b)(3)(B), and her homestead was exempt under Mississippi law from any process which could arise from the claims at issue. In re Dixon, 2011 Bankr. LEXIS 5680 (Bankr. S.D. Miss. Mar. 31, 2011).
      </p>
      <p>
       Separate deeds may be used to sever estate in the entirety under narrow range of circumstances whereby both spouses act in concert pursuant to common purpose and without derogation of other’s right of survivorship. Thus, separate deeds could be used by husband and wife to sever estate in the entirety where both deeds were executed, acknowledged and recorded at same time and place, and ownership arrangement regarding property was clearly division of marital property in anticipation of spouses’ impending divorce. Newton v. Long, 588 So. 2d 192 (1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       A tenancy by the entirety with right of survivorship was not converted to a tenancy in common by divorce of the parties; since a tenancy by the entirety is a joint tenancy with a right of survivorship plus the marital relation, even if the divorce terminated the tenancy by the entirety, the parties remained joint tenants with the right of survivorship and, upon the wife’s death, the property became the husband’s property. Shepherd v. Shepherd, 336 So. 2d 497, 1976 Miss. LEXIS 1510 (Miss. 1976).
      </p>
      <p>
       A tenancy by the entireties in real property cannot be severed or destroyed by the act of one of the tenants. Cuevas v. Cuevas, 191 So. 2d 843, 1966 Miss. LEXIS 1227 (Miss. 1966).

       A deed in which a widower deeded land to himself and to the niece of his deceased wife as an “estate in the entirety with full rights of survivorship and not as tenants in common” was, under other Mississippi decisions and under the law generally, sufficient to vest the entire title to the property in the niece after the widower’s death. Welborn v. Henry, 252 So. 2d 779, 1971 Miss. LEXIS 1198 (Miss. 1971).

      <p>
       Where a cotenant’s widow in possession claimed property to the exclusion of the other cotenants for more than 10 years after the death of her husband, who had claimed the entirety of the property, and during such period the widow had received all benefits flowing from the land and had made all expenditures without accounting to anyone, there was the equivalent of an ouster of the other cotenants and she had clear full title by adverse possession, the fiduciary relationship usually presumed to exist between cotenants having no application here; since the circumstances surrounding the widow’s acquisition of title completely negated any such relation to the extent that it was the equivalent of an ouster of the other cotenants. Bayless v. Alexander, 245 So. 2d 17, 1971 Miss. LEXIS 1349 (Miss. 1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       In an action brought by cotenants to confirm and establish their title to an undivided interest as cotenants in certain land as against claims of another cotenant, who had purchased a tax title to the property, the purchasing cotenant could not claim adverse possession as against her cotenants where there was no ouster of the cotenants such as would give them notice that her claim was adverse to their interest. Gavin v. Hosey, 230 So. 2d 570, 1970 Miss. LEXIS 1556 (Miss. 1970).
      </p>
      <p>
       The purchase of an outstanding tax title to the common property by one cotenant inures to the benefit of all cotenants, the reason being the confidential relationship or position of trust presumed to exist between cotenants. Gavin v. Hosey, 230 So. 2d 570, 1970 Miss. LEXIS 1556 (Miss. 1970).

       Where a grant or devise is made to one and his children, or issue, or the children of issue of his body, or equivalent words, and the named person has no child at the effective date of the instrument, the named person takes a fee simple title to the property conveyed or devised, unless the instrument, by express words or necessary implication, shows a clear intent to create a life estate in the named person, remainder to afterborn children or issue. Ewing v. Ewing, 198 Miss. 304, 22 So. 2d 225, 1945 Miss. LEXIS 198 (Miss. 1945).
      </p>

       A conveyance of realty, effective immediately, to the grantors’ daughter, “and the children of her body,” reserving a life estate to one of the grantors, does not, where there are no children in being on the effective date of the grant, give the daughter’s children an interest as tenants in common or joint tenants with their mother.

       Where a will devised one-half of a parcel of land to the testator’s son for life, and then to the heirs of the body of the son in fee simple, the testator intended to devise a life estate to the son, with remainder after his death to the heirs of his body in fee simple, should he have such heirs, and, upon the son dying without heirs, the devise lapsed and reverted to the heirs of the testator.

       The purpose of this section is to make the test whether the person in question left issue surviving him at the time of his death or had issue born to him within ten months thereafter, instead of whether or not he may have at any time subsequent to the execution of a will in his favor have had issue which predeceased such a beneficiary.

       This section applies to the situation at common law where there would be construed to exist an indefinite failure of issue and thus a void fee tail estate. White v. Inman, 212 Miss. 237, 54 So. 2d 375, 1951 Miss. LEXIS 447 (Miss. 1951).

       Quitclaim deed executed to each other by four devisees of tract of land, each devisee having defeasible fee simple title, by which tract was divided into four parcels and each devisee took possession of his or her allotted parcel, served to separate use and income of divided parcels but could not confer upon respective grantees fee simple title to parcels as division was made subject to, and could not change, terms of will under which devisees took defeasible fee simple title. Crump v. Phelps, 207 Miss. 682, 43 So. 2d 105, 1949 Miss. LEXIS 379 (Miss. 1949).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defeasible fee simple title is vested in named devisees under will providing trust for benefit of four named devisees and survivor or survivors of them and issue of deceased devisees subject to restriction that in event of death of devisee having no issue, devisee’s share is to be equally divided between surviving devisees and issue of those who may have died, issue to take by representation interest of deceased parent, and this interpretation of will is supported by this section against contention that executory limitation over could not become effective unless death of one of children of testatrix occurred prior to her death. Crump v. Phelps, 207 Miss. 682, 43 So. 2d 105, 1949 Miss. LEXIS 379 (Miss. 1949).

       Statute providing that contingent limitation in will depending on the dying of any person without issue, or issue of the body, or without children, shall be interpreted as limitation to take effect when such person shall die not having such heir, or issue, or child, has reference to death of devisee or legatee, and in absence of contrary intention expressly declared on face of will, requires that the limitation over be interpreted as taking effect on death of one of devisees without issue at any time. Hanie v. Grissom, 178 Miss. 108, 172 So. 500, 1937 Miss. LEXIS 189 (Miss. 1937).
      </p>
      <p>
       Limitation over contained in provision in will that if any of children to whom testatrix left certain realty should die without children, his or her share in realty should go equally to testatrix’ children that were living, was intended to take effect on death of child without issue at any time, whether before or after death of testatrix, and hence children took fee defeasible on their deaths without issue, leaving one or more of the other children surviving them. Hanie v. Grissom, 178 Miss. 108, 172 So. 500, 1937 Miss. LEXIS 189 (Miss. 1937).
      </p>
      <p>
       Will executed in 1929 by testatrix dying in 1929, and providing that if any of children to whom testatrix left certain realty should die without children, his or her share in such realty should go equally to testatrix’ children that were living, held not violative of rule against perpetuities or the two-donee statute, as respects interest passing on death of one child in 1933 without issue. Hanie v. Grissom, 178 Miss. 108, 172 So. 500, 1937 Miss. LEXIS 189 (Miss. 1937).
      </p>

       As to share given directly to testator’s daughter, two-donee statute as it read in 1871 did not affect right of testator’s sisters and brothers nor their descendants from taking as purchasers under will. Darrow v. Moore, 163 Miss. 705, 142 So. 447, 1932 Miss. LEXIS 85 (Miss. 1932).
      </p>
      <p>
       Devise to two daughters providing that in case of daughters predeceasing testatrix their children to inherit each daughter’s share, or if one died without children whole estate to go to other, or if both died without children estate to go over, contingency provided against was death of daughters before testatrix and upon their survival of testatrix they took a fee simple. Nations v. Colonial & United States Mortg. Co., 115 Miss. 741, 76 So. 642, 1917 Miss. LEXIS 260 (Miss. 1917).
      </p>
      <p>
       The statute will not be construed to add the words “then living” to a limitation to the descendants of the donee of a life interest. Caldwell v. Willis, 57 Miss. 555, 1880 Miss. LEXIS 4 (Miss. 1880), disapproved, Carter v. Berry, 243 Miss. 356, 140 So. 2d 843 (Miss.).

       In a devise to the son for life, and, after his death, to his lineal descendants, to the remotest posterity, and, in case of failure of lineal descendants, to the heirs of the devisor, the limitation over is void. Powell v. Brandon, 24 Miss. 343, 1852 Miss. LEXIS 56 (Miss. 1852).
      </p>

       In a devise to the daughter and the heirs of her body, but, if she die without issue, then to the children of the devisor alive at her death, the limitation over is valid. Kirby v. Calhoun, 16 Miss. 462, 1847 Miss. LEXIS 43 (Miss. 1847).

       A will devising testatrix’s real estate equally to a son and two daughters in common, and providing that if one of the devisees should die without leaving bodily heirs his or her share should go to the survivors, or if two of them should die without bodily heirs the land should go to the survivor, and that if either of the three devisees should die leaving bodily heirs, the heirs were to take the deceased parent’s share, violated the former “two donees” provision of this section (Code 1892, § 2436) permitting a devise of lands to a succession of donees then living not exceeding two and to the heirs of the body of the remainderman, and, in default thereof, to the right heirs of the donor, in fee simple, so that under the will the three devisees named as first takers took a determinable fee simple, subject to be defeated as to each share by the death of the devisee without bodily heirs, and upon the death of the two devisees named as first takers the entire estate finally vested in fee simple in the remaining devisee. Carter v. Sunray Mid-Continent Oil Co., 231 Miss. 8, 94 So. 2d 624, 1957 Miss. LEXIS 488 (Miss. 1957).
      </p>
      <p>
       Under a conveyance to the grantors’ daughter “and the children of her body,” reserving a life estate to one of the grantors, the daughter, having no children at the time of the conveyance, takes a fee tail, which by this section [Code 1942, § 838] is converted into a fee simple. Ewing v. Ewing, 198 Miss. 304, 22 So. 2d 225, 1945 Miss. LEXIS 198 (Miss. 1945).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a grant or devise is made to one and his children, or issue, or the children or issue of his body, or equivalent words, and the named person has no child at the effective date of the instrument, the named person takes a fee simple title to the property conveyed or devised, unless the instrument, by express words or necessary implication, shows a clear intent to create a life estate in the named person, remainder to after-born children or issue. Ewing v. Ewing, 198 Miss. 304, 22 So. 2d 225, 1945 Miss. LEXIS 198 (Miss. 1945).
      </p>
      <p>
       An intent on the part of the grantors of realty to an only daughter “and the children of her body,” to convey a life estate to the daughter with remainder to her children may not be inferred where, at the time of the conveyance, which was in consideration of love and affection, the daughter was only 16 years of age and unmarried, so that it was problematical whether she would ever have children. Ewing v. Ewing, 198 Miss. 304, 22 So. 2d 225, 1945 Miss. LEXIS 198 (Miss. 1945).

      <p>
       Where a will devised one-half of a parcel of land to the testator’s son for life, and then to the heirs of the body of the son in fee simple, the testator intended to devise a life estate to the son, with remainder after his death to the heirs of his body in fee simple, should he have such heirs, and, upon the son dying without heirs, the devise lapsed and reverted to the heirs of the testator. Boxley v. Jackson, 191 Miss. 134, 2 So. 2d 160, 1941 Miss. LEXIS 125 (Miss. 1941).
      </p>
      <p>
       A former enactment of this statute; while permitting contingent ultimate limitations to the right heirs of the donor either generally or specifically, was construed as not changing the common law rule that a conveyance to one’s own right heirs, like a deed without a grantee is void, and that when right heirs are designated as a class as such limitees, they take by descent and not by purchase, but when they are named specifically as individuals, they take by purchase and not by descent. West Tennessee Co. v. Townes, 52 F.2d 764, 1931 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1696 (D. Miss. 1931).

      <p>
       Where death of persons is dealt with as uncertain event it is presumed that death at a particular time or under particular circumstances is meant, and where circumstances do not appear it is presumed death is to occur prior to death of devisee before vesting in him of the property in possession; holding otherwise would render devise void for uncertainty. Bibby v. Broome, 116 Miss. 70, 76 So. 835, 1917 Miss. LEXIS 299 (Miss. 1917).

       Bequest for use of sons for life, then each father’s part to his children, to be theirs when they reach 21 years, providing if any died before age or condition fulfilled without brothers or sisters his share should go to surviving grandchildren of testatrix of proper age on condition fulfilled, created an executory devise and not an “estate tail.” Thomas v. Thomas, 97 Miss. 697, 53 So. 630, 1910 Miss. LEXIS 313 (Miss. 1910).

       Where there was a devise to wife and children for their natural lives, and to children and heirs of their bodies if there should be any at the time of their death, and if not, to revert to the estate in gross and be again divided between testator’s wife and children and to their heirs, “they” to take a life estate only, and the grandchildren were to take only such share as their deceased parent would have taken, the word “they” should be construed to refer to children of the testator and not to any surviving grandchild, in view of the dominant purpose of the will to vest a life estate in the testator’s wife and children and remainder in fee to his grandchildren. Davenport v. Collins, 96 Miss. 716, 51 So. 449, 1910 Miss. LEXIS 143 (Miss. 1910).

       Mississippi follows the “wait and see” doctrine with respect to the rule against perpetuities under which the future interest in question is held valid if the required contingency actually happens during the perpetuities period, even though the interest was not good at its creation because it was possible for the required contingency to happen outside the perpetuities period.

       This section was inapplicable to a case where the court was called upon to determine whether the rule against perpetuities was violated by the provisions of a will leaving the bulk of testator’s estate in trust which was to terminate when testator’s youngest grandchild (whether living at the time of the execution of the will or thereafter born) became 25 years of age, but further providing that in no event should the trust continue for a longer period than 35 years from the date of the will. 243 Miss. 356, 140 So. 2d 843.

       A residuary bequest to the testator’s son and grandchildren in equal shares, naming the five grandchildren who were alive at the time of execution, constituted a class bequest to all of the grandchildren rather than an individual bequest to each of the named grandchildren, where the evidence revealed that the testator was not aware that a sixth grandchild had been conceived, and that he was no less fond of the sixth grandchild than of the other five.

       This section had no application to the validity of a gas and oil lease, under which any interest acquired by the lessee was conveyed to him to take effect in praesenti, and by which provision was made for renewal as long as gas and oil should be produced in paying quantities, it was stipulated that if no well should be commenced before a specified date the lease would terminate, unless the lessee by such date should tender the lessor the sum of $100, which payment should operate as a renewal for twelve months, and that further deferments for like periods might be procured by similar payments, but which lease contained no limitation to postpone the vesting of the interest acquired until a future date, or that could be said to result in a restraint against alienation either to the mineral rights or to the fee itself.

       A will devising real property to the testator’s wife “to be hers during her lifetime, and to use the same for her personal comfort and benefit, as she may see fit and proper, without hindrance or trouble from anyone,” creates only a life estate in the widow and does not, at her discretion, vest her with power to sell the fee.

       The objection that statutory provision permitting lease of sixteenth section lands for oil, gas and mineral exploration and development, and for entry upon such lands for such purposes, was unconstitutional because the lease might under its terms remain in force so long as oil and gas should be produced from the land and therefore longer than the 25 years prescribed by a constitutional provision, is obviated by the statute providing that conveyances purporting to convey or pass a greater estate than the grantor might lawfully convey or pass, shall operate and pass such a right or estate as the grantor might lawfully convey.

     <p>
      Resident aliens may acquire and hold land, and may dispose of it and transmit it by descent, as citizens of the state may. Except as otherwise provided in this section, nonresident aliens shall not hereafter acquire or hold land, but a nonresident alien may have or take a lien on land to secure a debt, and at any sale thereof to enforce payment of the debt may purchase the same, and thereafter hold it, not longer than twenty (20) years, with full power during said time to sell the land, in fee, to a citizen; or he may retain it by becoming a citizen within that time. All land held or acquired contrary to this section shall escheat to the state; but a title to real estate in the name of a citizen of the United States, or a person who has declared his intention of becoming a citizen, whether resident or nonresident, if he be a purchaser or holder, shall not be forfeited or escheated by reason of the alienage of any former owner or other person.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any person who was or is a citizen of the United States and became or becomes an alien by reason of marriage to a citizen of a foreign country, may hereafter inherit, or if he or she heretofore inherited or acquired or hereafter inherits, may hold, own, transmit by descent or transfer land free from any escheat to the State of Mississippi, if said land has not heretofore escheated by final valid order or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction.
     </p>
     <p>
      Nonresident aliens who are citizens of Syria or the Lebanese Republic may inherit property from citizens or residents of the State of Mississippi.
     </p>
     <p>
      Nonresident aliens may acquire and hold not to exceed three hundred twenty (320) acres of land in this state for the purpose of industrial development thereon. In addition, any nonresident alien may acquire and hold not to exceed five (5) acres of land for residential purposes. The nonresident alien may dispose of any such land, but if any land acquired for industrial development ceases to be used for industrial development while owned by a nonresident alien, it shall escheat to the state. The limitation set forth in this paragraph shall not apply to corporations in which the stock thereof is partially or wholly owned by nonresident aliens.

     <p>
      In all cases where a board of trustees of any school district, governing authorities of any municipality or board of supervisors of any county in the State of Mississippi has heretofore attempted to convey or to obtain title to real property or any interest therein and thereafter any question of title arises with reference to the procedure of conveyance, description of the property attempted to be conveyed or obtained or other matters connected therewith, and the governing authority of said school district, municipality or county determines by order entered on its minutes that the said political subdivision is asserting no further claim of title, that at the time of said attempted conveyance or disposition of said property, if property was conveyed or disposed of by the political subdivision, the said political subdivision did then receive the fair and reasonable market value of said property, and that a period of at least five (5) years has elapsed from the date of the said original attempted conveyance or disposition or obtaining of title of said property; the said board of trustees of said school district, governing authorities of said municipality or board of supervisors of said county, as the case may be, is thereupon hereby authorized, in its discretion, to execute quitclaim deeds and disclaimers of title on behalf of said political subdivision, after which any right or claim of said political subdivision in and to said realty shall be cut off and not thereafter brought into issue. Any such quitclaim deed or disclaimer of title heretofore executed by or on behalf of said political subdivision in accordance with the foregoing shall likewise be valid if executed in accordance with the provisions hereof.

      Conveyances by masters, commissioners, sheriffs, and constables for lands sold by virtue of any decree or judgment of any court in this state, shall be good and effectual for passing all the interest the defendant had in the lands to the purchaser thereof, but shall not prejudice the rights of other claimants. In case any master, commissioner, sheriff, or other officer should, for any cause whatever, fail or omit to make such conveyance, without good cause for the omission or failure, during his continuance in office, the court which rendered the judgment or decree may, on petition for that purpose, order the successor of such master, commissioner, sheriff, or other officer, to make a proper conveyance to the purchaser; and all conveyances made by masters, commissioners, sheriffs, or other officers, shall be acknowledged or proved and recorded as other conveyances. In case any tax collector should fail to make a conveyance for land sold by him for taxes of any kind during his continuance in office, the board of supervisors of the proper county, on petition for that purpose and proof of the purchase and payment of the money, may order the successor of such tax collector to make a conveyance to the purchaser.

       § 89-1-29.
    Spouse’s role in conveying homestead; incompetent spouse; limited power of attorney in conveyance of homestead.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      A conveyance, mortgage, deed of trust or other incumbrance upon a homestead exempted from execution shall not be valid or binding unless signed by the spouse of the owner if the owner is married and living with the spouse or by an attorney in fact for the spouse. But where the spouse of the owner of the homestead exempted from execution has been adjudicated incompetent, then the owner of the homestead may file a petition in the chancery court and allege in the petition the incompetence of the spouse and the adjudication of incompetency of the spouse and the facts of the case. The summons for the spouse who has been adjudicated incompetent shall be issued and be served in the same manner as process is served in other cases on persons who are incompetent. The court shall hear the case in vacation or in termtime as in other cases, and if the court finds the spouse to be incompetent and the owner entitled to relief, the court by decree shall authorize and empower the owner to execute a conveyance, mortgage, deed of trust or other incumbrance upon the homestead without the signature of the spouse. However, no mortgage or deed of trust executed in favor of the Farmers Home Administration at the time of the purchase of real estate to secure the payment of the money used to purchase the real estate shall be invalid because it is not signed by the spouse of the owner. All powers of attorney authorizing any conveyance, mortgage, deed of trust or other incumbrance upon a homestead shall designate an attorney in fact other than the spouse and shall comply with the provisions of Chapter 3 of Title 87.

       A conveyance of the homestead by the husband in which the wife does not join is not valid or binding if he is living with his wife or, even if he is not living with her, if at the time of the execution thereof the husband was non compos mentis touching all matters connected with and all duties and obligations owing to her.

       The owner of a homestead has no vested right in the statute prescribing the mode of the alienation; and the law requiring the wife to join in the conveyance by the husband of his homestead applies to all conveyances hereafter made by him, although he owned the land in fee in his own right prior to the passage of the statute.

       In light of its dicta finding much force in the argument that the statute does not require a joint deed of husband and wife, the Mississippi Supreme Court would likely hold that a valid deed of trust was created when spouses contemporaneously signed separate but identical deeds of trust to their homestead because the parties clearly intended to create a valid deed of trust as part of one global transaction.

       Facts were undisputed that the proceeds of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s (HUD) subordinate loan were applied to cure the delinquent arrearage that had accrued on the primary loan; the court, however, found that the payment of the proceeds to cure the primary note arrearage did not permit the subordinate deed of trust to become a purchase money security interest. Since the deed of trust securing HUD’s arrearage payment was not a purchase money security interest and since it was not signed by the debtor’s spouse, the deed of trust was invalid.

       Spouse’s failure to sign deed of trust on homestead property given by husband as security for loan rendered deed of trust null and void as matter of law, and thus, foreclosure sale pursuant to deed of trust had to be set aside and title to property vested in owner’s son who received has interest in property via laws of descent and distribution.

       Bank was entitled to foreclose a deed of trust against homestead property for advances made to the husband, acting alone and without wife’s knowledge, which were additional to the original indebtedness secured by the deed of trust contract where the contract contained a “dragnet clause” which clearly and unambiguously provided that its purpose was to “secure all loans and advances which Beneficiary has made or may hereafter make to the Grantor, or any of them”; nor did the fact that the husband pledged certain cattle as additional security for the advances, which were missing when the bank sought to replevy them, amount to a waiver on the part of the bank of the security granted it by the deed of trust.

       The test whether the husband abandoned any homestead rights under statutes invalidating conveyance of the homestead is whether the husband had abandoned the conjugal relation with his wife and the occupancy of the property, but the wrongful ouster of the spouse does not constitute a wilful abandonment; and if a spouse voluntarily separates from the other and abandons the intention of living with him or her through no fault of the latter, he or she has abandoned any homestead rights.

       Where the wife’s leaving her invalid husband in need of personal attention because of his bringing his widowed sister and her child to live with him and care for him while the wife was working, was without legal justification under the circumstances, the wife lost her right to veto his conveyance of the homestead, notwithstanding she may have intended to return to the homestead if and when her sister-in-law moved therefrom.

Hence, the vendee in a deed from a husband living with his wife which she did not sign, purporting to convey his homestead, cannot maintain ejectment for the lands after the death of the husband against those who claim under his heirs.

       An exclusive real estate listing contract served to make the real estate agent the special agent of the owner, with limited power to find a purchaser ready, willing, and able to buy the property on terms and conditions fixed by the appellee; but the execution of such a contract did not serve to permit the agent to acquire any legal interest in the property placed in his hands for sale, nor did the contract create any incumbrance upon the property involved.

       In a case in which the father conveyed land by warranty deed to his daughter, reserving unto himself a life estate, but he attempted to reconvey one acre of the same tract to another person later, the chancellor correctly found that the father had reserved a life estate and that he could have conveyed his reserved life estate, but that reading
   the conveyance as retaining the right to reconvey title in fee simple was repugnant to the granting clause in the conveyance to his daughter as the father conveyed and warranted the property to his daughter; pursuant to the deed, the daughter acquired ownership of the property upon delivery of the deed; and the father could not subsequently convey to another person property he no longer owned.

       <p>
   Trial court erred in refusing to require the sellers to correct defects in title and convey the property to the buyer because the real estate contract required the sellers to convey by warranty deed and to cure defects, but they ignored their obligations under contract and pursued a better deal with a third party, which constituted a material breach of the contract and of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t89c01s89-1-33" target="_self">89-1-33</a></cite>, the warranty deed, absent other restrictive language, would have the effect of embracing all five covenants known to the common law, which were seizin, power to sell, freedom from encumbrances, quiet enjoyment and warranty of title.

       The wording of a deed which provided that “we hereby bargain, sell, convey and warrant to the Trustees of Oakgrove Consolidated High School and their successors the following described land. . . ” could only connote a conveyance absolute and the grantors’ children would not be heard some 50 years later to say that the grantors’ intent was something entirely different from what was expressed in the plain and simple legalese in the recorded instrument of conveyance.

       Estoppel by deed bars a party from asserting a subsequently acquired title in derogation of his grant. Chevron Oil Co. v. Clark, 291 F. Supp. 552, 1968 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12565 (S.D. Miss. 1968), aff'd in part and rev'd in part, 432 F.2d 280, 1970 U.S. App. LEXIS 7176 (5th Cir. Miss. 1970).

       Where at the time of executing a deed quitclaiming all his right, title and interest in and to all minerals in certain described lands, the grantor had no interest therein, and nothing in the quitclaim deed indicated any intention on the grantor’s part to convey any interest that he might subsequently acquire, the grantor was not estopped to assert his after-acquired title, and such after-acquired title did not enure to the benefit of the grantee in the quitclaim deed and his successive grantees. McLaurin v. Royalties, Inc., 231 Miss. 240, 95 So. 2d 105, 1957 Miss. LEXIS 510 (Miss. 1957).
      </p>

       The estoppel created by this section [Code 1942, § 846] is coextensive only with the estate, right or interest which the conveyance purports to convey. McLaurin v. Royalties, Inc., 231 Miss. 240, 95 So. 2d 105, 1957 Miss. LEXIS 510 (Miss. 1957).
      </p>
      <p>
       Grantee in quitclaim deed acquires such title, if any, as may be then vested in grantors, but when grantors have no title when they execute deed and do not afterwards acquire any title, grantee acquires nothing by virtue of this deed and is not estopped to reply upon perfect title acquired by him elsewhere.

       The rule that a grantor and all persons in privity with him are estopped from ever afterwards denying that, at the time his deed of conveyance was executed, he was seized of the property which his deed purported to convey, and that mortgages and deeds of trust are within this rule, has been extended by this statute to quitclaim deeds.

       Judgment on the pleadings in favor of an assignee was proper because there was no set of facts that a mortgagor could prove that would entitle him to the surplus that resulted from a foreclosure sale since his conveyances divested him of any interests or rights referenced in the deed of trust; the quitclaim deed and prior conveyances divested the mortgagee of his rights and interests in the property because he manifested his intent to transfer all his right, title, and interest in the property. Hinton v. Rolison, 175 So.3d 1281, 2015 Miss. LEXIS 519 (Miss. 2015).
      </p>
      <p>
       A quitclaim deed which conveyed a 40-acre tract of land to the grantee but retained one half of all mineral rights for the grantor transferred to the grantee only the surface land where the grantor had previously conveyed an undivided one-half interest in the minerals to a third party. However, where the devisees of the grantor admitted that it had been intended by the grantor that the grantee should have a one-quarter interest in the minerals, the quitclaim deed would be interpreted to have conveyed to the grantee such interest. Rosenbaum v. McCaskey, 386 So. 2d 387, 1980 Miss. LEXIS 2036 (Miss. 1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       The doctrine of mutual mistake of fact was applicable and quitclaim deeds previously executed were cancelled and set aside where the deeds had been executed under the mistaken belief, shared by all parties, that the prior owner of the property had died intestate, whereas he had in fact died testate. Greer v. Higgins, 338 So. 2d 1233, 1976 Miss. LEXIS 1655 (Miss. 1976).

       Where the plaintiff conveyed by quitclaim deed to the defendant an undivided one-half interest in the property which the plaintiff would inherit from the deceased, and at the same time the defendant conveyed to the plaintiff by quitclaim deed an undivided one-half interest of the defendant, and thereafter it was revealed that the decedent had devised and bequeathed all of his property to the plaintiff, the plaintiff became the owner of an undivided three-fourths interest in the estate, including realty and personalty, and the defendant became vested with an undivided one-fourth interest in such estate. Jackson v. Rutledge, 231 So. 2d 803, 1970 Miss. LEXIS 1613 (Miss. 1970).

       Where the mortgagor purchases from the state the land which was sold to the state for the nonpayment of the taxes and not redeemed, his action amounts merely to redemption from the tax sale and inures to the benefit of the mortgagee.

       Where grantee was fully aware of outstanding interest in the land in question at time of grantor’s conveyance of her interest therein by quitclaim deed, grantor’s subsequent acquisition of such outstanding interest on behalf of, and as mere conduit of title for, third person did not place at any disadvantage either the grantee or the beneficiaries under his will and such after-acquired title did not inure to their benefit. Crooker v. Hollingsworth, 210 Miss. 636, 46 So. 2d 541, 1950 Miss. LEXIS 355 (Miss. 1950).
      </p>
      <p>
       When a person attempts to convey title to something that he does not in fact own, and afterwards obtains good title to the property or interest thus conveyed, such subsequent acquisition will automatically inure to benefit of his prior vendees.

      <p>
       Quitclaim deed executed to each other by four devisees of tract of land, each devisee having defeasible fee simple title, by which tract was divided into four parcels and each devisee took possession of his or her allotted parcel, served to separate use and income of divided parcels but could not confer upon respective grantees fee simple title to parcels as division was made subject to, and could not change, terms of will under which devisees took defeasible fee simple title.

       The wording of a deed which provided that “we hereby bargain, sell, convey and warrant to the Trustees of Oakgrove Consolidated High School and their successors the following described land. . . ” could only connote a conveyance absolute and the grantors’ children would not be heard some 50 years later to say that the grantors’ intent was something entirely different from what was expressed in the plain and simple legalese in the recorded instrument of conveyance. Garraway v. Yonce, 549 So. 2d 1341, 1989 Miss. LEXIS 453 (Miss. 1989).

       Deed purporting to “grant, bargain, sell and convey” to a railroad company, held to convey fee and not a mere easement. Alabama & V. R. Co. v. Mashburn, 235 Miss. 346, 109 So. 2d 533, 1959 Miss. LEXIS 435 (Miss. 1959).
      </p>
      <p>
       The use of the words, “grant, bargain and sell” in a conveyance does not imply a warranty that the grantor was seized of a fee simple estate, but only of some estate of freehold; That the grantor had only a life estate is not a breach of such implied covenant. Cunningham v. Dillard, 71 Miss. 61, 13 So. 882, 1893 Miss. LEXIS 144 (Miss. 1893).
      </p>
      <p>
       Such implied covenant cannot be extended by implication because the habendum clause of the deed is “to have and to hold the above described property to the grantee, his heirs and assigns thereafter in fee simple against the claims of any and all persons whatsoever.” Cunningham v. Dillard, 71 Miss. 61, 13 So. 882, 1893 Miss. LEXIS 144 (Miss. 1893).

       If a secured creditor is authorized to foreclose by power of sale, after the debtor’s default and upon compliance with the deed of trust or other instrument, the secured creditor may sell any or all of the real estate that is subject to the security interest in its then condition or after any reasonable rehabilitation or preparation for sale. Every aspect of the sale, including the method, advertising, time, place and terms, must be commercially reasonable; this is an objective standard. Wansley v.

       Where a grantee retains title to land and holds it for the benefit of another in order to secure a loan made by the grantee, the conveyance is a mortgage. The mortgage is evidenced by a deed absolute and the grantee is entitled to retain title until payment of the claim for which it is held for security. La Barre v. Gold, 520 So. 2d 1327, 1987 Miss.

       After condition broken, the heirs of the grantor in a deed of trust did not have right of possession, with title passed on default to the trustee, as against either the trustee or the purchaser who succeeded to the rights of the mortgagee in possession at a void foreclosure sale, until the indebtedness was tendered or paid; and without such right of possession, essential to tenancy in common, a partition suit could not be maintained by such heirs.

       Judgment on the pleadings in favor of an assignee was proper because there was no set of facts that a mortgagor could prove that would entitle him to the surplus that resulted from a foreclosure sale since his conveyances divested him of any interests or rights referenced in the deed of trust; the quitclaim deed and prior conveyances divested the mortgagee of his rights and interests in the property because he manifested his intent to transfer all his right, title, and interest in the property.

       A bondholder under a deed of trust became an equitable assignee, at least pro tanto of the lien and indebtedness to the extent of his holdings, when he purchased the land in question after foreclosure of the deed of trust, notwithstanding that such sale was void because minor devisees of such land were not served with process in the foreclosure proceedings in the manner required by statute; and he succeeded to the rank of a mortgagee in possession from the date of confirmation of the sale, and with the right to have such indebtedness paid or tendered as a condition precedent to the right of the minor devisees, to enter possession of their claimed interests in such land under partition.

       Mortgagee who assigned mortgage debt and security and did not transfer to assignee previously accrued cause of action for conversion of mortgaged property waived such cause of action, since mortgagee’s interest in mortgaged property converted was based upon the mortgage and limited by debt secured and was lost by assignment.

       The wording of a deed which provided that “we hereby bargain, sell, convey and warrant to the Trustees of Oakgrove Consolidated High School and their successors the following described land. . . ” could only connote a conveyance absolute and the grantors’ children would not be heard some 50 years later to say that the grantors’ intent was something entirely different from what was expressed in the plain and simple legalese in the recorded instrument of conveyance.

       A conveyance by warranty deed of property for $400 which was capable of providing an annual income of $260, without any improvements having been added, and was valued at from $1650 to $2000, was grossly inadequate and was rescinded as constituting a mortgage rather than a sale.

       A quitclaim deed executed by the former owner of tax-forfeited land of a quit-claim deed to the patents issued to him from the state, executed under an alleged agreement of the grantee to reconvey on payment by such former owner of the money expended for the patents, could not be considered a mortgage or security for the money, where the grantee thereunder went into possession by the mandate of the unlawful entry and detainer course, and the grantor was therefore not in a position of a mortgagor in possession.

       This section [Code 1942, § 272] does not apply to a deed made by the vendors of land to one who paid the purchase price thereof on behalf of another, holding such title as security for the repayment thereof, under a parol agreement to convey it to such other person upon payment of the purchase price, where the real purchaser remained in possession.

       Deed acted only as debt-securing mortgage and parol evidence concerning deed was admissible to show that it had been intended for security, and not as conveyance, where grantee in deed stated on numerous occasions that deed was debt-securing mortgage, and that grantor owed him, not bank; additionally, deed at issue was one of several transactions where individuals secured loans after executing deeds to same individual who was grantee in instant case, and in those cases upon repayment, individual would reconvey property; there was also testimony that grantor had continued to express ownership interest in property until time of his death, speaking to his children about land and timber.

   Notwithstanding the provisions of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t89c01s89-1-47" target="_self">89-1-47</a></cite>, parole evidence could be introduced to prove that a deed, absolute on its face, was intended as a mortgage, where the grantor retained possession of the property.

      <p>
       After execution of a deed by a grantor to grantee, the grantee was presumed to be in possession of the undivided one-fourth interest in land which he had purchased by virtue of the deed, and the burden of proof was on those who sought to introduce parol proof to show that the grantor in the deed remained in possession after execution thereof.

       Even if evidence concerning possession of property had shown that a grantor remained in possession of part of land after execution of the deed to grantee, appellants would not have been entitled to have the deed adjudged to be a mortgage where the evidence was insufficient to prove that the deed was intended as a mortgage.

       In a suit to have an absolute deed declared a mortgage, where grantor retained control over the land and the grantee never assumed possession nor exercised any control over the land and in fact did not know the boundaries of the land, there was sufficient proof under this section [Code 1942, § 272] that the instrument was intended as a mortgage.

       Bank’s mortgage lien against residential property did not have priority over a prior recorded deed of trust against the same property securing a line of credit, since the bank’s payment of the outstanding balance on the line of credit did not cancel the line of credit or the deed of trust, and the deed of trust remained in effect when the term of the line of credit was renewed by agreement. U.S. Bank N.A. v. State Bank & Trust Co., 45 F. Supp. 3d 582, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 95934 (S.D. Miss. 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the assignment was absolute on its face, it gave the bank only a qualified interest in the homeowner’s property. Since the assignment was given as collateral security for the homeseller’s loan, the interest conveyed was commensurate with the debt; hence, when the homeseller paid off his loan to the bank, the bank’s interest in the secured property ceased as of that moment, and the bank’s interest was reinvested in the homeseller to the same extent as it would have been if an actual reassignment from the bank to the homeseller had been executed.

     <p>
      All lands comprising a single tract, and wholly described by the subdivisions of the governmental surveys, sold under mortgages and deeds of trust, shall be sold in the manner provided by Section 111 of the Mississippi Constitution of 1890 for the sale of lands in pursuance of a decree of court, or under execution. All lands sold at public outcry under deeds of trust or other contracts shall be sold in the county in which the land is located, or in the county of the residence of the grantor, or one of the grantors in the trust deed, provided that where the land is situated in two (2) or more counties, the parties may contract for a sale of the whole in any of the counties in which any part of the land lies. Sale of said lands shall be advertised for three (3) consecutive weeks preceding such sale, in a newspaper published in the county, or, if none is so published, in some paper having a general circulation therein, and by posting one notice at the courthouse of the county where the land is situated, for said time, and such notice and advertisement shall disclose the name of the original mortgagor or mortgagors in said deed of trust or other contract. No sale of lands under a deed of trust or mortgage, shall be valid unless such sale shall have been advertised as herein provided for, regardless of any contract to the contrary. An error in the mode of sale such as makes the sale void will not be cured by any statute of limitations, except as to the ten-year statute of adverse possession.

       If a secured creditor is authorized to foreclose by power of sale, after the debtor’s default and upon compliance with the deed of trust or other instrument, the secured creditor may sell any or all of the real estate that is subject to the security interest in its then condition or after any reasonable rehabilitation or preparation for sale. Every aspect of the sale, including the method, advertising, time, place and terms, must be commercially reasonable; this is an objective standard. Wansley v.

       To suggest that debtor could avoid a foreclosure sale because notice was addressed to him rather than his conservator was illogical. The conservator’s duties required him to open debtor’s mail and deal with the contents in an appropriate manner, and, therefore, in this situation, notice to debtor was notice to the conservator; furthermore, the evidence showed that the conservator was living at the property and received correspondence and notices from the creditor and the creditor’s attorney.

       That proof of publication of notice of sale on foreclosure of a deed of trust was attached to the trustee’s deed does not necessarily imply that notice was not posted at the courthouse door, where the trustee’s deed, without reciting details, states that the notice required by law was given. Craft v. Everett, 237 Miss. 360, 115 So. 2d 133, 1959 Miss. LEXIS 479 (Miss. 1959).

      </p>
      <p>
       Requirement of this section [Code 1942, § 888] that notice of sale be posted at the courthouse door is met by the posting of notice on face of stack of pasteboard cartons containing books, about half way down entrance hall of courthouse, in conspicuous place in corridor, not far from door space, where courthouse was being repaired, its doors were down for replacement, and bulletin board, which ordinarily stood nearby, was misplaced, and sheriff and others were using face of stack of cartons for posting of notices.

       Although the power of sale in a trust deed covering lands located in two counties provided that notice of foreclosure sale be given in one of the counties, such provision was prohibited by this section [Code 1942, § 888] which requires that the prescribed notice be given in every county wherein the land is located.

       Where notice of foreclosure sale under a trust deed covering land in different counties was published and posted in only one county and all of the land was sold as an entire tract after offering it for sale in separate lots and parcels, the sale was void, not only as to the land located in the county wherein no notice was given, but in the entirety.

       § 89-1-59.
    Accelerated debt may be reinstated by payment of all default before sale.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Where there is a series of notes or installment payments secured by a deed of trust, mortgage or other lien, and a provision is inserted in such instrument to secure them to the effect that upon a failure to pay any one (1) note or installment, or the interest thereon, or any part thereof, or for failure to pay taxes or insurance premiums on the property described in such instrument and the subject of such lien, that all the debt secured thereby should become due and collectible, and for any such reason the entire indebtedness shall have been put in default or declared due, the debtor, or any interested party, may at any time before a sale be made under the terms and provisions of such instrument, or by virtue of such lien, stop a threatened sale under the powers contained in such instrument or stop any proceeding in any court to enforce such lien by paying the amount of the note or installment then due or past due by its terms, with all accrued costs, attorneys’ fees and trustees’ fees on the amount actually past due by the terms of such instrument or lien, rather than the amount accelerated, and such taxes or insurance premiums due and not paid, with proper interest thereon, if such should have been paid by any interested party to such instrument. Any such payment or payments shall reinstate, according to the terms of such instrument, the amount so accelerated, the same as if such amount not due by its terms had not been accelerated or put in default.

       Bankruptcy courts have recognized that there are essential differences between a contractual mortgage reinstatement and the statutory cure right afforded by 11 U.S.C.S. § 1322(b)(5) of the Bankruptcy Code; regardless, it was undisputed that debtor never cured the default that precipitated acceleration of the Note and, therefore, never had the statutory right to reinstate the Note. Seaberry v. Cenlar FSB (In re Seaberry), — B.R. —, 2019 Bankr. LEXIS 1189 (Bankr. S.D. Miss. Apr. 12, 2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       Mortgagee’s refusal to accept payment after time provided for in work-out agreement, but before foreclosure proceedings were instituted, constituted misconduct such as warranted denial of mortgagee’s request for attorney fees. In re McIntyre, 96 B.R. 65, 1988 Bankr. LEXIS 2313 (Bankr. S.D. Miss. 1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       The holder of a secondary deed of trust has no right to notice of foreclosure, or statutory right of redemption, but may only assert an interest prior to foreclosure by paying the amounts due and subsequently engaging in foreclosure for nonpayment of his secondary deed of trust. Crystal v. Duffy, 493 So. 2d 942, 1986 Miss. LEXIS 2574 (Miss. 1986).

       A contract for the purchase and sale of certain real estate was properly cancelled pursuant to findings that defendant purchasers were in arrears in the monthly installments as well as in taxes and insurance premiums, where purchasers did not take advantage of the statutory procedure for reinstatement of accelerated debts.

       This section [Code 1942, § 892] gave the purchaser of an automobile under a conditional sales contract the right to reinstate the instalments under the sales contract as written upon payment of the past-due instalments, even if the entire indebtedness had been accelerated or attempted to be accelerated by the then holder of the contract, at any time before a sale of the automobile which had been repossessed when the purchaser defaulted in making payment of instalments.

       A deed which is defectively acknowledged by reason of the fact that word “delivered” was omitted from acknowledgment is good as between the parties. Kelly v. Wilson, 204 Miss. 56, 36 So. 2d 817, 1948 Miss. LEXIS 342 (Miss. 1948).
      </p>

       An instrument in the form of a deed which provided that the grantors were to retain possession, control and occupancy of the lands during their lifetime and then vest in the purported grantee, “but not until the death of both grantors herein, does the title pass,” was testamentary in character and did not meet the requirement of a deed that it must convey some estate effective upon delivery. Coulter v. Carter, 200 Miss. 135, 26 So. 2d 344, 1946 Miss. LEXIS 274 (Miss. 1946).

       If conveyance is sufficiently certain, additional description failing as to accuracy should be rejected as surplusage; on contradiction in description of premises conveyed, mistaken part should be rejected and other allowed to stand.

       Deed conveying 175 acres more or less, by metes and bounds, does not convey 300 acres of accretions attached to original tract before conveyance. Houston Bros. v. Grant, 112 Miss. 465, 73 So. 284, 1916 Miss. LEXIS 130 (Miss. 1916).
      </p>
      <p>
       Instrument in form of deed “to take effect only after death of the grantor” was testamentary in character and not a deed. Simpson v. McGee, 112 Miss. 344, 73 So. 55, 1916 Miss. LEXIS 117 (Miss. 1916).
      </p>
      <p>
       Under this section [Code 1942, § 852] the word “warrant” constitutes a warranty of the possession as well as of the title. Allen v. Caffee, 85 Miss. 766, 38 So. 186, 1904 Miss. LEXIS 191 (Miss. 1904).
      </p>
      <p>
       The words “convey and warrant” are effective “to transfer all the right, title, claim and possession” of the grantor only when an intention to convey a less estate is not expressed in the deed. Hart v. Gardner, 74 Miss. 153, 20 So. 877, 1896 Miss. LEXIS 128 (Miss. 1896).

The provisions of Sections 89-1-301 through 89-1-329 shall apply to any mortgage or deed of trust on real property executed prior to the date of the disaster declaration by the governor, and to any such instruments executed after the date of the disaster declaration by the governor which renewed or extended any mortgage or deed of trust executed prior to the date of the disaster declaration by the governor. When the mortgagee, or owner, or holder, or trustee, or other person having like power shall hereafter determine to foreclose a mortgage or deed of trust on real estate covered by the provisions of Sections 89-1-301 through 89-1-329, he may proceed by bill in chancery, and in the same manner as in proceedings to foreclose under existing statutes in cases where the mortgage or deed of trust contains no provisions for sale by a trustee or otherwise. Any stipulations in the mortgage or deed of trust as to the manner of foreclosure thereunder shall not preclude proceedings to foreclose any mortgage or deed of trust under the provisions of Sections 89-1-301 through 89-1-329. If any mortgagee, holder, owner, trustee, or other person shall attempt to foreclose otherwise than as herein provided, such proceedings may be enjoined by the mortgagor or owner in possessing of the mortgaged premises, or anyone claiming under the mortgagor, or anyone liable for the mortgage debt. Upon the filing of a sworn petition which affirmatively sets forth that neither the petitioner nor any other person owning an interest in the legal title to the mortgaged premises is able to pay the sums in arrears on the mortgaged debt, that no such person or persons have been able to secure a refinancing of the mortgaged debt up to the date of the filing of the petition, after diligent effort, and that because of the destruction of or damage to improvements on the mortgaged premises or because of economic conditions brought about by the effects of such an enemy attack or man-made, technological or natural disaster declared by the governor, the mortgaged property has depreciated in value as a proximate result of said disaster in an amount in excess of fifteen percent (15%) of its fair market value prior to said disaster, the chancellor of any chancery court of competent jurisdiction shall issue a preliminary injunction enjoining any foreclosure proceedings which have been commenced. The chancellor shall likewise issue a preliminary injunction enjoining any foreclosure proceedings which have been commenced if a sworn petition shall be filed which affirmatively sets forth that as a direct and proximate result of said disaster the petitioner or any other person owning an interest in the legal title to the mortgaged premises is unable to pay the sums in arrears on the mortgage debt, that the petitioner or such other person or persons have not been able to secure the refinancing of the mortgage debt up to the date of the filing of the petition after diligent effort, and that the petitioner has actually sustained a loss in income derived from the mortgaged property, or is presently threatened with such loss as a proximate result of such disaster, in an amount in excess of fifteen percent (15%) of the average annual income from the mortgaged property for the three (3) years immediately prior to said disaster; provided, however, for mortgages or deeds of trust on real property leased or rented for residential purposes from the mortgagor to a third party or parties, the provisions of Sections 89-1-301 through 89-1-329 shall apply only if the mortgagor or landlord has made or is making a good-faith effort to rehabilitate the property to a reasonable standard of habitability.
     </p>
     <p>
      Upon the issuance of any such preliminary injunction, the mortgagee may file a motion to dissolve said injunction, which motion shall be heard in termtime or in vacation, at a time to be fixed by the court not less than thirty (30) days from the date of the filing thereof. The mortgagor may implead any and all persons owning or claiming an interest in the legal title to said property and all persons who may be primarily or secondarily liable on the mortgaged indebtedness. Process shall be issued for all parties so impleaded in the manner now provided by law in suits to confirm titles and the cause shall be triable five (5) days after completion of service of process on all parties. The court may grant such continuances as may be necessary for the completion of service of process on all parties.
     </p>
     <p>
      Upon the hearing of the motion to dissolve, unless the petitioner shall prove all of the material allegations of his petition by a preponderance of the evidence, the preliminary injunction shall be dissolved. No injunction bond shall be required for the issuance of the preliminary injunction. If the court shall find the petition was filed solely for the purpose of hindering and delaying collection of the mortgaged debt and without reasonable grounds therefor, reasonable attorney’s fees shall be allowed as in other cases upon dissolution of preliminary injunctions, but not otherwise.
     </p>
     <p>
      If, upon hearing of the motion to dissolve, it shall be determined that said motion should not be granted, then the hearing shall continue in the same manner as provided for in Section 89-1-303, and the court shall enter its order granting the relief provided for by Sections 89-1-301 through 89-1-329 in the case of bills to foreclose. All the terms and provisions of Sections 89-1-301 through 89-1-329 relating to the proceedings had on, or to relief granted under, bills to foreclose shall be applicable.
     </p>
     <p>
      Provided, however, if a deed of trust be foreclosed according to the provisions therein contained, and the sale be actually consummated without the mortgagor or his heirs or assigns availing themselves of the right to enjoin said sale as provided in Sections 89-1-301 through 89-1-329, the foreclosure and the title resting thereon, if otherwise regular, shall not be controverted on account of any of the provisions of Sections 89-1-301 through 89-1-329, and this limitation shall also apply to minors and all others under legal disability. The provisions of this section shall apply to advertisements for sales already published at the time of the disaster declaration by the governor in which he specifically included the relief provided for in Sections 89-1-301 through 89-1-329, but in which the sale has not been made; provided that in such case the costs of the advertisement be tendered in cash with the bill for injunction.

     <p>
      Suits for the foreclosure of mortgages and deeds of trust shall be deemed ready for final hearing at any time after the expiration of thirty (30) days from the completion of the service of legal process on all parties. On the hearing, the court or chancellor in vacation shall receive evidence tending to establish the reasonable, normal, actual value of the mortgaged property, may fix a minimum price or reasonable and equitable price thereon, and shall determine the reasonable value of the income on said property, if any. If it has no income, then the court or chancellor in vacation shall determine the reasonable rental value, and in lieu of a present order of sale shall direct and require the mortgagor or those interested therein to pay all or a reasonable part of said income or rental value to be used for the payment of taxes, insurance and interest on the mortgage indebtedness, together with a reasonable sum for the upkeep of said property. Said payments shall be made at such times and in such manner as shall be fixed and determined and ordered by the court or chancellor in vacation which, according to the circumstances, may appear just and equitable for a term not to extend beyond two (2) years from the date of the disaster declaration by the governor in which he specifically included the relief provided for in Sections 89-1-301 through 89-1-329. After the expiration of two (2) years from the date of the disaster declaration by the governor in which he specifically included the relief provided for in Sections 89-1-301 through 89-1-329, if any past due principal, interest, taxes and the like have not been paid, a final order for sale may be made.

     <p>
      If the mortgagor or owner of the mortgaged premises, or other interested person for whose relief Sections 89-1-301 through 89-1-329 are enacted, shall make default in the carrying charge payments, or any of them, required in the order mentioned in the foregoing section, or shall commit any waste, his or her right to a further postponement of a final sale shall terminate thirty (30) days after such default, and the mortgagee or trustee or other persons having the right to foreclose shall thereupon be entitled to apply to the court in termtime or vacation for a final decree of sale upon a satisfactory showing to the court that the default aforesaid has occurred; provided that if the default be explained on the grounds of casualty, inevitable accident, or other good reason wholly beyond the control of the defaulter, and be one which in the judgment of the court can be remedied and made good by the defaulter within a reasonably short period to be fixed by the court, then the court or chancellor in vacation shall have power to excuse the default and to make such order in reference thereto as may be just and equitable. The chancellor shall have power in vacation, at any time after the period mentioned in Section 89-1-303, to hear and determine and to order or decree in respect to any matter that shall arise under Sections 89-1-301 through 89-1-329, to the same extent and as fully as the court could do in termtime, legal notice having been given to all parties of the said hearing in vacation. The court or chancellor in vacation shall have power to revoke the period of extension theretofore granted for the making of the final order of sale in case it may be made to appear to the chancellor in vacation, or to the court in termtime, that the occasion for said postponement no longer exists or is no longer just and reasonable; and, in general, the court, or chancellor in vacation, shall have power to alter and revise its orders theretofore made in any respect insofar as the changed circumstances and conditions may require. Provided further, that prior to two (2) years from the date of the disaster declaration by the governor in which he specifically included the relief provided for in Sections 89-1-301 through 89-1-329, no action shall be maintained in this state for a deficiency judgment until the period of time extension allowed in any proceeding begun under the provisions of Sections 89-1-301 through 89-1-329 shall have expired.

When an original bill has been filed in response to a bill of injunction under Sections 89-1-301 through 89-1-329, the causes may be consolidated for the hearing and for all subsequent proceedings, save as to the pleadings and process.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Every law and all the provisions thereof now in force insofar as inconsistent with the provisions of Sections 89-1-301 through 89-1-329 are hereby suspended for two (2) years from the date of the disaster declaration by the governor in which he specifically included the relief provided for in Sections 89-1-301 through 89-1-329. No postponement of sale shall be ordered or allowed under Sections 89-1-301 through 89-1-329 which would have the effect of extending the period for redemption beyond two (2) years from the date of the disaster declaration by the governor in which he specifically included the relief provided for in Sections 89-1-301 through 89-1-329.
     </p>
     <p>
      Sections 89-1-301 through 89-1-329, as to mortgage foreclosure, shall apply only to mortgages made prior to the date of the disaster declaration by the governor in which he specifically included the relief provided for in Sections 89-1-301 through 89-1-329, but shall not apply to mortgages made prior to the date of the disaster declaration by the governor in which he specifically included the relief provided for in Sections 89-1-301 through 89-1-329, which shall hereafter be renewed or extended for: (a) a period ending more than one (1) year after the date of the disaster declaration by the governor in which he specifically included the relief provided for in Sections 89-1-301 through 89-1-329, or (b) which shall be extended by agreement so as to be payable in monthly installments extending over a period of more than three (3) years. During the period of time of postponement granted under the terms of Sections 89-1-301 through 89-1-329 the several statutes of limitation be and they are hereby suspended insofar as any right or obligation may be affected by Sections 89-1-301 through 89-1-329.

      <p>
       Sellers failed to comply with requirements concerning disclosures by failing to disclose the known repair history or providing responses to the relevant questions on the disclosure form; the presence of an “as-is” clause did not absolve the sellers of their duty to disclose. The sellers were fully aware that the subject parapet wall had issues because they had paid a contractor to repair numerous problems prior to the sale of the home to the buyers, and because of the sellers’ failure to disclose, the buyers were damaged. Lewis v. Rula, — So.3d —, 2020 Miss. App. LEXIS 86 (Miss. Ct. App. Mar. 24, 2020).
      </p>
      <p>
       While Mississippi requires a disclosure statement to accompany the sale of a domicile or house, transfers of real property on which no dwelling is located do not require disclosure statements to be provided to the buyer. Stribling Invs., LLC v. Mike Rozier Constr. Co., 189 So.3d 1216, 2016 Miss. LEXIS 19 (Miss. 2016).

      <p>
       Where the home seller had submitted two disclosure statements before his death, the first one with a listing agency in which the seller admitted that his home had been treated for termite damages, and the second one with the realtor in which the seller denied that his home had been treated for prior termite damage, summary judgment in favor of a realtor was proper as the home buyers failed to show that the realty possessed any prior knowledge of any problems with the seller’s memory or his home which would have triggered a duty to investigate the credibility of the seller’s denial of prior termite damage in his disclosure statement. Varnado v. Alfonso Realty, Inc., 16 So.3d 746, 2009 Miss. App. LEXIS 492 (Miss. Ct. App. 2009).

     <p>
      The transferor of any real property subject to Sections 89-1-501 through 89-1-523 shall deliver to the prospective transferee the written property condition disclosure statement required by Sections 89-1-501 through 89-1-523, as follows:
     </p>
     <p>
      In the case of a sale, as soon as practicable before transfer of title.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the case of transfer by a real property sales contract, or by a lease together with an option to purchase, or a ground lease coupled with improvements, as soon as practicable before execution of the contract. For the purpose of this paragraph, execution means the making or acceptance of an offer.
     </p>
     <p>
      With respect to any transfer subject to paragraph (a) or (b), the transferor shall indicate compliance with Sections 89-1-501 through 89-1-523 either on the receipt for deposit, the real property sales contract, the lease, or any addendum attached thereto or on a separate document.
     </p>
     <p>
      If any disclosure, or any material amendment of any disclosure, required to be made by Section 89-1-501 through 89-1-523, is delivered after the execution of an offer to purchase, the transferee shall have three (3) days after delivery in person or five (5) days after delivery by deposit in the mail, to terminate his or her offer by delivery of a written notice of termination to the transferor or the transferor’s agent.

       Summary judgment and dismissal of the home buyers’ suit against the home sellers (in which they contended the sellers intentionally misrepresented the condition of the property) was proper as the buyers offered no evidence that the sellers intentionally misrepresented the condition of their property, or that the sellers had any personal knowledge of the conditions discovered by the buyers subsequent to their purchase. Additionally, the buyers hired their own licensed inspector prior to the closing of sale, and pursuant to his recommendations, the buyers were apparently satisfied enough with the conditions of the property to follow through with the contract and purchase the property.

     </p>
     <p>
      Be presumed to extend any assurance that such land or water area is safe for any purpose;
     </p>
     <p>
      Incur any duty of care toward a person who goes on the land or water area; or
     </p>
     <p>
      Become liable or responsible for any injury to persons or property caused by the act or omission of a person who goes on the land or water area.
     </p>
     <p>
      The foregoing applies, whether the person going on the land or water area is an invitee, licensee, trespasser or otherwise.

       Chancery court properly granted a decedent’s former wife summary judgment in an executrix’s action seeking to void deeds because the property-settlement agreement between the decedent and wife contemplated that the property would pass by survivorship; the conveyances of the wife’s undivided one-half interest were void, and thus, the original joint tenancy with rights of survivorship was still intact at the decedent’s death, and the wife was entitled to the entire property.

       Where a deed was first conveyed to a grandson by the decedent, then conveyed back to the estate, then conveyed to the grandson again by the executrix, but the executrix later sought to set aside the deed when the grandson died, notwithstanding the failure to have strictly followed form, the acknowledgment contained all the necessary information and, therefore, was not fatal to the deed’s validity; furthermore, it was clear from the deed that the executrix was acting on behalf of the decedent, the grantor, and, thus, there was no ambiguity Estate of Dykes v.

   In action arising from defendants’ alleged negligence and misconduct in conducting substituted trustee’s foreclosure sale, acknowledgment verifying that person who executed appointment of substituted trustee had, in fact, appeared before notary public and signed document was not fatally defective under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t89c03s89-3-1" target="_self">89-3-1</a></cite> due to notary’s failure to fill in blank space provided for name of person who appeared before him and executed instrument, as such person’s identity was readily ascertainable from appointment form itself.

       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       Where a deed was first conveyed to a grandson by the decedent, then conveyed back to the estate, then conveyed to the grandson again by the executrix, but the executrix later sought to set aside the deed when the grandson died, notwithstanding the failure to have strictly followed form, the acknowledgment contained all the necessary information and, therefore, was not fatal to the deed’s validity; furthermore, it was clear from the deed that the executrix was acting on behalf of the decedent, the grantor, and, thus, there was no ambiguity Estate of Dykes v. Estate of Williams, 864 So. 2d 926, 2003 Miss. LEXIS 759 (Miss. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       There was no ambiguity or disabling defect in an acknowledgment which recited that the grantors “acknowledged that they signed and delivered to the foregoing deed,” so as to divest its recordation of its efficacy as constructive notice. Davis v. Gulf Refining Co., 202 Miss. 808, 32 So. 2d 133, 1947 Miss. LEXIS 344 (Miss. 1947).
      </p>
      <p>
       Attestation by a single witness is sufficient, and a substantial compliance with the statutory form is all that is required. White v. Union Producing Co., 140 F.2d 176, 1944 U.S. App. LEXIS 3896 (5th Cir. 1944).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where proof of the execution of a colessor’s agreement was made in the manner required by law before an officer competent to take the same, and was duly certified to by him, the certificate, showing full compliance with the statute, is conclusive of the facts, except in cases of fraud; and if there was no fraud in procuring the execution of the instrument, there is none in making proof of its execution and having it filed for record. White v. Union Producing Co., 140 F.2d 176, 1944 U.S. App. LEXIS 3896 (5th Cir. 1944).
      </p>
      <p>
       The officer who has properly exercised the judicial function of taking an acknowledgment, may perform the clerical act of making the certificate at any time while he remains in office, if rights of third persons do not intervene. Harmon v. Magee, 57 Miss. 410, 1879 Miss. LEXIS 94 (Miss. 1879).
      </p>
      <p>
       The certificate of acknowledgment cannot be enlarged by averment. Willis v. Gattman, 53 Miss. 721, 1876 Miss. LEXIS 141 (Miss. 1876).
      </p>
      <p>
       A certificate showing a full compliance with the statute, except in cases of fraud, is conclusive of the facts. Johnston v. Wallace, 53 Miss. 331, 1876 Miss. LEXIS 72 (Miss. 1876).
      </p>
      <p>
       The term “executed,” when used in the acknowledgment of an instrument, imports “signing, sealing, and delivery.” Smith v. Williams, 38 Miss. 48, 1859 Miss. LEXIS 92 (Miss. 1859); Perkins, Livingston & Post v. Swank, 43 Miss. 349, 1870 Miss. LEXIS 46 (Miss. 1870).
      </p>
      <p>
       The description of an officer need not be fully stated-abbreviations may be used; And it seems that evidence aliunde may be heard to show the official character of the officer. Russ v. Wingate, 30 Miss. 440, 1855 Miss. LEXIS 116 (Miss. 1855).
      </p>
      <p>
       Substantial compliance with the form, even in cases of witnesses, is sufficient. Morse v. Clayton, 21 Miss. 373, 1850 Miss. LEXIS 31 (Miss. 1850).
      </p>
      <p>
       A deed attested by a single witness is rightfully admitted to record on proof made by him. Wilkins v. Wells, 17 Miss. 325, 1848 Miss. LEXIS 18 (Miss. 1848);
   Morris v. Rucks, 62 Miss. 76, 1884 Miss. LEXIS 23 (Miss. 1884).

       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       Official acknowledgment for public record of corporate document should in some manner make it clear that it is corporation executing instrument by and through authorized officer, officers, or agent. White v. Delta Foundation, Inc., 481 So. 2d 329, 1985 Miss. LEXIS 2339 (Miss. 1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that defendant’s agent in procuring colessor’s agreement was employed at a fixed salary did not disqualify him to act as a nonofficial subscribing witness or to make proof of the execution of such agreement, where he had no pecuniary interest in the matter. White v. Union Producing Co., 140 F.2d 176, 1944 U.S. App. LEXIS 3896 (5th Cir. 1944).
      </p>
      <p>
       Deed signed and acknowledged by corporation’s president and attested by secretary under seal held sufficient. Griffis v. Martin Oil Co., 127 Miss. 606, 90 So. 324, 1921 Miss. LEXIS 263 (Miss. 1921).
      </p>
      <p>
       One partner cannot acknowledge deed to partnership property unless his authority affirmatively appears. Tinnin v. Brown, 98 Miss. 378, 53 So. 780, 1910 Miss. LEXIS 74 (Miss. 1910).

      </p>
      <p>
       The officer who makes the certificate is incompetent as a witness to impeach it. Stone v. Montgomery, 35 Miss. 83, 1858 Miss. LEXIS 9 (Miss. 1858).

      </h4>
      <p>
       Instrument will not necessarily be deemed fatally deficient on basis of omission from acknowledgment where omission can be remedied by reference to body of instrument itself. White v. Delta Foundation, Inc., 481 So. 2d 329, 1985 Miss. LEXIS 2339 (Miss. 1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       A deed which is defectively acknowledged by reason of the fact that word “delivered” was omitted from acknowledgment is good as between the parties. Kelly v. Wilson, 204 Miss. 56, 36 So. 2d 817, 1948 Miss. LEXIS 342 (Miss. 1948).
      </p>
      <p>
       Acknowledgment of power of attorney which failed to show acknowledgment of delivery of power, held void. Lucas v. New Hebron Bank, Inc., 181 Miss. 762, 180 So. 611, 1938 Miss. LEXIS 116 (Miss. 1938).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trust created by deed not acknowledged according to law was void; trustees thereunder not entitled to maintain suit to remove cloud on theory that upon failure of trust conveyance to them was absolute. Board of Trustees v. Odom, 100 Miss. 64, 56 So. 314, 1911 Miss. LEXIS 15 (Miss. 1911).
      </p>
      <p>
       Deed not constructive notice to subsequent purchasers where acknowledgment fatally defective. Tinnin v. Brown, 98 Miss. 378, 53 So. 780, 1910 Miss. LEXIS 74 (Miss. 1910).

      </p>
      <p>
       Acknowledgment which does not state that grantor executed or delivered deed is fatally bad; such deed not entitled to record and not constructive notice. Elmslie v. Thurman, 87 Miss. 537, 40 So. 67, 1905 Miss. LEXIS 179 (Miss. 1905).
      </p>
      <p>
       Lease not entitled to record because of improper acknowledgment, not ineffective against subsequent grantees with actual notice. Ladnier v. Stewart, 38 So. 748 (Miss. 1905).
      </p>
      <p>
       The omission of the words “on the day and year therein mentioned,” was not, under former statute, a material defect in an acknowledgment. Caruthers v. McLaran, 56 Miss. 371, 1879 Miss. LEXIS 132 (Miss. 1879).
      </p>
      <p>

     </h3>
     <p>
      If the grantor and witness or witnesses of any instrument of writing be dead or absent, so that the personal attendance of neither can be had, it may be established by the oath of any person who, on examination before an officer competent to take acknowledgments, can prove the handwriting of the deceased or absent witness or witnesses; or when such proof cannot be had, then the handwriting of the grantor may be proved, and the officer before whom such proof is made shall certify accordingly, and such certificate shall be deemed equivalent to an acknowledgment by the grantor or proof by a subscribing witness, and entitle the instrument to be recorded.

       A recorded deed of trust, containing an erroneous description of the land conveyed by the grantor, which recited that the land in question contained 60 acres more or less, whereas the grantor only owned 40 acres, was not sufficient to put the grantor’s judgment creditors on notice that an entirely different tract of land was intended to be included, and did not give notice of a description which a diligent search of the records might have disclosed as to other lands belonging to the grantor, so that while the grantee was entitled to a reformation of a trust deed as against the grantor, he was not so entitled as against the judgment creditors, who had executed on the land actually owned by the grantor.

      Except as provided by Sections 89-5-101 through 89-5-113, all bargains and sales, and all other conveyances whatsoever of lands, whether made for passing an estate of freehold or inheritance, or for a term of years; and all instruments of settlement upon marriage wherein land, money, or other personalty should be settled or covenanted to be left or paid at the death of the party, or otherwise; and all deeds of trust and mortgages whatsoever, shall be void as to all creditors and subsequent purchasers for a valuable consideration without notice, unless they be acknowledged or proved and lodged with the clerk of the chancery court of the proper county, to be recorded in the same manner that other conveyances are required to be acknowledged or proved and recorded. Failure to file such instrument with the clerk for record shall prevent any claim of priority by the holder of such instrument over any similar recorded instrument affecting the same property, to the end that with reference to all instruments which may be filed for record under this section, the priority thereof shall be governed by the priority in time of the filing of the several instruments, in the absence of actual notice. But as between the parties and their heirs, and as to all subsequent purchasers with notice or without valuable consideration, said instruments shall nevertheless be valid and binding.

       Chancery court properly granted a lender’s successor summary judgment in its action seeking a declaratory judgment that it held a first-priority deed of trust on real property because there was no genuine issue of material fact that the successor had actual knowledge of the defective deed of trust or a beneficiary’s lien; the managing member of the settlement agent for the lender swore that the lender had no knowledge of any other deed of trust.

       To the extent one of a bank’s deeds of trust was secondary to a lienholder’s deed of trust by virtue of the filing date, equitable subrogation applied because the bank’s loan was secured by a corresponding deed of trust for the same property, which was allowed to be pledged by the same person for the debt of a family member’s company and the bank never cancelled its other deeds of trust.

       Chancery court properly found that the foreclosure a lienholder conducted was subject to the first priority lien position of a bank because the bank had a priority lien by virtue of its prior deeds of trust; it would be inequitable to hold that the bank lost its priority lien position to the lienholder, the wife and mother of the debtors to whom the bank showed favor by stopping its foreclosure proceedings and issuing another loan, a loan whose purpose was to refinance a business debt.

       A recorded deed of trust, containing an erroneous description of the land conveyed by the grantor, which recited that the land in question contained 60 acres more or less, whereas the grantor only owned 40 acres, was not sufficient to put the grantor’s judgment creditors on notice that an entirely different tract of land was intended to be included, and did not give notice of a description which a diligent search of the records might have disclosed as to other lands belonging to the grantor, so that while the grantee was entitled to a reformation of a trust deed as against the grantor, he was not so entitled as against the judgment creditors, who had executed on the land actually owned by the grantor.

   Chancery court erred in relying on Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t89c05s89-5-13" target="_self">89-5-13</a></cite> to find that two deeds were effective on the dates reflected in the acknowledgments, without addressing uncontradicted testimony regarding the intent of the parties or considering when the deeds were delivered and accepted. Morrow v. Morrow, 129 So.3d 142, 2013 Miss. LEXIS 546 (Miss. 2013).
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 89-5-13 is a curative statute for deeds with defective acknowledgements, and therefore did not cure a deed’s total lack of acknowledgement. Greenlee v. Mitchell, 607 So. 2d 97, 1992 Miss. LEXIS 483 (Miss. 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 89-5-13, a purely curative statute for a deed which has been of record for 20 years with a defect in the acknowledgment, had no bearing or relevance to the issue of whether the signature on a deed was authorized, and did not create a presumption that it was. Goodwin v. McMurphy, 435 So. 2d 639, 1983 Miss. LEXIS 2617 (Miss. 1983).

      Where the remedy to enforce any mortgage, deed of trust, or other lien on real or personal property which is recorded, appears on the face of the record to be barred by the statute of limitations (which, as to a series of notes or a note payable in installments, shall begin to run from and after the maturity date of the last note or last installment), the lien shall cease and have no effect as to creditors and subsequent purchasers for a valuable consideration without notice, unless within six (6) months after such remedy is so barred the fact that such mortgage, deed of trust, or lien has been renewed or extended be entered on the margin of the record thereof, by the creditor, debtor, or trustee, attested by the clerk, or a new mortgage, deed of trust, or lien, noting the fact of renewal or extension, be duly filed for record within such time. If the date of final maturity of such indebtedness so secured cannot be ascertained from the face of the record the same shall be deemed to be due one (1) year from the date of the instrument securing the same for the purpose of this section. And where a suit shall have been brought to keep a judgment alive within seven (7) years from the rendition of such judgment, the general lien of such judgment shall expire as to creditors and subsequent purchasers for a valuable consideration, without notice, at the end of seven (7) years from the rendition of such judgment, notwithstanding such suit to keep alive the judgment unless a notation to keep alive such judgment shall be made on the judgment roll within six (6) months after the expiration of seven (7) years from the time of the rendition of such judgment.

       Where note secured by deed of trust was extended from time to time, but fact of extensions was not noted on margin of record of deed of trust before remedy to enforce it appeared on face of record to be barred, or within six months thereafter, such extensions did not affect rights of subsequent creditors without notice of extensions.

       In searching the records to determine the names and address of mortgagees pursuant to the mandatory provisions of Section 27-43-5, a clerk may rely upon the provisions of Section 89-5-19; he may consider as barred any lien which as of the date of the search appears to have been barred pursuant to the applicable statute of limitation at least six months prior to the date of the search for the debt secured thereby; and he need not give notice of the maturity of a tax sale to any mortgagee whose lien appears to be barred.

       To the extent one of a bank’s deeds of trust was secondary to a lienholder’s deed of trust by virtue of the filing date, equitable subrogation applied because the bank’s loan was secured by a corresponding deed of trust for the same property, which was allowed to be pledged by the same person for the debt of a family member’s company and the bank never cancelled its other deeds of trust.

       Chancery court properly found that the foreclosure a lienholder conducted was subject to the first priority lien position of a bank because the bank had a priority lien by virtue of its prior deeds of trust; it would be inequitable to hold that the bank lost its priority lien position to the lienholder, the wife and mother of the debtors to whom the bank showed favor by stopping its foreclosure proceedings and issuing another loan, a loan whose purpose was to refinance a business debt.

       The clerk of the chancery court shall provide a general index, direct and reverse, on which shall be entered, in regular alphabetical order under the appropriate letter, the name of each maker of the instrument and the name of each person to whom made; and in like alphabetical order under its appropriate title shall be entered the name of each person to whom the instrument is made and the name of each person by whom made. A general index, both direct and reverse, of mortgages and deeds of trust on land shall be kept separate from the general index to other records which the chancery clerk is required to keep, and he shall make the proper entries in it as he is required to make in the other general index. Immediately on receipt of any instrument to be recorded, the clerk shall make these entries in the appropriate general index and, after recording the instrument, the book and page in which the record is made shall be noted opposite each name thus placed in such general index, both direct and reverse.

       The clerk of the chancery court shall maintain a sectional index to instruments describing land which are also entered in the general index. Each entry shall state the name of each maker of the instrument, the name of each person to whom made, and the date, type of instrument and the appropriate reference where recorded. Opposite each such entry, the sectional index shall indicate the location of the land described in the instrument (a) by quarter section or governmental lot or other applicable subdivision of each section, township and range established by governmental survey, or (b) by lot number for platted subdivisions, official surveys, and unofficial subdivisions and surveys commonly in use. The clerk may elect to keep the sectional index by quarter-quarter section rather than by the quarter section, but shall not require a preparer’s indexing instruction to describe the quarter-quarter section. Except as otherwise provided in this section, every instrument describing land and required to be entered in the general index shall also be entered in the sectional index. In the event of conflict between the general and the sectional indices, the notice imparted by the general index shall prevail except to the extent the land is described by lot number for platted subdivisions, official surveys, and unofficial subdivisions and surveys commonly in use, the sectional index shall prevail.

       Every surveyor or other person who prepares a legal description of land or who prepares an instrument utilizing an existing description and every person who prepares a deed of trust shall (except as herein provided) include an indexing instruction which shall state the section, township and range and one or more quarter sections or governmental lots or other applicable subdivisions of each section in which the land is located. The preparer, at his option, may elect to note the quarter-quarter section in which the land is located, but shall not be required to do so. However, if the section or quarter sections or governmental lots or other applicable subdivisions of the section cannot feasibly be determined by such surveyor or other person, the indexing instruction shall contain a statement to that effect and shall then state all of the sections and quarter sections or governmental lots or other applicable subdivisions of the section in which the described land could possibly be located. The indexing instruction shall be distinctly set apart in the instrument so as to be readily apparent to the chancery clerk. A chancery clerk shall refuse to accept delivery of an instrument which does not contain the indexing instruction required in this section unless the instrument otherwise discloses the information required to be included in an indexing instruction. To be accepted for recording, an instrument shall state the name, address and telephone number of the person, entity or firm preparing it. If prepared by an attorney, the instrument shall also include the attorney’s Mississippi bar number. The fact that the indexing instruction or preparer information may be omitted, incorrect, incomplete or false shall not invalidate the instrument or the filing thereof for record. The chancery clerk shall enter the instrument in the sectional index according to the indexing instruction, or equivalent information if accepted for filing without an indexing instruction, and shall make no entries under any other quarter sections or governmental lots or subdivisions of the section. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the following kinds of instruments shall be indexed as stated:

       Pursuant to Section 1-1-109, the Joint Legislative Committee on Compilation, Revision and Publication of Legislation corrected a typographical error in subsection (3). In the third sentence of (3), an apparent typographical error was corrected by substituting “determined by such survey or other person” for “determined by such survey or other person.” The Joint Committee ratified the correction at its April 26, 2001, meeting.

       Subsequently a publishing error was corrected by substituting the word “surveyor” for “survey” so that the phrase read “determined by such surveyor or other person.”

      Sales of land made under deeds of trust by substituted trustees shall not convey the interest of the grantor or grantors therein, but shall be absolutely null and void, both at law and in equity, unless the substitution shall appear of record in the office of the chancery clerk of the county where the land is situated, and unless it shall so appear by being actually spread at large upon the record before the first advertisement or notice of sale shall have been posted or published; the filing for record or lodging with the clerk not being sufficient. Such substitution, however, may so appear by a separate instrument recorded as above set out in all respects, or a copy of such substitution may be recorded as above set out. Provided, however, that where the beneficiary named in the deed of trust is an agency of the United States or the State of Mississippi, a national or state chartered bank or savings and loan association, a federal land bank, a production credit association, or an insurance company, the beneficiary may substitute the trustee named therein and the trustee named in all deeds of trust held by such beneficiary in the county, by recording in the office of the chancery clerk in the county where the land encumbered is situated one (1) instrument designated as a general substitution. It shall not be necessary for the general substitution to identify individually deeds of trust affected, or the grantors therein, it being sufficient if the instrument recites the name and address of the beneficiary and declares that its purpose is to name a substitute trustee for all mortgages or deeds of trust held by the named beneficiary which are recorded in the county. All general substitutions shall be indexed by the chancery clerk in a separate book especially designated for such purpose.

       Where a county, which had become the purchaser of land upon foreclosure of a deed of trust held by it, and had received a deed thereto from a subsequent trustee, but had obtained no title because the substitution of the trustee was not made a matter of record as required by statute, sold the land under an order of the board of supervisors, which was void in that the order had been made at a special meeting, the call for which failed to make provision, either expressly or impliedly, for taking up the matter of the sale and conveyance of the land, a later valid foreclosure of the trust deed and the purchase by the county did not inure to the benefit of the would-be purchaser under the void sale by the board, so as to render her title good, since such would-be purchaser had been affected with notice of the illegality of the first foreclosure and the conveyance following it made to her, and persons dealing with members of the board of supervisors, who are trustees for the public and bound by the limitations fixed by law on their powers, must take notice of their powers and cannot acquire rights where they are acting beyond their authority.

     </p>
     <p>
      The “Mississippi Coordinate System of 1927 East Zone” is a transverse Mercator projection of the Clarke spheroid of 1866, having a central meridian eighty-eight (88) degrees fifty (50) minutes west of Greenwich, on which meridian the scale is set at one (1) part in twenty-five thousand (25,000) too small. The origin of coordinates is at the intersection of the meridian eighty-eight (88) degrees fifty (50) minutes west of Greenwich and the parallel twenty-nine (29) degrees forty (40) minutes north latitude. This origin is given the coordinates: X 500,000 feet and Y 0 feet.
     </p>
     <p>
      The “Mississippi Coordinate System of 1927 West Zone” is a transverse Mercator projection of the Clarke spheroid of 1866, having a central meridian ninety (90) degrees twenty (20) minutes west of Greenwich, on which meridian the scale is set at one (1) part in seventeen thousand (17,000) too small. The origin of coordinates is at the intersection of the meridian ninety (90) degrees twenty (20) minutes west of Greenwich and the parallel thirty (30) degrees thirty (30) minutes north latitude. This origin is given the coordinates: X 500,000 feet and Y 0 feet.

      The “Mississippi Coordinate System of 1983 West Zone” is a transverse Mercator projection of the North American Datum of 1983, having a central meridian ninety (90) degrees twenty (20) minutes west of Greenwich, on which meridian the scale is set at one (1) part in twenty thousand (20,000) too small. The origin of coordinates is at the intersection of the meridian ninety (90) degrees twenty (20) minutes west of Greenwich and the parallel twenty-nine (29) degrees thirty (30) minutes north latitude. This origin is given the coordinates: N 0 meters and E 700,000 meters.

      No coordinates based on either Mississippi coordinate system, purporting to define the position of a point, shall be recorded on any plat or in any public record unless the coordinates are derived from an accurate connection to an identified existing or newly established permanently-monumented third order Class I(1:10,000) or higher order station of the National Geodetic Reference System. Standards and specifications of the Federal Geodetic Control Committee (FGCC) or its successor in force on the date of survey shall apply. Published existing control stations or the acceptance with intent to publish the newly established station by the National Ocean Service/National Geodetic Survey will constitute evidence of adherence to the FGCC specifications.

    Use of system of plane coordinates to describe location of point within state.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      For purposes of describing the location of any point in the State of Mississippi, it shall be considered a complete, legal and satisfactory description of such location to give the position of such point on the system of plane coordinates defined in this chapter, provided the connection to the Mississippi Coordinate System is made in accordance with the provisions of this chapter and the standards of practice for surveying as adopted by the Board of Licensure for Professional Engineers and Surveyors. Whenever coordinates are affixed to any point which has previously been described by another system, the coordinates shall be construed as additional evidence of the location of the same point. In the event of any conflict as to the point or its location, the common rules of evidence shall be used to resolve the conflict. When used to reference the position of a point to be cited in recorded description of real property, the description must be written in a form that is tied to the existing land system.

   Landlord Lien Statute affords unpaid landlord no rights in property of third persons on landlord’s premises. By analogy, landlord should not acquire lien under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t89c07s89-7-51ol12" target="_self">89-7-51(2)</a></cite> on property not belonging to lessee. Hicks v.

      <p>
       The lien for the enforcement of which the statute provides is that inherent in the relation of landlord and tenant and therefore is not one created by legal proceedings within the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act that liens obtained through legal proceedings against an insolvent within four months prior to the filing of the petition of bankruptcy shall be deemed void.

       The provision that goods shall not be taken from rented premises under process until rent is paid does not give landlord lien on property on leased premises for rent. White v.

       Rent accrued prior to the filing of a petition in bankruptcy is, however, properly allowable as a secured claim against the proceeds of the trustee’s sale of the tenant’s goods found on the premises at the time of the bankruptcy.

      A tenant shall not be bound to pay rent for buildings after their destruction by fire or otherwise, nor shall a covenant or promise by a lessee to leave or restore the premises in good repair have the effect to bind him to erect or pay for such buildings as may be so destroyed, unless in respect to the matters aforesaid there was negligence or fault on his part, or unless he has expressly stipulated to be so bound.

       Where a building was destroyed by fire and the fire was not caused by negligence or fault of the lessee and the lessee did not expressly stipulate to pay for rent after destruction by the fire, the lessee was entitled to a reduction in the monthly rental to be paid for the leased premises and the lessee did not lose his right when he rebuilt the building at his own expense. Miller v. Miller, 222 Miss. 588, 76 So. 2d 705, 1955 Miss. LEXIS 641 (Miss. 1955).

       A tenant is not liable for accidental damages or destruction by fire, unless he has contracted to assume liability for such damages. Miller v. Miller, 217 Miss. 650, 64 So. 2d 739, 1953 Miss. LEXIS 475 (Miss. 1953).
      </p>
      <p>
       In an action brought by lessee against lessor of a gasoline station seeking reduction of monthly rental to be paid on account of destruction of the main service station building by fire, or, in the alternative, to require the lessors to restore the building to its former condition, wherein the lessors filed a cross bill to recover for damages to the building on the ground that the fire was the result of lessee’s negligence, evidence sustained a finding that there was insufficient proof that fire was caused by the negligence of lessee or his employees. Miller v. Miller, 217 Miss. 650, 64 So. 2d 739, 1953 Miss. LEXIS 475 (Miss. 1953).

       This section [Code 1942, § 898] affects contract rights of parties to a lease, but concluding clause is merely declaratory of common law right to sue tenant for negligent act, resulting in damage. Roell v. Brooks, 205 Miss. 255, 38 So. 2d 716, 1949 Miss. LEXIS 427 (Miss. 1949).
      </p>
      <p>
       In action under this section [Code 1942, § 898] by landlord against tenant for damages to leased premises by fire alleged to have been caused by negligence of defendant’s manager in leaving gas heater burning during his absence from building, burden of proof is on plaintiff to show by preponderance of evidence that defendant did not use reasonable care in maintenance of reasonably safe gas heater and that such failure was proximate cause of fire and resulting damage. Roell v. Brooks, 205 Miss. 255, 38 So. 2d 716, 1949 Miss. LEXIS 427 (Miss. 1949).
      </p>
      <p>
       Tenant, although bound under lease to restore building destroyed by fire, held not entitled to proceeds of insurance taken out by the lessor. Panhandle Oil Co. v. Therrell, 158 Miss. 810, 131 So. 263, 1930 Miss. LEXIS 109 (Miss. 1930).

       Watertank, pump, and engine placed on leased premises by tenant after destruction by windstorm did not become fixtures. Frederick v. Smith, 147 Miss. 437, 111 So. 847, 1927 Miss. LEXIS 279 (Miss. 1927).
      </p>
      <p>
       If a lessee covenants “to take good care of the leased premises and to return the same in as good order as at the beginning of the lease, ordinary wear and tear, and damage by fire, wind and water excepted, and to make at his own expense all necessary repairs,” he is obliged to make all such repairs as are necessary to keep the premises in such condition. The exceptions cannot be construed to relieve him of such obligations. Waddell v. De Jet, 76 Miss. 104, 23 So. 437, 1898 Miss. LEXIS 57 (Miss. 1898).
      </p>
      <p>
       An insolvent tenant who violates his obligation to repair, to the extent of endangering the destruction of the leased premises, subjects himself to a suit for the cancellation of his lease. Waddell v. De Jet, 76 Miss. 104, 23 So. 437, 1898 Miss. LEXIS 57 (Miss. 1898).
      </p>
      <p>
       No damages are allowable, but the tenant is entitled under the statute to an abatement of rent in the proportion that the value of the use of the ginhouse and machinery accidentally destroyed by fire during his term, bears to the value of the use of the whole premises. Taylor v. Hart, 73 Miss. 22, 18 So. 546, 1895 Miss. LEXIS 84 (Miss. 1895).

     <p>
      The executor or administrator of a person to whom rent is due and not paid at the time of his death may have an action for all such arrearages against the tenant or tenants who ought to have paid the rent so being behind in the lifetime of their testator or intestate, or against the executors or administrators of such tenants. Every executor or administrator of any person to whom such rent is due and not paid at the time of his death, may distrain for the arrearages of all such rents on the lands which were charged with the payment of such rents, and liable to the distress of the testator or intestate, so long as the same continue in the seizin or possession of the tenant who ought to have paid the rent to the testator or intestate in his lifetime, or in the seizin or possession of any person claiming the lands, only by and from the tenant, by purchase, gift, or descent, in like manner and form as the said executor’s or administrator’s testator or intestate might have done in his lifetime. The executors and administrators for the same distress may lawfully make avowry.

       The statute is the sole remedy for landlords against holdover tenants; the common law rule with regard to holdover tenants was abrogated by the statute. Dungan v. Presley, 765 So. 2d 592, 2000 Miss. App. LEXIS 379 (Miss. Ct. App. 2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the landlord did not covenant to put the new tenant in possession of the leased premises, the landlord’s right to bring a dispossessory action against the old tenant was transferred to the new tenant, and the new tenant was bound by the terms of this section and could recover no more than the damages allowed the landlord under this section. Southwest Drug Co. v. Howard Bros. Pharmacy, Inc., 320 So. 2d 776, 1975 Miss. LEXIS 1499 (Miss. 1975).
      </p>
      <p>
       Judgment may be entered for both single and double rent in an unlawful entry and detainer proceeding. Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. v. Fried, 202 Miss. 370, 31 So. 2d 116, 1947 Miss. LEXIS 287 (Miss. 1947).
      </p>
      <p>
       Single rent only was recovered by a landlord during the time reasonably necessary for the tenant to remove its improvements after receiving notice the day before the lease expired that the landlord was exercising his retake privilege. Hines Motor Co. v. Hederman, 201 Miss. 859, 30 So. 2d 70, 1947 Miss. LEXIS 457 (Miss. 1947).
      </p>
      <p>
       Under this section [Code 1942, § 947], rent due by a tenant unlawfully holding over after notice to vacate the premises is double that which he had agreed to pay. Ellison v. Landry, 199 Miss. 161, 24 So. 2d 319, 1946 Miss. LEXIS 182 (Miss. 1946).
      </p>
      <p>
       Tenant, who became trespasser by holding over beyond expiration of term, is liable for double rent thereafter, but only for that period dating from one year prior to suit. Sherrill v. Stewart, 199 Miss. 216, 23 So. 2d 915, 1945 Miss. LEXIS 282 (Miss. 1945).
      </p>
      <p>
       When a person is rightfully in possession of a leased premises and the landlord seeks wrongfully to evict him, the case does not become moot upon the mere fact that the tenant’s term has expired before the time of trial, because, in such case, the general judgment in favor of the landlord would be to adjudge that the tenant was wrongfully in possession at the time the action was filed and before his rightful term expired, and might subject him to double rent under this section [Code 1942, § 947]. Henley v. Kilbas, 188 Miss. 604, 195 So. 582, 1940 Miss. LEXIS 61 (Miss. 1940).

      <p>
       Liability of tenant holding over after notice to quit, for double rent, is absolute. Weatherall v. Brown, 113 Miss. 887, 74 So. 765, 1917 Miss. LEXIS 161 (Miss. 1917).
      </p>
      <p>
       After termination of lease tenant has reasonable time in which to remove effects, and on failure to do so landlord may remove them but does not acquire title by tenant’s failure to remove. Opperman v. Littlejohn, 98 Miss. 636, 54 So. 77, 1910 Miss. LEXIS 102 (Miss. 1910).

       In unlawful entry and detainer action against tenant holding over, imposition of damages at double rent cannot be awarded on testimony which is too vague to establish a rental basis, especially in view of penal nature of such award.

      </p>
      <p>
       One who is no longer within the orbit of federal statute because no longer a tenant, the office of price administration having authorized action for eviction or removal in accordance with requirements of local law, cannot avoid penalty provided by this section [Code 1942, § 947].

      </p>

       This section [Code 1942, § 947] is penal and should be strictly construed against the claim for double rent. Sherrill v. Stewart, 197 Miss. 880, 21 So. 2d 11, 1945 Miss. LEXIS 319 (Miss. 1945).
      </p>
      <p>
       Claim for double rent is one for a penalty and is subject to the one-year limitation period under Code 1942, § 731. Sherrill v. Stewart, 197 Miss. 880, 21 So. 2d 11, 1945 Miss. LEXIS 319 (Miss. 1945).
      </p>
      <p>
       The statutory provision making a tenant liable for double rent in case he holds over after notice is penal and should be strictly construed against the claim for double rent, but that does not mean that the very letter of the statute must be followed.

       Under this section [Code 1942, § 947], double rent may be recovered in an action of unlawful entry and detainer. Ellison v. Landry, 199 Miss. 161, 24 So. 2d 319, 1946 Miss. LEXIS 182 (Miss. 1946).
      </p>
      <p>
       The statutory remedy of recovery of double rent for tenant’s holding over is exclusive, and hence recovery thereunder in dispossessory proceedings was res judicata of landlord’s action for damages, notwithstanding another statute permitting recovery of both penalty and actual damages in certain cases. Tepper Bros. v. Buttross, 178 Miss. 659, 174 So. 556, 1937 Miss. LEXIS 261 (Miss. 1937).

   A landlord’s sole action for damages as a result of a tenant’s holdover is provided in §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t89c07s89-7-25" target="_self">89-7-25</a></cite>; accordingly, where the landlord notified the tenant of the approaching expiration of his annual lease and demanded that the premises be surrendered at the completion of the term, but never elected to pursue his statutory remedy by having the tenant evicted, the landlord’s acceptance of one month’s rent following the expiration of the lease created a month to month tenancy, and the landlord was entitled to nothing further when the tenant vacated the premises at the end of that month. Mississippi State Dep't of Public Welfare v. Howie, 449 So. 2d 772, 1984 Miss. LEXIS 1663 (Miss. 1984).
      </p>
      <p>
       Double rent was not recoverable prior to date on which tenant herself asserted that the term had expired, where landlord had waived the claim for double rent. Sherrill v. Stewart, 199 Miss. 216, 23 So. 2d 915, 1945 Miss. LEXIS 282 (Miss. 1945).
      </p>
      <p>
       Tenant’s plea of estoppel in landlord’s action for double rent, upon ground that landlord’s position in present suit was inconsistent with prior suit between the same parties and relating to the same subject matter instituted by the landlord for dispossession wherein landlord waived claim for double rent, was not frivolous, so that the sustaining of plaintiff’s motion to strike the plea constituted reversible error. Sherrill v. Stewart, 197 Miss. 880, 21 So. 2d 11, 1945 Miss. LEXIS 319 (Miss. 1945).

       § 89-7-27.
    Proceedings against tenant holding over.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      A tenant or lessee at will or at sufferance, or for part of a year, or for one or more years, of any houses, lands, or tenements, and the assigns, undertenants, or legal representatives of such tenant or lessee, shall be removed from the premises by the judge of the county court, any justice of the peace of the county, or by the mayor or police justice of any city, town, or village where the premises, or some part thereof, are situated, in the following cases, to wit:
     </p>
     <p>
      First. Where such tenant shall hold over and continue in possession of the demised premises, or any part thereof, after the expiration of his term, without the permission of the landlord.
     </p>
     <p>
      Second. After any default in the payment of the rent pursuant to the agreement under which such premises are held, and when complete satisfaction of the rent and any late fees due cannot be obtained by distress of goods, and three (3) days’ notice, in writing, requiring the payment of such rent or the possession of the premises, shall have been served by the person entitled to the rent on the person who owes the rent.
     </p>
     <p>
      Third. If a written agreement between the landlord and tenant exists, any event calling for eviction in the agreement may trigger the eviction process under this section. Notice of default by email or text message is proper if the party has agreed in writing to be notified by that means.
     </p>

       Interest of plaintiff in the land, where supreme court affirmed judgment granting plaintiff possession as against defendant’s contention that he was in possession under contract for its purchase, was not limited to the rent due but covered all its value, so as to entitle plaintiff to 5 per cent damages on such value under Code 1942, § 1971.

       Statutes relating to bond and judgment thereon in proceedings to stay execution of writ of possession in ejectment (Code 1942, §§ 1165 and 1166) have no application to an appeal by tenant from judgment rendered against him in proceeding under this section [Code 1972, § 948] awarding appellee recovery of land as against contention that tenant was in possession under contract for purchase, since this is not an appeal from a judgment in an action of ejectment with a stay of execution.

      If a judgment of eviction is founded solely upon the nonpayment of rent and, at the time of the request for the warrant for removal the full and complete amount of rent due, including any late fees as provided in the rental agreement that have accrued as of the date of judgment, and the costs of the proceedings, have been paid to the person entitled to the rent, the magistrate shall not issue a warrant for removal. If the rent, late fees and costs have not been paid in full at the time of the request for the warrant for removal, the magistrate must immediately issue the warrant for removal unless the judge determines that, for good cause shown, a stay not to exceed three (3) days would best serve the interests of justice and equity. If it is shown that a stay is likely to result in material injury to the property of the person entitled to the rent, no stay shall be granted.

     <p>
      If a tenant of lands, being in arrear for rent, shall desert the demised premises and leave the same uncultivated or unoccupied, so that a sufficient distress cannot be had to satisfy the arrears of rent, any constable of the county may, at the request of the landlord, and upon due proof by affidavit that the premises have been deserted, leaving rent in arrear, and not sufficient distress thereon, go upon and view the premises, and upon being satisfied that the premises have been so deserted, he shall affix a notice, in writing, upon a conspicuous part of the premises, stating what day he will return to take a second view thereof, not less than five (5) days nor more than fifteen (15) days thereafter, and requiring the tenant then to appear and pay the rent and any late fees due. At the time specified in the notice the constable shall again view the premises, and if, upon second view, the tenant shall not pay the rent and any late fees due, or there shall not be sufficient distress upon the premises, then the justice court shall immediately or within forty-eight (48) hours put the landlord in possession of the premises, and the lease thereof to such tenant shall become void. The tenant may appeal to the circuit court from the proceedings of the justice court at any time within thirty (30) days after possession delivered, by serving notice in writing thereof upon the landlord, and by giving bond, with sufficient sureties, to be approved by the justice court, for the payment to the landlord of the costs of appeal, which may be adjudged against the tenant; and thereupon the justice court shall return the proceedings before him to the next term of the circuit court, and the court shall, at the return term, examine the proceedings in a summary way, and may order restitution to be made to the tenant, with costs of appeal, to be paid by the landlord; or in case of affirming the proceedings, shall award costs against the tenant and sureties in his bond.

       Every lessor of land shall have a lien on the agricultural products of the leased premises, however and by whomsoever produced, to secure the payment of the rent and of money advanced to the tenant, and the fair market value of all advances made by him to his tenant for supplies for the tenant and others for whom he may contract, and for his business carried on upon the leased premises. This lien shall be paramount to all other liens, claims, or demands upon such products when perfected in accordance with Uniform Commercial Code Article 9 – Secured Transactions (Section 75-9-101 et seq.). The claim of the lessor for supplies furnished may be enforced in the same manner and under the same circumstances as his claim for rent may be; and all the provisions of law as to attachment for rent and proceedings under it shall be applicable to a claim for supplies furnished, and such attachment may be levied on any goods and chattels liable for rent, as well as on the agricultural products.

       <p>
   The landlord lien statute (§<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t89c07s89-7-51" target="_self">89-7-51</a></cite>) does not provide for the ejectment of a tenant from the leased premises for failure to pay rent, but merely gives a landlord a subordinate lien on all articles of personal property. Bender v. North Meridian Mobile Home Park, 636 So. 2d 385, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 160 (Miss. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       In determining whether a lien will be extended to include the proceeds of a crop sale, courts look to whether: (1) the crop lender was aware of the landlord/tenant relationship; (2) the crop lender was involved in the sale; (3) the crop lender obtained a subordination agreement from the landlord; or (4) whether the landlord expressly or impliedly waived its statutory lien. Planters Bank & Trust Co. v. Sklar, 555 So. 2d 1024, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 1 (Miss. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Landlord Lien statute affords unpaid landlord no rights in property of third persons on landlord’s premises. By analogy, landlord should not acquire lien under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t89c07s89-7-51ol12" target="_self">89-7-51(2)</a></cite> on property not belonging to lessee. Hicks v. Thomas, 516 So. 2d 1344, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2949 (Miss. 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       In determining whether landlord is entitled to lien on crops securing rent of tenant house off leased premises, question is whether house was reasonably necessary to enable tenants to properly carry out farming operations. Dale v. Webb, 166 Miss. 309, 146 So. 875, 1933 Miss. LEXIS 364 (Miss. 1933).
      </p>
      <p>
       Title to stolen crop when rent reserved therefrom held to be in tenant until division of the crop is made. Bethany v. State, 124 Miss. 870, 87 So. 410, 1921 Miss. LEXIS 186 (Miss. 1921).
      </p>
      <p>
       Under lease for year title to crop vests in tenant subject to landlord’s lien. Opperman v. Littlejohn, 98 Miss. 636, 54 So. 77, 1910 Miss. LEXIS 102 (Miss. 1910).
      </p>
      <p>
       Merchants receiving crop to ship out of state and credit on tenant’s account held liable to extent of landlord’s lien. Peets & Norman Co. v. Baker, 95 Miss. 576, 48 So. 898, 1909 Miss. LEXIS 247 (Miss. 1909).
      </p>
      <p>
       The lien given a landlord under this section [Code 1942, § 908] is effectual to secure the rent of the dwelling house appurtenant to the farm, as well as the rent of arable lands. Scroggins v. Foster, 76 Miss. 318, 24 So. 194, 1898 Miss. LEXIS 76 (Miss. 1898).
      </p>
      <p>
       A landlord has no lien upon his tenant’s goods, other than agricultural products, and, before distress for rent, a bona fide purchaser of such goods, whether on or off the leased premises, will be protected. Richardson v. McLaurin, 69 Miss. 70, 12 So. 264, 1891 Miss. LEXIS 104 (Miss. 1891).
      </p>
      <p>
       The lien is only given upon the agricultural products, and is not affected by their removal from the premises. Henry v. Davis, 60 Miss. 212, 1882 Miss. LEXIS 33 (Miss. 1882); Fitzgerald v. Fowlkes, 60 Miss. 270, 1882 Miss. LEXIS 49 (Miss. 1882); Tennessee Joint Stock Land Bank v. Bank of Greenwood, 179 Miss. 534, 172 So. 323, 1937 Miss. LEXIS 2 (Miss. 1937).
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no lien, except on the agricultural products, before the levy of attachment. Marye v. Dyche, Gates, Gillespie & Co., 42 Miss. 347, 1869 Miss. LEXIS 1 (Miss. 1869).

       A landlord holding the tenant’s note for rent, who during the term and before the rent is due, conveys the rented land, cannot thereafter attach for the rent. The conveyance carries with it, as an incident, the note. Watkins v. Duvall, 69 Miss. 364, 13 So. 727, 1891 Miss. LEXIS 150 (Miss. 1891).
      </p>
      <p>
       One who was landlord, after conveying the premises to a third person, has no lien for supplies thereafter advanced by him during the term to enable the tenant to make a crop on the land. Watkins v. Duvall, 69 Miss. 364, 13 So. 727, 1891 Miss. LEXIS 150 (Miss. 1891).

      </p>
      <p>
       Persons furnishing receiver money with which to gather tenant’s cotton crop does not acquire lien on other cotton grown on leased premises. Goodwin v. Mitchell, 38 So. 657 (Miss. 1905).

      <p>
       Abandonment by tenant not justified by failure of landlord to furnish meat and clothing, unless landlord obligated himself to do so. Petty v. Leggett, 38 So. 549 (Miss. 1905).
      </p>
      <p>
       Mules are “supplies,” and taking a separate note for their price, reciting that a lien on them and the crop is retained until it is paid, is not a waiver of the landlord’s lien. Trimble v. Durham, 70 Miss. 295, 12 So. 207, 1892 Miss. LEXIS 104 (Miss. 1892).
      </p>
      <p>
       The lien does not exist if the landlord merely guarantees the payment for supplies advanced by another. The relation of creditor and debtor must exist between the landlord and tenant to support the lien. Ellis v. Jones, 70 Miss. 60, 11 So. 566, 1892 Miss. LEXIS 55 (Miss. 1892).
      </p>

       Where lands were rented to several tenants under their agreements to pay one-third of the cotton and seed, with the landlord paying one-third of the cost of fertilizer, poison and ginning, the relationship of landlord and tenant came into existence and title to and possession of the crop was vested in the tenant, subject to the landlord’s paramount lien to secure the payment of rent. Lewis v. Latham, 224 Miss. 107, 79 So. 2d 811, 1955 Miss. LEXIS 466 (Miss. 1955).

      <p>
       Where former litigation between the parties to a deed of trust and the decree therein established that the parties were claiming title to the land in question adversely to each other, the relation of landlord and tenant necessary to found a landlord’s lien for agricultural products grown on the land during such period of litigation did not exist; and the record in such litigation was an estoppel on the mortgagee to claim that relation. Riley v. Hardy, 185 Miss. 765, 189 So. 514, 1939 Miss. LEXIS 187 (Miss. 1939).
      </p>
      <p>

       A contract that one of the parties is to furnish the other a dwelling house for himself and family with adjacent lands, and with teams and utensils, and that such other is to cultivate the land and pay one-half the crop for the use of the property, creates the relation of landlord and tenant.

        7. Rights and liabilities of purchasers of agricultural products.
       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       Landlord’s lien on agricultural products as security for unpaid rent is paramount to rights of purchaser of warehouse receipts for product issued in tenant’s name in absence of proof that tenant has dealt honestly with his landlord. Phillips v. Box, 204 Miss. 231, 37 So. 2d 266, 1948 Miss. LEXIS 358 (Miss. 1948).
      </p>
      <p>
       Bona fide purchaser of warehouse receipts held to acquire stored cotton free from landlord’s lien. McGee v. Carver, 141 Miss. 463, 106 So. 760, 1926 Miss. LEXIS 444 (Miss. 1926).
      </p>
      <p>
       Purchaser of cotton from tenant held liable to landlord for rent. Walker-Durr Co. v. Mitchell, 97 Miss. 231, 52 So. 583, 1910 Miss. LEXIS 248 (Miss. 1910).
      </p>
      <p>
       A landlord has a lien to secure his rent and supplies for the current year on all agricultural products raised on the leased premises and may assert it against the products or the purchaser, with or without notice of such products. Ball, Brown & Co. v. Sledge, 82 Miss. 749, 35 So. 447, 1903 Miss. LEXIS 203 (Miss. 1903); Tennessee Joint Stock Land Bank v. Bank of Greenwood, 179 Miss. 534, 172 So. 323, 1937 Miss. LEXIS 2 (Miss. 1937).
      </p>
      <p>
       The lien does not follow the agricultural products out of the state, and one who purchases them out of the state takes free of the lien, although he had notice of its existence. Millsaps v. Tate, 75 Miss. 150, 21 So. 663, 1897 Miss. LEXIS 86 (Miss. 1897); Ball, Brown & Co. v. Sledge, 82 Miss. 749, 35 So. 447, 1903 Miss. LEXIS 203 (Miss. 1903).
      </p>
      <p>
       A commission merchant in another state who has made advances to a planter and received and sold in good faith cotton shipped by him for his account, is not answerable for the proceeds thereof to one who had a landlord’s lien on the cotton when shipped. Chism v. Thomson, 73 Miss. 410, 19 So. 210, 1895 Miss. LEXIS 152 (Miss. 1895).
      </p>
      <p>
       A purchaser of agricultural products grown on land in the adverse possession of another is not liable to account to the true owner of the land for the value of such products, even though he knew at the time he bought them of the want of title to the land of the occupant and who was the real owner of the land. Morgan v. Long, 73 Miss. 406, 19 So. 98, 1895 Miss. LEXIS 130 (Miss. 1895).
      </p>
      <p>
       Neither ignorance as to the tenancy by a purchaser, nor false statement by the tenant as to his right to sell will defeat the landlord’s claim. Warren v. Jones, 70 Miss. 202, 14 So. 25, 1892 Miss. LEXIS 145 (Miss. 1892).
      </p>
      <p>
       The landlord’s right to recover from one to whom the agricultural products grown on the demised premises have been sold by the tenant is not affected by want of notice by the purchaser that the rent is due; the rule of caveat emptor applies. Eason v. Johnson, 69 Miss. 371, 12 So. 446, 1891 Miss. LEXIS 114 (Miss. 1891).
      </p>
      <p>
       The lien will prevail against a bona fide purchaser for value. Newman v. Bank of Greenville, 66 Miss. 323, 5 So. 753, 1889 Miss. LEXIS 103 (Miss. 1889); W. L. Robinson Co. v. Weathersby, 101 Miss. 724, 57 So. 983, 1911 Miss. LEXIS 146 (Miss. 1911).
      </p>
      <p>
       It being a crime for a person with notice of the lien to remove the products from the leased premises without the landlord’s consent, the landlord can maintain an action for damages against the purchaser with notice of products subject to the lien for rent, etc. Cohn v. Smith, 64 Miss. 816, 2 So. 244, 1887 Miss. LEXIS 110 (Miss. 1887).

      <p>
       A landlord did not waive her right to the statutory landlord’s lien merely because the lease contract did not specifically refer to the landlord’s lien statute since the landlord’s lien exists by positive law without writing or record. Planters Bank & Trust Co. v. Sklar, 555 So. 2d 1024, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 1 (Miss. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       A landlord’s conduct did not constitute a waiver of the landlord’s lien, even though the landlord permitted the lessee to harvest, market and sell the crops as he saw fit, where, for the most part, rent was paid prior to the harvest and sale of crops, and the lender had actual notice of its debtor’s landlord/tenant relationship. Planters Bank & Trust Co. v. Sklar, 555 So. 2d 1024, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 1 (Miss. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       A landlord’s lien under this section [Code 1942, § 908] can be waived. Martin v. Leflore Bank & Trust Co., 220 Miss. 106, 70 So. 2d 66, 1954 Miss. LEXIS 414 (Miss. 1954).
      </p>
      <p>
       Proof of waiver of landlord’s lien on agricultural products for rent must be established by preponderant testimony which affirmatively shows an agreement by landlord, or conduct tantamount thereto, that tenant may deal with product as if free of any lien. Phillips v. Box, 204 Miss. 231, 37 So. 2d 266, 1948 Miss. LEXIS 358 (Miss. 1948).
      </p>
      <p>
       Waiver of landlord’s lien in favor of purchaser of warehouse receipts for product, issued in tenant’s name, is not shown by evidence that landlord accepted farm equipment as part payment of rent and offered to accept tenant’s notes for balance, which offer tenant ignored and had cotton crop ginned, baled and placed in warehouse taking warehouse receipts in his own name and selling warehouse receipts, all without knowledge of landlord who attached cotton promptly after locating it in warehouse. Phillips v. Box, 204 Miss. 231, 37 So. 2d 266, 1948 Miss. LEXIS 358 (Miss. 1948).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence held to establish that landlord did not, by its conduct, impliedly permit tenant to store cotton in compress, take warehouse receipts therefor in tenant’s name, and dispose of receipts, so as to waive landlord’s lien on cotton. Tennessee Joint Stock Land Bank v. Bank of Greenwood, 179 Miss. 534, 172 So. 323, 1937 Miss. LEXIS 2 (Miss. 1937).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence held not to warrant finding that landlord clothed tenant with indicia of ownership of cotton, or was negligent, or lacking in vigilance, so as to be estopped from asserting lien on cotton as against bona fide purchasers of negotiable warehouse receipts, issued in name of tenant, for cotton. Tennessee Joint Stock Land Bank v. Bank of Greenwood, 179 Miss. 534, 172 So. 323, 1937 Miss. LEXIS 2 (Miss. 1937).
      </p>
      <p>
       To effect waiver of landlord’s lien on agricultural products, evidence must preponderate that landlord either affirmatively agreed to permit, or by his conduct and course of pleadings permitted, tenant to deal with agricultural products as though they had been freed from landlord’s lien. Tennessee Joint Stock Land Bank v. Bank of Greenwood, 179 Miss. 534, 172 So. 323, 1937 Miss. LEXIS 2 (Miss. 1937).
      </p>
      <p>
       Waiver of lien of rent held limited, and to give no right to buy from tenant. Pitts v. Baskin, 140 Miss. 443, 106 So. 10, 1925 Miss. LEXIS 278 (Miss. 1925).
      </p>
      <p>
       Landlord held estopped to assert lien on crops. Judd v. Delta Grocery & Cotton Co., 133 Miss. 866, 98 So. 243, 1923 Miss. LEXIS 191 (Miss. 1923).
      </p>
      <p>
       Landlord who habitually permits sharecrop tenant to sell products cannot enforce landlord’s lien against or recover value of products from good faith purchaser. Phillips v. Thomas, 128 Miss. 729, 91 So. 420, 1922 Miss. LEXIS 160 (Miss. 1922).
      </p>
      <p>
       Landlord permitting tenant to sell cotton and receiving rent from proceeds, held estopped to assert lien for advances where he gave no notice thereof to purchaser. A. C. Seavey & Sons v. Godbold, 99 Miss. 113, 54 So. 838, 1910 Miss. LEXIS 23 (Miss. 1910).
      </p>
      <p>
       A landlord who has waived his lien in favor of one who advances supplies to the tenant on the security of a trust deed on his cotton crop, after receiving from the tenant four bales and mingling them with his own, is estopped to deny that a bale of cotton seized by the trustee was grown by the tenant on the premises. Alexander v. Zeigler, 84 Miss. 560, 36 So. 536, 1904 Miss. LEXIS 64 (Miss. 1904).
      </p>
      <p>
       A landlord who waives his lien for a specified sum to enable his tenant to secure advances from another by a deed of trust on his crops is bound by the waiver, although the deed of trust recites that the advances were to be used in making crops on other lands also and does not expressly require advances to the full extent of the waiver. Dreyfus v. W. A. Gage & Co., 84 Miss. 219, 36 So. 248, 1904 Miss. LEXIS 29 (Miss. 1904).

   Two lessors did not have priority over a bank with a perfected lien on a lessee’s government payments, even though the bank had actual notice of the leases before it loaned money to the lessee as: (1) Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.75.html#t75c09s75-9-109ol1a2" target="_blank">75-9-109(a)(2)</a></cite> applied to agricultural liens; (2) perfection of agricultural liens was required under Miss.

Pair A Dice Farms, Inc. v. InSouth Bank of Covington, 118 So.3d 165, 2012 Miss. App. LEXIS 802 (Miss. Ct. App. 2012), cert. denied, 2013 Miss. LEXIS 387 (Miss.

      </p>
      <p>
       Unless the crop lender has taken steps to subordinate a landlord’s statutory priority, the landlord’s interest in the proceeds of a crop sale will be paramount to the crop lender who receives the proceeds. The landlord has the inside track in a priority clash over the proceeds of a crop sale. Planters Bank & Trust Co. v. Sklar, 555 So. 2d 1024, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 1 (Miss. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless a landlord has expressly or impliedly waived the statutory landlord’s lien, its rights are superior to all other interests, including those created by Chapter 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code. Planters Bank & Trust Co. v. Sklar, 555 So. 2d 1024, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 1 (Miss. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the bank advances money to a tenant who with the landlord gave the bank a trust deed and the landlord taking a subordinate trust deed to tenant’s farm machinery and equipment and later the bank without knowledge of the landlord advanced more money to the tenant for the operation of the farm, and the tenant paid the bank from proceeds of sale of crops, the bank applying the proceeds on the first loan and also on loan advanced without knowledge of landlord, the landlord had a superior lien on the crops because the bank was not authorized to apply proceeds on the loan made without knowledge of landlord. Cavins v. Planters Bank & Trust Co., 187 F.2d 906, 1951 U.S. App. LEXIS 2339 (5th Cir. Miss. 1951).

   In order for a landlord to enforce the statutorily-created lien on a tenant’s personal property, he or she must follow the attachment for rent statutes (§§<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t89c07s89-7-55" target="_self">89-7-55</a></cite> through<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t89c07s89-7-125" target="_self">89-7-125</a></cite>).

       Render of judgment in favor of a tenant on the tenant’s unlawful-reentry issue was appropriate because the evidence showed that the landlord acted without authority in using self-help to reenter the leased property, as the lease did not provide for such action, and failed to provide the tenant with a notice and hearing before reentering the property.

       An assignee of notes given by a tenant to his landlord for rent cannot assert his lien against one who makes advances to the tenant on the security of the landlord’s waiver and the tenant’s trust deed on the crops when he has concealed his ownership of the notes and induced him to believe that the landlord’s waiver and the tenant’s trust deed will give him first lien.

       Render of judgment in favor of a tenant on the tenant’s unlawful-reentry issue was appropriate because the evidence showed that the landlord acted without authority in using self-help to reenter the leased property, as the lease did not provide for such action, and failed to provide the tenant with a notice and hearing before reentering the property. Crowell v. Butts, 153 So.3d 719, 2013 Miss. App. LEXIS 866 (Miss. Ct. App. 2013), cert. denied, 145 So.3d 674, 2014 Miss.

       The statute only covers a demand for rent. An agreement of the tenant as part of the expressed consideration of the lease, to pay as rent a debt which is not such in fact, will not change this. Paxton v. Kennedy, 70 Miss. 865, 12 So. 546, 1893 Miss. LEXIS 2 (Miss. 1893).

      The affidavit for an attachment for rent and supplies, or either, may be in the following form, viz.:
     </p>
     <p>
      “State of Mississippi, County. “Before me, , a justice of the peace of the County of , came , who, being duly sworn, says on oath: That [the tenant] is indebted to him [or if the affidavit be made by an agent or attorney, strike out ‘him’ and insert the name of the landlord or person to whom the rent is due, and add after the landlord’s name, ‘of whom the affiant is agent’] in the sum of dollars for rent in arrears [or if the rent be not due, strike out the words ‘in arrears,’ and insert ‘to become due on the day of , A.D. ’] by virtue of a lease for the term commencing on the day of , A.D. , and ending on the day of , A.D. of land situated in County, and described as [here describe the leased premises; it is well to describe by name, if it has one, or by its occupants, and if such be the case it would be well to say ‘and occupied by said , tenant, during the year ’]. “And the said , the tenant, is further indebted to affiant [or if the oath be made by an agent or attorney, strike out ‘affiant’ and insert the name of the landlord or person to whom the debt is due] in the further sum of dollars, now due [if the debt be not due, strike out the words ‘now due,’ and insert ‘to become due on the day of , A.D.’] of which supplies a bill of particulars is attached hereto. Affiant [or if made by an agent or attorney, say ‘affiant’s said principal’] claims a lie the following agricultural products raised during the year , on the said leased premises [here describe the products, giving their location, if known, for the officer’s guidance]. “Sworn to and subscribed before me, this the day of , A.D. , J.P.”

     <p>
      If the attachment be for rent only, strike out all relating to supplies; and if the claim be for supplies only, strike out all relating to the sum due for rent, and alter the form to suit the case.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the claim be not due, add to the form the following words: “And affiant has just cause to suspect, and does verily believe that the said tenant will remove [or has removed, as the case may be] his effects from said leased premises before said claim [or claims] be or shall become due, so that a distress or seizure cannot be made therefor, or so as to impair the landlord’s lien on the agricultural products raised on the premises.”
     </p>
     <p>
      If the rent be for part of the crop, or other thing than money, the affidavit should state it as it is, giving the money value of what is due.

     <p>
      The tenant, his executor or administrator, may replevy the agricultural products or other property distrained, at any time before the sale thereof, by giving bond with one or more sufficient sureties, to be approved by the officer in whose custody the property may be, payable to the party in whose name or right the distress or seizure was made, in a penalty double the amount distrained for or double the value of the property seized, where the value is less than the amount distrained for, conditioned to prosecute his suit against the obligee in the bond for the property, and to perform the judgment of the court in such suit, in case he shall fail therein. Upon the delivery of such bond to the officer having control of the property, he shall deliver the same to the party giving the bond, and shall return the bond and the writ of attachment, with a statement of his proceedings, to the clerk of the circuit court if the value of the property or amount distrained for exceed Two Hundred Dollars ($200.00), and to the justice of the peace who issued the attachment if neither the amount claimed nor the value of the property exceed Two Hundred Dollars ($200.00); and he shall summon the party in whose name or right the distress or seizure was made, to appear at the next term of the court to which return of the attachment and bond shall be made, to answer the suit of the person replevying the property; and the officer shall make his return of having summoned such party on the papers by him returned to the court.

    Replevin of property by strangers.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      When any person other than the tenant shall claim to be the owner of any property distrained or seized for rent or supplies, he may make affidavit that said property is his, and not the property of the tenant, and not held to the use of the tenant in any manner whatever, and is not liable to such distress or seizure. If he desire immediate possession of said property, he shall give bond, with sufficient sureties, in the manner directed for the tenant, and such affidavit and bond shall be delivered to the officer who made the distress, who shall deliver the property to the claimant. Such claim may be interposed without giving bond, and the same proceedings shall be had thereon, except that the property claimed shall not be delivered to the claimant, but shall be disposed of as in the case of replevy by the tenant. Upon such claim being made, the landlord may release the property so claimed and forthwith distrain or seize other property in lieu thereof.

      <p>
       This section is not a basis for holding a landlord negligent per se for all housing code violations, and such an interpretation would lead to inequitable and extreme results. Sweatt v. Murphy, 733 So. 2d 207, 1999 Miss. LEXIS 43 (Miss. 1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because the Residential Landlord and Tenant Act informed the Mississippi Supreme Court’s decision to hold that a warranty of habitability applied to residential leases, after concluding that such warranty would apply to mobile home lots, a court denied property management companies’ motion for summary judgment in a tenant’s suit to recover damages for personal injuries that he sustained when he tripped over a broken sidewalk in front of his rented lot; although the tenant had signed a lease stating that he was responsible for making all repairs, whether the tenant waived the warranty of habitability was a question for the jury. Moorman v. Tower Mgmt. Co., 451 F. Supp. 2d 846, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 67246 (S.D. Miss. 2006).

      <p>
       Construing the term “re-subdivided” most strongly against the homeowners and in favor of the developer, the prohibition that the lots were not to be re-subdivided meant that the platted lots were not to be divided into smaller tracts of land and then re-platted as a subdivision, and it would be unreasonable to find that the covenant drafters intended that a lot owner, who alienated a portion of a lot without assigning it a separate lot number, was engaged in prohibited re-subdividing, especially so in light of the covenant’s allowance of multi-family residential structures on the lots, which contemplated more than one property owner per lot; the evidence before the chancellor pertaining to the definition of multi-family residential use was that it included condominiums. COR Devs., LLC v. College Hill Heights Homeowners, LLC, 973 So. 2d 273, 2008 Miss. App. LEXIS 31 (Miss. Ct. App. 2008).

    Condominium constitutes real property.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      A condominium is an estate in real property consisting of an undivided interest in common in a portion of a parcel of real property together with a separate interest in space in a residential, industrial, or commercial building on such real property, such as an apartment, office, or store. A condominium may include in addition a separate interest in other portions of such real property.
     </p>
     <p>
      Such estate may, with respect to the duration of its enjoyment, be in fee simple, leasehold or any other estate in real property recognized by law.

      The provisions of this chapter shall apply to property divided or to be divided into condominiums only if there shall be recorded in the office of the chancery clerk in the county in which such property lies a plan consisting of (a) a description or survey map of the surface of the land included within the project, (b) diagrammatic floor plans of the building or buildings built or to be built thereon in sufficient detail to identify each unit, its relative location and approximate dimensions, and (c) a certificate consenting to the recordation of such plan pursuant to this chapter signed and acknowledged by the record owner of such real property and all record holders of security interests therein. Such plan may be amended or revoked by a subsequently acknowledged recorded instrument executed by the record owner of such real property and by all record holders of security interests therein. Until such recordation of a revocation, the provisions of this chapter shall continue to apply to such real property.

     </h3>
     <p>
      A reasonable assessment upon any condominium made in accordance with a recorded declaration of restrictions permitted by Section 89-9-17 shall be a debt of the owner thereof at the time the assessment is made. The amount of any such assessment plus any other charges thereon, such as interest, costs, attorneys’ fees, and penalties, as such may be provided for in the declaration of restrictions, shall be and become a lien upon the condominium assessed when the management body causes to be recorded in the office of the chancery clerk of the county in which such condominium is located a notice of assessment, which shall state the amount of such assessment and such other charges thereon as may be authorized by the declaration of restrictions, a description of the condominium against which the same has been assessed, and the name of the record owner thereof. Such notice shall be signed and verified by an authorized representative of the management body or as otherwise provided in the declaration of restrictions. Such lien shall be recorded in a condominium lien book alphabetically by name of the condominium unit owner, and such books need not be obtained until a condominium plat shall have been first recorded in said county. Upon payment of said assessment and charges in connection with which such notice has been so recorded, or other satisfaction thereof, the management body shall cause to be recorded a further notice stating the satisfaction and the release of the lien thereof.
     </p>
     <p>
      Such lien shall be prior to all other liens recorded subsequent to the recordation of said notice of assessment except that the declaration of restrictions may provide for the subordination thereof to any other liens and encumbrances. Unless sooner satisfied and released, or the enforcement thereof initiated as hereafter provided, such lien shall expire and be of no further force or effect one year from the date of recordation of said notice of assessment; provided, however, that said one-year period may be extended by the management body for a time not to exceed one (1) additional year by recording a written extension thereof.
     </p>
     <p>
      Such lien against any unit may be enforced by sale of same by the management body, its attorney or other person authorized to make the sale, after failure of the owner to pay such an assessment in accordance with its terms, such sale to be conducted in accordance with the provisions of Section 89-1-55, applicable to the exercise of powers of sale in mortgages and deeds of trust, or in any other manner permitted by law. Unless otherwise provided in the declaration of restrictions, the management body shall have power to bid in the condominium at foreclosure sale and to hold, lease, mortgage and convey the same. Suit to recover a money judgment for unpaid assessments may be maintained without waiving the lien securing the same.

If the personal property of a deceased owner of escheated property be insufficient for the payment of his debts and the costs so allowed by the court, or if there be no personal property, the court shall decree the real estate subject to the payment of the costs so allowed, and shall order the sale of a sufficiency thereof for that purpose, and require any balance of proceeds to be paid into the state treasury through the land office.

       Subject to the provisions of Section 89-12-17, and except as otherwise provided in subsections (2) and (5) of this section, stock or other intangible ownership interest in a business association which is held by the association, the existence of which is evidenced by records available to the association, is presumed abandoned if a dividend, distribution or other sum payable as a result of the interest has remained unclaimed by the owner for five (5) years and during that time the owner has not:

        <li id="t89c12s89-12-11ol11a">

If five (5) dividends, distributions or other sums are paid during the five-year period, the time period leading to a presumption of abandonment commences on the date that payment of the first unclaimed dividend, distribution or other sum became due and payable. If five (5) dividends, distributions or other sums are not paid during the presumptive period, the period continues to run until there have been five (5) dividends, distributions or other sums that have not been claimed by the owner.

     <p>
      Persons owning adjoining land or lots, or being lessees thereof for more than two (2) years, shall be bound to contribute equally to the erection of fences on the line dividing the land or lots, if the land or lots on their respective sides be used by the owner or lessee thereof for purposes of cultivation, or for horticultural purposes, or for the purpose of pasturing cattle, horses, hogs or sheep, or if a lot be used as an inclosure for any other purpose; and each party shall be bound to contribute equally toward keeping the party fences in good repair so long as the land or lot be so used. An owner shall not be bound to contribute to the erection of a party fence, either built or to be built, or to keeping the same in repair, who may prefer to build a fence and to leave a lane on his land between himself and the adjoining owner. But the failure to erect such fence for the space of sixty (60) days shall be deemed an abandonment of the intention to do so, and a determination to adopt the fence built, and the person so failing shall then be bound to pay his proportion of the value of the party fence.

   There was no evidence that a fence that was constructed between the parties’ properties was in fact a party fence within the meaning of Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t89c13s89-13-1" target="_self">89-13-1</a></cite>. Therefore, the chancery court erred in requiring plaintiffs to reimburse defendants for the cost of the fence that defendants constructed. Varnell v. Rogers, 198 So.3d 1278, 2016 Miss. App. LEXIS 230 (Miss. Ct. App. 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       A yard fence erected along the line of a city lot by one of the adjoining landowner’s predecessors in title, without any contribution from the other adjoining landowner or his predecessor in title, was not a party fence. Hunter v. Williams, 230 Miss. 72, 92 So. 2d 367, 1957 Miss. LEXIS 346 (Miss. 1957).
      </p>
      <p>
       Making of slight repairs on fence by adjoining landowner and giving of notice not to interfere would not constitute such fence a “party fence.” Evans v. State, 159 Miss. 870, 132 So. 455, 1931 Miss. LEXIS 69 (Miss. 1931).
      </p>
      <p>
       That adjoining landowners may have owned land by adverse possession up to fence would not of itself constitute such fence a “party fence.” Evans v. State, 159 Miss. 870, 132 So. 455, 1931 Miss. LEXIS 69 (Miss. 1931).
      </p>
      <p>
       Line fence does not become “party fence” unless provisions of statute are complied with so that each party owns interest in adjoining land and fence. Evans v. State, 159 Miss. 870, 132 So. 455, 1931 Miss. LEXIS 69 (Miss. 1931).
      </p>
      <p>
       An agreement between adjoining owners for the construction of a dividing line fence at the cost of both is not within the statute of frauds. Berry v. Jones, 106 Miss. 115, 63 So. 341, 1913 Miss. LEXIS 112 (Miss. 1913).

      If any person, being requested to do so, will not contribute his proper share of the work and furnish the requisite materials suitable for a party fence, or pay the value of his share, the person desiring to build the fence may erect or construct the whole of it, of a proper and suitable kind, being a lawful fence, and may thereafter apply, in writing, to a justice of the peace, who shall appoint three (3) impartial freeholders of the neighborhood to view the fence and determine what amount should be paid by the person who has failed to contribute.

       It is not a valid objection to the reconstruction of a party wall, weakened by fire, that one of the parties will be inconvenienced by the construction, or that the wall as it stood was sufficient for such party’s own use. Lexington Lodge v. Beal, 94 Miss. 521, 49 So. 833, 1909 Miss. LEXIS 379 (Miss. 1909).
      </p>
      <p>
       Each purchaser of either lot on which a party wall has been placed, has the right to assume that any compensation as between their vendors has been paid. Mayer v. Martin, 83 Miss. 322, 35 So. 218, 1903 Miss. LEXIS 47 (Miss. 1903).
      </p>
      <p>
       The verbal agreement of a lot owner to pay one-half of the cost of a wall to be built by an adjoining owner does not run with the land and is not enforceable by the vendee of such adjoining owner. Mayer v. Martin, 83 Miss. 322, 35 So. 218, 1903 Miss. LEXIS 47 (Miss. 1903).
      </p>
      <p>
       A wall built upon a dividing line of two separate proprietors, partly on the land of each, is a party wall, which means a solid wall, and one of the proprietors has no right to cut windows in such wall above the roof of the other. Weems v. Mayfield, 75 Miss. 286, 22 So. 892, 1897 Miss. LEXIS 124 (Miss. 1897).
      </p>
      <p>
       A verbal agreement between two proprietors that a division wall, built partly upon the land of each, shall be the sole property of one of them is void under Code 1892, § 2434 [Code 1942, § 832]. Weems v. Mayfield, 75 Miss. 286, 22 So. 892, 1897 Miss. LEXIS 124 (Miss. 1897).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because of the writing a contemporaneous parol agreement by such grantor to build a wall cannot be shown. Money v. Peavy, 70 Miss. 260, 12 So. 334, 1892 Miss. LEXIS 118 (Miss. 1892).
      </p>
      <p>
       To recite in a deed as a part of the consideration, that the vendees or any subsequent owner of the land conveyed, “shall have the right of uniting with and using the south wall which may be erected thereon” is not to stipulate that the wall shall or will be built, and the grantors are not liable in damages for failure to erect one. Money v. Peavy, 70 Miss. 260, 12 So. 334, 1892 Miss. LEXIS 118 (Miss. 1892).

       This section [Code 1942, § 1001] authorizes verbal contracts between persons who own adjacent lots for erecting partition walls and does not apply to contracts whereby parties are negotiating to become such owners. Money v. Peavy, 70 Miss. 260, 12 So. 334, 1892 Miss. LEXIS 118 (Miss. 1892).

      A person shall not be at liberty to join or use a wall as a party-wall without first paying to the owner thereof one-half (1/2) the value of so much as may be used; and if the parties cannot agree as to the value, either may apply to the mayor, police justice of the city, town or village, or to any justice of the peace of the county, in writing, for the appointment of suitable persons to assess the amount to be paid; and such mayor or police justice or justice of the peace shall thereupon appoint three (3) mechanics skilled in the description of work, who, or a majority of whom, shall examine the wall, and assess the amount to be paid to the owner thereof, and give a certificate of such examination and assessment to the party at whose instance they were appointed. The opposite party shall have five (5) days’ notice of the time of the meeting of the appraisers, and their names, which notice may be served as a summons is required by law to be served. On payment or tender of the amount assessed, the party desiring to use the wall may proceed to do so.

       § 89-21-3.
    Right to disclaim interest in property.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      A person, or the representative of a person, to whom an interest in or with respect to property or an interest therein devolves by whatever means may disclaim it in whole or in part by delivering or filing a written disclaimer under this chapter. The right to disclaim exists notwithstanding (a) any limitation on the interest of the disclaimant in the nature of a spendthrift provision or similar restriction or (b) any restriction or limitation on the right to disclaim contained in the governing instrument. For purposes of this section, the “representative of a person” includes an executor of a decedent’s estate, an administrator of a decedent’s estate, a conservator of a disabled person, a guardian of a minor or incapacitated person, and an agent acting on behalf of the person within the authority of a power of attorney. For purposes of this section, the term “governing instrument” means a deed, will, trust, insurance or annuity policy, account with POD designation, security registered in beneficiary form (TOD), pension, profit-sharing, retirement, or similar benefit plan or instrument creating or exercising a power of appointment or a power of attorney, or a dispositive, appointive or nominative instrument of any similar type.

The disclaimer must be filed in the chancery court of the county in which proceedings for the administration of the estate of the deceased owner or deceased donee of the power have been commenced.

       § 89-23-5.
    Holder defined; rights and obligations; subordination of rights.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Any person, including a person that owns an interest in the real property, a municipality or other unit of local government, may be a holder. An environmental covenant may identify more than one (1) holder. The interest of a holder is an interest in real property.
     </p>
     <p>
      A right of an agency under this chapter or under an environmental covenant is not an interest in real property. Nothing in this chapter authorizes the commission to act as a holder.
     </p>
     <p>
      An agency is bound by any obligation it assumes in an environmental covenant, but an agency does not assume obligations merely by signing or approving an environmental covenant. Any other person that signs an environmental covenant is bound by the obligations the person assumes in the covenant, but signing the covenant does not change obligations, rights, or protections granted or imposed under law other than this chapter except as provided in the covenant.
     </p>
     <p>
      The following rules apply to interests in real property in existence at the time an environmental covenant is created or amended:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t89c23s89-23-5ol11">
       An interest that has priority under other law is not affected by an environmental covenant unless the person that owns the interest subordinates that interest to the covenant.
      </li>
      <li id="t89c23s89-23-5ol12">
       This chapter does not require a person that owns a prior interest to subordinate that interest to an environmental covenant or to agree to be bound by the covenant.
      </li>
      <li id="t89c23s89-23-5ol13">
       A subordination agreement may be contained in an environmental covenant covering real property or in a separate record. If the environmental covenant covers commonly owned property in a common interest community, the record may be signed by any person authorized by the governing board of the owners’ association.
      </li>
      <li id="t89c23s89-23-5ol14">
       An agreement by a person to subordinate a prior interest to an environmental covenant affects the priority of that person’s interest but does not by itself impose any affirmative obligation on the person with respect to the environmental covenant.
      </li>

      <li id="t89c23s89-23-7ol11">
       State that the instrument is an environmental covenant executed pursuant to this chapter;

      </li>
      <li id="t89c23s89-23-7ol13">
       Describe the activity and use limitations on the real property;
      </li>
      <li id="t89c23s89-23-7ol14">
       Identify every holder;
      </li>
      <li id="t89c23s89-23-7ol15">
       Be signed by the agency, every holder, and unless waived by the agency, every owner of the fee simple of the real property subject to the covenant;
      </li>
      <li id="t89c23s89-23-7ol16">
       Be signed by the commission, unless the commission waives participation; and

       Identify the name and location of any administrative record for the environmental response project reflected in the environmental covenant.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      In addition to the information required by subsection (a), an environmental covenant may contain other information, restrictions, and requirements agreed to by the persons who signed it, including any:
     </p>
     <p>
      Requirements for notice following transfer of a specified interest in, or concerning proposed changes in use of, applications for building permits for, or proposals for any site work affecting the contamination on, the property subject to the covenant;
     </p>
     <p>
      Requirements for periodic reporting describing compliance with the covenant;
     </p>
     <p>
      Rights of access to the property granted in connection with implementation or enforcement of the covenant;
     </p>
     <p>
      A brief narrative description of the contamination and remedy, including the contaminants of concern, the pathways of exposure, limits on exposure, and the location and extent of the contamination;
     </p>
     <p>
      Limitation on amendment or termination of the covenant in addition to those contained in Sections 89-23-17 and 89-23-19; and
     </p>
     <p>
      Rights of the holder in addition to its right to enforce the covenant pursuant to Section 89-23-21.

      In addition to other conditions for its approval of an environmental covenant, the agency or the commission may require those persons specified by the agency or commission who have interests in the real property to sign the covenant.

     <p>
      If the commission refuses to sign an environmental covenant, it shall set forth its reasons for refusing to sign in an order and such order may be appealed as provided in Section 49-17-41.

      An environmental covenant that complies with this chapter runs with the land.
     </p>
     <p>
      An environmental covenant that is otherwise effective is valid and enforceable even if:
     </p>

      <li id="t89c23s89-23-9ol11">

     <p>
      An instrument that creates restrictions or obligations with respect to real property that would qualify as activity and use limitations except for the fact that the instrument was recorded before July 1, 2008, is not invalid or unenforceable because of any of the limitations on enforcement of interests described in subsection (b) or because it was identified as an easement, servitude, deed restriction, or other interest. This chapter does not apply in any other respect to such an instrument.
     </p>
     <p>
      This chapter does not invalidate or render unenforceable any interest, whether designated as an environmental covenant or other interest, that is otherwise enforceable under the law of this state.
