       The commerce clause of Constitution does not operate to commit to federal courts or withhold from state court, jurisdiction of all suits relating to regulation, or attempted regulation, of interstate commerce. Southern Bus Lines, Inc. v. Amalgamated Ass'n of Street, etc., 205 Miss. 354, 38 So. 2d 765, 1949 Miss. LEXIS 435 (Miss. 1949).
      </p>
      <p>
       Legislation by Congress under the commerce clause, and administrative orders made in pursuance to such legislation, are controlling both in the state and the Federal courts. Stoner & Co. v. Blocton Export Coal Co., 135 Miss. 390, 100 So. 5, 1924 Miss. LEXIS 42 (Miss. 1924).
      </p>
      <p>
       The commerce clause was designed to prevent each state from legislating with reference to its own interest regardless of the interest of others, and should be so construed as to accomplish that end, and should be limited to that. Stone v. Yazoo & Miss. V. Ry., 62 Miss. 607, 1885 Miss. LEXIS 120 (Miss. 1885).

       By contributing to unitary interstate transaction, radio station’s remote broadcasting activities fell within governance, and hence protections, of commerce clause. Remote broadcasting from Mississippi area entailed transmission of live, promotional messages from premises of advertisers in Mississippi to Alabama station, from which messages were rebroadcast via FCC licensed interstate transmitter to listeners in Alabama and Mississippi. Such remote broadcasting is inseparable from underlying interstate sale of air time. Radio station’s remote broadcasting from Mississippi was not localization where (1) only a single commercial transaction relating to remote broadcasts could be identified, and that was sale of air time to advertiser; (2) remote radio transmissions directly involved the delivery of services across state lines, and (3) services were essential to and inseparable from underlying interstate sales transactions themselves.

       It is well settled by the Federal Supreme Court that in imposing taxes for state purposes a state is not exercising any power which the Federal Constitution has conferred upon Congress, but it is only when the tax operates to regulate commerce between the states or with foreign nations, to an extent which infringes the authority conferred upon Congress, that the tax exceeds the limitations imposed by the Federal Constitution.

       The present trend of judicial decisions in upholding state tax statutes is in favor of a more liberal construction and holding that unless the tax complained of tends to prohibit interstate commerce or place it at a disadvantage in competition with intrastate commerce, it does not violate the commerce clause of the Federal Constitution, and especially where the tax is not on the commerce but is levied on the right to engage in a local activity for the exercise of which local citizens are required to pay.

   Wholesale markup on liquor sold to federal military installations in Mississippi constituted a sales tax, the legal incident of which rested upon instrumentalities of the United States as the purchasers, and therefore the markup was unconstitutional as a tax imposed upon the United States and its instrumentalities. Since the legal incidence of the tax was upon the United States, the federal immunity with respect to sales of liquor to the two exclusively federal enclaves was preserved by § 107(a) of the Buck Act (4 USCS §§ 105-110).

   Decision on former appeal of same case that Use Tax Law of this state is unconstitutional in its requirement that foreign seller collect and pay use tax on goods sold to Mississippi residents when seller is nondomesticated foreign corporation having no place of business or any agent in this state, its only intrastate activity being sending into state of non-resident solicitors to take orders effective only when approved at home office and sales being completed by delivery of goods to common carrier in foreign state, will be adhered to on subsequent appeal, and case does not become new case because state of Tennessee, from which state goods are shipped, is claimed to have relevant Sales Tax Law; because coming to rest in this state feature of original law has been eliminated; or because two salesmen of seller happen to reside in Mississippi for their own personal convenience and not that of employer, since principles controlling law of case doctrine are more binding upon courts than law of precedent.

       Income of a business operating in interstate commerce is not immune from a fairly apportioned state taxation. However, for a state to tax income generated in interstate commerce, the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution require that the tax must be applied to an activity with a substantial nexus with the taxing state, the tax must be fairly apportioned, the tax must not discriminate against interstate commerce, and the tax must be fairly related to services provided by the taxing state.

   The Supreme Court was authorized to treat a criminal defendant’s appeal from a circuit court’s denial of his motion to dismiss the indictment against him on double jeopardy grounds as an appeal from a denial of a writ of habeas corpus under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.11.html#t11c43s11-43-53" target="_blank">11-43-53</a></cite>, or, alternatively, as an application to the Supreme Court for a writ of habeas corpus under §§<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.11.html#t11c43s11-43-7" target="_blank">11-43-7</a></cite> and<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.11.html#t11c43s11-43-9" target="_blank">11-43-9</a></cite>, since the defendant’s double jeopardy claim went beyond his right not to be convicted in that it involved his constitutional right not to be prosecuted for the offense, and therefore the Supreme Court had jurisdiction of the defendant’s appeal under Art. I § 9 of the United States Constitution and Art. 3 § 21 of the Mississippi Constitution, which guarantee the right of habeas corpus. De La Beckwith v. Mississippi, <cite class="us_code">510 U.S. 884</cite>, <cite class="s_court">114 S. Ct. 232</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">126 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 187, 1993 U.S. LEXIS 5961 (U.S. 1993).

       Conditional grant of writ of habeas corpus by federal habeas corpus court simply requires state to release defendant from custody based upon invalid convictions unless he is retried within certain number of days or months; this allows state to retain person in custody pursuant to invalid conviction for this period without releasing him; conditional grant does not prevent state from retrying defendant after expiration of time set in order of court; it only requires that defendant be released from custody on basis of conviction that was vacated; thus, defendant was still properly in custody of State of Mississippi on basis of valid indictment lodged against him and detainers placed on him by other states and jurisdictions.

      <b>
       1.
      </b>
      The executive power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America. He shall hold his office during the term of four years, and, together with the Vice President, chosen for the same term, be elected, as follows:
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       2.
      </b>
      Each State shall appoint, in such manner as the Legislature thereof may direct, a number of electors, equal to the whole number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress: but no Senator or Representative, or person holding an office of trust or profit under the United States, shall be appointed an elector.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       3.
      </b>
      [The electors shall meet in their respective States, and vote by ballot for two persons, of whom one at least shall not be an inhabitant of the same State with themselves. And they shall make a list of all the persons voted for, and of the number of votes for each; which list they shall sign and certify, and transmit sealed to the seat of the Government of the United States, directed to the President of the Senate. The President of the Senate shall, in the presence of the Senate and House of Representatives, open all the certificates, and the votes shall then be counted. The person having the greatest number of votes shall be the President, if such number be a majority of the whole number of electors appointed; and if there be more than one who have such majority, and have an equal number of votes, then the House of Representatives shall immediately choose by ballot one of them for President; and if no person have a majority, then from the five highest on the list the said house shall in like manner choose the president. But in choosing the President, the votes shall be taken by States, the representation from each state having one vote; a quorum for this purpose shall consist of a member or members from two-thirds of the States, and a majority of all the States shall be necessary to a choice. In every case, after the choice of the President, the person having the greatest number of votes of the electors shall be the Vice President. But if there should remain two or more who have equal votes, the senate shall choose from them by ballot the Vice President.]
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       4.
      </b>
      The Congress may determine the time of choosing the electors, and the day on which they shall give their votes; which day shall be the same throughout the United States.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       5.
      </b>
      No person except a natural-born citizen, or a citizen of the United States, at the time of the adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible to the office of President; neither shall any person be eligible to that office who shall not have attained to the age of thirty-five years, and been fourteen years a resident within the United States.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       6.
      </b>
      In case of the removal of the President from office, or of his death, resignation, or inability to discharge the powers and duties of the said office, the same shall devolve on the Vice President, and the Congress may by law provide for the case of removal, death, resignation or inability, both of the President and Vice President, declaring what officer shall then act as President, and such officer shall act accordingly, until the disability be removed, or a President shall be elected.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       7.
      </b>
      The President shall, at stated times, receive for his services, a compensation, which shall neither be increased nor diminished during the period for which he shall have been elected, and he shall not receive within that period any other emolument from the United States, or any of them.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       8.
      </b>
      Before he enter on the execution of his office, he shall take the following oath or affirmation:–“I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.”

       Facial challenges brought by church against city’s ordinance under which church had been denied renovation permit were easily ripe because, first, they were fit for judicial decision because they raised pure questions of law, and second, church would have suffered hardship, including probable losing of its lease and curtailment of its religious exercise rights, if review were delayed. Opulent Life Church v City of Holly Springs, Miss. 697 F.3d 279, U.S. App. LEXIS 20283 (5th Cir. 2012).

       Lawsuit brought by church challenging city’s ordinance under which it had been denied renovation permit did not become moot when on eve of oral argument that city repealed ordinance and replaced it with one which would have banned church altogether from using building it had leased; furthermore, church seeking actual damages and attorney fees ensured actual live controversy. Opulent Life Church v City of Holly Springs, Miss. 697 F.3d 279, U.S. App. LEXIS 20283 (5th Cir. 2012).

       Requirements of U.S. Const. Art. III are not satisfied merely because a party requests a court of the United States to declare its legal rights; plaintiff political party’s attempts to demonstrate actual or threatened injury by (a) declaring its intention, were the statute not in place, to hold closed primaries, (b) asserting a threat of prosecution against it for violating state election law, and (c) protesting its inability to modify party rules without legislative sanction, failed to satisfy its burden to show a case or controversy. Although the party contended its executive committee’s decision to authorize a suit was sufficient to give it standing to challenge the statute, without concrete plans or any objective evidence to demonstrate a “serious interest” in a closed primary, the party suffered no threat of imminent injury. Miss. State Democratic Party v. Barbour, 529 F.3d 538, 2008 U.S. App. LEXIS 11395 (5th Cir. Miss. 2008).
      </p>

       <p>
   Although plaintiff political party unquestionably pleaded a constitutional injury by alleging that Mississippi’s semi-closed primary statute required it to associate with members of the other party during its candidate-selection process, it took no internal steps to limit participation in its primaries to party members and thus could not claim that Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.23.html#t23c15s23-15-575" target="_blank">23-15-575</a></cite> actually had an unconstitutional effect; this lack of “actual controversy” made the case too remote and abstract an inquiry for the proper exercise of the judicial function under U.S. Const. Art. III. Miss. State Democratic Party v. Barbour, 529 F.3d 538, 2008 U.S. App. LEXIS 11395 (5th Cir. Miss. 2008).

   In the context of standing, while any person may file a complaint with the Mississippi Ethics Commission under Mississippi law, only local district attorneys, the Mississippi Attorney General, or the Commission itself may file direct actions in court challenging the ethical conduct of public officials.

   A statute which, as construed by the state courts, makes it a criminal offense to communicate to others views and opinions respecting governmental policies, and prophesies concerning the state of this and other nations, irrespective of whether the communication was with an evil or sinister purpose or advocated or incited subversive action against the nation or state, or threatened any clear and present danger to American institutions or government, denies the liberty guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment.

   Mississippi is required by the United States Constitution, Art. IV, Sec. 1, to give full faith and credit to all final judgments of other states and federal courts unless (1) the foreign judgment was obtained as a result of some false representation without which the judgment would not have been rendered, or (2) the rendering court did not have jurisdiction over the parties or the subject matter; however, in order to challenge a foreign judgment on this ground, it is necessary that the challenge be timely and properly filed in Mississippi pursuant to §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.15.html#t15c01s15-1-45" target="_blank">15-1-45</a></cite>.

       Hospital showed that a foreign judgment confirming an arbitration award in favor of a staffing company was invalid on the ground that the arbitrator and the Missouri court lacked personal jurisdiction over it because the contract and lease affirmatively showed that the hospital was not the entity that contracted with the company; the lease established that during the contract period, the county board of supervisors had leased the hospital facility to a private entity and had ceased operating it.

       Doctor enrolled the New Mexico judgment on March 3, 1999, and the clerk mailed notice of the enrollment on that date, and the attorney then had 20 days to contest the enrollment of the judgment; where the attorney’s response was filed on April 28, 1999, outside the 20-day limit, the attorney’s defenses to the enrollment which alleged false representations by the doctor were not properly before the trial court. Schwartz v. Hynum, 933 So. 2d 1039, 2006 Miss. App. LEXIS 521 (Miss. Ct. App. 2006).

       Doctrine of comity, which gives effect to laws and judicial decision of other courts beyond that mandated by full faith and credit clause, would not be considered, where non-forum court lacked subject matter jurisdiction. Harrison v. Boyd Mississippi, Inc., 700 So. 2d 247, 1997 Miss. LEXIS 235 (Miss. 1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       In order for full faith and credit to apply, the foreign court must have addressed the merits of the case in rendering its judgment. However, this general rule does not apply if the rendering court did not have jurisdiction over the parties or the subject matter or if the foreign judgment itself was obtained as a result of some false representation without which the judgment would not have been rendered. If a foreign judgment is collaterally attacked on subject matter grounds, the court may consider extrinsic evidence only to show that the foreign judgment is void. When the attack is on grounds of extrinsic fraud, a distinction must be made between fraud involving the merits and fraud which enables a party to procure a judgment that he or she otherwise would not have obtained. Davis v. Davis, 558 So. 2d 814, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 19 (Miss. 1990).

       Chancery Court has jurisdiction to hear and adjudicate controversy involving validity and effect of power of attorney, which has not been acknowledged and recorded in manner of conveyance of land, with respect to conveyance of real property situated in Republic of Greece where all parties reside in Mississippi and have been effectively subjected to in personam jurisdiction of Chancery Court; court may enter personal judgment, even though controlling substantive law is that of Greece; final adjudication would effectively bind parties in Mississippi and presumably in all other states even though adjudication may not be enforceable in Greece as matter of right and maybe not even as matter of comity.

       Where jurisdiction of a foreign court or that of a state is brought into question in a suit in courts of another state or sovereignty, the law of the forum is controlling upon the question of jurisdiction of the court rendering the judgment.

       Where at the time of rendering judgment assessing certain policy holders, the Texas court had jurisdiction of the subject matter of the class suit by the statutory receiver for an unincorporated reciprocal insurance exchange, but did not have territorial jurisdiction of the person of the defendant who then lived in Mississippi, and who was not served with process except by mailing of the same to him at his place of residence, the court did not err in refusing to give full faith and credit to the judgment when defendant was sued in Mississippi. Wheeler v. Kight, 233 Miss. 425, 102 So. 2d 374, 1958 Miss. LEXIS 398 (Miss. 1958).
      </p>
      <p>
       Records and proceedings of courts of other states are entitled to full faith and credit only insofar as such courts have jurisdiction of the subject matter and the parties, and facts necessary to give jurisdiction to the court rendering judgment may be inquired into.

   Where on former appeals, terminating in a decision by the Federal Supreme Court, the point raised by demurrer to insurer’s plea involved the question whether a provision in a fidelity bond requiring any claim thereunder to be made within 15 months after the termination of the suretyship, was subject to the law of Tennessee where the contract was made at a time when the insured was then located in Tennessee, or subject to the laws of Mississippi, to which insured had removed and where the defalcation occurred, and resulted in a determination that the laws of Tennessee governed, such determination did not preclude subsequent litigation as to the effect of such provision under Tennessee decisions as being a condition precedent to liability of the insurer or merely a postponement of the right to sue.

       One qualification to rule requiring Mississippi Courts to give full faith and credit to final judgments of all other states and federal courts is that if foreign judgment itself was obtained as result of some false representation without which judgment would not have been rendered, and of such nature that court of that state would relieve judgment debtor from its effect, court of Mississippi may refuse to enforce it; it is not fraud involving merits of case which may be attacked, but fraud that enables party to procure judgment he otherwise would not have obtained.

   An ex-husband’s filing of a suit in tort against his ex-wife was not a proper response to her attempt to enforce foreign judgments for unpaid child support and attorney’s fees, in spite of his argument that the law suit was a consolidated answer to the efforts to enroll and execute on the 4 judgments. Even if the law suit were a timely and proper response, it would otherwise fail because the record reflected proper notice in accordance with §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.11.html#t11c07s11-7-301" target="_blank">11-7-301</a></cite> et seq., and the “response” collaterally attacked the validity and amounts of the underlying judgments which may not be attacked in Mississippi.

     By virtue of the supremacy clause, the Federal Uniformed Services Former Spouses’ Protection Act overrides Mississippi’s long-arm statutes to the extent that Mississippi law would exceed the limitations of the federal enactment. Thus, a former husband’s absence from Mississippi for 15 continuous years precluded personal jurisdiction by reason of residence or domicile since the language of the federal Act makes it clear that only current domicile or residence may suffice to confer authority upon a court to adjudge rights in a former service person’s military retirement pension.

    <p>
     In May, 1785, a committee of Congress made a report recommending an alteration in the Articles of Confederation, but no action was taken on it, and it was left to the State Legislatures to proceed in the matter. In January, 1786, the Legislature of Virginia passed a resolution providing for the appointment of five commissioners, who, or any three of them, should meet such commissioners as might be appointed in the other States of the Union, at a time and place to be agreed upon, to take into consideration the trade of the United States; to consider how far a uniform system in their commercial regulations may be necessary to their common interest and their permanent harmony; and to report to the several States such an act, relative to this great object, as, when ratified by them, will enable the United States in Congress effectually to provide for the same. The Virginia commissioners, after some correspondence, fixed the first Monday in September as the time, and the city of Annapolis as the place for the meeting, but only four other States were represented, viz.: Delaware, New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania; the commissioners appointed by Massachusetts, New Hampshire, North Carolina, and Rhode Island failed to attend. Under the circumstances of so partial a representation, the commissioners present agreed upon a report, (drawn by Mr. Hamilton, of New York,) expressing their unanimous conviction that it might essentially tend to advance the interests of the Union if the States by which they were respectively delegated would concur, and use their endeavors to procure the concurrence of the other States, in the appointment of commissioners to meet at Philadelphia on the second Monday of May following, to take into consideration the situation of the United States; to devise such further provisions as should appear to them necessary to render the Constitution of the Federal Government adequate to the exigencies of the Union; and to report such an act for that purpose to the United States in Congress assembled as, when agreed to by them, and afterwards confirmed by the Legislatures of every State, would effectually provide for the same.
    </p>
    <p>
     Congress, on the 21st of February, 1787, adopted a resolution in favor of a convention, and the Legislatures of those States which had not already done so (with the exception of Rhode Island) promptly appointed delegates. On the 25th of May, seven States having convened, George Washington, of Virginia, was unanimously elected President, and the consideration of the proposed Constitution was commenced. On the 17th of September, 1787, the Constitution as engrossed and agreed upon was signed by all the members present, except Mr. Gerry, of Massachusetts, and Messrs. Mason and Randolph, of Virginia. The president of the convention transmitted it to Congress, with a resolution stating how the proposed Federal Government should be put in operation, and an explanatory letter. Congress, on the 28th of September, 1787, directed the Constitution so framed, with the resolutions and letter concerning the same, to “be transmitted to the several Legislatures in order to be submitted to a convention of delegates chosen in each State by the people thereof, in conformity to the resolves of the convention.”
    </p>
    <p>
     On the 4th of March, 1789, the day which had been fixed for commencing the operations of Government under the new Constitution, it had been ratified by the conventions chosen in each State to consider it, as follows: Delaware, December 7, 1787; Pennsylvania, December 12, 1787; New Jersey, December 18, 1787; Georgia, January 2, 1788; Connecticut, January 9, 1788; Massachusetts, February 6, 1788; Maryland, April 28, 1788; South Carolina, May 23, 1788; New Hampshire, June 21, 1788; Virginia, June 25, 1788; and New York, July 26, 1788.
    </p>
    <p>
     The President informed Congress, on the 28th of January, 1790, that North Carolina had ratified the Constitution November 21, 1789; and he informed Congress on the 1st of June, 1790, that Rhode Island had ratified the Constitution May 29, 1790. Vermont, in convention, ratified the Constitution January 10, 1791, and was on March 4, 1791, by an act of Congress approved February 18, 1791, “received and admitted into this Union as a new and entire member of the United States.”

        Proposal and Ratification of Amendments 1 to 10.
       </b>
       The first ten amendments to the Constitution of the United States, which comprise the Bill of Rights, set out in 1 Stat. 97, were proposed to the Legislatures of the several States by the First Congress, on September 25, 1789. They were ratified by the following States, and the notifications of ratification by the Governors or Secretaries of State thereof were communicated successively by the President to Congress: New Jersey, November 20, 1789; Maryland, December 19, 1789; North Carolina, December 22, 1789; South Carolina, January 19, 1790; New Hampshire, January 25, 1790; Delaware, January 28, 1790; New York, February 27, 1790; Pennsylvania, March 10, 1790; Rhode Island, June 7, 1790; Vermont, November 3, 1791; and Virginia, December 15, 1791. The Legislatures of Connecticut, Georgia, and Massachusetts ratified them on April 19, 1939, March 18, 1939, and March 2, 1939, respectively.
      </p>
      <p>
       Twelve articles were proposed on September 25, 1789. The first two, which failed of adoption, read as follows:
      </p>
      <p>
       “Art. I. After the first enumeration required by the first article of the Constitution, there shall be one representation for every thirty thousand, until the number shall amount to one hundred, after which the proportion shall be so regulated by Congress, that there shall be not less than one hundred representatives, nor less than one representative for every forty thousand persons, until the number of representatives shall amount to two hundred; after which the proportion shall be so regulated by Congress, that there shall not be less than two hundred representatives, nor more than one representative for every fifty thousand persons.
      </p>
      <p>
       “Art. II. No law varying the compensation for the services of the Senators and Representatives shall take effect, until an election of Representatives shall have intervened.”

       Defendant’s free speech rights were not violated by his warrantless arrest where the confrontation occurred not out in public but at the sheriff’s department, the officer neither initiated nor had an opportunity to walk away from defendant’s words and combative conduct, defendant became agitated and began shouting profanities when the officer told him about the protocol he would have to follow to retrieve his vehicle from the impound lot, and defendant did not stop with simply expressing his displeasure. He was combative, and he created a stalemate that rose to the level of “fighting words” that were likely to inflict injury or incite an immediate breach of the peace. Odem v.

       Even though First Amendment right to openness of courtroom and court files was qualified, public and press were entitled to prior notice of any attempt by court or party to close courtroom or seal court file in prosecution for conspiracy to commit murder. United States v. Nix, 976 F. Supp. 41 (1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       Party seeking closure of courtroom or court file could overcome First Amendment presumption of openness to press and public of court file and defendants’ motions to dismiss indictment and to sever in prosecution for conspiracy, but only if party seeking closure would show, first, that there was substantial probability that defendants’ right to fair trial would be prejudiced by publicity that closure would prevent and, second, that reasonable alternatives to closure could not adequately protect defendants’ fair trial rights.

      <p>
       For purposes of determining whether to unseal defendants’ previously-sealed motions to dismiss indictment and to sever and attached exhibits in prosecution for conspiracy to commit murder, in light of qualified First Amendment right of public and press to openness of courtroom and court files, defendants’ rights to fair trial would be impaired if motions and exhibits were unsealed prior to trial; unsealing of motion to dismiss indictment and motion’s exhibits, which contained names and addresses of potential prosecution witnesses, would compromise witnesses’ safety and well-being, partial redaction would not prevent ascertainment of names and addresses, allegations in motion to sever could prejudice jury and might constitute inadmissible evidence, and voir dire to determine possible juror bias would not be workable solution. United States v. Nix, 976 F. Supp. 41 (1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       After issuing initial orders sealing certain defendants’ motions to dismiss indictment and to sever and their attached exhibits in prosecution for conspiracy to commit murder without giving prior notice to public and press, district court would not order any further closure of courtroom or sealing of court files unless supported by specific on-the-record findings after notice to press and public, in light of qualified First Amendment right of press and public to openness of courtroom and court files.

      <p>
       Four-step process applies in court’s determination of whether to close criminal court proceeding or to seal court file despite qualified First Amendment right of public and press to openness of courtroom and court files: party seeking to close proceeding or seal file must advance overriding interest that is likely to be prejudiced; closure must be no broader than necessary to protect interest of accused’s right to fair trial; court must consider reasonable alternatives to closing proceeding; and court must make findings adequate to support any closure or sealing. United States v. Nix, 976 F. Supp. 41 (1997).

       District court would allow newspaper publisher access to transcript of any oral argument on murder conspiracy defendants’ motions to dismiss indictment and to sever, which might take place prior to trial, at time motions were unsealed, in light of qualified First Amendment right of public and press to openness of courtroom and court files. United States v. Nix, 976 F. Supp. 41 (1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       An accused’s right to a fair trial and the press and public’s right of access to criminal proceedings must be balanced when determining whether access to legal proceedings should be restricted. The press and public are entitled to notice and a hearing before a closure order is entered, and any submission in a trial court for closure, either by a party Or by the court’s own motion, and be it a letter, written motion, or oral motion, either in chambers or open court, must be docketed, as notice to the press and public, in the court clerk’s office for at least 24 hours before any hearing on such submission, with the usual notice to all parties. The requirement should not be taken to mean that a greater notice period may not be afforded where feasible. Preferably, the submission should be a written motion if time and circumstances allow. A hearing must be held in which the press is allowed to intervene on behalf of the public and present argument, if any, against closure. The movant must be required to advance an overriding interest that is likely to be prejudiced, the closure must be no broader than necessary to protect that interest, the trial court must consider reasonable alternatives to closing the proceedings, and it must make findings adequate to support the closure. In considering the less restrictive alternatives to closure, the court must articulate the alternatives considered and why they were rejected. The court must then make written findings of fact and conclusions of law specific enough that a reviewing court can determine whether the closure order was properly entered. A transcript of the closure hearing should be made public and if a petition for extraordinary relief concerning a closure order is filed in the Supreme Court, it should be accompanied by the transcript, the court’s findings of fact and conclusions of law, and the evidence adduced at the hearing upon which the judge based the findings and conclusions. These requirements cannot be avoided by an agreement between the defendant and the State that proceedings and files should be closed. Gannett River States Pub. Co. v. Hand, 571 So. 2d 941, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 710 (Miss. 1990).

       Circuit Court’s closure order in capital murder case was reasonable regulation of time, place, and manner of newspaper’s enjoyment of its First Amendment right; desire of press to inform public about important criminal proceedings can result in publication of matter that can deprive defendant of his right to fair trial; access of press to trial and pretrial processes may be qualified, and record amply supported Circuit Court’s finding that unrestricted access to trial process would result in substantial likelihood of defendant being denied fair trial; additionally, newspaper was not being denied access to pre-trial proceeding in perpetuity, because closure order expired once jury was sequestered and trial began; once that point was reached, newspaper would be granted access to complete transcript of all closed, pre-trial proceedings.

Furthermore, any potential to mislead that liquor advertising may possess did not warrant wholesale exclusion of liquor advertising from First Amendment protection. Lamar Outdoor Advertising, Inc. v.

Evans v. Indianola, 778 F. Supp. 333, 1991 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17739 (N.D. Miss. 1991), aff'd, 981 F.2d 1255, 1992 U.S. App. LEXIS 34054 (5th Cir. Miss. 1992).

       Employee speech is entitled to judicial protection only if it pertains to matters of public concern, and this protection does not extend to comments of personal interest. Even employee speech on matters of public interest must be balanced against the government’s interest in promoting efficiency, integrity and proper discipline in the discharge of public service. Thus, a police chief’s request that an officer maintain a “low profile” did not wrongfully suppress the officer’s constitutional right to free speech since the request was “well within the legitimate and necessary means inherent to the efficient operation of a police department which is deeply involved in combating narcotics activity in the community.” Bulloch v. Pascagoula, 574 So. 2d 637, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 798 (Miss. 1990).

   The University of Virginia’s refusal to fund the printing of a newspaper published by a student organization because it had a Christian religious orientation violated the free speech guarantee of the First Amendment, and was not excused by the need to comply with the First Amendment’s establishment of religion clause, where the organization was not a religious institution in the usual sense of that term or as defined in the university’s own regulations, the organization sought funding as a student journal, no public funds would flow directly to the organization’s coffers, any benefit to religion would be incidental to the payment of printing costs from the student activities fund on a religion-neutral basis, and denial of payment risked fostering a pervasive bias or hostility to religion.

       The section of an ordinance enacted by the City of Tupelo authorizing the Chief of Police to deny a parade permit if he finds that “the conduct of the parade will probably cause injury to persons or property or provoke disorderly conduct or create a disturbance” is unconstitutional in that the term “disorderly conduct” is overbroad because it could be applied to deny permits to those seeking to engage in protected activity; the provision constitutes a prior restraint upon free speech because it is not narrowly drawn to relate to health, safety, and welfare interests, but instead sanctions the denial of a permit on the basis of the so-called “hecklers’ veto;” the provision is unconstitutionally vague as well since it contains no instructions directing the Chief of Police in the formulation of his opinion. The phrase “will probably cause injury” is constitutionally invalid since the term “probably” is simply too vague and indefinite and does not control adequately the discretion of the Chief in his determination of when to grant or deny a permit; the phrase “create a disturbance” is unconstitutional because it vests in the licensing authority the unbridled discretion to determine when, in his opinion, it is likely that criminal conduct will occur in the future. Limiting parade activity to the hours before 6:00 pm is invalid where it remains light in Tupelo well past that hour most of the year and the protection of citizens at night is not thereby jeopardized by a later time limit. The requirements of the ordinance that all paraders be unarmed, line up no more than four abreast, in the right-hand lane of the street, in units of 100 or fewer, with 15-foot intervals between units is unconstitutional in that it violates the Equal Protection Clause since such requirements do not apply to students or governmental agencies. The requirement that marchers act in an “orderly manner” is unconstitutionally overbroad; and the restriction on the use of “profanity” is void since profanity is protected speech unless it falls into such unprotected categories as obscenity or fighting words. Exemption of governmental agencies and students participating in educational activities from the licensing and regulatory requirements constitutes a violation of the Equal Protection Clause since such discrimination is based upon the content of the speech involved. That section of the ordinance which requires that the applicant for a permit demonstrate the noise level of sound equipment to be used is not facially unconstitutional since all it requires is a demonstration of the noise level; however, in the course of applying this statute, if the Chief of Police denies permits because of the demonstrated noise level of the equipment, the applicant will be able to make the argument offered herein that the section fails to give narrow and objective standards to be used in the determination. The blanket prohibition against sound equipment in areas zoned for residential purposes is overbroad because the ordinance presumes incompatibility based on an area’s merely being zoned residential and oftentimes areas zoned residential include structures other than homes, such as churches and schools, which are not incompatible with the use of sound equipment. The restriction of the operation of sound equipment at any location between the hours of 6:00 pm and 9:00 am is invalid where, although nighttime restrictions might be justifiable, the hour at which the restriction commences is not necessarily at night.

       Where defendant was charged with and found guilty of felony driving under the influence of alcohol, the trial court did not err in denying defense counsel’s motion to suppress evidence of defendant’s blood alcohol results; the warrant authorizing the blood alcohol test was valid and thus, defendant’s constitutional rights were not violated. Inter alia, the officer observed defendant’s slurred speech and staggered walk, and he noted that defendant’s breath smelled of alcohol and defendant actually admitted to having drunk four beers that morning and was unable to recite the alphabet. Dove v. State, 912 So. 2d 1091, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 738 (Miss. Ct. App. 2005).

       In a possession of marijuana case, defendant was not denied his due process rights in the revocation of his postrelease supervision as there was evidence that defendant had waived his rights to a hearing and that he had admitted to violating his probation.

       The rule that failure to object at trial waives objection on appeal applies to Fourth Amendment claims. Simply put, if a defendant fails to object to the admission of illegally obtained evidence, the objection is waived. Brown v. State, 875 So. 2d 214, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 1192 (Miss. Ct.

   There is no discovery violation as to an officer’s notes, taken in the presence of witnesses and destroyed in good faith. Thus, the destruction of original handwritten notes of a defendant’s statement, which were transcribed into a typed statement, and admission of the typed statement into evidence, did not deprive the defendant of his rights to a fair and impartial trial and adequate defense as provided by the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. Woodward v. State, 533 So. 2d 418, 1988 Miss. LEXIS 492 (Miss. 1988), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">490 U.S. 1028</cite>, <cite class="s_court">109 S. Ct. 1767</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">104 L.

   On the inmate’s claim that his execution would be unconstitutional under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments because he was mentally retarded, he was entitled to and did not receive an Atkins hearing because the inmate met the requirements of Chase and its progeny; the inmate’s claim was not procedurally barred under Miss.

       A defendant’s constitutional rights were not violated when the public was excluded from a hearing on a petition to revoke his suspended sentence and probation; the hearing was not a part of a criminal prosecution and thus the full panoply of rights due a defendant in a criminal prosecution under the requirements of the United States and Mississippi Constitutions did not apply.

       Defendant failed to establish that he had a reasonable expectation of privacy in a motel room where money from a bank robbery was found as the room was registered in the name of a third party; as defendant did not produce evidence that he had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the motel room, he lacked standing to contest the search and the admission of the evidence obtained as a result of the search.

       A defendant charged with capital murder had no reasonable expectation of privacy during a conversation with his wife in which he told her that he had committed the alleged crime because she would not come back to him, and that if she and the children had been in the house at the time of the crime, they would be lying next to the victims, where the statements were made while the two were seated near the open door of a room in the sheriff’s department, which led into an outer office occupied by five to seven people who were approximately two to three feet away, and continued while the two were entering into the outer office occupied by the third parties.

       The relevant inquiry under the Fourth Amendment is whether the police have infringed upon some legitimate expectation of privacy which the defendant had. Accordingly, a defendant had no standing under the Fourth Amendment to complain about a warrantless entry by police officers in another’s home nor the seizure of contraband therein. Moss v.

   In a 42 U.S.C.S. § 1983 suit, an arrestee adequately pled claims for excessive use of force against a police officer because he had a clearly established Fourth Amendment right not to be bodily removed from his car after being stopped for careless driving and thrown to the ground; the officer’s actions were not shielded by the doctrine of qualified immunity or governmental immunity arising under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.11.html#t11c46s11-46-9ol11" target="_blank">11-46-9(1)</a></cite>. Stepney v. City of Columbia, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16376 (S.D. Miss.

       The defendant police officer was not entitled to summary judgment in an action alleging that he used excessive force in arresting the plaintiff since the court could not say that a reasonable officer, facing the plaintiff, who was neither resisting arrest nor physically confrontational, and who was recovering from recent medical procedures, would have considered the defendant’s actions an objectively reasonable response to the situation at hand.

       Suit alleging that school official grabbed arm of student did not show type of action calculated to cause serious injury, nor did not such act evince malice or intention to cause injury, and even if serious injuries may have resulted, nature of contact suggested that any injuries were unintended rather than calculated and that if force used was in fact excessive, it came from carelessness or excess of zeal rather than malice. Whether physical harm by state officer rises to level of constitutional deprivation depends on extent of injury inflicted, degree of force used in proportion to amount necessary under circumstances, and motives of official; bottom-line inquiry is whether official’s conduct amounted to abuse of official power that shocks conscience.

       An officer’s failure to inform the defendant that he had a right to refuse the officer’s request for a blood sample did not render the test results inadmissible in a manslaughter prosecution against the defendant where the officer had probable cause to obtain the blood sample in that the officer knew that the defendant was the driver of an automobile which had collided head on with another vehicle, the collision occurred on a straight and level highway when the road condition was dry, the officer knew that at least two people were dead in the vehicle which the defendant hit, the officer had observed a beer in the defendant’s vehicle, and the defendant had slurred speech and dilated pupils. For a search which would otherwise be illegal, absent consent, knowledgeable waiver of one’s constitutional right not to be searched is guaranteed by Article 3, § 23 of the Mississippi Constitution. However, blood searches which are based upon probable cause are not illegal, and, therefore, the question of the defendant’s knowledgeable waiver was not relevant. Longstreet v.

      <p>
       In prosecution for vehicular manslaughter, blood sample from allegedly intoxicated defendant absent his arrest or consent was admissible evidence, where probable cause to make search existed at time of sample’s collection, given defendant’s display of symptoms of intoxication, such as slurred speech, immediately following his automobile’s striking rear of decedent’s truck, parked wholly off interstate highway.

      <p>
       Admission into evidence of results of blood alcohol test at trial for manslaughter and aggravated assault arising out of a motor vehicle accident was reversible error, where deputy sheriff who investigated the accident had insufficient probable cause to request a blood alcohol test for defendant driver, in view of deputy’s statement that he smelled no odor of alcohol on defendant either at the accident scene or at the hospital, he observed no whiskey bottles or beer cans in defendant’s car, no aspect of defendant’s speech, appearance or behavior indicated that he was under the influence of alcohol, and deputy admitted that the real reason for requesting the blood alcohol test was because it was sheriff department policy to do so when someone was killed in an automobile accident.

       The Fourth Amendment prohibition against unreasonable search and seizure applies when an intrusion into the body–such as a blood test–is undertaken without a warrant, absent an emergency situation. Cole v. State, 493 So. 2d 1333, 1986 Miss. LEXIS 2641 (Miss. 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a criminal prosecution, where a police officer was justified in requiring a blood test to determine the alcoholic content in defendant’s blood, and such test had in fact been performed, although for diagnostic and not law enforcement purposes, the State was entitled to the benefit of the test results, and the result of the blood test administered at the direction of defendant’s physician was admissible. Ashley v. State, 423 So. 2d 1311, 1982 Miss. LEXIS 2266 (Miss. 1982).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Fourth Amendment’s proper function is to constrain, not against all intrusions as such, but against intrusions which are not justified or which are made in an improper manner. The drawing of blood from a rape suspect for a blood-semen test did not violate the suspect’s Fourth Amendment right to be secure in his person, where the warrant for the blood test was issued upon sufficient evidence of probable cause.

       The court rejected the contention that a judge was not an impartial magistrate because he personally completed the affidavit for search warrant and the actual search warrant where the judge testified at the suppression hearing that the information contained in the affidavit was received from a police officer and the officer testified that he signed both forms indicating his assent to the accuracy of the information.

       A search warrant was not defective because it erroneously named the defendant as the owner of the property to be searched. The Fourth Amendment does not require that either the affidavit or the warrant give the name of the owner of the property to be searched; identifying the owner of the premises is relevant only to assist and aid in particularizing the place to be searched.

       There was no merit to a defendant’s claim that the judge who issued 2 search warrants was not neutral and detached on the basis that the judge who went to the scene of the crime and saw the body also issued the search warrants, where there was no showing as to how this, in and of itself, created any prejudice or bias towards the defendant.

       A judge who issues a search warrant is not required to confer on the searching officer the full range of authority allowed by law. The judge is within his prerogatives to limit the officer’s authority, either by use of a pre-printed form or by inter-lined language. Strange v. State, 530 So. 2d 1336, 1988 Miss.

      </p>
      <p>
       The Fourth Amendment was designed to protect against “general warrants” and other exploratory searches. The fact that contraband is believed to be on the premises cannot in and of itself justify a warrantless search. The discovery of evidence does not “create” an exigent circumstance such that a valid warrant is not required. Carney v. State, 525 So. 2d 776, 1988 Miss. LEXIS 175 (Miss. 1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       Justice Court Judge who issued search warrant was neutral and detached magistrate where nothing in record indicated that judge acted in biased manner when he issued search warrant; central requirement for valid search warrant is that it must be issued by neutral and detached magistrate, and substantial involvement in search is forbidden; however, magistrate who goes to scene, issues warrant, and remains there for some time does not abdicate his proper position.

   Fact that magistrate primarily relies on fact that sworn police officers are asking for search warrant rather than on anything in particular in affidavit of underlying facts and circumstances does not mean that magistrate is not acting in neutral and detached manner in issuing warrant where judge issues warrant only if judge feels that it is warranted.

       Where defendant was taken to a hospital after a two-car collision, the search warrant for a blood draw was invalid because: (1) the officer who requested the search warrant falsely stated in his affidavit that defendant had (a) refused to submit to an “analysis of his breath” after having been offered an opportunity to submit, and (b) been placed under arrest for driving while under the influence, although at that time he had not yet been arrested; and (2) there were no exigent circumstances present at the hospital that would have justified a blood test since defendant was not fleeing, and the officer obviously had time to secure a warrant, albeit an invalid one. As to the admissibility of defendant’s statements about having consumed several beers, made to police at the scene of the accident, defendant did not claim that he was in custody at the time, and his statements clearly had probative value, thus the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the statements to be admitted into evidence despite the defendant’s argument that he was disoriented, confused, and suffering from shock and retrograde amnesia when he made the statements and they were therefore not reliable.

       When defendant asserts that information contained in affidavit supporting application for search warrant constitutes false swearing, then reviewing court must determine, with false material set aside, whether affidavit’s remaining content, together with sworn oral testimony presented to issuing magistrate, is sufficient to establish probable cause.

       An affidavit for a search warrant was not fatally defective merely because the attached page containing a description of the residence to be searched was not signed by the affiants, where other pages of the affidavit were signed, and the narcotics agent who was the author of the warrant and application swore that the description was not substituted.

       In a prosecution for possession of intoxicating liquor, the trial court erred in overruling defendant’s motion to suppress evidence seized during a search of his home, based on his contention that the warrant was defective, where the underlying facts and circumstances portion of the affidavit, stating that a deputy had called the affiant and said that after several observations of defendant over a period of time “he was apparently selling whiskey,” was insufficient as a matter of law.

       For an affidavit to be sufficient to meet Fourth Amendment standards, the informant or the affiant must have reasonable information or cause to believe that the items sought pursuant to the search warrant are located in the premises to be searched, and, if the information which the affiant uses as the basis of his probable cause for a search warrant was obtained from an informant, there must be underlying facts and circumstances alleged which would show the independent magistrate that the informant was reliable and that his information was reasonably trustworthy.

      </p>
      <p>
       In order to justify the issuance of a valid search warrant the basic affidavit must include a statement by the affiant of the underlying facts and circumstances upon which he relies as constituting probable cause so that the magistrate may judge for himself the persuasiveness of the facts to show probable cause.

       Where the affidavit for a search warrant fails to allege facts or circumstances from which the justice of the peace could judicially ascertain or determine probable cause, but sets forth nothing more than a mere conclusion, it does not meet the requirements of this amendment, and a search warrant issued upon such an affidavit is void.

   After an appellate court reversed defendant’s drug possession conviction by finding that the trial court should have granted defendant’s suppression motion because the magistrate who issued the search warrant lacked a substantial basis for concluding that probable cause existed and because the probable cause determination was based upon false and/or omitted information, the state supreme court held that there there was no showing that the investigator intentionally misrepresented facts or made them in reckless disregard for the truth; the investigator described the confidential informant (CI) who provided information about defendant’s activities as reliable in the past because he knew him to be a reliable CI used by the police department on occasion, and he was able to independently corroborate the CI’s reliability when a controlled buy resulted in defendant selling cocaine to the CI. The investigator’s omission of the fact that there was a controlled buy the day before did not constitute a reckless disregard for the truth, and the omission was adequately explained by the investigator, who testified that he was protecting the identity of the CI; as such, the warrant was supported by adequate probable cause.

   Through Miss. Unif. Cir. &amp; County Ct. Prac. R. 6.03, Mississippi has provided a procedure for a fair and reliable determination of probable cause by a judicial officer promptly after arrest. If the procedure of Rule 6.03 is followed, the U.S. Const. amend IV and Miss. Const. art. 3, § 23, rights of the accused are protected; however, the converse does not necessarily follow: failure to follow the exact procedure of Rule 6.03 does not necessarily result in a Fourth Amendment or Article 3 violation.

       Probable cause for the issuance of a warrant to search the defendant’s residence was established where (1) the magistrate was informed by the police that an undercover drug operation had occurred that day and that the defendant had been arrested for the sale of $ 220 worth of cocaine, (2) an informant had set up the buy by calling the defendant at his residence, and the police suspected the origin of the cocaine was indeed his residence, and (3) the residence had been under surveillance as a drug distribution center due to complaints of anonymous neighbors.

       Probable cause existed for a warrant to issue for a search of the defendant’s residence for illicit drugs since the officer who obtained the warrant did not rely solely on unsubstantiated hearsay relayed to him by another officer but, instead, questioned the other officer’s informant, and then undertook to independently verify the accuracy of the informant’s representations by having him make what appeared to be an actual purchase of drugs at the defendant’s residence.

       Probable cause existed for the issuance of a search warrant for a defendant’s residence, in spite of the defendants’ argument that an informant’s personal observation of marijuana at the residence 2 weeks earlier was stale and too remote, where 2 narcotics agents saw a sale of marijuana, which came from one of the defendants and from the house in question on the day of the search.

      <p>
       In determining whether probable cause existed for a particular search or search warrant, judges must scrupulously examine the facts in each case, make a careful evaluation, and make a determination in their own best judgment. Probable cause is not what some officer thought, and not some conduct that was simply unusual or that simply roused the suspicion that illegal activity could be afoot, when there was at the same time just as likely a possibility that nothing at all illegal was transpiring. Rather, it must be information reasonably leading an officer to believe that, then and there, contraband or evidence material to a criminal investigation would be found. Rooks v. State, 529 So. 2d 546, 1988 Miss. LEXIS 232 (Miss. 1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where available information shows only that a crime has been committed and that a particular person has committed it, there is probable cause only for the issuance of an arrest warrant. The mere fact that a person committed a crime does not necessarily mean that there is probable cause to search that person’s dwelling for evidence of that crime. Carney v.

       Probable cause did exist to obtain search warrant for defendant’s residence where officer who served as affiant for warrants testified that state had composite drawing of man who used victim’s credit cards, number of truck license tag registered to defendant was listed on credit card purchase receipt, authorities had observed truck in defendant’s yard whose tag number was used in purchase, and officer who identified defendant from composite prepared photographic lineup from which merchant identified defendant as man using victim’s credit card to make purchases day following victim’s murder.

       Defendant was not entitled to have evidence suppressed where the affidavit for the warrant under which the search was conducted supplied the issuing magistrate with a substantial basis to conclude that there was a fair probability that contraband could be found in the vehicle to be searched.

       Under the Fourth Amendment, a police dispatcher, working as a desk sergeant, was not sufficiently severed from the activities of law enforcement nor independent of the police and prosecution so as to be considered a neutral and detached magistrate; however, where the defendant was already the subject of a valid arrest warrant by Florida authorities on a completely separate charge, the invalidity of the arrest warrant was irrelevant.

       Although officers who executed the affidavit for a search warrant had not been previously acquainted, either personally or officially, with defendant’s neighbor who supplied the information as to marijuana plants growing on defendant’s property, and had no previous experience as to his reliability based on former tips, or otherwise, inasmuch as the informant was an eyewitness to the growing of the marijuana, which he had observed simply by looking across the imaginary line separating his property from defendant’s property, and inasmuch as his statements with respect to it were supported and borne out when he took several other plants to the police where it was identified by them as being marijuana, the information in the hands of the officers was ample, and was sufficiently set out in detail in the affidavit, to justify a finding of probable cause and the issuance of a warrant.

       Given that a confidential informant (CI) provided reliable information on the same day that the search warrant was issued and that the CI had given reliable information in the past, the information supporting the search warrants was sufficiently reliable; under a totality-of-the-circumstances review, it was evident that there was a substantial basis for the magistrate’s determination that the search warrant’s language concerning ‘‘stolen items’’ was supported by sufficiently reliable information.

       <p>
   Court rejected defendant’s claim that he was subjected to an illegal search and seizure, and that the confidential informant was not sufficiently reliable to establish probable cause for a search warrant as required under the Fourth Amendment, because the test for probable cause in Mississippi is the totality of the circumstances and defendant admitted to the undercover officer that he had drug paraphernalia in his home, which was sufficient to give the officer probable cause to believe that defendant had and was committing a crime and to place him under arrest. Also, the informant’s reliability was confirmed by a recording of the informant’s telephone conversations with defendant. Passman v. State, 937 So. 2d 17, 2006 Miss. App. LEXIS 89 (Miss. Ct.

   Although defendant was not given an initial appearance until six days after his arrest, which violated Miss. Unif. Cir. &amp; County Ct. Prac.

At trial, through use of testimony and exhibits, the farm was described as a cluster of buildings, situated fairly close together, consisting of a metal shed, a wooden shed, an abandoned farmhouse, and an outhouse (or old chicken house); a search of any or all of these buildings was within the scope of the warrant, which authorized search of “a farm house” and “any out buildings normally associated with this residence.” Gillett v.

   The search of a one-story building, pursuant to an affidavit and search warrant for a two-story dwelling, did not violate the defendant’s constitutional rights where the officer who made the affidavit for the search warrant had driven by the defendant’s property in a rural area and thought that there was only one building–the two-story building–on the property, the defendant owned all the property but resided in the one-story building, the officers went to the unoccupied two-story building when they arrived on the property but received no answer, the defendant came to the front door of the one-story building and the officers went there and served him with the warrant, and the officers searched the one-story building and found marijuana in that building. The affidavit and search warrant sufficiently directed the officers to the defendant’s premises where they found him in his residence, executed the warrant and discovered marijuana, and therefore the trial court was not in error when it denied the defendant’s motion to suppress the evidence found in the search.

       A “no-knock” warrant was both justified and reasonable where (1) the defendant was living in a virtual fortress, (2) any announcement made by the officers would only have given him more time to destroy evidence, and (3) the defendant was a convicted felon and a previous search of the residence had produced firearms.

       A police officer can, via a search warrant, compel a person to submit to a gunpowder residue test and, because the chemicals sought to be found on a person’s hand can easily and quickly be destroyed, an officer is within his rights to swab a person’s hand even over his objections.

   In his trial for murder of a police officer, defendant’s contention that the homicide was justifiable because he was resisting an unlawful arrest and reasonably believed himself to be in imminent danger of great bodily harm was not supported by the evidence, where the law officers had sufficient grounds to believe that fugitives for whom they had arrest warrants were located in the house in which defendant was staying and fired gas into the house only after a reasonable time had elapsed following the announcements requesting the occupants to vacate the house; failure of the occupants to exit as requested demonstrated their refusal to cooperate with the arresting officers who had identified themselves and stated their purpose, and the officers were warranted in using reasonable force and means to execute the arrest warrants.

       It was error for a trial court to deny a defendant’s motion to suppress an investigatory stop of the vehicle defendant drove, when an informant told officers the subject of outstanding arrest warrants would be driving a similar vehicle, because the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule did not apply as (1) an officer said the officer did not know the identity of the subject of the arrest warrants, so the officer could not reasonably execute the warrants without verifying the suspect’s identity, and (2) the officer’s misinterpretation of constitutional mandates, contradictions between the officer’s arrest report and testimony, and the officer’s failure to resolve the suspect’s identity made the exception inapplicable.

       Investigatory stop of defendant was not violative of defendant’s constitutional rights under the Fourth Amendment where a telephone call to the police officer gave the State a reasonable suspicion that justified the police in driving to defendant’s location; furthermore, the plea agreement was an independent justification for the State to detain and/or search defendant.

       Court properly denied a motion to suppress where an officer testified that the bulge in defendant’s shorts was unusually large and given his erratic behavior, defensive posturing, and possession of a pocket knife, the officer believed that the bulge could be a weapon; therefore, at the time the officer proceeded to pat the bulge, the officer had not extended the search of defendant beyond what was necessary to determine whether he was armed and dangerous. In addition, the officer stated that when he touched the bulge, he could feel stems and seeds through the fabric of defendant’s shorts that he thought was marijuana, and it was immediately apparent to the officer that the bulge was marijuana.

       The fact that the defendant’s wife was not affirmatively informed by police officers of her right to decline to consent to the inspection of the defendant’s premises did not render her consent involuntary where, after she was requested to consent to an inspection of the premise, she declined to do so unless the officers agreed to remove a substantial number of the police cars parked at her residence, since the very act of attaching conditions to the consent to search and demanding compliance with the conditions before the search began was a strong indicator that she understood that she was not obligated to permit the officers to inspect the premises.

   There was no basis to suppress evidence obtained from a second entry into defendant’s residence, as the initial search was legal as an emergency search under exigent circumstances, and the second entry into the residence was a reasonable continuation, whereupon evidence seen in plain view was seized.

      </p>
      <p>
       An emergency situation is a valid exception to the warrant requirement; the elements for the application of this exception are: (1) reasonable grounds to believe there is an emergency situation and there is an immediate need for their assistance in order to protect life and property; (2) the primary motivation for the search must not be an intent to arrest and seize the evidence; and (3) some reasonable basis, approximating probable cause, must associate the emergency with the area or place searched.

       A second and third walk-through of a house were continuations of the original entry, which was justified based on information that the victim was burned and lying on the bathroom floor of the house, and, therefore, the seizure of evidence during those walk-throughs was proper where all of the evidence seized was in plain view during the first walk-through and would have seized then had not the officers been focused on their goal of locating the victim and attempting to assist her.

       Search was lawful under the plain view exception to the warrant requirement because the officer had the legal authority to stop defendant for running a stop sign and to approach the vehicle. In addition, the incriminating character of the black duffel bag and other items was readily apparent, as the officer was aware that those types of items were used in the recent restaurant armed robbery, and they were in plain view.

       There was sufficient probable cause to search defendant’s vehicle after an accident and to seize beer in the vehicle because the smell of beer on defendant’s breath, coupled with his impaired coordination and his statement that he had consumed a good bit of alcohol earlier in the day, constituted probable cause to seize beer in plain view.

       Though crack cocaine was often carried in plastic bags, and defendant’s having a plastic bag inside his pants was unusual, neither consideration creates probable cause to believe that there was cocaine in defendant’s pants. It took a look after pulling open defendant’s pants before probable cause existed. Thus, the bag and its contents were not in plain view and the searching of defendant’s pants was not justified.

       Both the automobile and plain view exceptions permitted agents to search the defendant’s vehicle without first obtaining a warrant where they had probable cause to stop and search the vehicle on the basis of information received from a confidential informant and where an agent looked through a window and saw a bag in the rear of the vehicle which appeared to contain several large bricks of marijuana.

       In a prosecution for possession of crack cocaine, the search of an automobile was not valid under the plain view exception to the search warrant requirement where the police officer entered the car to retrieve the keys, he saw an ordinary matchbox on the passenger seat and opened it to find only matches, and he then noticed another matchbox between the 2 front seats and opened it to find that it contained 9 rocks of crack cocaine; no incriminating evidence was visible at the time the officer entered the car, since the mere presence of a matchbox on the front seat of a car ordinarily cannot be termed an incriminating object in plain view.

       Investigatory stop which led to defendant’s arrest violated defendant’s constitutional right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures because the stop was based on a tip from an anonymous caller who reported a person driving erratically in a particular vehicle and flashing what appeared to be some type of badge at other drivers, but there was a lack of sufficient indicia of reliability in the case, coupled with the police officers’ failure to corroborate the criminal activity reported.

       A confidential informant’s tip to a sheriff’s deputy provided probable cause to justify a stop, and therefore a subsequent search and seizure of the suspect’s property did not violate his constitutional rights, where the officer knew the informant, information supplied by the informant had been successfully used by the officer in the past, and the informant accurately told the officer that the suspect would be traveling in a certain direction on a certain road which demonstrated a special familiarity with the suspect’s affairs.

       Search of passenger compartment of defendant’s car and of bag found therein was valid as justified by search incident to arrest and probable cause; officer had pulled defendant over for running traffic light, defendant was placed under lawful arrest for three failures to appear for traffic violations and was seated in patrol car, defendant’s request for his money bag sent officer back to vehicle, officer then smelled marijuana, giving him probable cause to search further for source of smell, and search for money bag in passenger compartment, in which defendant had been only passenger, followed immediately after arrest.

       Both probable cause and exigency prong of automobile exception to warrant requirement were satisfied, despite defendant’s claim that narcotics agents should have gotten search warrant in the several hours that passed between informant’s giving defendant informant’s car and defendant’s arrest; in recorded conversations, defendant had agreed to go out-of-state and get cocaine for informant, who had allegedly made similar transactions with defendant in past, and at time vehicle was stopped, nearness of state line and ease with which defendant could have fled agents’ jurisdiction made getting search warrant impracticable.

       For purposes of exigency prong of automobile exception to warrant requirement, exceptional circumstances excusing issuance of warrant are: when vehicle searched is in motion; when officers have probable cause to believe vehicle contains contraband subject to search; and when it is impracticable to secure warrant because vehicle can and may be removed from jurisdiction.

       A warrantless search of an automobile was proper, even though the vehicle had been immobilized, since the “automobile exception” to the warrant requirement “does not vanish once the car has been immobilized.” Additionally, the search was valid because the contraband had been observed in plain view inside the vehicle. The search was also lawful because it was made in connection with the inventory of an impounded vehicle, where the vehicle was in the lawful custody of the police, a police officer had information that the vehicle had been used in a shoplifting, and a search of the driver bore no fruit.

       At trial of a defendant charged with possession, with intent to distribute, of more than one kilogram of marijuana, evidence obtained by a warrantless search of the trunk of an automobile which had been stopped for speeding did not require suppression where state troopers, upon approaching stopped automobile, had observed marijuana seeds and parts and had detected odor of marijuana emanating from, passenger compartment.

       In a prosecution for possession of marijuana with intent to deliver, the trial court erred in admitting, over defendant’s objection, evidence of the contents of a vacuum cleaner bag containing .2 of a gram of marijuana gleaned from a warrantless search of defendant’s automobile where the search was conducted while defendant was in jail and after the automobile had been seized by the officers and lodged in a public garage; since there was ample time to obtain a warrant and no probability that the automobile would be removed beyond the reach of police the rule permitting warrantless searches of vehicles was inapplicable.

       Court correctly concluded that defendant’s detention was legal and did not exceed what was necessary where an officer testified that although he initially stopped defendant for speeding, his observance of defendant led him to suspect that defendant had been driving under the influence of a drug. Prior to the pat down search, the officer had not completed his activities incident to the traffic stop nor allayed his reasonable suspicion that defendant had been driving under the influence of a drug.

       The trial court erred in refusing to suppress marijuana plants seized under a void search warrant, notwithstanding the fact that the arresting officers had previously observed what appeared to be growing marijuana plants from a tract of land adjacent to defendant’s land and could then have arrested defendants for committing a felony in their presence, where no such arrest occurred prior to execution of the void warrant; contraband in “plain view” may be seized without a warrant (1) incident to a lawful arrest, or (2) incident to “hot pursuit” of a fleeing suspect, or (3) incident to a search of a stopped vehicle on probable cause or because of the mobility of the vehicle, or (4) where officers have a valid search warrant to search a given area for specific objects and in the course of the search come across contraband; the “plain view” doctrine does not eliminate the requirement that seizure of contraband discovered while in “plain view” must comply with constitutional requirements and in the absence of “exigent circumstances” must be based on a valid warrant.

       Probable cause existed for law enforcement officers to stop and search an automobile for contraband where 2 strange individuals drove to one particular area of a small town airport to which vehicles did not usually travel, an occupant got out of the automobile, walked directly to a place in the grass, picked up 2 garbage bags and put them into the trunk, the auto immediately sped off, and the individuals were observed by a reliable person with some experience in law enforcement who reported the entire activity to the sheriff.

       Defendant’s
   own acts disclosed the cigarette pack and its contents, so there was
   no seizure in the sense of the law when the officers examined the

       Circuit court did not err in admitting into evidence a firearm and marijuana found in the street because defendant surrendered his Fourth Amendment protections as to those items when he abandoned them; defendant was not considered arrested under the Fourth Amendment until he was captured by the chasing Mississippi Bureau of Narcotic agents and placed into custody because he was in no way restrained during his flight, and thus, no arrest occurred within the confines of the Fourth Amendment.

       In a prosecution for possession of a controlled substance, cocaine which had been discarded by the defendant was not the fruit of an illegal search and seizure, and was therefore properly admitted into evidence, since the defendant was not “seized or arrested” when he discarded the drugs where the defendant did not stop when police officers ordered him to do so for the purpose of checking his identification, and he threw down the cocaine while he was walking away from the officers; the defendant was not restrained or stopped at the time he discarded the cocaine, and therefore the cocaine was abandoned and not the fruit of an unlawful seizure or arrest.

When the police chief began his pursuit, it was not a pursuit for the purpose of making an arrest, rather, it was a pursuit to give a courtesy warning; at the time defendant was arrested at his home, he had committed the crime of felony DUI, as well as the crime of driving with a suspended license.

       There are “degrees” of detainments which fall short of an arrest which requires probable cause; detainments which would become an arrest depending on the outcome of a pending investigation are permissible, though police officers do not have unlimited authority, and may not be clothed with the authority to detain where they are not diligently investigating in such a way which will resolve the matter.

        54. - Lawful detention under “Terry” rule, temporary detention.
       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       Scope of investigatory stop was not exceeded by Mississippi Bureau of Narcotic agents’ conduct because the agents discovered a firearm, and thus, they were justified in their decision to conduct a Terry frisk of defendant person in order to determine whether he possessed a weapon that could be used to assault the agents. Cole v. State, 242 So.3d 31, 2018 Miss. LEXIS 54 (Miss. 2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       Mississippi Bureau of Narcotic agents’ decision to conduct a Terry frisk of defendant’s person was justified, and thus, defendant’s subsequent, unprovoked flight from his lawful, temporary detention provided the agents with further reasonable suspicion to pursue him, and ultimately, the probable cause necessary to effectuate an arrest. Cole v. State, 242 So.3d 31, 2018 Miss. LEXIS 54 (Miss. 2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because defendant had been lawfully detained on grounds of reasonable suspicion, his flight provided Mississippi Bureau of Narcotic agents with justification to pursue him; whether defendant had been frisked prior to his flight, he was up to that point lawfully detained under Terry and temporarily not free to leave, but his unprovoked flight was a consummate act of evasion, designed to prevent his further detention and carried out by his desire to avoid jail. Cole v. State, 242 So.3d 31, 2018 Miss. LEXIS 54 (Miss. 2018).

       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       Mississippi Bureau of Narcotic agents’ investigatory stop was lawful under Terry, both at its inception and in its scope, because the agents were entitled to conduct a carefully limited search of the outer clothing of defendant in an attempt to discover weapons that could be used to assault them; defendant was not under arrest because he was not physically placed under arrest and did not personally submit to any show of authority.

      </h4>
      <p>
       Circuit court did not err in admitting into evidence a firearm and marijuana found in the street because defendant surrendered his Fourth Amendment protections as to those items when he abandoned them; defendant was not considered arrested under the Fourth Amendment until he was captured by the chasing Mississippi Bureau of Narcotic agents and placed into custody because he was in no way restrained during his flight, and thus, no arrest occurred within the confines of the Fourth Amendment. Cole v. State, 242 So.3d 31, 2018 Miss. LEXIS 54 (Miss. 2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because the pursuit, seizure, and ultimate arrest of defendant were legal, it necessarily followed that the additional marijuana found on his person was lawfully obtained; therefore, it was not fruit of the poisonous tree. Cole v. State, 242 So.3d 31, 2018 Miss. LEXIS 54 (Miss. 2018).

       Defendant’s conviction for burglary of a dwelling house was improper where defendant exercised his right to remain silent up until the time of the trial and the trial court committed reversible error by allowing the prosecutor to imply to the jury that defendant’s post-arrest silence was an indication that he was untruthful and, by implication, and indication that he committed the crime.

       Defendant’s purported conviction for robbery was plain error because he had been indicted for burglary, not the entirely distinct crime of robbery, which was not a lesser-included offense of burglary, and a court could not make, alter, or substantively amend a felony indictment; defendant’s conviction for robbery was a plain, clear, and obvious error that violated his fundamental rights and constituted a manifest miscarriage of justice.

      </p>
      <p>
       Delay of approximately one year between defendant’s arrest and the indictment did not result in a violation of due process of law because (1) the pre-indictment delay reasonably could not have been characterized as having caused the destruction of video surveillance tapes, which routinely were destroyed a mere two weeks after they were made, or the inability of a witness to recall the date when the witness had encountered defendant; and (2) obtaining DNA testing was a large part of the reason for the lengthy delay.

   Denial of an inmate’s motion for leave to proceed with a petition for postconviction relief in the trial court was proper, where his indictment was not unconstitutional for the failure to include and specify the aggravating factors used to sentence him to death, since the United States Supreme Court has not ruled that State capital defendants have a constitutional right to have all aggravating circumstances listed in their indictments.

Furthermore, the defendant was not prejudiced in the preparation of his defense or exposed to double jeopardy by the indictment’s language. Allman v. State, 571 So. 2d 244, 1990 Miss.

       Petitioner’s argument that he was sentenced twice for the same offense and was subjected to double jeopardy lacked merit because the petitioner was not given a second sentence, but instead, after learning that federal authorities would not allow him to serve his state and federal sentences concurrently, the circuit court simply corrected its sentencing order, which it had authority to do because the sentencing order was amended before the end of the circuit court term.

       Because the first indictment was nolle prosequi before defendant pled guilty, defendant was not subject to double jeopardy as there was no prejudice. McKenzie v.

   The defendant in a murder prosecution was not subjected to double jeopardy when his bond on an unrelated pending charge was revoked based on the fact that there was probable cause to believe that he committed the murder at issue.

       In the retrial of the defendant for murder, the introduction of evidence connecting the defendant to items taken from the crime scene did not twice put him in jeopardy for capital murder or robbery; although he was previously acquitted of murder during the commission of a robbery, a capital offense, and thus could not be retried for capital murder, the jury’s acquittal on the capital crime did not imply that the jury did not believe that the defendant took items from the victim’s trailer; instead, it showed only that the jury did not believe that the murder occurred during the commission of a robbery.

       The constitutional guarantee against double jeopardy never attached where a nolle prosequi was granted after the court had questioned the veniremen and administered their oath before turning them over to the state for voir dire, but before a jury of 12 had been selected.

       Double jeopardy was not implicated where the defendant was tried for capital murder and for the same burglary that was necessary to support the capital murder offense and he eventually pled guilty to the lesser included offense of murder and to burglary of an occupied dwelling.

       The appellant’s double jeopardy rights were violated where (1) the Supreme Court previously affirmed the appellant’s capital murder conviction and reversed and remanded for resentencing, (2) the appellant was then reindicted, and the new indictment, unlike the original indictment, charged the appellant as an habitual offender, and (3) the appellant pled guilty to capital murder as an habitual offender, and agreed to a life sentence without parole.

       The criminal prosecution and conviction of the defendant for conspiracy did not violate the double jeopardy clauses of the Mississippi and United States Constitutions, notwithstanding that her vehicle was forfeited to the state prior to her criminal trial, since a civil forfeiture does not impose punishment.

   The Supreme Court was authorized to treat a circuit court’s denial of a criminal defendant’s motion to dismiss the indictment against him on double jeopardy grounds as a “final judgment” in a civil action under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.11.html#t11c51s11-51-3" target="_blank">11-51-3</a></cite>, which authorizes an appeal from a final judgment, and §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.09.html#t09c03s9-3-9" target="_blank">9-3-9</a></cite>, which gives the Supreme Court jurisdiction of an appeal from any final judgment in the circuit court, since the double jeopardy claim went beyond the defendant’s right not to be convicted in that it involved his constitutional right not to be prosecuted for the offense, and therefore denial of the claim was final and justified immediate determination. De La Beckwith v. State, 615 So. 2d 1134, 1992 Miss. LEXIS 807 (Miss. 1992), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">510 U.S. 884</cite>, <cite class="s_court">114 S.

   A defendant’s double jeopardy right not to be re-prosecuted for the same offense accrues instantly upon the happening of some event in criminal proceedings against him or her, though the original jeopardy must have “terminated” in order for such a right to accrue; thereafter, lapse of time neither strengthens nor diminishes the right as no subsequent event affects an accrued double jeopardy right.

   A nolle prosequi entered upon the motion of the district attorney did not terminate the defendant’s original jeopardy or accrue unto him the right not to be re-indicted and re-prosecuted for the same offense where the State had unsuccessfully sought the defendant’s conviction through 2 successive trials which both ended when the jury became deadlocked so that there was a “manifest necessity” to declare a mistrial in each case, there was nothing to suggest any prosecutorial misconduct or manipulation in moving for the nolle prosequi, and there was no objection by the defendant to the entry of the nolle prosequi.

   The Supreme Court was authorized to treat a criminal defendant’s appeal from a circuit court’s denial of his motion to dismiss the indictment against him on double jeopardy grounds as an appeal from a denial of a writ of habeas corpus under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.11.html#t11c43s11-43-53" target="_blank">11-43-53</a></cite>, or, alternatively, as an application to the Supreme Court for a writ of habeas corpus under §§<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.11.html#t11c43s11-43-7" target="_blank">11-43-7</a></cite> and<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.11.html#t11c43s11-43-9" target="_blank">11-43-9</a></cite>, since the defendant’s double jeopardy claim went beyond his right not to be convicted in that it involved his constitutional right not to be prosecuted for the offense, and therefore the Supreme Court had jurisdiction of the defendant’s appeal under Art I § 9 of the United States Constitution and Art 3 § 21 of the Mississippi Constitution, which guarantee the right of habeas corpus.

   A trial court’s imposition of a sentence of 49 1/2 years imprisonment upon finding that the defendant had violated a plea agreement which provided that the charges against the defendant would be dismissed following restitution and 3 years of good behavior pursuant to §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.99.html#t99c15s99-15-26" target="_blank">99-15-26</a></cite>, in spite of the defendant’s argument that the maximum sentence he should have received was 3 years since the plea bargain required him to “go straight” for only 3 years as a condition of dismissal, since the defendant had not been adjudged guilty or sentenced for the original charges until the date when the 49 1/2 year sentence was imposed, and therefore the 3-year period of conditional good behavior did not amount to a sentencing ceiling for double jeopardy purposes. Wallace v. State, 607 So. 2d 1184, 1992 Miss. LEXIS 586 (Miss. 1992).

       Where a defendant was charged with misdemeanor driving under the influence of alcohol, forfeiture of his bond and entry of a sentence of guilty into the docket constituted a conviction such that a subsequent trial for felonious driving under the influence was barred by the principle of double jeopardy.

       Trial judge’s actions were tantamount to acquittal on charge of armed robbery and thereby dismissed charge of armed robbery as to one victim where trial judge determined that state had failed to produce evidence to prove that defendant robbed alleged victim with deadly weapon, where State had attempted to establish armed robbery of alleged victim with testimony and had simply failed to prove armed robbery, rejecting claim that inability to produce alleged victim was result of manifest necessity due to his intervening illness, because state could have sought continuance but instead elected to proceed with proof until defense counsel made motion for directed verdict.

       In prosecution for attempted burglary of business dwelling, double jeopardy clause of United States and Mississippi Constitutions was not violated by retrial of defendant following order quashing indictment due to its insufficiency and failure to charge crime, since defendant was neither acquitted nor convicted, having successfully persuaded trial court not to submit issue of guilt or innocence to jury empaneled to try him.

       Judge may impose more severe sentence upon defendant following new trial and conviction for same charge for which defendant has successfully appealed original conviction but only if judge affirmatively states in record reasons for harsher sentence and only if reasons are based upon objective information concerning identifiable conduct on part of defendant occurring after time of original sentencing proceeding, or based upon objective information concerning events occurring after time of original sentencing proceeding that may throw new light upon defendant’s life, health, habits, conduct, or mental and moral propensities.

       An inmate was properly denied credit for time served upon her original sentence for time spent out of prison on parole prior to its revocation, even though credit is allowed for time spent on work release, which is functionally similar to parole; nor did denying her credit for time served while on parole deprive her of rights secured under the double jeopardy clause, deny her due process of law, or subject her to an ex post facto law.

       Defendant was not subject to double jeopardy, even though defendant was issued a citation for resisting arrest and was later convicted of simple assault on a law enforcement officer, where a clear reading of the statutes established that the two offenses contained an element that was lacking from the other.

       An order of the justice of peace court, dismissing the case against the accused for want of prosecution, showing that the accused was not prosecuted or put in jeopardy in that court, was insufficient to sustain the accused’s plea of former jeopardy in bar of judgment and sentence upon his being convicted in a circuit court of the charge of assault.

       Although it is remarked in an early case (State v Moor, Walk 134) that the double jeopardy provision is binding in state as well as in Federal courts, it is now well settled that this amendment does not affect state action (Withers v Buckley, 20 How (US) 84, 15 L Ed 816) and is directed at the exercise of Federal authority, and not at the states and their agencies.

       Administrative proceedings did not invoke the double jeopardy clause, and as such defendant was not unconstitutionally subjected to double jeopardy where his removal from the intensive supervision program and reclassification into the general prison population, as well as the imposition of his original sentence, were administrative, not criminal proceedings; double jeopardy protections did not apply to suspension revocation hearings.

       Defendant did not suffer a double jeopardy violation where the trial court’s petition to revoke probation or to revoke suspension of a sentence was not a criminal case and not a trial on the merits of the case; there was no subsequent conviction and sentence, only an indictment, and defendant failed to show he had previously been convicted of the crime of possession of cocaine when the trial judge revoked his bond, and defendant did not show that jeopardy attached at probation and bail revocation hearings.

       Although defendant claimed that the court’s decision to set his pleas aside and bring him to trial constituted a breach of the plea agreement on the State’s behalf, an abuse of discretion, and double jeopardy, the circuit court did not abuse its discretion by disregarding the original plea agreement and putting the case on the trial docket because defendant’s guilty pleas were involuntary. There was no reason why defendant should not have been proceeded against as if no trial had previously taken place; therefore, defendant could not get his convictions set aside and then claim that he was protected from a new trial by the Double Jeopardy Clauses of the Mississippi and United States Constitutions, Miss.

   Jeopardy had not attached when the municipal court dismissed defendant’s driving under the influence (DUI) charge in the municipal court, where the municipal judge received no evidence and heard no witnesses before dismissing the DUI charge. Moreover, the judge’s comments on the order relative to the DUI charge did not contain any findings of the court, but rather, the court merely recorded the reasons that the prosecutor gave for not proceeding to trial on the DUI charge; such notations in the order did not constitute either an acquittal or an adjudication, such that the subsequent indictment or trial of defendant would be barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause, U.S. Const. amend.

       Defendant’s convictions for murder and for shooting into an occupied dwelling did not violate the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment. In order to convict defendant for shooting into an occupied dwelling, the State was required to prove that defendant shot into a dwelling house, but no such showing was required to convict defendant under the felony-murder statute.

       Dismissal of the inmate’s motion for post-conviction relief was proper in part because the inmate had pled guilty to manslaughter and was never prosecuted for murder; thus, he was not twice put in jeopardy of life or limb in violation of the Fifth Amendment.

       Under the Fifth Amendment and Miss. Const. Art. 3, § 21, a trial court’s imposition of defendant’s original ten-year term after his second parole violation was not an unlawful extension or increase of his sentence in violation of his right against double jeopardy because, although the written sentencing order did not reflect the court’s imposition of the ten-year sentence but merely that all but 18 months of that sentence were suspended, on two occasions defendant was clearly informed in open court that his sentence was for ten years.

       By being subject to both a criminal prosecution and civil fines for tax evasion, defendant was not exposed to double criminal prosecutions in violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause.

       Trial court ’s resentencing of defendant to subsequent sentences that were more severe than the original sentence imposed upon defendant’s guilty plea to transfer of a controlled substance violated double jeopardy principles despite the fact that the first resentencing had been on the motion of the defendant; as the right to a legal sentence is a fundamental right, defendant could raise the claim that the re-sentencings were illegal in an out-of-time motion for post-conviction relief. Ethridge v. State, 800 So. 2d 1221, 2001 Miss. App. LEXIS 479 (Miss. Ct. App. 2001).

The crime of gratification of lust did not require any proof of sexual intercourse or proof of a laceration/tearing of the child’s genitalia, and as such, statutory rape required proof of an additional element not required by gratification of lust, and there was no double jeopardy.

Further, the facts were such that it was not clear whether defendant shot into the vehicle when he killed the victim, as there was testimony to the effect that the victim may have had all or part of his head outside the vehicle when he was shot; in essence, the facts were such that defendant could have been found guilty of murder and of shooting into a vehicle without any risk of exposure to double jeopardy.

       Defendant’s motion for post-conviction relief was properly denied where defendant’s convictions for conspiracy to commit capital murder, accessory before the fact of grand larceny, and accessory before the fact of burglary of a dwelling with intent to commit assault did not subject defendant to double jeopardy; defendant’s crimes were completely different and required proving different sets of elements.

       Trial court properly dismissed defendant’s motion for post-conviction relief where he was not subjected to double jeopardy by being convicted of three criminal offenses arising out of a single incident; a criminal defendant could be convicted of more than one offense that arose out of a single event where each offense required proof of a different element.

       Protection guaranteed by the Double Jeopardy Clauses of the Fifth Amendment and Miss. Const. Art. 3, § 22, and the doctrine of collateral estoppel, did not preclude the State from charging defendant with a cocaine offense that was the basis for an unsuccessful petition to revoke his probation, because there were different issues and burdens of proof involved in a revocation hearing and a trial on the indictment. A revocation hearing is conducted to enforce the court’s order imposing conditions on a defendant under a suspended sentence, and the issue to be determined at trial on the indictment is whether the State has proven beyond a reasonable doubt the elements of the charge; therefore, collateral estoppel does not apply.

Also, the transcript of defendant’s guilty plea hearing clearly showed that he was aware that the State would seek to invalidate his plea and reinstate the charges if he failed to testify truthfully against his co-defendant; additionally, as to the reinstatement of a kidnapping charge, it was fully within the State’s authority to re-indict defendant for the same offense after an order of nolle prosequi had been entered.

   Aggravating circumstances used to determine whether to impose the death penalty do not themselves carry any penalty, as their only purpose is to narrow class of individuals most worthy of receiving the death penalty and to furnish guidance to the jury, so that use of aggravating circumstance, such as sexual battery, which has also been the basis for conviction for an offense does not violate double jeopardy.

   Submission to a capital sentencing jury of the mitigating factor that the defendant had no “significant” history of criminal activity was not improper, in spite of the defendant’s argument that the factor was unconstitutionally applied in his particular case because it implied that he had at least some criminal history when in fact he had none, where the mitigating factor was taken verbatim from the list provided by the legislature to be considered in imposing sentence, and the defendant had the opportunity during closing argument to dispel any notion the jury might have had that he had a history of criminal activity.

       Since Mississippi’s capital sentencing procedure requires the jury to determine whether the State has proved its case for the death penalty, the double jeopardy clause will protect a defendant from any subsequent attempt to subject him or her to the death penalty after a jury has impliedly acquitted him or her of the death penalty by determining that only a life sentence was warranted. Lanier v. State, 635 So. 2d 813, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 165 (Miss. 1994), overruled in part, Twillie v. State, 892 So. 2d 187, 2004 Miss. LEXIS 1322 (Miss. 2004).

       The double jeopardy clause did not afford a capital murder defendant protection against further capital sentencing procedures where he was originally sentenced to death by a jury, the death sentence was subsequently reversed due to a confrontation clause problem but there was no finding that the State had failed to prove its case for the death penalty, and the defendant and the State then entered into a sentencing agreement which was found to be void; since there was no acquittal of the death penalty, the double jeopardy clause would not prohibit the State from seeking the death penalty at a subsequent sentencing hearing. Lanier v. State, 635 So. 2d 813, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 165 (Miss. 1994), overruled in part, Twillie v. State, 892 So. 2d 187, 2004 Miss. LEXIS 1322 (Miss. 2004).

At the capital murder sentencing hearing on the matter of whether the defendant should be sentenced to death, the defendant was not put in jeopardy on the issue of sentence enhancement based on recidivism.

In affirming the denial of the writ, the court held that the Jackson rule was inapplicable to the Mississippi general statute on murder for the reason that an accused entering a plea of guilt to a charge of murder under Code 1942 § 2217 is not assured of not receiving the death penalty: for the trial court cannot be required to accept a guilty plea in a capital case and pronounce a sentence of less than death, but may require a jury trial in which the imposition of the death sentence is within the sole province of the jury.

       Post-arrest statements made by a defendant which are inconsistent with his trial testimony may be used by the state against him during cross-examination; to hold otherwise would not only afford the defendant the right not to incriminate himself by remaining silent but would also afford him the right not to incriminate himself by making voluntary statements which are inconsistent with his testimony at trial, which would ultimately grant a defendant who chooses to be a witness in his own defense more protection than that granted to any other witness.

   The defendant’s privilege against self-incrimination was not violated when the prosecutor argued that the defendant “pled not guilty. And he doesn’t have to do a thing. He sits there. We have to prove the case,” since (1) such argument was made in response to the defendant’s argument that the state prolonged the trial by putting forth unnecessary or redundant evidence and attempted to place the blame for his crimes on those who failed to obtain proper treatment for him, and (2) the jury was given several instructions which clarified any confusion resulting from the arguments.

       The prohibition against double jeopardy did not preclude the State at resentencing from enhancing a defendant’s life sentence for murder with the habitual offender statute where the defendant was initially sentenced to death and therefore his status as an habitual offender was not determined until after the sentencing trial on remand; since the defendant’s status as an habitual offender had not previously been determined, the finding of habitual offender status on resentencing was not barred by double jeopardy.

The defendant could be prosecuted for the murder under the original indictment since the reversal of his murder conviction on procedural grounds did not constitute a rendering of the case nor a discharge of the defendant, and the defendant’s refusal to plead guilty to the lesser offenses was a breach of the bargain.

Thus, in a prosecution for capital murder, a defendant who argued pro se to the jury and clearly went beyond the evidence in the record had to accept as a consequence the prosecution’s comment on his failure to swear to the testimony, since defendant’s remarks constituted a waiver of both the constitutional privilege against self-incrimination and the prohibition against the prosecution from commenting on his failure to testify.

A party may not testify as to material facts in proceedings which he or she initiated, and later invoke the privilege against self-incrimination on those same matters.

       Mere calling of witness by State who invoked Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination would not be sufficient grounds for reversal of capital murder conviction; however, where state was allowed to call other witnesses to testify regarding alleged confession given by that witness, wherein he had detailed events of murder and implicated defendant as party to murder, defendant’s right to confront and cross-examine witnesses presented against her was violated. Witness invoking Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination and refusing to answer any questions regarding confession effectively prevented defendant from conducting meaningful cross-examination in violation of her constitutionally protected rights; fact that defendant was allowed to cross-examine both witnesses concerning circumstances under which confession was given could not substitute for meaningful cross-examination of declarant himself; state’s contention that this evidence was properly admitted to impeach testimony given by witness was rejected, where state was allegedly attempting to impeach witness concerning statement that was accurate and truthful, which was that jury had previously decided whether he had killed decedent; court stated that it knew of no authority where truthful statements were held to be impeachable; instruction to jury that testimony was to be viewed only for impeachment purposes did nothing to diminish importance of this testimony and certainly did not cure constitutional error.

      <p>
       The constitutional right against self-incrimination requires a transactional immunity grant when a witness is granted immunity from prosecution in exchange for the witness’ agreement to testify before the grand jury. In order to place an individual in a position where he or she has no right to refuse to testify and may be held in contempt if he or she refuses to testify, the prosecution is required to grant immunity from prosecution for the witness’ involvement in the transaction which is the subject of the grand jury investigation and for or on account of any transaction, matter or thing concerning which the witness may testify or produce evidence. Moreover, no testimony or evidence produced by the witness, nor any information directly or indirectly derived from such testimony or evidence, may be used against the witness in any criminal prosecution, except perjury. Only such broad immunity will make the individual as secure as if he or she had remained silent. Wright v. McAdory, 536 So. 2d 897, 1988 Miss. LEXIS 589 (Miss. 1988).

       In a prosecution for capital murder in which, when pressured to admit that he had acted alone and without an accomplice, defendant twice replied “I prefer not to speak on that,” defendant effectively invoked his privilege against further self-incrimination under the Fifth Amendment, and, because his request was not scrupulously honored, his subsequent incriminating statements were, as a matter of law, unconstitutionally obtained and should not have been received in evidence against him at trial. Jones v. State, 461 So. 2d 686, 1984 Miss. LEXIS 2009 (Miss. 1984).

       Defendant’s statement to police officers during an interrogation should have been suppressed because the State of Mississippi failed to adequately prove that defendant initiated a conversation with the police officers after defendant invoked defendant’s right to have counsel present, and, even if defendant did initiate the conversation, the State failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that defendant’s statement was knowing and intelligent. Collins v. State, 172 So.3d 724, 2015 Miss. LEXIS 435 (Miss. 2015).
      </p>
      <p>
       In connection with the right to counsel during questioning, the standard in providing counsel does not depend on the expediency with which a law enforcement officer may secure counsel for the accused; any subsequent conversation cannot exceed the bounds of clarifying the accused person’s request. Downey v. State, 144 So.3d 146, 2014 Miss. LEXIS 389 (Miss. 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       When defendant stated that she had an attorney and “could use him,” all interrogation was required to cease except questioning for the purpose of clarifying the request for counsel, but the officer overstepped the limits of proper clarification by emphasizing the amount of time and difficulty that would be involved in obtaining counsel for defendant, and the officer’s persistence infringed on defendant’s right to cease the interrogation; because defendant invoked her right to counsel and the officer improperly continued questioning her, her rights to an attorney and against self-incrimination were violated. Downey v. State, 144 So.3d 146, 2014 Miss. LEXIS 389 (Miss. 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court manifestly erred in failing to suppress defendant’s statement to the police because the police subjected defendant to interrogation after he had invoked his right to counsel, and the State failed to prove that defendant’s waiver of rights was knowing, intelligent, and voluntary. Benjamin v. State, 116 So.3d 115, 2013 Miss. LEXIS 322 (Miss. 2013).
      </p>

       In a case in which defendant argued that the trial court should have suppressed her statements because they were taken in violation of her constitutional right to counsel. The record supported a finding that defendant received the Miranda warning, that she knowingly and intelligently waived the rights, and that she freely and voluntarily made the statements, and, pursuant to the Davis decision, she failed to make an unambiguous, unequivocal request for an attorney. Barnes v. State, 30 So.3d 313, 2010 Miss. LEXIS 104 (Miss. 2010).

       Confronting a suspect with the incriminating evidence compiled against him after he has invoked his right to counsel, and without any initiation on the part of the suspect, is precisely the kind of psychological ploy that definition of interrogation in Innis was designed to prohibit.

      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant’s right to counsel was violated by police-initiated interrogation after he asserted his right to counsel because an officer showed defendant the evidence file in an attempt to have him reconsider his request for counsel; a tactic that proved successful as defendant was not prompted to speak until he reviewed the evidence. Because the actions of the officer constituted police-initiated custodial interrogation, a valid waiver could not be established simply by showing that defendant responded to the interrogation. Pannell v. State, 7 So.3d 277, 2008 Miss. App. LEXIS 550 (Miss. Ct. App. 2008), cert. denied, 11 So.3d 1250, 2009 Miss. LEXIS 154 (Miss. 2009).

       Defendant’s capital murder convictions were proper where his Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights to counsel and to remain silent were not violated. He made no objection at trial; there was no testimony concerning defendant’s use of counsel or his right to remain silent; and the State’s questioning was designed solely to elicit a chronological version of the events involved in the investigation of the murders not the fact that the defendant requested an attorney during the State’s investigation. Rubenstein v. State, 2005 Miss. LEXIS 789 (Miss. Dec. 1, 2005), op. withdrawn, 2006 Miss. LEXIS 424 (Miss. Aug. 10, 2006), sub. op., 941 So. 2d 735, 2006 Miss. LEXIS 411 (Miss. 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Defendant’s conviction for capital murder was proper where he was not denied his right to counsel because, at the time of his confession, he was merely a suspect who had been brought to the sheriff’s department for questioning and thus, his U.S. Const. amend. VI right to counsel had not yet attached. Further, as his confession occurred during a custodial interrogation, he had a U.S. Const. amends. V and XIV right to have counsel present, but the lower court found the testimony of the officers that defendant had not invoked his right to counsel more credible than defendant’s assertion that he had done so. Brink v. State, 888 So. 2d 437, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 559 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 888 So. 2d 1177, 2004 Miss.

      <p>
       When counsel is requested, interrogation must cease, and officials may not reinitiate interrogation without counsel present, whether or not the accused has consulted with his attorney; if the accused indicates in any manner that he wishes access to counsel, interrogation without counsel is allowed only if the accused himself initiates it; waiver of Fifth Amendment protections after counsel has been requested is not foreclosed, provided the accused has initiated the conversation or discussions with the authorities; defendant’s voluntary statement after requesting counsel, that he had dug a deep hole for himself, was admissible. Randolph v. State, 852 So. 2d 547, 2002 Miss. LEXIS 2 (Miss. 2002).

      <p>
       Requesting assistance of counsel at an initial appearance or bail hearing to defend a pending charge is not the same type of invocation of counsel contemplated by the Fifth Amendment Miranda-Edwards interest against compulsory self-incrimination, which is associated with police-initiated custodial interrogations; in order to invoke the Fifth Amendment right against compulsory self-incrimination, some “expression of a desire for the assistance of an attorney in dealing with custodial interrogation by the police” is required. Balfour v. State, 598 So. 2d 731, 1992 Miss. LEXIS 131 (Miss. 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       An accused invoked her Fifth Amendment right to counsel at the time of her arrest when she asked for an attorney and stated that she was not going to sign any papers or answer any questions without having a lawyer present; the accused invoked her Sixth Amendment right to counsel and the state counterpart right secured by Article 3, § 26 of the Mississippi Constitution at her initial appearance when she indicated a desire for representation and an interest in contacting her family to ascertain their progress in hiring a lawyer for her. Balfour v. State, 598 So. 2d 731, 1992 Miss. LEXIS 131 (Miss. 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       A trial court erred in admitting a defendant’s confession evidence since the confession was tainted by the constitutional violation of the defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to counsel and rights secured by Article 3, § 26 of the Mississippi Constitution, where the defendant “waived her rights” and made the confession after a sheriff department investigator and deputy initiated contact with her within less than 4 hours after she invoked the right to counsel at her initial appearance; the confession was also tainted by violation of the defendant’s Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment rights since the defendant had also requested a lawyer and declined to waive any rights at the time of her arrest. Balfour v. State, 598 So. 2d 731, 1992 Miss. LEXIS 131 (Miss. 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       When an accused makes an equivocal statement suggesting a request for counsel, the interrogation may only continue “on the narrow road” to ascertain the meaning of the equivocal statement. The interrogating officer has an affirmative duty to attempt to clarify the request before proceeding with the substance of the interrogation; the officer’s subsequent finding will determine whether or not interrogation may continue. Kuykendall v. State, 585 So. 2d 773, 1991 Miss. LEXIS 647 (Miss. 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       Once an accused has requested an attorney, it is improper for either the same or another law enforcement officer to question the accused about his or her criminal conduct. If the accused indicates in any manner at any time prior to or during questioning that he or she wishes to remain silent or to have access to counsel, the officers must cease interrogation. When the accused asks for counsel, the officers may not resume interrogation until counsel has been provided, except where the accused voluntarily reinitiates the discussion of the charges. If the accused requests access to counsel, all officers of the prosecution force are bound thereby, including those who have no actual knowledge of the request. Kirkland v. State, 559 So. 2d 1046, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 200 (Miss. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       A defendant’s confession should not have been admitted into evidence where the confession was obtained by law enforcement officers after the defendant made a request for an attorney to the justice court judge who was considering binding him over to await the action of the grand jury, and one of the officers heard the defendant’s request. Although the defendant may only have meant that he wanted a lawyer for court proceedings and did not want a lawyer to advise him before being questioned about the crime, the officers did not seek to make such a determination, but simply proceeded to question the defendant, knowing that he was a cocaine addict and to some extent, because of such addiction, judgment-impaired at the time. No intelligent, knowing waiver of the right to counsel, which the defendant had expressed to the justice court judge, could be found from an officer testifying that he simply orally gave the defendant the Miranda warning. Kirkland v. State, 559 So. 2d 1046, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 200 (Miss. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       Admission of written statement into evidence violated defendant’s constitutional rights where, after Miranda rights were read, father of defendant informed police that attorney was desired and that no statement would be made until one was present. After this right had been invoked, officer continued questioning at which point defendant gave oral statement, which was reduced to writing following day. Prosecution could not show that defendant understood and waived his rights where officer stated that Miranda rights were read to him and defendant was asked if he understood it, to which he replied “yes”, but rights were not discussed with defendant. Impermissible questioning which occurred in police station after defendant had invoked right to counsel bears on admissibility of written statement which was obtained following morning. Reuben v. State, 517 So. 2d 1383, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2935 (Miss. 1987).

       <p>
   Statement made by defendant to deputy sheriff, in response to questioning, after defendant had requested a lawyer but before he had arrived, was not admissible by the state on its case in chief against defendant for murder; but, since the statement was not a product of coercion or promises, it was admissible to impeach defendant’s credibility as a witness.

       A defendant’s Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and Sixth Amendment right to counsel were not violated by the admission of his confession into evidence, even though the confession was obtained after the defendant initially refused to sign a waiver of rights form and had stated that he would not sign anything until he talked to his mental health counselor. The defendant’s refusal to sign the waiver of rights form was not a per se invocation of his Fifth Amendment rights. Additionally, the defendant’s request for a mental health counselor was not a per se invocation of his Fifth Amendment rights; a request for someone other than an attorney does not invoke a defendant’s Fifth Amendment rights, and a mental health counselor is not qualified to protect a defendant’s Fifth Amendment rights. Similarly, neither the defendant’s request to speak to his mental health counselor nor his temporary refusal to sign the waiver form constituted a request for counsel so as to invoke his Sixth Amendment right.

       Petitioner failed to show cause and actual prejudice necessary to overcome waiver, as there was no direct comment on his failure to testify; the prosecutor commented on petitioner’s mitigation evidence and the disparaging remarks he made about the victim, which comments were proper remarks on the weight of the mitigation evidence and did not deprive petitioner of a fair trial.

       Defendant’s capital murder conviction was appropriate because the trial court did not err in not declaring a mistrial after a witness’s comment regarding defendant’s exercise of his right to remain silent. The trial court’s instruction, to which the defense did not object, cured the error of the testimony of the investigator; therefore, the investigator’s comment on defendant’s exercise of his right to remain silent did not constitute abuse of discretion by the trial court, nor reversible error.

       Prosecutor’s statement “she can’t come here with a straight face and tell you I lied for whatever kind, sweet reason counsel opposite might have you believe” was not a comment on defendant’s failure to testify.

   Prosecutor’s statement was a permissible comment on the absence of evidence to support defendant’s defense as the prosecutor’s statement neither referred to defendant’s failure to testify, nor by masked implication suggested defendant’s silence was evidence of guilt; therefore, the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in overruling defendant’s motion for a mistrial.

Not every comment regarding the lack of any defense or upon the defense presented is equivalent to a comment on the defendant’s failure to testify; the State is entitled to comment on the lack of any defense, and such comment will not be construed as a reference to a defendant’s failure to testify by innuendo and insinuation.

       Where the prosecution asked a question that elicited a response commenting on defendant’s exercise of defendant’s right to remain silent, this infringement upon defendant’s Fifth Amendment right to remain silent was harmless error, because defendant had been identified as the perpetrator by the codefendant, who testified against defendant at trial, and the facts of the crime were largely beyond dispute.

       Prosecutor did not make improper comments on defendant’s failure to testify, and defendant was thus not entitled to mistrial, when prosecutor commented about what defendant might or might not have said to arresting officer, objected to defense counsel’s statement that defendant was a family man who should be sent home to his family, and noted that jury had not heard any proof about where defendant was going if jury did not convict him.

   A prosecutor’s remarks during the penalty phase of a capital murder prosecution did not constitute an improper comment on the defendant’s failure to testify where the prosecutor stated that the defendant “showed no compassion, but would send a lawyer up here and ask you for compassion,” since the argument pointed out the lack of a mitigation defense presented by the defendant, and that he was reduced to sending his lawyer in to plead for his life after all else had failed.

   The prosecutor’s closing argument in the guilt phase of a capital murder prosecution did not constitute an improper comment on the defendant’s right to remain silent following arrest where the prosecutor, while discussing a county jail inmate’s testimony as to statements made by the defendant while he was in the jail, referred to the relationship between the defendant and the witness, and described the circumstances under which the statements were made.

   A prosecutor’s closing argument in a capital murder case did not constitute a comment on the defendant’s failure to testify at trial, in spite of the defendant’s argument that the prosecutor’s comments highlighted the fact that the only people alive who could have testified as to the events surrounding the murders were the defendant and his accomplice, where the prosecutor merely stated that the defendant and his accomplice saw to it that there were no eyewitnesses, and that “people who kill their victims and kill their eyewitnesses cannot be set free.” Carr v. State, 655 So. 2d 824, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 56 (Miss. 1995), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">516 U.S. 1077</cite>, <cite class="s_court">116 S. Ct. 783</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">133 L.

      <p>
       In the sentencing phase of a capital murder prosecution, the State’s closing argument did not constitute a comment on the defendant’s failure to take the witness stand in his own defense where the State made the following argument: “Do you think she was suffering? Do you think that’s cruel and atrocious, and what’s even more than that, what do you think was running through [defendant’s] head as he sat through watching her gag on her own blood? What do you think he was thinking?” Thorson v. State, 653 So. 2d 876 (Miss. 1994), reh’g denied (Miss. Apr. 20, 1995).

   A prosecutor’s remarks during closing argument did not constitute improper comment on the defendant’s decision not to testify where the prosecutor did not comment on the defendant’s failure to take the stand, but merely attempted to turn the jury’s attention to the defendant’s confession to the police which had been admitted into evidence. Foster v. State, 639 So. 2d 1263, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 670 (Miss. 1994), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">514 U.S. 1019</cite>, <cite class="s_court">115 S. Ct. 1365</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">131 L.

      <p>
       A prosecutor’s comments on the defendant’s failure to testify reached a constitutional dimension so egregious that failure on the part of the defense counsel to make a proper objection either at trial or in his motion for a new trial did not waive the error where the prosecutor made 4 separate statements telling the jury that the State’s witness’ testimony was “unopposed,” “unimpeached,” “unrebutted,” and that there was “no evidence whatsoever toward their unreliability.” Whigham v.

       A prosecutor did not improperly comment during closing argument on the defendant’s right to remain silent where the prosecutor remarked that the victim could not talk because she was dead and stated that only the defendant and God knew what happened, but he did not observe the defendant’s silence during trial; the prosecutor’s comments would be a reference to the defendant’s failure to testify only if innuendo and insinuation were employed. Alexander v. State, 610 So. 2d 320, 1992 Miss. LEXIS 580 (Miss. 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       A prosecutor improperly commented during closing argument on a capital murder defendant’s failure to testify where the prosecutor stated that the defendant “hasn’t told you the whole truth yet,” that “you still don’t know the whole story,” and that the defendant was the only person alive who could give the whole story. Butler v. State, 608 So. 2d 314, 1992 Miss. LEXIS 588 (Miss. 1992).

       A prosecutor did not improperly comment on the defendant’s failure to testify when he stated during closing argument: “That’s what you have got before you, and that’s all you have got before you. All the evidence in this case points to one thing and one thing only”; the prosecutor’s comment related to the evidence presented in the trial by both the State and defense as a whole, rather than the failure of the defendant to take the stand. Rogers v. State, 599 So. 2d 930, 1992 Miss. LEXIS 123 (Miss.), overruled in part, Mayfield v. State, 612 So. 2d 1120, 1992 Miss. LEXIS 861 (Miss. 1992).

      <p>
       In a capital murder prosecution in which the defense counsel had argued that “there is only one person who can tell you if a reasonable doubt exists insofar as this case, and that’s each and every one of you,” the prosecutor’s rebuttal constituted an improper comment on the defendant’s failure to testify where it included a statement that “they tell you, there’s one man alive today who can tell you what happened, and I agree with that. There is one person who could tell you what happened and we have... a statement from him. We have a confession, an oral confession, we have a written confession....” Such remarks directed the jury’s attention to the failure of the defendant to take the stand and admit or deny the contents of the confession. Griffin v. State, 557 So. 2d 542, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 50 (Miss. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       A prosecutor’s statement in closing argument that “they” hadn’t bothered to tell the jury what the defendant was doing at a certain location was not an impermissible comment on the defendant’s failure to testify since it was proper for the prosecutor to question the defense’s inability to successfully explain the defendant’s presence in the area where the crime took place, and the prosecutor’s use of the word “they” appeared to be a reference to the defendant’s 2 attorneys rather than the defendant himself. Jimpson v. State, 532 So. 2d 985, 1988 Miss. LEXIS 428 (Miss. 1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       An assignment of error based on the prosecutor’s comment on the defendant’s failure to testify was not procedurally barred for failure to make a contemporaneous objection because the right not to take the witness stand is a fundamental constitutional right. Livingston v. State, 525 So. 2d 1300, 1988 Miss. LEXIS 223 (Miss. 1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       Argument that comment by prosecutor, who stated he had observed defendant and saw no remorse in him whatsoever, was made on defendant’s Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination did not constitute reversible error when viewed in light of all evidence. Livingston v. State, 525 So. 2d 1300, 1988 Miss. LEXIS 223 (Miss. 1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       No breach of constitutional right not to testify occurred where comment by counsel allegedly related to failure of accused to testify was in fact statement which court found had not been intended as reference to defendant’s silence, but was instead merely mention of other parties who had testified.

       In a prosecution for rape, statements made by the prosecutor concerning defendant’s failure to deny guilt when arrested were improper but did not mandate reversal of the conviction where the defense attorney neither asked the trial court to instruct the jury to disregard the statements, nor moved for a mistrial, thereby failing to properly preserve the issue for appeal, and where such error was harmless in view of the overwhelming evidence of defendant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

       Defendant’s post-arrest statement, that victim “come out on me with a gun,” was sufficiently inconsistent with his trial testimony, that third-party shook defendant’s rifle and shooting was accidental, to establish that prosecutor’s comments on statement were designed and had effect of highlighting arguable inconsistency, rather than commenting improperly on defendant’s exercise of his right to remain silent.

       A defendant’s out of court signed statement was properly used to impeach his testimony, though the statement was inadmissible in the State’s case-in-chief because the defendant signed the statement without being informed of his Miranda rights, since the statement was voluntarily given where the defendant was not threatened or mistreated when he made the statement, no one made any promises to him, he was not intoxicated or under the influence of any drugs, and the defendant admitted that he could have stopped talking at any time and could have left the room.

   A prosecutor’s question on cross-examination of the defendant, asking if “today is the first time you have told any official the version you’ve given today?”, did not constitute an improper comment on the defendant’s right to remain silent where the defendant, on direct examination, had testified to a version of the events in question that had never before been given to the sheriff’s office and the defendant had given the sheriff four other versions of the story. Once the defendant related this new sequence of events on direct examination, the prosecution was well within its rights on cross-examination to inquire further about the novelty of the story.

   While codefendants’ Fifth Amendment rights would not have been violated by having handwriting exemplars examined by an expert to authenticate a statement allegedly written by the codefendant because the evidence would not have been used as testimonial evidence at trial, there was not a substantial need for expert assistance shown in that nothing in the record indicated that defendant ever attempted to have these statements authenticated by locating someone familiar with the handwriting of the codefendants under Miss. R. Evid. 901(b)(2). Therefore, the trial court did not err in denying defendant’s motion to compel handwriting exemplars. Flora v. State, 925 So. 2d 797, 2006 Miss.

       Incriminating statements made by a murder defendant were properly admitted into evidence where the defendant was not under arrest at the time of the questioning, the law enforcement officers were merely seeking information about a missing person, the defendant voluntarily went with the officers to the sheriff’s office, he was free to leave, and he was taken home by an officer when the questioning was over.

       A defendant was under arrest and was therefore entitled to Miranda warnings where he was taken into custody by a deputy sheriff, he was told to go with the officer and was told that it was a very serious matter, he was not allowed to drive his own truck, and he was never released even though he told the officers no more about his whereabouts at the time of the crime then they had already been told. Although the questioning officer may have assumed that the defendant was not under arrest when he questioned him, that is not the test; if the officer had any intention of questioning the defendant without first giving him the Miranda warnings, it was incumbent upon him to have ascertained clearly from the officer who brought the defendant in that the defendant had not been taken into custody and that there was no reason for the defendant to believe that he was in custody.

       Complained of comments and testimony, even if improper, could not be said to amount to plain error in light of the significant circuit split as to whether the use of a defendant’s post-arrest, pre-Miranda silence as substantive evidence of the defendant’s guilt offended the Fifth Amendment; the references to appellant’s post-arrest, pre-Miranda silence did not meet all the elements of the plain-error test in that those references could not be said to be plain, clear, or obvious under the law in Mississippi.

       Defendant’s convictions for felonious child abuse were appropriate because her statements to a family protection specialist were admissible since defendant was not subjected to custodial interrogation. Defendant was questioned by the specialist, and not the law enforcement officers who accompanied her; during the questioning, defendant was not under arrest, she was in her own home and free to terminate the interview; and nothing in the testimony of defendant or the specialist indicated that defendant believed that she was going to jail rather than temporarily being detained.

       In a murder and aggravated assault case, incriminating statements made to police as defendant was being led to a patrol car were not suppressed because they were not the product of an interrogation; defendant made the statements as police were trying to read him his rights, and he was not questioned until after these warnings were given.

       Refusal of trial judge to hold a pre-trial hearing on the admissibility of certain statements in no way prevented defendant from objecting to the admission of the statements when offered; the ruling simply decided that the trial proceedings would not be halted for a separate pre-trial hearing; nevertheless, had a timely objection been interposed, the appellate court would still find no error, as the record showed no basis for a finding that the confessions had been obtained illegally: law enforcement officials who took the statements from defendant testified that (1) defendant freely and voluntarily made the statements after being advised of Miranda rights and after voluntarily executing a waiver-of-rights form; and (2) they did not use promises or threats to extract the statements from defendant.

Based on the totality of the circumstances, defendant’s constitutional rights were not violated because defendant’s statement was given freely without coercion, and the fact that defendant was 18 years old at the time of the arrest had no bearing on defendant’s ability to comprehend the questions and waive defendant’s rights.

      <p>
       A murder defendant’s confession was not the product of an illegal arrest, since conflicting statements regarding the events surrounding the killing related by the defendant to law enforcement officers provided probable cause for his arrest; moreover, the defendant’s confession was not the product of the arrest, since he gave his confession only after incriminating physical evidence was found by the officers, and the discovery of the physical evidence was the result of separate questioning of another witness and was therefore unconnected with the arrest.

       Statements made by sheriffs to a defendant that “it was always best to tell the truth” and that “it would be better for him to tell the truth” were mere exhortations to tell the truth and not an inducement to confess, where the defendant was a 22-year-old adult who had several prior convictions and was therefore familiar with the criminal justice system, the defendant’s first statement after the sheriff’s alleged inducements was a denial rather than a confession, and the defendant testified at his suppression hearing that the sheriffs did not make any specific promises.

   A trial court did not err in allowing a defendant’s statement to the police into evidence, in spite of the defendant’s argument that his statement was not voluntary because of his age, education, and intelligence, where the defendant was 17 years old at the time of his arrest and interrogation, he had an 8th grade education, his parents were uneducated, he had suffered head injuries as a young child which allegedly sometimes caused impairment of his mental faculties, and the arresting officers testified that the defendant was read his Miranda rights at least twice before any interrogation, he stated that he understood those rights and the waiver of those rights, and he stated that he did not have any trouble reading or writing.

       A defendant’s statement of his birth date elicited by the police after his arrest was obtained during routine “booking”-type questioning, so that the questioning by the police did not amount to impermissible interrogation. Testimony concerning the defendant’s admission of age was, therefore, admissible in his prosecution for rape of a female child under the age of 12, regardless of whether Miranda warnings were given.

   Confessions were held to be voluntary, despite defendants’ assertions to the contrary, where defendants’ alleged involuntariness was based on: their youth, one being 17, the other 22; their lack of education, one went through tenth grade and other graduated from high school; holding of both defendants incommunicado for 3 days after their initial incarceration, allowing no visits by friends or family until a statement was given; and, one defendant was confined for that period in “drunk tank” with no bed, shower, or change of clothes; both defendants had signed waiver of rights forms prior to giving statements.

       A defendant’s confession was not the product of mental deficiency, and therefore the defendant “knowingly” confessed, even though there was evidence that the defendant was mildly mentally retarded, where the defendant graduated from high school though he flunked 3 grades in school, there was no evidence that he was ever placed in special education classes, he admitted that he could read and write and that he understood the charges against him, and all who witnessed the interrogation said they saw no evidence that the defendant suffered mental abnormalities such that he could not understand the interrogation process or its consequences.

   The trial court in a capital murder prosecution properly concluded at the end of a lengthy suppression hearing that defendant’s confession was admissible as having been freely and voluntarily given, notwithstanding the fact that defendant was mentally retarded, where there was no evidence of any threats, promises, or any form of physical abuse of coercion, where defendant never requested the assistance of counsel, where there was no evidence that on any occasion during the questioning defendant had been under the influence of drugs or liquor, where the record was replete with the inference that the detective who interrogated defendant had been courteous, considerate, patient and persistent, and where that detective testified that the confession had been given at a time when defendant had understood and appreciated the gravity of the charges against him, and that it had been given at a time when defendant was fully aware of his constitutional privilege against self-incrimination and his right to counsel.

       Defendant’s self-incrimination rights were not violated because all law enforcement personnel who testified stated that defendant did not appear to have been under the influence of drugs and there was no corroboration to defendant’s assertions to the contrary; additionally, defendant’s actions on the day of the murders indicated a mind capable of perceiving the world around him and taking control of his own actions.

       There was no physical evidence linking defendant to a burglary but the jury was provided with physical evidence connecting his accomplice to the crime. Then, the jury was told that defendant was able to identify his accomplice close to the crime scene when this identification had already been suppressed due to the violation of defendant’s Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights at the time of his arrest (Miranda violation); thus, the identification testimony by the officer was unquestionably prejudicial, the prosecutor’s closing argument further compounded the problem by linking the physical evidence connecting the accomplice to the crime to defendant, and the trial court committed reversible error in denying defendant’s motions for a mistrial and for a new trial.

       The defendant was properly advised of her rights prior to making her confession because (1) the five to 10 minutes that elapsed between one interview and another interview by a different officer constituted only a brief pause in questioning that did not require a renewal of Miranda warnings, and (2) the defendant had been advised of her Miranda rights three times in a period of less than 24 hours.

       An accused person who has been given the Miranda warnings is not obliged to answer any questions or to make any explanation. The accused need not invoke the presence of counsel in order to obtain the benefits of these rights. It is improper and, ordinarily, reversible error to comment on the accused’s post-Miranda silence. The accused’s right to be silent then is equally as strong as the right not to testify and it is error to comment on either. It is therefore improper to inquire of a testifying defendant as to whether he or she made any protest or explanation to the arresting officers. Quick v. State, 569 So. 2d 1197, 1990 Miss.

      </p>
      <p>
       A warning advising a suspect “that anything he said might be used against him in a court of law” is constitutionally adequate; an officer is not required to advise a suspect of all specific possible criminal consequences. One of the virtues of Miranda is its clarity; the warnings are the same in every case. Adding the requirement that the officer inform the suspect of specific criminal consequences would add a component variable from case to case and undermine the simplicity and bright-line character of the rule as it stands.

   Argument that Miranda warning given defendant which concluded with the words “we have no way of giving you a lawyer, but one will be appointed for you if you wish, if and when you go to court”, was insufficient and ineffective since it left the impression with defendant that he was entitled to an attorney only during trial, but not during interrogation, was persuasive in isolation, but when considered in context with the remainder of the related warning, a part of which advised of the right to an attorney before responding to question, the plausibility disappeared; however peace officers would be well advised to delete the words “if and when you go to court” from future warnings.

       Defendant’s confession, which was made during a police interrogation, was freely and voluntarily given, and defendant’s rights waiver was knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily made, because, although defendant declined to sign the rights waiver form, defendant voluntarily informed the interrogating officer of defendant’s alibi and responded to further questioning, despite being advised several times that defendant could stop the interview at any point, until defendant confessed to the rape of the victim.

       Trial court erred in admitting defendant’s confession without first holding a hearing without the jury present where the voluntariness issue had appeared before the trial court, the trial court allowed the State to elicit testimony from the officer who had advised defendant of his Miranda rights and recorded his confession, and by not holding that hearing, the trial court had precluded defendant from putting on evidence refuting the officer’s testimony.

       Trial court’s ruling that defendant made a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary waiver of his Miranda rights was supported by substantial evidence because a police officer’s threat to arrest defendant’s wife if defendant did not confess that drugs belonged to him was insufficient to render defendant’s statement involuntary because probable cause existed to arrest defendant’s wife because cocaine was found in the kitchen, a common area of the home, and defendant’s wife had been living in the home and was listed on the lease.

   In a capital murder case, a motion to suppress defendant’s confession was properly denied because the statement was voluntarily given, despite cultural differences; defendant, who completed 10 years of education, waived Miranda rights and entered a partial confession before police mentioned religious beliefs. Le v. State, 913 So. 2d 913, 2005 Miss. LEXIS 151 (Miss.), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">546 U.S. 1004</cite>, <cite class="s_court">126 S. Ct. 622</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">163 L.

       Trial court did not err in finding that a statement made by defendant during the booking process for the crime of driving while impaired was admissible because the statement was freely and voluntarily given; the admission of the spontaneous statement was not barred by the Fifth Amendment. Watson v. State, 835 So. 2d 112, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 6 (Miss. Ct. App. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       The defendant’s confession was voluntarily given because (1) he had been read his Miranda warnings, (2) the arresting officers did not interrogate the defendant about his involvement in the crime at issue, and (3) the defendant spoke freely without prompting by the officers; a contrary determination was not required by the fact that the defendant had an apparent friendship with one of the officers because the friendship did not create a compelling influence on the defendant.

      </p>
      <p>
       The defendant’s confession was voluntary, notwithstanding that he was in the emergency room with two self-inflicted stab wounds, neither of which turned out to be life threatening, and the assertion that he was involuntarily intoxicated, where (1) law enforcement officers testified that the defendant was alert, aware of his surroundings, and answered all their questions rationally, and that he voluntarily waived his Miranda rights, and (2) the emergency room physician and the attending nurse corroborated the officers’ view that the defendant understood everything they asked, answered all their questions, was alert, stable, oriented and not in shock.

      <p>
       A statement made by the defendant was volunteered information, unprompted by the equivalent of interrogation, where, while he was being booked for stealing a truck, the defendant asked how the officer could charge him with such an act, the officer explained the facts that led to the charge, and the defendant responded that he thought he should only be charged with unauthorized use of a motor vehicle.

       Confessions made by a 14 year old defendant in a murder prosecution were not voluntary where the strategy of the interrogating officers to procure a confession was to convince the defendant that he might receive religious salvation for his sins and see his murdered parents again if he told them the truth; the defendant’s will was overborne and his confession was induced by the investigating officers’ invocation of the deity, references to heaven and hell, and promises of leniency and religious salvation which, according to the officers’ testimony at the suppression hearing, could only be attained by a confession. Carley v. State, 739 So. 2d 1046, 1999 Miss. App. LEXIS 188 (Miss. Ct. App. 1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       The trial judge did not err in finding that the defendant’s statements were made voluntarily where the interrogating officers testified (1) that the defendant never refused to speak to them, but initially denied any involvement in the crime at issue, (2) that the defendant understood his rights, including his right to remain silent, voluntarily spoke with them, and never requested an attorney, (3) that no one promised anything to the defendant or threatened him in any way, and (4) that the defendant stated that he understood his rights before voluntarily signing a rights waiver form.

       Determination that defendant was not threatened into making confession was supported by testimony of all detectives present at time of alleged threat, in which detectives all denied that threat was made. Morgan v. State, 681 So. 2d 82, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 429 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Delay of approximately 24 hours between time of arrest and initial appearance before magistrate did not warrant suppression of confession given by defendant prior to initial appearance; defendant was arrested by warrant while he was already in jail, defendant was informed of his right to remain silent, his right to attorney, and his right to stop answering questions at any time and to ask for attorney, and defendant did not ask for appointment of counsel on charge for which he was arrested. Morgan v. State, 681 So. 2d 82, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 429 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       A defendant’s confession was freely and voluntarily given, and was therefore admissible into evidence in his murder trial, where law enforcement officers testified that he was given all the Miranda warnings prior to giving his confession and that he did not ask for an attorney at any time, he was familiar with his constitutional rights as evidenced by his refusal to sign a waiver form and the fact that he had previously been convicted of a felony, and his video-taped confession did not suggest any coercion.

      <p>
       The principle enunciated in
   Agee v State (1966, Miss) 185 So 2d 671 with respect to proving the voluntariness of a confession remains sound, but its importance to an accused has receded in view of the strong affirmative mandates of Miranda; only those persons who are claimed to have induced a confession through some means of coercion are required to be offered by the State as a witness under Agee.

       Where the State has laid the “proper predicate” for admission of a defendant’s confession, the onus is then on the defendant to provide other evidence or testimony on the issue of voluntariness to rebut the State’s assertion. Haymer v. State, 613 So. 2d 837, 1993 Miss. LEXIS 32 (Miss. 1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a prosecution for driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor, the defendant’s statement to a police officer that the breathalyzer machine would “probably show I’m in a coma” was essentially a confession that the defendant was drunk, and was therefore admissible into evidence as a voluntary statement where it was made spontaneously after the defendant had been given the Miranda warnings. Ricks v. State, 611 So. 2d 212, 1992 Miss. LEXIS 819 (Miss. 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       A trial court followed the correct legal standards to determine the admissibility of the content of a defendant’s confession and there was substantial evidence to support a finding of voluntariness, where no pre-trial motion to suppress was filed, the trial court conducted a hearing in chambers during the trial after the defendant’s in-court objection to the voluntariness of his confession, the trial court found that the State had established a “proper predicate” on the testimony of a fire marshal who was present at the time of the confession, and the defendant did not rebut the State’s predicate during arguments on the motion, so that the State was not required to produce all of the witnesses to the confession to establish voluntariness. Cox v. State, 586 So. 2d 761, 1991 Miss. LEXIS 588 (Miss. 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court did not commit error in determining that statements were voluntarily given after knowing and intelligent waiver where defendant contended statements were made when he was misled as to their import, arguing that he was arrested on one charge but questioned concerning a more serious charge. Testimony at suppression hearing supported trial court’s determination that waiver was voluntary despite questioning related to crime not charged, where defendant was presented warrants for his arrest on charges of forgery and credit card misuse, but before statement was taken was informed that sheriff was present in regard to investigation into death of man who owned credit cards he was accused of illegally using. Transcript of defendant’s recorded statement made clear that he was informed that officers wanted to talk with him about murder investigation. Lutes v. State, 517 So. 2d 541, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2931 (Miss. 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       Determination of whether confession is voluntary and freely given, and not product of coercion, is finding of fact which will not be reversed on appeal unless manifestly in error, or contrary to overwhelming weight of evidence; factual determination that confession was voluntarily and freely given was not clearly erroneous where interrogating officer testified that no mental or physical pressure was placed on defendant, no promises of freedom or leniency were offered in exchange for confession, and police officer called attorney for defendant; rejected was defendant’s argument that confession was involuntary because it was result of threats, pressure, and coercion, defendant had only 6-grade education, and at time of confession was wearing colostomy bag, which impaired ability of defendant to freely and voluntarily waive his rights against self-incrimination. Sims v. State, 512 So. 2d 1256, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2701 (Miss. 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       Admission of defendant’s confession into evidence is proper where there is voluntary and knowing waiver of Miranda rights and confessions are free and voluntary as evidenced by testimony of officers involved in obtaining the confessions, defendant initiated statement about previous rape, police officer who took defendant to station testified that defendant was not intoxicated and was in control of himself, jailer testified that he never noticed defendant experiencing severe withdrawal symptoms, and nurse assigned to jail did not recall defendant asking to see doctor and observing that defendant appeared to know what was going on and to understand questions and make appropriate responses.

       A confession by the defendant was not the product of threats or promises made by police, notwithstanding statements by the police that defendant should tell the truth so she would feel better about herself, that she and her boyfriend were “going down” if she did not tell the truth, and that she would be better off if she told the truth and should explain what occurred so she could have peace of mind.

      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant’s confession was not unlawfully induced by detective’s comment that defendant should tell truth and that “the truth shall set you free”; defendant had history of legal problems and had opportunity to become familiar with criminal justice system, there was nothing to indicate that defendant placed trust or confidence in detective, and defendant testified that he was not offered any promises or inducements to make written or videotaped confessions.

       <p>
   A defendant’s statement to police was admissible and not the product of improper inducement, even though a police officer had told the defendant that “it’d be best for him to tell us to help himself,” where the defendant received Miranda warnings twice, he understood his constitutional rights, his statement was a denial rather than a confession, no specific promise was made to him by a law enforcement officer, and he maintained that he would have told the truth regardless of the officer’s comments to him.

       The trial court in a capital murder prosecution erred in refusing to suppress the defendant’s confession as involuntary where a former teacher and retired minister was called in by the sheriff to meet privately with the defendant, the minister communicated to the defendant, at the sheriff’s direction, the notion that there might be a chance for mercy if he volunteered to cooperate, the minister and the defendant discussed the death penalty and the religious ramifications of the defendant’s action, a sheriff’s deputy told the defendant that he thought it would look better if the defendant confessed, and an investigator who conducted the interrogation with the sheriff admitted that the defendant may have been given the impression by the investigator and the sheriff that cooperation could be of some benefit.

       The trial court did not err in finding that a waiver of rights form signed by the defendant prior to his later contrary statement was in accordance with the law and that the defendant had waived his rights knowingly in a statement where he made an admission of guilt, where (1) no physician was produced, either during the suppression hearing or at trial, to attest to the fact that the defendant suffered from anxiety or that he had been taking medications for that condition, and (2) there was no testimony from the defendant or anyone else that his medication had been withheld by an officer until he confessed.

       In order to establish the admissibility of a murder defendant’s confession, the State was not required to offer as witnesses law enforcement officers who allegedly yelled at the defendant and were abusive when he was initially questioned, since the alleged statements made by the officers had no bearing on the defendant’s confession which was made 2 days later after he was given the Miranda warnings.

       The evidence was sufficient to support a finding that the defendant knowingingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived his Miranda rights, even though the defendant had been drinking prior to his arrest, he had not slept for nearly 24 hours prior to waiving his rights, and he had periodic bouts of crying, where the defendant repeatedly acknowledged that he understood his Miranda rights and expressed this acknowledgment both orally and in writing, he was 49 years old, had a high school and vocational education, and considered himself to be a “very intelligent person,” his criminal past provided him with some experience and knowledge about a suspect’s Miranda rights, 5 witnesses testified that he did not appear to be impaired by alcohol and did not slur his speech, the defendant testified that he had been a chronic drinker, the defendant was for the most part calm and cooperative throughout the investigation and particularly at the moment he waived his rights, the defendant had meticulously schemed to “cover his tracks” to avoid arrest which reflected a coherent, unimpaired state of mind, and the defendant’s taped confession contained the admission that no one had “threatened,” “intimidated,” or “promised him anything.” Holland v.

Const, Art 3, §§ 14 and 26. Sanders v. State, 440 So. 2d 278, 1983 Miss. LEXIS 2905 (Miss. 1983).

       In defendant’s manslaughter case, his confession was voluntary because defendant conceded that he gave the statement voluntarily, and he was given Miranda warnings and understood his rights; an officer testified that he was outside of the interrogation room, another officer and defendant came out of the room, and the officer told him that defendant had said “he just lost it and shot her and he would show us where the body was.” McBride v. State, 934 So. 2d 1033, 2006 Miss. App. LEXIS 539 (Miss. Ct. App. 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       Valid guilty plea operated as a waiver of all nonjurisdictional rights or defects that were incidental to trial; defendant was fully advised of his rights and the maximum sentences he faced if he chose to go to trial, and he was provided a detailed admonishment prior to accepting his guilty plea, such that defendant’s plea was made knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily and he waived any rights regarding the allegedly coerced confession. Swindoll v. State, 859 So. 2d 1063, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 1071 (Miss. Ct. App. 2003).

      <p>
       Where a defendant claimed his confessions were involuntary because he was on pain medication and in physical pain when he made them, unrebutted police testimony that he was read his rights, was not coerced, appeared coherent, and voluntarily confessed, supported the trial court’s decision to admit the confessions. Wimberly v. State, 839 So. 2d 553, 2002 Miss. App. LEXIS 867 (Miss. Ct. App. 2002).
      </p>

       The constitutional standard for voluntariness of a guilty plea does not mention knowledge of the mandatory minimum sentence as an essential element; instead, it merely states that the accused should understand the effects of a guilty plea. Smith v. State, 636 So. 2d 1220, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 54 (Miss. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       A defendant’s claim that he blindly entered a plea of guilty because his attorney told him that his mother advised him to do so was not sufficient to render his plea involuntary. Smith v. State, 636 So. 2d 1220, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 54 (Miss. 1994).

      <p>
       A plea is voluntary if not induced by fear, violence, deception or improper inducements. Smith v. State, 636 So. 2d 1220, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 54 (Miss. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       A defendant’s plea of guilty to 2 counts of forgery was not involuntarily entered, even though the trial court did not personally advise the defendant of the minimum and maximum penalties provided by law for the crimes of forgery, where the defendant’s attorney explained to him the maximum and minimum penalties for the charges, the defendant made no claim about the sentence he expected to receive or his belief as to the minimum sentence for the offense charged, and he did not claim that his alleged ignorance was the basis for his guilty plea. Banana v. State, 635 So. 2d 851, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 181 (Miss. 1994).

Alexander v. State, 605 So. 2d 1170, 1992 Miss. LEXIS 573 (Miss. 1992).

      <p>
       A defendant who pleaded guilty without an affirmative expression by the trial court informing him that by pleading guilty he waived his constitutional right against self-incrimination, was entitled to an evidentiary hearing on the issue of whether his guilty plea was involuntarily and unintelligently made. Although the defendant’s petition to the court to accept his plea of guilty recited that there was “no constitutional right or reason why this court should not accept this plea and enter sentence thereon,” this was not sufficient to show that he was advised or informed of his constitutional right against self-incrimination. Horton v. State, 584 So. 2d 764, 1991 Miss. LEXIS 459 (Miss. 1991).
      </p>

   Admission of a redacted video of defendant’s second interrogation constituted harmless error beyond a reasonable doubt.

   Because defendant’s Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination was not violated when defendant gave her statements to the officers that evidence of the murders could be found at the county dump, the trial court did not err in denying her motion to suppress that evidence as fruit of the poisonous tree. Chamberlin v. State, 989 So. 2d 320, 2008 Miss. LEXIS 352 (Miss. 2008), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">555 U.S. 1106</cite>, <cite class="s_court">129 S.

       Miranda warnings protected defendant’s Fifth Amendment right to be free of compulsory self-incrimination, but did not extend to nontestimonial evidence, such as the vials of crack cocaine defendant took from his pockets on police orders after he was lawfully arrested; therefore, that he had not been advised of his Miranda rights did not affect the admissibility of the cocaine.

       Although rape defendant’s consent to procurement of pubic hairs was improperly obtained in violation of the constitutional right against self-incrimination after defendant had invoked the right to counsel, the error was harmless, as the evidence was of a scientific nature, and not of a communicative nature, and the evidence was not protected by the right against self-incrimination; additionally, the evidence obtained was subject to a search warrant, for which probable cause clearly existed.

       State did not satisfy its burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant had waived her Miranda rights; defendant requested counsel by stating she had an attorney and could use him, but the officer crossed the line in clarifying this, and defendant did not initiate further conversation with the officer, and thus the trial court abused its discretion in denying defendant’s motion to suppress.

       Defendant called the State witness on her cell phone immediately after the shooting and made incriminating admissions, and approximately a month after the shooting, law enforcement provided defendant with Miranda warnings, and upon being so advised, he chose not to exercise his right to remain silent. Instead, he made oral statements to law enforcement disclaiming his connection to the shooting, which was admissible under Miss. R.

       There was substantial evidence that defendant understood English and validly waived his Miranda rights because (1) he had completed nine years of formal education, which included two years of English classes; (2) all conversations between defendant and the arresting officers were in English; (3) the arresting officers testified that defendant never asked the police officers to explain any English words to him; (4) all of the officers testified that defendant understood and spoke the English language without an interpreter; (5) defendant was given a chance to read the Miranda waiver form before signing it; (6) he gave his statement in English; (7) defendant was not threatened or intimidated, nor was he offered any promises, hopes, or rewards for his confession; and (8) defendant’s estranged wife testified that she and defendant communicated in English during their marriage.

       Evidence was sufficient to establish that the defendant waived his privilege against self-incrimination, notwithstanding that the Miranda warning procedure did not include delivering a written listing of his rights to the defendant and that the officers did not obtain a written statement from him of his understanding and knowing waiver of those rights, where the defendant did not testify in support of his suppression motion and did not present any other witnesses to contradict an officer’s testimony that the defendant was informed, understood, and waived his right against self-incrimination.

       Under a totality of the circumstances analysis, the defendant knowingly, understandingly, freely and voluntarily waived her Miranda rights, and her statements were admissible; while it certainly would have been permissible, and perhaps desirable, for law enforcement officials to inform the defendant that her parents were in the process of hiring an attorney for her and that an attorney had called to speak with her, they were not under a legal obligation to do so.

       The refusal of the defendant to sign a waiver of rights form did not constitute an invocation of his Fifth Amendment rights; thus, where the officer who had started the questioning of the defendant honored his wishes and stopped questioning him, thereby giving him the opportunity to exercise his rights to remain silent and to obtain an attorney, the defendant’s subsequent volunteering of information reasonably led to the conclusion that he did not, in fact, wish to invoke his right to remain silent.

   The court rejected the defendant’s contention that he did not make a knowing and intelligent waiver of his right to remain silent where (1) he drafted and signed a waiver form which allowed the use of his statement by federal, but not state, authorities, (2) it appeared that the form was intended to protect the defendant’s attorney from future claims if ineffective assistance of counsel, and (3) the form was not discussed with law enforcement officers and they were not aware of the limiting language inserted by the defendant.

       A murder defendant’s initial refusal to sign a waiver of rights form did not constitute a demand for an attorney where he was not questioned again until more than 32 hours had lapsed when he was presented with incriminating physical evidence connecting him to the crime, and he was again advised of his rights before further questioning; thus, admission of his confession into evidence did not violate his constitutional right against compulsory self-incrimination or right to an attorney.

       A former husband waived his privilege against self-incrimination when he took the witness stand and testified on the merits of the case in a contempt action brought by his former wife who alleged that he failed to abide by their judgment of divorce; an objection made at the close of trial was much too late to object to testimony which was incriminating. Since the contempt hearing was a quasi-criminal proceeding, the former husband had no right to forbid questioning altogether, but once he was asked anything outside of the innocuous arena–the introductory questions–he should have invoked his privilege on a question by question basis.

       There are practical and institutional limitations upon the Supreme Court’s ability to find facts; consequently, much deference is placed upon the trial judge’s full discharge of his or her responsibility to make findings of fact as to the question of whether Miranda rights have been intelligently, knowingly and voluntarily waived. However, when the trial judge fails to make specific findings and only makes general findings thereby allowing admissibility of evidence, the Supreme Court’s scope of review is considerably broader particularly when the trial judge’s findings on the precise points at issue on appeal are not clearly inferable from the findings made.

       In determining whether a confession was freely and voluntarily given, the circuit court sits as the factfinder.

The defendant waived his right against self-incrimination by answering the deposition questions even though he was not aware that any criminal prosecution was likely at the time he was deposed, was not represented by an attorney at the deposition, and was not advised by anyone that his answers could be termed voluntary and used against him in a criminal proceeding.

       Where the police read the defendant her Miranda rights and she responded “I understand, but I don’t understand if I should have a lawyer or not,” her waiver of her rights, as guaranteed under the Fifth Amendment, was knowing and intelligent in that, although she may not have been able to decide whether she wanted an attorney, the record was clear that she understood that she had the right to one; it is not the responsibility of police officers to decide for an accused whether the accused should retain an attorney, it is sufficient that the accused understand that the retention of counsel is a viable option.

       A defendant in a capital murder prosecution knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to remain silent and, accordingly, the questioning to which he was submitted was not constitutionally prohibited, where, although he was not pleased with the “waiver of rights” language in the written waiver form that he signed, he nevertheless discussed the homicide in question with officers and gave a video-taped statement after having been warned of his constitutional prerogatives, after he had executed a formal waiver of those rights, and after he had visited with his mother who was present when the statement was given, where there was no inducement or coercion to obtain the statement from defendant by way of promise of hope or reward, and where there was no evidence of physical or mental coercion for the statement through delay or any violation of defendant’s Miranda rights.

Furthermore, the environmental organization waived any objections it might have had where it made no objection before the Board and proceeded through the hearing without objection, and the organization admitted having knowledge of the identity of the hearing officer as an assistant attorney general well before the hearing and in time to object if any legitimate objection existed.

       A 16-year veteran police officer, who had vested permanent employment rights under the civil service laws, resigned on his own volition and was not “constructively discharged” where he obtained legal counsel when he became aware that he was the object of an investigation and resigned his job on his attorney’s advice. Thus, he could not thereafter pursue an untimely claim that he was denied procedural due process. In order to ensure that a civil service employee preserves his or her procedural due process guarantees, he or she should “stay the course” and remain with the job until relieved from the assignment by an official with statutory authority to fire. While the work environment could become the source of some irritation or embarrassment, such embarrassment will usually afford the civil servant nothing in the way of a procedural due process claim after a voluntary resignation. The instances will be few when a claim of constructive discharge will preserve procedural guarantees that the employee has waived by resigning. The wisdom of “staying the course” is especially crucial in light of state law which deems civil service administrative remedies as the exclusive remedy before relief can be sought in state court.

       An attorney who was suspended from the practice of law following a felony conviction in the federal courts and who was disbarred 3 years later at the conclusion of his appeal of the federal conviction, was not denied equal protection or due process rights on the ground that he would be required to wait 3 years longer before reinstatement than an attorney who chose not to appeal a conviction. All disbarred attorneys are treated equally; the disparity of time arises when an attorney resists the disbarment pending his or her appellate procedures. Had the attorney accepted the disbarment following his conviction, no delay in entering a final order of disbarment would have resulted, and therefore there was no unequal treatment or denial of due process. Additionally, the attorney’s disbarment was not retroactive to the date of his suspension since the attorney’s initiative delayed the entry of the final order; retroactivity cannot be applied when the attorney seeks a stay of the final order.

       Teacher’s constitutional right to due process was not violated by school board despite claim that he was denied fair and impartial hearing because school board had already determined to dismiss him when it informed him of his right to public hearing, and because even though board conducted hearing through hearing officer, the ultimate decision rested with board. First, teacher had made no complaint at time of hearing about possibility of impartiality of school board, and such failure waived point. Second, where board acts both investigatively and adjudicatively, court establishes presumption of honesty and integrity in those serving as adjudicators, and in order to rebut presumption, teacher must show that board members had personal or financial stake in decision, or that there was some personal animosity toward teacher. Finally, showing that board was involved in events preceding termination is not enough, absent showing of either personal animosity, personal stake, or financial stake in decision, to overcome presumption of honesty and integrity of board members.

       The construction and maintenance of a warehouse for the reception of freight on railroad right-of-way, which had existed as such for more than 50 years prior to the adoption of an ordinance making most of such right-of-way a residential district, held to be a reasonable use of such right-of-way in facilitating the company’s principal business and no more objectionable than the operation of trains, and to be authorized by provision of ordinance excepting existing nonconforming uses; and, accordingly, action of city authorities in denying such use of the property was an unreasonable and arbitrary interpretation of the ordinance which tended to deprive the company of its property and use thereof in violation of both Federal and State Constitutions.

       The four criteria that a taxing statute must satisfy to withstand a challenge under the commerce clause and due process clause of the United States Constitution are: (1) the tax must be applied to an activity with a substantial nexus with the taxing state; (2) the tax must be fairly apportioned; (3) the tax must not discriminate against interstate commerce; and (4) the tax must be fairly related to services provided by the taxing state; the failure to meet any one prong of the test renders the tax invalid.

Additionally, the probationer was not wrongfully denied the opportunity to call his own witnesses where he made a last-minute request during the third hearing to call witnesses who allegedly would have testified in his behalf, the court concluded that the witnesses would have offered no new evidence, the probationer had already admitted that he committed probation violations, and at most the witnesses would have testified in regard to the probationer’s character and would have had no effect on the outcome of the case.

       Inmates who are placed in administrative segregation have no constitutional basis for demanding the same privileges as those inmates in the general prison population since prison officials have the discretion to determine whether and when to provide prisoners with privileges such as showers, exercise, visitation, and access to personal property.

   A circuit judge erred in deciding not to subject a creditor to liability for injurious violation of a debtor’s constitutional right to due process when the creditor seized the debtor’s mobile home and furnishings in compliance with §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.11.html#t11c37s11-37-101" target="_blank">11-37-101</a></cite> simply because the creditor acted pursuant to a presumptively valid (albeit unconstitutional) statute. An evidentiary hearing should have been held, and the creditor’s claim of good faith reliance on a presumptively valid statute should have been considered in light of not only the sincerity in its belief that it was acting properly, but the reasonableness of its actions under the circumstances. A fact finder conceivably could have concluded that the creditor’s “surprise” seizure of the debtor’s mobile home and its contents was, under the circumstances, unreasonable and compensable, where the record indicated no explanation for the necessity of an immediate seizure.

       Defense counsel was given every opportunity to listen to the tapes and view the transcripts, as all evidence was made available to defense counsel, and no evidence was intentionally withheld by the State; additionally, when applying the four-part test to determine if Brady violations occurred in the inmate’s case with respect to two witnesses, the trial court finding on that issue was supported by the record. Therefore, all exculpatory issues raised by the inmate regarding those two witnesses were without merit, and there was no violation of defendant’s due process rights. Manning v.

Additionally, the inmate was allowed to seek post-conviction relief on the question of whether the State had knowingly suppressed additional exculpatory evidence, including (1) notes taken on the door-to-door canvas conducted following the murders; (2) statements of other neighbors implicating another suspect; and (3) other impeachment evidence.

       There can be no per se prohibition against a child witness testifying in a divorce case between the child’s parents. The right of every litigant to compulsory process for witnesses and to have them testify under oath in court is so well grounded that any per se exclusion simply because he or she is a child of the divorcing parents risks offending the due process provisions of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution and Mississippi Constitution Art 3, § 14. Before excluding the testimony of a child witness of tender years in a divorce proceeding, the chancellor, at a minimum, should follow the procedure required by Crownover v Crownover (1975) 33 Ill App 3d 327, 337 NE2d 56. Although no parent can be precluded from having a child of the marriage testify in a divorce proceeding simply because of that fact, parents in a divorce proceeding should, if at all possible, refrain from calling children of their marriage as witnesses, and counsel should advise their clients against doing so except in the most exigent cases.

       While the due process clause requires that an indigent defendant should at times be allowed an expert in the interest of fundamental fairness, a court is not required to appoint an expert upon demand. Some of the factors to be considered in determining if the defendant was denied a fair trial when the court did not appoint a requested expert include the degree of access the defendant had to the State’s experts and whether those experts were available for vigorous cross-examination. Another consideration is the lack of prejudice or incompetence on the part of the State’s experts. Fisher v. Eupora, 587 So. 2d 878, 1991 Miss. LEXIS 669 (Miss. 1991).

       Defendant was barred from asserting claim of state’s abuse of its peremptory challenges to exclude all blacks from defendant’s jury, which allegedly deprived him of his right to representative jury and to due process of law, where record failed to reflect that defendant had made contemporaneous objection to prosecuting attorney’s use of peremptory challenges.

       Jury selection was properly conducted and jurors were not excluded on basis of race where black jurors were excluded for following race-neutral reasons: (1) 22-year-old laborer with eleventh-grade education was stricken because his youth, marital status, and educational level appeared to prosecutor to indicate instability; (2) 49-year-old minister/bus driver was stricken because he was preacher; (3) 35-year-old housewife was removed because she did not reveal her brother’s conviction for armed robbery; (4) 38-year-old cafeteria hostess was challenged because of her concerns about sequestration due to having to care for invalid mother; and (5) 25-year-old was stricken from panel because he wore hat into courtroom and his general demeanor suggested to prosecutor that he was unstable, unconcerned, and had no respect for proceedings.

       Under Batson v Kentucky (1986) 476 US 79, 90 L Ed 2d 69, 106 S Ct 1712, defendant raising claim must show (1) he is member of “cognizable racial group;” (2) prosecutor has exercised peremptory challenges toward elimination of veniremen of his race; and (3) facts and circumstances infer that prosecutor used his peremptory challenges for purpose of striking minorities. These components constitute prima facie showing of discrimination necessary to compel state to come forward with neutral explanation for challenging black jurors. Lockett v.

       Prosecutors are not limited in use of any legitimate informational source available as to jurors, nor does prosecutor have to question juror in open court about such information before using it as racially neutral ground to make peremptory strike, as long as source of information and practice itself are not racially discriminatory.

   The State’s plea bargain with a codefendant which was conditional upon his testimony at the defendant’s trial did not violate due process where there was no indication that the codefendant’s plea reduction was made conditional upon “false or specific testimony or a specific result,” and the defendant’s attorney cross-examined the codefendant extensively on the plea bargain; the practice of the State’s withholding its end of a plea bargain until a codefendant has testified is permissible and does not result in tainted and inadmissible testimony, but rather the existence of a plea bargain is to be considered by the trier of fact in determining the credibility of the codefendant’s testimony.

       Appellate court overruled defendant’s argument that the on-the-scene identification violated his due process rights and prevented him from receiving a fair trial, because the pre-trial identification was sufficiently reliable. The victim had the opportunity to view defendant two or three times before the armed robbery occurred, the victim testified that he was indeed paying attention before, during and after the robbery, the record indicated that the victim gave a detailed description of defendant that was largely accurate, and the victim was, insofar as the record revealed, unequivocal in his ability to identify defendant on four separate occasions.

       Chance encounter with the victim at the police station did not amount to an unnecessarily suggestive, single person show-up identification such as to violate due process; the victim’s description given to police was sufficiently accurate for them to identify defendant as a suspect based on nothing but information obtained from her, and only the briefest of time transpired between the victim’s encounter in the parking lot and her subsequent unanticipated encounter with defendant at the police station, at which time she identified him of her own volition, apparently without any prompting or inquiry from any investigating officer.

       When a reasonably intelligent eyewitness has had a good opportunity to view the features of the perpetrator of a crime, the method the police use in having the witness identify the defendant recedes in importance in inverse ratio to the intelligence of the witness and opportunity to view the perpetrator. Thus, a rape defendant’s argument that the victim’s in-court identification resulted from an impermissibly suggestive photographic identification of the defendant, or from seeing him at the preliminary hearing, was without merit where the victim was a sensible child who had ample opportunity to view the rapist in the daylight, she gave a description of the defendant to a police officer, the accuracy of which was undisputed, and she identified the defendant’s photograph without hesitation no more than 1 1/2 hours after the crime.

   The capital murder statute (§<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.99.html#t99c19s99-19-101" target="_blank">99-19-101</a></cite>) does not unconstitutionally shift the burden of proof during the sentencing phase by requiring a defendant to come forward with proof of mitigating circumstances or automatically have the death penalty imposed, since the statute does not require the jury to impose death when aggravating circumstances are shown and mitigating circumstances are not; proof of aggravating circumstances may still be found insufficient by the jury to require death and the state still carries the burden of showing not only aggravating circumstances, but that the circumstances are sufficient to warrant death. Furthermore, the statute is not unconstitutional for failing to provide guidelines for appellate review, since a comparison with other cases where the death penalty was upheld is constitutionally adequate and comparison with cases of life imprisonment is not required; the use of the “especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel” aggravating circumstances is not vague, overbroad or violative of the Fifth Amendment, and the statute does not unconstitutionally allow unlimited evidence at the sentencing stage, since evidence is limited to the aggravating circumstances listed in the statute.

       A restrictive covenant is an interest in real property for which due compensation must be paid upon a taking by the exercise of eminent domain powers. Morley v. Jackson Redevelopment Auth., 632 So. 2d 1284, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 75 (Miss. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       Homeowners who suffered additional damages allegedly attributable to a highway construction project a few years after the homeowners were compensated for the taking of their property by the condemning authority in an eminent domain action could not recover for the additional damages, even if those damages were not reasonably foreseeable at the time of the original eminent domain trial. King v. Mississippi State Highway Com., 609 So. 2d 1251, 1992 Miss. LEXIS 590 (Miss. 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       An actual taking or physical invasion of property is not the only basis for compensation. Damage to adjacent private property caused by public use is also compensable. Property is damaged when it is made less valuable. Personal inconvenience, discomfort, or interference with use is not compensable unless it results in the depreciation of value. Even then, compensation is not definite, but these factors are evidence of conditions which adversely affect the value of land. Persons owning property abutting streets have a right to reasonable access to their property from the street, and altering that access may damage the property. Where alteration of access, including light, air and view, diminishes the value of the property, the owner is entitled to compensation; such compensation is commonly termed consequential damages. Gilich v. Mississippi State Highway Com., 574 So. 2d 8, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 778 (Miss. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       The alteration of access to property requires compensation only where, and to the extent that, alteration of access diminishes the value of the property. Matters such as parking and increased difficulty in maneuvering automobiles may likewise be considered to the extent of their adverse effect on property value. Additionally, loss of frontage that “moves” buildings and facilities closer to a roadway may adversely affect value and require compensation. However, compensation for such losses is due only to the extent that the damage is caused by governmental action as distinguished from landowner improvements. Thus, such losses are legally illusory where there has been no taking, but only a reclaiming of a right-of-way that the landowner has theretofore enjoyed and where the landowner has boxed himself or herself in by the manner in which he or she has constructed or purchased the improvements on the property. So long as, after the governmental action at issue, there remains access which would be reasonable if the property had been reasonably improved, no compensation is due. City of Gulfport v. Anderson, 554 So. 2d 873, 1989 Miss. LEXIS 441 (Miss. 1989).
      </p>

       Compensation is required for a change of grade in a roadway which adversely affects the value of adjacent property, such as where a change in grade casts increased quantities of water upon the landowner’s property.

   The 2 lakes artificially created by dredging for fill materials used in construction of Interstate Highway I-10 are not part of the State’s tidelands public trust, and to strip these artificial tidelands from their record titleholders would constitute a taking within the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and within Mississippi Constitution Article 3, § 17, which taking would require just compensation from the State.

       Petitioner was granted leave to proceed in the trial court with his post-conviction relief petition on his claim that his Sixth Amendment right to trial by an impartial jury was violated since one of the jurors was biased; since petitioner’s claim was at least “procedurally alive,” his allegation of improper juror contact warranted an evidentiary hearing. Corrothers v. State, 255 So.3d 99, 2017 Miss. LEXIS 40 (Miss. 2017).
      </p>
      <p>
       Supreme court cannot ignore the plain language of the Sixth Amendment, which limits its own application to “criminal prosecutions"; to the extent the supreme court held in the case of In Interest of C.B., that the Sixth Amendment applies in civil proceedings, the supreme court overrules it.
   Miller v. Smith, 229 So.3d 100, 2017 Miss. LEXIS 427 (Miss. 2017).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a murder case, even if defendant’s constitutional rights were violated, no overwhelming injustice occurred because there was overwhelming evidence presented of his guilt. Offenses to certain constitutional rights did not require a per se reversal. Hall v. State, — So.3d —, 2016 Miss. LEXIS 125 (Miss. Mar. 17, 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Although the state failed to identify the nurse who drew defendant’s blood, and defendant was consequently unable to cross-examine her, his Sixth Amendment right to confront witnesses was not violated. The Sixth Amendment does not require that anyone whose testimony may be relevant in establishing the chain of custody, authenticity of the sample, or accuracy of the testing device, must appear in person or as part of the prosecution’s case; rather, gaps in the chain of custody normally go to the weight of the evidence rather than its admissibility. Deeds v. State, 27 So.3d 1135, 2009 Miss. LEXIS 588 (Miss. 2009), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">562 U.S. 836</cite>, <cite class="s_court">131 S. Ct. 150</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">178 L.

      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Defendant’s conviction for murder was appropriate because he was specifically instructed on his right to testify in his own defense and the trial judge was careful to inform defendant that the decision was for defendant alone to decide; the record did not demonstrate that defendant was refused an opportunity to present a defense, and the record and arguments demonstrated that defendant’s counsel was satisfied that defendant received what he asked of the trial judge. McCain v. State, 971 So. 2d 608, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 295 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 973 So. 2d 244, 2007 Miss.

       Where defendant failed to show that the under-representation of a racial group on his jury was based on a systematic exclusion in selection of the jury venire, defendant was not denied a jury that was a fair cross-section of the community. Pratt v. State, 870 So. 2d 1241, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 273 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant’s right to a fair trial was not denied where the prosecutor’s statements, while rambling and tending to bring in extraneous considerations, largely were focused on the need to consider that drugs were dangerous and possession should be a crime; the evidence offered to support conviction was of a person signing for delivery of marijuana, without any evidence that he was otherwise involved in the drug trade; the challenged arguments were not in the “send a message” category and the statements did not interfere with the fairness of the trial. Shanks v. State, 951 So. 2d 575, 2006 Miss. App. LEXIS 647 (Miss. Ct. App. 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   In defendant’s capital murder case, while the prosecutor’s comments to the jury regarding defendant’s having the protection of the constitution, but the victim not having it, were condemned, they did not constitute reversible error where the argument was not likely to have influenced the jury. The evidence of defendant’s callous indifference to human life was overwhelming, and the jury’s sentence was well supported by the record. Goodin v. State, 856 So. 2d 267, 2003 Miss. LEXIS 353 (Miss. 2003), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">541 U.S. 947</cite>, <cite class="s_court">124 S. Ct. 1681</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">158 L.

       Court rejected defendant’s claim that certain trial court rulings denied defendant a fundamentally fair trial ensured by U.S. Const. Amend. VI; because defendant’s asserted individual errors were without merit, defendant’s claim of cumulative effect was also without merit. Sheffield v. State, 844 So. 2d 519, 2003 Miss.

      </p>
      <p>
       Isolated reference to what perpetrators told an investigator about defendant’s connection to a burglary was insufficient to rise to the level of a Confrontation Clause issue, especially because one of the perpetrators testified against defendant in the trial for the offense of accessory after the fact to burglary.

   In earlier decisions the view has been expressed that the

   167 So 779; Skinner v State, 198 M 505,
   23 So 2d 501. And that this amendment applies only to trials in Federal Courts and does not require giving to accused in criminal prosecution for burglary in state court assistance of counsel for his defense.

      <p>
       Trial court did not err in denying defendant’s motion to suppress his pre-trial confession to police because the State presented sufficient evidence to show that defendant’s statements were voluntarily made without threats, coercion, or an offer of reward. The State introduced a police officer’s testimony that stated that no threats were made and a videotape of the confession; also defendant signed a Miranda warning form and four forms waiving his rights to counsel and to remain silent. Manix v. State, 895 So. 2d 167, 2005 Miss. LEXIS 112 (Miss. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Defendant’s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel in all phases of his capital murder trial were rejected because the evidence showed defendant’s confession was not coerced, that police did not make promises to induce his confession and that defendant was read his Miranda rights before making his voluntary confession. Also defendant failed to show that his counsel’s failure to investigate a critical prosecution witness resulted in prejudice where there was sufficient other evidence of defendant’s guilt, or that he was not properly advised regarding a plea bargain offer. Hodges v. State, 912 So. 2d 730, 2005 Miss. LEXIS 164 (Miss.), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">546 U.S. 1037</cite>, <cite class="s_court">126 S. Ct. 739</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">163 L.

       The presence of security personnel at trial did not deny defendant a fair trial – a witness frightened by the presence of many armed guards did not admit to having testified differently because of the presence of the guards. Russell v. State, 849 So. 2d 95, 2003 Miss. LEXIS 297 (Miss. 2003).

   Aggravating circumstances used as grounds for defendant’s death sentence did not have to be included in the indictment because Apprendi did not require the inclusion of aggravating circumstances in defendant’s indictment.

   Defendant’s due process rights were not violated as the indictment was not required to have specified the items alleged to have been taken in a robbery. Batiste v. State, 121 So.3d 808, 2013 Miss. LEXIS 295 (Miss. 2013), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">572 U.S. 1117</cite>, <cite class="s_court">134 S. Ct. 2287</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">189 L.

       Dismissal of an indictment charging defendant with being a felon in possession of a weapon and reversal of the conviction thereunder were required because the indictment failed to specify which, if any, of the four types of prohibited knives defendant was alleged to have possessed in violation of defendant’s federal and state constitutional rights.

Tran v. State, 962 So. 2d 1237, 2007 Miss. LEXIS 475 (Miss. 2007), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">553 U.S. 1054</cite>, <cite class="s_court">128 S. Ct. 2472</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">171 L.

      </p>
      <p>
       Because defendant’s indictment failed to charge the essential elements of armed robbery, the circuit court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the offense of armed robbery, but the indictment properly charged defendant with the crime of simple robbery; however, defendant’s guilty plea was involuntary because he was not informed of the true nature and consequences of the charge. Garner v. State, 944 So. 2d 934, 2006 Miss. App. LEXIS 921 (Miss. Ct. App. 2006), cert. dismissed, 951 So. 2d 563, 2007 Miss. LEXIS 534 (Miss. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because the information did not sufficiently charge defendant with armed robbery, as it did not charge the overt act as the display of a weapon by another perpetrator and then the shooting of the victim, defendant’s armed robbery conviction, the result of a guilty plea, was reversed; however, because there was a sufficient charge of simple robbery, if not for the word “attempt,” the court affirmed a conviction of robbery, and remanded for sentencing on that count.

       Indictment for murder includes all lower grades of felonious homicide, including manslaughter, and failure of state to elect between murder and manslaughter does not leave defendant ignorant of charge in violation of Sixth Amendment of United States Constitution and § 26 of Mississippi Constitution.

       Court did not violate defendants’ rights to a public trial where defendants escaped from the maximum security unit at Parchman, and both defendants were dangerous, violent, and habitual offenders. As a result of their past criminal convictions, their previous escapes, and the evidence of their willingness to do anything to remain free, the trial court was correct to find a clear and present overriding public interest in safety for the public that justified its consideration of whether to conduct the trial inside the penitentiary.

       For purposes of determining whether to unseal defendants’ previously-sealed motions to dismiss indictment and to sever attached exhibits in prosecution for conspiracy to commit murder, in light of qualified First Amendment right of public and press to openness of courtroom and court files, defendants’ rights to fair trial would be impaired if motions and exhibits were unsealed prior to trial; unsealing of motion to dismiss indictment and motion’s exhibits, which contained names and addresses of potential prosecution witnesses, would compromise witnesses’ safety and well-being, partial redaction would not prevent ascertainment of names and addresses, allegations in motion to sever could prejudice jury and might constitute inadmissible evidence, and voir dire to determine possible juror bias would not be workable solution. United States v. Nix, 976 F. Supp. 41 (1997).

      <p>
       Four-step process applies in court’s determination of whether to close criminal court proceeding or to seal court file despite qualified First Amendment right of public and press to openness of courtroom and court files: party seeking to close proceeding or seal file must advance overriding interest that is likely to be prejudiced; closure must be no broader than necessary to protect interest of accused’s right to fair trial; court must consider reasonable alternatives to closing proceeding; and court must make findings adequate to support any closure or sealing. United States v. Nix, 976 F. Supp. 41 (1997).

      <p>
       District court would allow previously-sealed motions of defendants to dismiss indictment and to sever and attached exhibits to remain sealed, but only as long as necessary to protect rights of defendants to fair trial in prosecution for conspiracy to commit murder, in light of qualified First Amendment right of public and press to openness of courtroom and court files; motion to dismiss and its exhibits would be unsealed as soon as prosecution witnesses to which motion and exhibits referred testified, and motion to sever and its exhibits would be unsealed as soon as jury was impaneled and qualified and first prosecution witness had begun to testify.

       Defendant was not denied his right to a public trial by the trial court’s order excluding a spectator who resembled defendant from the courtroom, where the spectator possibly was defendant’s brother and the purpose of the exclusionary order was to preclude confusing state’s witnesses in making an in-court identification of defendant who was seated with other spectators.

       Defendant’s argument on appeal was that there was no personal in-court identification of him as one of the men who participated in the robbery. However, the judge had recessed court for lunch and defendant failed to return to court on his bond, and upon a motion by the State, trial proceeded in his absence; because defendant chose not to return for his trial, he could not complain that he was not personally identified in court, since this was a consequence of his own voluntary act.

       The defendant was not constitutionally entitled to be present while the trial judge qualified the pool of prospective jurors since his presence in the courtroom would not have had a reasonably substantial relation to his opportunity to defend himself.

       Neither the Fifth or Sixth Amendment rights of the defendant were violated when the trial court had him removed from the courtroom at the states request during a hearing on a motion for mistrial where the legal issue to be argued concerned a question that had been asked on the stand, but to which he had yet to give an answer.

   The trial court in a capital murder prosecution did not err in permitting 3 off-the-record bench conferences and a jury instruction conference to be conducted when the defendant was not present where the defendant was represented by counsel at every critical stage of the proceedings, and he was not prejudiced by his absences at the conferences. Carr v. State, 655 So. 2d 824, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 56 (Miss. 1995), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">516 U.S. 1077</cite>, <cite class="s_court">116 S. Ct. 783</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">133 L.

       Although the trial judge did not verbally warn a defendant that he would be removed from the courtroom for disruptive conduct, the defendant received adequate warning that he would be removed for continued disruptive conduct where he was removed after an initial outburst, he was allowed to cool down, and no proceedings were had in his absence. These occurrences amounted to a warning since the defendant was not unaware that his disruptive conduct was the reason for his first removal and that continued disruption would result in a second removal.

   Even if the record clearly showed that a petitioner was in shackles in front of the jury in the sentencing phase of a capital murder trial, there was no merit to the petitioner’s arguments that his Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment rights were violated; the petitioner had already been convicted twice and had already received a death sentence for the murder of one victim, and as a juvenile, he had a history of escaping from authority.

       In defendant’s capital murder case, defendant’s right to a fair trial was not violated by the trial court’s admission of testimony about the sexual assault of the victim, which defendant was not charged with, that occurred in the moments preceding her murder where the sexual molestation was integrally related to her murder such that one could not coherently present the facts of her demise without reference to it, and it described part of the res gestae of the crime charged and helped shed light on defendant’s motive.

       Party seeking closure of courtroom or court file could overcome First Amendment presumption of openness to press and public of court file and defendants’ motions to dismiss indictment and to sever in prosecution for conspiracy, but only if party seeking closure would show, first, that there was substantial probability that defendants’ right to fair trial would be prejudiced by publicity that closure would prevent and, second, that reasonable alternatives to closure could not adequately protect defendants’ fair trial rights.

       An accused’s right to a fair trial and the press and public’s right of access to criminal proceedings must be balanced when determining whether access to legal proceedings should be restricted. The press and public are entitled to notice and a hearing before a closure order is entered, and any submission in a trial court for closure, either by a party or by the court’s own motion, and be it a letter, written motion, or oral motion, either in chambers or open court, must be docketed, as notice to the press and public, in the court clerk’s office for at least 24 hours before any hearing on such submission, with the usual notice to all parties. The requirement should not be taken to mean that a greater notice period may not be afforded where feasible. Preferably, the submission should be a written motion if time and circumstances allow. A hearing must be held in which the press is allowed to intervene on behalf of the public and present argument, if any, against closure. The movant must be required to advance an overriding interest that is likely to be prejudiced, the closure must be no broader than necessary to protect that interest, the trial court must consider reasonable alternatives to closing the proceedings, and it must make findings adequate to support the closure. In considering the less restrictive alternatives to closure, the court must articulate the alternatives considered and why they were rejected. The court must then make written findings of fact and conclusions of law specific enough that a reviewing court can determine whether the closure order was properly entered. A transcript of the closure hearing should be made public and if a petition for extraordinary relief concerning a closure order is filed in the Supreme Court, it should be accompanied by the transcript, the court’s findings of fact and conclusions of law, and the evidence adduced at the hearing upon which the judge based the findings and conclusions. These requirements cannot be avoided by an agreement between the defendant and the State that proceedings and files should be closed. Gannett River States Pub. Co. v. Hand, 571 So. 2d 941, 1990 Miss.

       Defendant’s petition to enter a guilty plea and the transcript reflected that he was aware that he would be pleading guilty to the amended charge of attempted possession of precursor chemicals, and that his attorney had gone over both the petition to enter a guilty plea and the amended charge with him. Thus, his assertion that his plea was unintelligent and involuntary was rejected, as was his argument that counsel was ineffective in failing to explain that an “attempted possession” conviction did not carry a lesser sentence. Even if that had been true, defendant received a favorable plea agreement (all but five years suspended), he had admitted guilt and that he understood the nature of the offense, and he failed to show the outcome of a jury trial would have been different.

   Trial court did not unconstitutionally limit closing argument at guilt phase of capital murder case by denying defendant full 5 minutes of additional time requested after original 60 minutes had expired; 60-minute period had been requested by defendant’s counsel, and after 5 minute extension request was refused counsel was allowed to place remaining 4 minutes into record, and case was not so complex as to require more time.

   A trial court’s limitation of closing argument to 15 minutes in the sentencing phase of a capital murder prosecution did not violate the defendant’s constitutional right to a fair trial where the defendant made no proffer as to what he would have argued had he been given additional time, and he raised no objection to the time limit at the time of trial.

       Defendant’s convictions for kidnapping and sexual battery were proper where his argument that counsel was ineffective because the jury was improperly instructed on the issue of whether or not the sexual act was consensual was without merit because a prerequisite to finding defendant guilty of sexual battery was to determine that the sexual act between him and the victim was without the victim’s consent. As the jury determined that defendant was indeed guilty of sexual battery, inherently the jury had to determine that the sexual act took place without the victim’s consent. Winding v.

   Mistrial was not required in capital murder case after victim’s grandmother “became emotional” when asked to look at pictures identifying victim during guilt phase; defendant had not made contemporary objection, thus precluding court from giving curative instruction which jury would have presumably followed, and as incident occurred after defendant had been officially found guilty he could not be heard to complain about an emotional state which he had brought on through his own actions.

Also, the record showed that petitioner’s waiver was knowingly and intelligently made because she was advised as to the sentencing options available to a jury, or a judge sitting without a jury, after her capital murder conviction, and she signed a waiver stating that she understood that she could be sentenced in the discretion of the trial judge to death, life imprisonment without eligibility for parole, or life imprisonment as provided in §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.99.html#t99c19s99-19-101ol11" target="_blank">99-19-101(1)</a></cite>.

   Mississippi’s capital sentencing scheme complies with the Sixth Amendment requirement that other than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt, because under Miss.

      </p>
      <p>
       Imposition by trial court of heavier sentence than that which was offered in plea bargaining process is not abuse of discretion and violates no right of defendant where lenient sentence is proposed in pre-trial plea bargain negotiations, where after rejecting same defendant is found guilty by jury, where before imposition of sentence trial judge is presented with evidence of aggravating circumstances relevant to sentencing not known to him at time of original plea bargain negotiations, where in fact trial judge imposes heavier sentence than was proposed at time of plea bargain and in fact bases imposition of heavier sentence upon information of aggravating circumstances of which he has been newly made aware, and where heavier sentence has not been imposed upon accused in whole or in part as penalty for his exercise of his constitutional right to trial by jury.

       Sentence of life imprisonment for crime of capital rape was appropriate for defendant convicted of raping 6-year-old child, despite fact that defendant had been offered 5-year sentence during plea negotiations prior to trial; court was not involved in plea negotiations, did not impose heavier sentence merely because defendant exercised his constitutional right to jury trial, and merely followed statutory sentencing dictates.

      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant’s right to a speedy trial was not violated because although defendant eventually asserted his right to a speedy trial, he continued to take steps that were inconsistent with his claim that he was ready for trial; defendant waited almost eight months to assert his right, and after asserting his right to a speedy trial, defendant effectively undermined his request by seeking the recusal of the trial judge and filing numerous pretrial motions.

      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant’s right to a speedy trial was not violated, as approximately 197 days elapsed between defendant’s arrest and trial, a number well below the statutory limit of 270 days, and the greatest part of the “delay” between the commission of the felony and trial was directly and solely the consequence of defendant’s flight; therefore, defendant’s counsel was not ineffective for failing to file a motion to dismiss on speedy trial grounds.

       Defendant’s speedy trial claim failed; though 410 days elapsed before he was again brought to trial after the conviction was reversed, most of the delay was chargeable to him, since he had obtained three continuances, and he failed to show prejudice from the delay chargeable to the State.

       The Sixth Amendment speedy trial right applies only to time periods when a person is either under indictment or under arrest; therefore, such right did not apply to a more than 20 year period from the entry of a nolle prosequi on an indictment for murder until the subsequent reindictment of the defendant.

Additionally, the defendant’s constitutional right to a speedy trial was not violated, even though 456 days elapsed between the time the defendant was arrested and the first day of his trial, where a significant part of the delay was attributable to the defendant, the balance of the delay was attributable to mere negligence and court congestion, and the defendant failed to assert his right to a speedy trial until the day the trial was scheduled.

Additionally, the defendant’s constitutional right to a speedy trial was not violated where the defendant moved for 2 continuances during the period between the indictment and the trial which resulted in 181 days of time lost, much of the remaining delay could be attributed to 5 changes in the defendant’s attorney, the delay was for good cause to allow his counsel sufficient time to prepare for trial, there were no deliberate attempts by the State to cause a delay to hamper the defendant’s ability to prepare a defense, and there was no showing of prejudice to the defendant.

   For constitutional purposes, the right to a speedy trial attaches and time begins to run with arrest.

Any delays in prosecution attributable to a defendant under either the constitutional or statutory scheme tolls the running of time. Any continuances for “good cause” will toll the running of time unless “the record is silent regarding the reason for delay,” in which case “the clock ticks against the State because the State bears the risk of non-persuasion on the good cause issue.” The statutory 270-day rule is satisfied once the defendant is brought to trial, even if that trial results in a mistrial.

       Section 99-17-1 requires only that indictments be tried within 270 days of arraignment, and, where the first trial results in a mistrial, the statute is not applicable to require that the retrial take place within 270 days of the first trial.

       The time period over which the defendant’s Sixth Amendment protection extended was the period from his second mistrial in 1964 through the entry of the nolle prosequi in 1969, a period of almost five years, rather than from his second mistrial in 1964 through his reindictment in 1990, a period of over 26 years.

      <p>
       An unserved arrest warrant, issued because a statutorily empowered magistrate determines that probable cause for the arrest exists, does not formally initiate criminal proceedings or create other effects on a person’s liberty interests; therefore, the period of delay in a defendant’s trial is not measured from the issuance of an arrest warrant.

       A 28-day delay in taking a defendant before a magistrate for a preliminary hearing did not deprive him of his right to a speedy trial under § 26 of the Mississippi Constitution or the Sixth Amendment of the Federal Constitution, and such a delay without prejudice is not sufficient to require a reversal of his conviction.

   Defendant’s right to a speedy trial under the Sixth Amendment and Miss. Const.

      <p>
       In a statutory rape case, defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial was not violated under the totality of the circumstances after four factors were analyzed, despite the fact that the length of the delay and the reason for the delay weighed in favor of defendant; the assertion of the right and the prejudice factors weighed in favor of the State. Price v. State, 898 So. 2d 641, 2005 Miss. LEXIS 127 (Miss. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant was not deprived of his constitutional right to a speedy trial as (1) although the delay was presumptively prejudicial, (2) the 182 days granted for continuances were for good cause including the judge’s illness and plea negotiations, (3) defendant never asserted a right to a speedy trial by filing a motion, and (4) there were no assertions of prejudice. Mayo v. State, 886 So. 2d 734, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 430 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 887 So. 2d 183, 2004 Miss. LEXIS 1383 (Miss. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant failed to establish that the constitutional right to a speedy trial was violated, as though the length of time was presumptively prejudicial, most of the delays were attributed to defendant or his counsel, defendant failed to show that he had failed to demand his right to a speedy trial until shortly before the trial began, and he was not prejudiced by the delay as emotional stress caused by the delay did not constitute prejudice. Wesley v. State, 872 So. 2d 763, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 433 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).

       Under balancing test to determine whether defendant’s constitutional right to speedy trial has been violated, no one factor alone is dispositive, and the factors must be considered individually, assessed both objectively and dispassionately, then weighed and balanced together.

      </p>
      <p>
       Under case law, four factors must be considered before one can determine if right to speedy trial has been denied: length of delay; reason for delay; defendant’s assertion of his right to speedy trial; and prejudice resulting to defendant.

       Factors to be examined in determining whether constitutional right to speedy trial has been violated include length of delay, reason for delay, assertion of right to speedy trial, and prejudice to defendant from the delay; no single factor is dispositive.

       <p>
   Analysis of whether defendant was deprived of right to speedy trial must turn on facts of particular case, quality of evidence available on each factor, and, in absence of evidence, identification of party with risk of non-persuasion; no sole factor is dispositive. Taylor v. State, 672 So. 2d 1246, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 193 (Miss.), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">519 U.S. 994</cite>, <cite class="s_court">117 S. Ct. 486</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">136 L.

      <p>
       Once constitutional right to speedy trial has attached, the Supreme Court, in determining whether right has been denied, must examine length of delay, reason for delay, defendant’s assertion of right to speedy trial, and prejudice resulting to defendant from delay, in light of all circumstances, including conduct of prosecution and accused. Atterberry v. State, 667 So. 2d 622, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 630 (Miss. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       Court must balance four factors in determining whether defendant’s claim of constitutional speedy trial violation is justified: length of delay, reason for delay; whether defendant has timely asserted right to speedy trial and whether defendant has been prejudiced by delay. Johnson v. State, 666 So. 2d 784, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 616 (Miss. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       In determining whether defendant’s claim of constitutional speedy trial violation is justified, no single factor is dispositive, but court must consider totality of circumstances, including any additional relevant circumstances beyond 4 enumerated factors, in making that determination. Johnson v. State, 666 So. 2d 784, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 616 (Miss. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       For purpose of constitutional speedy trial analysis, as period of delay between defendant’s arrest and trial increases, importance of delay factor also increases. Johnson v. State, 666 So. 2d 784, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 616 (Miss. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       For purpose of constitutional speedy trial analysis, where delay between arrest and trial is not long enough to be considered presumptively prejudicial, court does not need to examine remaining factors used to determine whether constitutional speedy trial violation has occurred. Johnson v. State, 666 So. 2d 784, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 616 (Miss. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       Balance is struck in favor of rejecting defendant’s speedy trial claim if delay is neither intentional nor egregiously protracted, and where there is complete absence of actual prejudice. Johnson v. State, 666 So. 2d 784, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 616 (Miss. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       The balancing test used in criminal proceedings for determining whether the right to a speedy trial has been violated is not applicable in an attorney disciplinary action; although attorney disciplinary proceedings are quasi-criminal in nature, they are not governed by the same rules that are utilized in criminal proceedings. Barrett v. The Mississippi Bar, 648 So. 2d 1154, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 27 (Miss. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a constitutional speedy trial analysis, prejudice to the defendant may take several forms: (1) delay may prejudice the outcome of the defendant’s case; (2) prejudice may take the form of harm to the defendant’s personal interests, such as the debilitating effect of delay on the defendant’s financial, societal, and emotional circumstances; and (3) lengthy pretrial incarceration may be unnecessarily oppressive and may pose societal disadvantages, though a defendant’s assertion of prejudice attributable solely to incarceration, with no other harm, typically is not sufficient to warrant reversal. Ross v. State, 605 So. 2d 17, 1992 Miss. LEXIS 419 (Miss. 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       When the constitutional right to a speedy trial attaches, the court, in order to determine whether the defendant’s right has been denied, will examine 4 factors: (1) length of delay, (2) reason for the delay, (3) the defendant’s assertion of his right to a speedy trial, and (4) prejudice resulting to defendant because of the delay. All 4 factors must be considered together, and no individual factor may completely dispose of the issue. Lightsey v. State, 493 So. 2d 375, 1986 Miss. LEXIS 2583 (Miss. 1986).

       Trial court did not err in denying petitioner’s motion for post-conviction relief where he failed to prove his assertions that he was denied his right to a speedy trial and that he received ineffective assistance from counsel; there was no evidence in the record of the starting date of petitioner’s incarceration, but the record showed that 89 days elapsed between indictment and trial which the appellate court found was quite reasonable.

       Defendant’s constitutional right to a speedy trial was not violated because, although the delay of approximately five years and two months was presumptively prejudicial, the vast majority of the delay was attributable to continuances generated by the defense; of the approximately five-year delay between defendant’s arrest and his trial, 339 days were attributable to the State, and 1,548 days were attributable to defendant; and defendant was not prejudiced by the delay as any anxiety or stress that defendant experienced due to the delay was outweighed by the fact that his defense was assisted, not hindered, by the delay.

      <p>
       While the 1,099 days between defendant’s indictment and trial was presumptively prejudicial, defendant’s right to a speedy trial was not violated, as most of the delay resulted from the substantial amount of time it took to schedule and prepare a mental evaluation for the defense and defendant was not prejudiced by the delay.

Further, the delay could be attributed to continuances requested upon the motion of defendant’s attorneys, substitution of counsel, plea negotiations, ongoing discovery, and potentially the trial date being lost due to a crowded docket, and applying the balancing test to the four factors listed in Barker, and the conduct of the State and defendant, defendant’s constitutional right to a speedy trial was not denied.

      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant was arrested on July 5, 2000, indicted one year later, and his trial commenced on April 2, 2002; because defendant was released on bond shortly after his indictment there was no oppressive pretrial detention after he was indicted. Further, at least part of the delay to trial, following his indictment, was attributable to the two continuances granted at defendant’s request; thus, there was no merit to defendant’s denial of a speedy trial claim as to the period of time following his indictment. Young v. State, 891 So. 2d 813, 2005 Miss. LEXIS 40 (Miss. 2005).

   Although the time between defendant’s arrest and his trial for attempted kidnapping was substantial, a portion of the delay was excluded from the “270 day rule” provided in Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.99.html#t99c17s99-17-1" target="_blank">99-17-1</a></cite> as being attributable to defendant and he failed to show how his case was prejudiced by the delay in that he did not show that his pretrial incarceration was oppressive, that he suffered anxiety, or that his defense was impaired. Therefore defendant’s right to a speedy trial guaranteed by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Miss. Const. art. 3, § 26 was not violated. Hersick v.

       Defendant was released on bond shortly after his indictment; there was no oppressive pretrial detention after he was indicted; additionally, at least part of the delay prior to trial, following defendant’s indictment, was attributable to the two continuances granted at defendant’s request.

       Defendant was not deprived of her right to a speedy trial where she was brought to trial 19 months after she was arrested as most of the delay created in the case going to trial was of defendant’s own volition, she did not assert her right to speedy trial until three weeks before the trial, and under the totality of the circumstances she was not denied her right to a speedy trial.

       Where the delay in the case totaled more than 25 months, but 23 months of the delay was caused by the defendant leaving the state before he could be arrested and his subsequent incarceration in another state on an unrelated matter, the defendant was not denied his right to a speedy trial.

       Delay in bringing defendant to trial in capital murder prosecution weighed heavily against defendant in constitutional speedy trial analysis where most delay was due to defendant and where State made no deliberate attempts that could be considered as oppressive conduct to harm defense.

       Defendant’s constitutional right to speedy trial was not violated, although 21-month delay between arrest and trial was presumptively prejudicial, where significant portion of delay was due to defendant’s request for psychological evaluation, defendant did not bring motion to dismiss on speedy trial grounds for over a year, and defendant did not demonstrate any prejudice.

       A defendant’s constitutional right to a speedy trial was not violated, even though the length of the delay was 636 days, where the bulk of the delay was caused by the defendant’s frequent changes of counsel and his reneging on a plea agreement, the multitude of pretrial motions filed on the defendant’s behalf further contributed to the delay, the defendant made no assertion of his right other than a motion to dismiss the charges after the fact, and the defendant could not show tangible prejudice but relied only on the anxiety caused by incarceration and pending charges.

       Aggravated assault conviction and sentence were affirmed where counsel was not ineffective because the defendant provided no evidence that proved he suffered harm as a result of his attorney not objecting to the State’s leading questions or that had his attorney objected to the State’s leading questions the outcome would have been different and trial counsel’s failure to object to leading questions by the State could have been a trial strategy.

       Although the cause for the delay in going to trial was well beyond the presumptively prejudicial eight-month period, the cause for delay after the arrest and prior to the indictment was with the investigating agencies, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the majority of delay thereafter was caused by the multiplicity of motions filed by each of the defendants; thus, the State’s contributions to the delay were legitimate and there was no violation of the constitutional right to a speedy trial.

       A defendant was denied his constitutional right to a speedy trial where 2 1/2 years elapsed between the time of the defendant’s arrest and his trial, the defendant caused 11 months of the delay while the State caused one year and 9 months of the delay without good cause, the defendant asserted his right to a speedy trial one year prior to his trial, and the defendant was prejudiced as a result of the delay in bringing him to trial as the only witness alleged to have connected the defendant to the crime died before the defendant was brought to trial and another witness admitted that her memory was not as good at the time of trial as it had been previously.

       A defendant’s constitutional and statutory rights to a speedy trial were not violated, even though the delay between the defendant’s arrest and trial was 378 days and the delay between arraignment and trial was 370 days, where only one of the delays–a continuance requested by the State solely for its prosecutorial tactical advantage–was attributable to the State, and, after calculating the delays caused by the defendant, he came to trial 164 days after his arrest and 156 days after his waiver of arraignment.

       Defendant was arrested on July 5, 2000, indicted one year later, and his trial commenced on April 2, 2002. For purposes of the pre-indictment delay of 366 days, there was nothing in the record or in defendant’s brief to indicate (1) that defendant made any effort to request an attorney, seek bail, or demand a speedy trial prior to June 2001; (2) that the State delayed bringing defendant to trial for any prejudicial or improper reason; or (3) any prejudice to defendant by the delay; thus, defendant’s right to a speedy trial was not violated by the pre-indictment delay.

       A defendant’s right to a speedy trial was not violated, even though the defendant was tried for capital murder more than 270 days after his original arraignment on an indictment for murder less than capital, where the defendant was reindicted for capital murder and was tried well within the 270-day rule from the time of the arraignment on the capital murder charge.

       A simple delay between the date of an offense and the date of the indictment is not per se reversible error, particularly when the reason for the delay is for the purpose of concealing the identity of an undercover agent for a reasonable period of time so that he or she may continue to work effectively as an agent. Thus, a defendant was not denied his right to a speedy trial where a 10-month delay from the time of the criminal act to the charge and arrest was caused by the State’s pursuance of a continuing undercover operation.

       A defendant’s constitutional right to a speedy trial was not violated where the defendant was tried 230 days after his arrest, the delay was due to the State’s reasonable and legitimate motion for a continuance predicated on the unavailability of a material witness, the defendant’s assertion of his right to a speedy trial was made 173 days prior to trial in conjunction with his objection to the State’s request for a continuance, and there was no actual prejudice to the defendant in his defense.

       In determining whether a defendant has been denied his or her right to a speedy trial, a continuance granted to the defendant is counted differently from a continuance granted to the State. Any delay as a result of action by the State without “good cause” causes the time to be counted against the State. A delay caused by the actions of the defendant, such as a continuance, tolls the running of the time period for that length of time, and this time is subtracted from the total amount of the delay.

Roach v. State, 938 So. 2d 863, 2006 Miss. App. LEXIS 102 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 937 So. 2d 450, 2006 Miss. LEXIS 600 (Miss. 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       Most significant factor was that defendant failed to demonstrate how his incarceration and the 31-month delay between his arrest and trial caused him any actual prejudice. Thus, per the Barker factors, the appellate court found that there was no violation of defendant’s constitutional right to a speedy trial; secondly, defendant waived his right to complain about the denial of his statutory right to a speedy trial since he did not assert that right until well after the statutory deadline had passed, and because his assertions as to a denial of his speedy trial rights would not have resulted in a different outcome to the case, counsel was not ineffective in failing to raise said issues. Guice v. State, 952 So. 2d 187, 2006 Miss. App. LEXIS 72 (Miss. Ct. App. 2006), aff'd, 952 So. 2d 129, 2007 Miss. LEXIS 9 (Miss. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       Time elapsing from the date of defendant’s arrest to the beginning day of his trial was more than 31 months, and was presumptively prejudicial under the Barker factor. However, he had not asserted his right to a speedy trial and on appeal, he did not assert that his defense suffered any prejudice because of his lengthy incarceration; he did not contend that witnesses were unavailable because of the delay or that evidence had been lost or destroyed or that his defense against the charges was affected in any way by the delay, and because no actual prejudice was shown, his constitutional right to a speedy trial was not violated. Guice v. State, 952 So. 2d 187, 2006 Miss. App. LEXIS 72 (Miss. Ct. App. 2006), aff'd, 952 So. 2d 129, 2007 Miss. LEXIS 9 (Miss. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court carefully and patiently examined the testimony and other evidence and provided defendant with ample opportunity to provide evidence that the delay was not attributable to him or good cause; defendant failed to suggest any evidence, potential witness, or case theory which escaped his reach because of the delay, and there was no basis to hold that the delay in the proceedings impaired defendant’s defense of the case. Stark v. State, 911 So. 2d 447, 2005 Miss. LEXIS 458 (Miss. 2005).

   District court’s ruling that the government could not seek the death penalty against a defendant charged with carjacking resulting in death in violation of 18 U.S.C.S. § 2119(3) was vacated where the 16-month delay between the indictment and the government’s notice of appeal was not long enough to weigh heavily in favor of presuming prejudice to the defendant, the government’s use of two continuances within one year of the indictment to further investigate was permissible, there was no evidence to support the finding that the defendant had refrained from appealing a magistrate’s rulings based on the government’s death penalty representations, and the defendant had not diligently asserted his speedy trial right and failed to show that he was actually prejudiced by any delay. United States v. Frye, 372 F.3d 729, 2004 U.S. App. LEXIS 11029 (5th Cir. Miss. 2004), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">543 U.S. 1155</cite>, <cite class="s_court">125 S.

      <p>
       No violation of defendant’s constitutional right to a speedy trial occurred where there was no evidence in the record to suggest that defendant had attempted to obtain a ruling on a motion asserting his right to a speedy trial; there was no prejudice to defendant’s defense based on the testimony of the defense witnesses, who were clear in their recollection of what transpired on the night of the crime.

      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant’s conviction for aggravated assault was proper where his right to a speedy trial was not violated because the claim was not preserved for appellate review; moreover, the evidence defendant complained he was unable to present was cumulative to evidence he did not present; the court could discern no prejudice under those circumstances and there could be no violation of the right to a speedy trial in the absence of prejudice. Woodson v. State, 845 So. 2d 740, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 425 (Miss. Ct. App. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       One defendant alleged that the delay in going to trial could diminish the ability of defense witnesses to recall pertinent dates and times that could weaken a possible alibi defense, while the other defendant alleged that the defendant experienced anxiety, depression, mental anguish, and psychological and mental distress due to the delay and also that defendant was unable to remember certain facts and locate alibi witnesses; however, defendants wholly failed in their efforts to demonstrate any actual prejudice and there was no violation of the constitutional right to a speedy trial. Collins v. State, 817 So. 2d 644, 2002 Miss. App. LEXIS 313 (Miss. Ct. App. 2002).
      </p>
      <p>
       The defendant was not denied his constitutional right to a speedy trial, notwithstanding a delay of almost two years and 11 months between arrest and trial, and that the state offered no explanation for the delay, because the defendant failed to assert his right to a speedy trial and failed to demonstrate any actual prejudice, or the probability, as opposed to possibility, of actual prejudice. Smith v. State, 812 So. 2d 1045, 2001 Miss. App. LEXIS 115 (Miss. Ct. App. 2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       An almost five year delay between the defendant’s second mistrial in 1964 and the entry of a nolle prosequi in 1969 did not violate the defendant’s speedy trial rights as the defendant was not retried after his second mistrial and, therefore, there was no prejudice. Beckwith v. Anderson, 89 F. Supp. 2d 788, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7033 (S.D. Miss. 2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       The complete absence of any evidence of actual prejudice to the defendant arising out of a 14 month delay in bringing the defendant to trial outweighed any other considerations that weighed against the state and, therefore, the trial court did not err when it denied the defendant’s motion to dismiss the indictment based on a perceived violation of his right to a speedy trial under the Sixth Amendment. Genry v. State, 767 So. 2d 302, 2000 Miss. App. LEXIS 426 (Miss. Ct. App. 2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       A five year delay between a mistrial in a murder prosecution and the entry of a nolle prosequi did not violate the defendant’s constitutional right to a speedy trial because the defendant was not retried after the mistrial and, therefore, suffered no prejudice. Beckwith v. Anderson, 89 F. Supp. 2d 788, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2238 (S.D. Miss. 2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       The defendant’s constitutional right to speedy trial was not violated, notwithstanding that 11 months elapsed from the time of his arrest to his trial and that the state did not show good cause for the delay, where (1) although the defendant was imprisoned for a period of time before trial, most, if not all, of his period of imprisonment stemmed from his parole revocation and conviction on subsequent criminal charges, and (2) he did not assert his right to a speedy trial until nine months after his arrest. Jones v. State, 756 So. 2d 852, 2000 Miss. App. LEXIS 76 (Miss. Ct. App. 2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       There was no violation of the defendant’s constitutional right to a speedy trial, notwithstanding a delay of approximately 400 days from the date of his arrest or indictment to the date of his trial, where the defendant did not seek a dismissal until 20 days prior to going to trial and there was no demonstration of actual memory loss by witnesses which might have caused prejudice. Riggs v. State, 744 So. 2d 365, 1999 Miss. App. LEXIS 346 (Miss. Ct. App. 1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       The defendant’s right to a speedy trial was not violated where (1) when tolling the clock for several continuances, defense attorney substitutions, psychiatric evaluation, and the defendant’s skipping bond, only 265 days, at most, could be charged against the state, (2) although the defendant was incarcerated for a substantial period of the delay, his incarceration was caused by his skipping bond and unrelated offenses, and (3) there was no impairment of the defense. Elder v. State, 750 So. 2d 540, 1999 Miss. App. LEXIS 340 (Miss. Ct. App. 1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       The defendant failed to establish prejudice arising from the delay of his trial, notwithstanding his contentions that (1) he was unable to adequately prepare his case, and (2) since the state did not simultaneously prosecute him on his four outstanding indictments he could not take the witness stand in his defense without the trial jury becoming aware of his previous convictions for similar crimes. Robinson v. State, 1999 Miss. App. LEXIS 320 (Miss. Ct. App. June 8, 1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       The defendant was not prejudiced by the fact that she suffered a ruptured brain aneurysm during the delay between her arraignment and trial, notwithstanding that she may have suffered loss of memory because of her condition, as the ruptured aneurysm was in no way caused or exacerbated by the state. Swindle v. State, 755 So. 2d 1158, 1999 Miss. App. LEXIS 318 (Miss. Ct. App. 1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       The absence of a witness did not constitute prejudice where the defendant never proffered anything at trial describing the potential testimony of the witness, other than saying that the defense anticipated him to testify that if the defendant hadn’t shot the victim, the victim “would have killed us all,” and such statement was cumulative to testimony received from another witness. Swindle v. State, 755 So. 2d 1158, 1999 Miss. App. LEXIS 318 (Miss. Ct. App. 1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       The defendant was not prejudiced by a delay in his sentencing, which was deferred to give him an opportunity to make restitution, notwithstanding the contention that had sentence been imposed, he would have not committed a subsequent offense for which he was indicted as an habitual criminal. Massengill v. State, 755 So. 2d 492, 1999 Miss. App. LEXIS 297 (Miss. Ct. App. 1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       The defendant was not entitled to reversal of his conviction for murder on the basis of a violation of his right to a speedy trial where (1) the delay was for good cause, as it was requested by the state so that it could locate a material witness, (2) the defendant waited until the Friday before the trial was set to start on a Monday morning and then filed his motion for a speedy trial, and (3) the defendant suffered no prejudice other than continued incarceration during the time while waiting to be brought to trial. Holiday v. State, 1999 Miss. App. LEXIS 15 (Miss. Ct. App. Jan. 26, 1999), op. withdrawn, sub. op., 739 So. 2d 394, 1999 Miss. App. LEXIS 176 (Miss. Ct. App. 1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       The defendant was not entitled to dismissal for violation of his right to a speedy trial where (1) 296 days of the 640 days between arrest and trial were due to actions of the defendant and 209 days were due to docket congestion, (2) the defendant did not raise the issue of his right to a speedy trial until 458 days after his arrest, and (3) the defendant failed to show any prejudice other than the length of his pretrial incarceration. Bingham v. State, 755 So. 2d 426, 1999 Miss. App. LEXIS 7 (Miss. Ct. App. 1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       The defendant failed to show that he was prejudiced by a 38 month delay, notwithstanding his assertion that he had grown significantly during that time and that his defense of duress was harmed by his change in appearance, as he was no longer smaller than his codefendant; the fact that his appearance changed and that he looked less sympathetic was one of the inexorable realities of the end of adolescence, and pictures and verbal descriptions used at his trial established his earlier appearance. Biggs v. State, 741 So. 2d 318, 1999 Miss. App. LEXIS 238 (Miss. Ct. App. 1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       The defendant failed to show prejudice caused by a 12 month delay where the record was devoid of any testimony from the defendant himself reflecting anxiety and concern, and there was no evidence that his defense was impaired. Arthur v. State, 735 So. 2d 213, 1999 Miss. LEXIS 124 (Miss. 1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       The delay in the defendant’s trial was not presumptively prejudicial where (1) at the time the first capias was executed, the defendant was incarcerated elsewhere pending prosecution for murder, and (2) after the defendant entered a plea agreement in that matter, he was expeditiously arraigned on the crime at issue and trial occurred within eight months of such arraignment. Davis v. State, 750 So. 2d 552, 1999 Miss. App. LEXIS 600 (Miss. Ct. App. 1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       The defendant was not entitled to the reversal of his conviction, notwithstanding a 501 day delay from his arrest to his trial since the only prejudice asserted was that the memory of the arresting officers had diminished but the record did not support such assertion where the primary arresting officer and the remaining officers testified regarding many details of the events surrounding the issuance of the search warrant and the subsequent search. Bryant v. State, 746 So. 2d 853, 1998 Miss. App. LEXIS 1027 (Miss. Ct. App. 1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       The trial court did not improperly dismiss the speedy trial claim where the reasons for the delay were valid, the assertion of the right only occurred near the time of the trial, and there was no showing of actual prejudice. Hogan v. State, 730 So. 2d 94, 1998 Miss. App. LEXIS 1078 (Miss. Ct. App. 1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Five-year period between mistrial on defendant’s murder charge and entry of nolle prosequi of indictment, which was followed more than twenty years later by reindictment and conviction, did not violate defendant’s right to speedy trial, though length of such period was presumptively prejudicial to defendant; defendant never asserted his speedy trial rights, defendant acquiesced in delay caused by state agency’s assistance to his defense without prosecution’s knowledge, and defense was not prejudiced, as all material evidence from prior proceedings was preserved. De La Beckwith v. State, 707 So. 2d 547, 1997 Miss. LEXIS 749 (Miss. 1997), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">525 U.S. 880</cite>, <cite class="s_court">119 S.

      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant’s right to speedy trial was not violated by 554-day delay between arrest and trial, even though delay was due to crowded docket and weighed against state, where defendant suffered no prejudice as a result of the delay and defendant was out on bond pending trial. Skaggs v. State, 676 So. 2d 897, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 317 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Delay may prejudice defendant, for speedy trial purposes, in two ways; delay may actually impair defendant’s ability to defend himself, and defendant may suffer because of restraints to his liberty. Skaggs v. State, 676 So. 2d 897, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 317 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Incarceration before trial is not alone enough prejudice to warrant reversal of conviction on ground that defendant was denied speedy trial. Taylor v. State, 672 So. 2d 1246, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 193 (Miss.), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">519 U.S. 994</cite>, <cite class="s_court">117 S. Ct. 486</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">136 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 379, 1996 U.S. LEXIS 7020 (U.S. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   In speedy trial analysis, defendant was not prejudiced by his inability to talk with potential alibi witnesses, due to his incarceration prior to trial; record mentioned names of no potential alibi witnesses who had suffered memory loss or who could not be found, and defense counsel could have traced leads at defendant’s direction. Taylor v. State, 672 So. 2d 1246, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 193 (Miss.), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">519 U.S. 994</cite>, <cite class="s_court">117 S. Ct. 486</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">136 L.

      </p>
      <p>
       For speedy trial analysis, prejudice to accused encompasses both actual prejudice in defending case and prejudice from inordinate delay. Atterberry v. State, 667 So. 2d 622, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 630 (Miss. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       Accused may suffer prejudice due to delay, a factor in speedy trial analysis, in form of oppressive pretrial incarceration, anxiety and concern, and impairment of defenses. Atterberry v. State, 667 So. 2d 622, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 630 (Miss. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       Without evidence of absent witness’ departure date or expected testimony, accused could not show prejudice from delay in commencement of trial, a factor in speedy trial analysis; moreover, even if accused could have shown prejudice due to absent witness, he would have been barred from doing so, as he raised prejudice from absent witness for first time on appeal. Atterberry v. State, 667 So. 2d 622, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 630 (Miss. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       In determining whether violation of defendant’s constitutional right to speedy trial has occurred, defendant may be prejudiced by fact that he has been detained before trial, that he has suffered anxiety as result of delay, or that his defense has been impaired by delay. Johnson v. State, 666 So. 2d 784, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 616 (Miss. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       In determining whether violation of defendant’s constitutional right to speedy trial has occurred, defendant suffers no prejudice from detention when he is out on bail. Johnson v. State, 666 So. 2d 784, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 616 (Miss. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       In determining whether violation of defendant’s constitutional right to speedy trial has occurred, where incarceration is only ground raised by defendant as basis for prejudice, reversal generally will not be required. Johnson v. State, 666 So. 2d 784, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 616 (Miss. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       In determining whether defendant has been prejudiced by delay between arrest and trial such that violation of his constitutional right to speedy trial is implicated, impairment of defendant’s defense may occur as result of witnesses dying or disappearing or of loss of memory on part of witnesses. Johnson v. State, 666 So. 2d 784, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 616 (Miss. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       In determining whether defendant has been prejudiced by delay between arrest and trial such that violation of his constitutional right to speedy trial is implicated, anxiety on part of defendant is presumed from mere fact of delay even where defendant does not complain that he has suffered anxiety. Johnson v. State, 666 So. 2d 784, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 616 (Miss. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       An aggravated assault defendant was not denied his constitutional right to a speedy trial, even though there was a delay of more than 25 months between the date of his arrest and his trial and the State blamed part of the delay on an overcrowded docket which weighed against the State, where the defendant requested a continuance of an earlier trial date, the victim had to undergo several surgical treatments and it was several months before he was physically able to proceed with the case, the defendant did not raise the speedy trial issue until more than one and 1/2 years after his arrest, and the defendant failed to show any material prejudice as a result of the delay. Stogner v. State, 627 So. 2d 815, 1993 Miss. LEXIS 531 (Miss. 1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       A defendant was not denied his statutory or constitutional rights to a speedy trial, even though he was arrested on February 13, 1989, arraigned May 5, 1989, and his trial began March 5, 1990, where the defendant filed 15 motions before he was brought to trial which substantially contributed to the delay, the record supported the State’s position that it could not try the case until the issues of change of venue and admissibility of forensic DNA analysis had been resolved, and the defendant did not contend that the delay either diminished his defense or strengthened the State’s evidence, but stated only that he suffered “a great deal of anxiety.” Polk v. State, 612 So. 2d 381, 1992 Miss. LEXIS 820 (Miss. 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendants did not suffer a deprivation of the right to a speedy trial, even though there was a 414-day delay between the date the defendants were arrested and the date of their trial, where a substantial part of the reason for the delay was that the defendants took no steps to secure counsel, and the delay did not operate to their substantial prejudice since there was no evidence of prejudice at trial and the defendants’ arrest resulted in their parole revocation and immediate incarceration to complete prior sentences, so that the defendants’ lives were not “put on hold” solely as a result of the delay. Jaco v. State, 574 So. 2d 625, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 823 (Miss. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant was not denied her constitutional right to speedy trial, although delay was lengthy, where there were numerous reasons for delay, including defendant’s efforts to fight extradition and congested court dockets; further, defendant did not assert right to speedy trial until little over one month before trial and had failed to show any prejudice other than her continuous incarceration. Williamson v. State, 512 So. 2d 868, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2683 (Miss. 1987), Walton v. State, 678 So. 2d 645, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 192 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant was not denied constitutional right to speedy trial despite asserting that right, when he was tried approximately 33 months after his indictment, where defendant was incarcerated in New York state prison which would not let defendant be moved to Mississippi for trial, and district attorney fulfilled his duty to make diligent, good-faith effort to have defendant returned to Mississippi for trial; defendant also made no allegation in either trial court or on appeal that he lost witnesses or was otherwise prejudiced in trial of his case. Hughey v. State, 512 So. 2d 4, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2752 (Miss. 1987).

      <p>
       Delay of 15 months before defendant’s trial was presumptively prejudicial and the State did not offer a valid explanation for the delay; however, defendant’s right to a speedy trial was not denied because, while there was some delay, it was offset by (1) defendant’s failure to assert his right to a speedy trial; and (2) his failure to demonstrate any actual prejudice that witnesses were unavailable to testify as a result of the delay. Jackson v. State, 910 So. 2d 658, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 170 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 904 So. 2d 184, 2005 Miss. LEXIS 402 (Miss. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       From the date of arrest to the date of defendant’s trial, approximately 22 months elapsed, and that presumptive prejudice required the appellate court to consider other Barker factors relating to defendant’s right to a speedy trial. Other reasons for the delay were: (1) plea negotiations; (2) change of counsel; (3) the fact the State had to await results from the crime lab after plea negotiations failed; and (4) a preferred trial setting in another case. However, when considered as a whole, the reasons for delay favored neither party, defendant was not prejudiced by his pre-trial incarceration, his alleged demands for speedy trial had generally been in the form of motions to dismiss, and his rights under the Sixth Amendment and Miss. Const. art. III, § 26 were not violated. Grant v. State, 913 So. 2d 316, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 253 (Miss. Ct. App. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Delay of almost 26 months between indictment and trial warranted presumption of prejudice, thereby triggering inquiry into other constitutional speedy trial factors. (Per Pittman, J., with two Justices concurring, two Justices concurring in the result only, and one Justice concurring in part.) Kolberg v. State, 704 So. 2d 1307, 1997 Miss. LEXIS 697 (Miss. 1997).

       In determining whether constitutional right to speedy trial has been denied, delay is triggering mechanism and must be presumptively prejudicial or analysis is halted. Atterberry v. State, 667 So. 2d 622, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 630 (Miss. 1995).

       Delay of 280 days from time defendant’s constitutional right to speedy trial attached to time trial began was presumptively prejudicial for purposes of speedy trial analysis. Atterberry v. State, 667 So. 2d 622, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 630 (Miss. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although accused was presumptively prejudiced by 280-day delay before trial, he was not denied right to speedy trial, since he failed to ask for speedy trial until trial, he moved for continuance before trial, and he failed to show prejudice from the delay.

       For purpose of constitutional speedy trial analysis, delay which is presumptively prejudicial to defendant will not require reversal in and of itself but will require that remaining factors in determining whether claim of constitutional violation is justified be examined closely.

      </p>
      <p>
       Delay of 409 days between arrest of defendant on charge of capital rape and commencement of trial was presumptively prejudicial, and triggered examination of remaining factors to determine whether violation of defendant’s constitutional right to speedy trial had occurred.

       A 6-month delay between a mistrial and a retrial was not “presumptively prejudicial,” and therefore the defendant’s constitutional right to a speedy trial was not violated by the delay.

   Defendant’s right to a speedy trial under the Sixth Amendment and Miss. Const. Art. 3, § 26 was not violated because despite the anxiety and hardship that defendant could have endured, he waited until two weeks before his initial trial date to assert his right to a speedy trial; although defendant’s motion included a request for a speedy trial, the context and timing of the motion showed that he was actually seeking dismissal, not a trial. Ben v. State, 95 So.3d 1236, 2012 Miss. LEXIS 411 (Miss. 2012), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">569 U.S. 905</cite>, <cite class="s_court">133 S. Ct. 1723</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">185 L.

      </p>
      <p>
       There was no violation of the defendant’s constitutional right to a speedy trial, notwithstanding a delay of approximately 400 days from the date of his arrest or indictment to the date of his trial, where the defendant did not seek a dismissal until 20 days prior to going to trial and there was no demonstration of actual memory loss by witnesses which might have caused prejudice. Riggs v. State, 744 So. 2d 365, 1999 Miss. App. LEXIS 346 (Miss. Ct. App. 1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       The defendant’s right to a speedy trial was not violated, notwithstanding a 474 day delay between his arrest and trial where the reason for the lengthy delay was that the defendant was reindicted, he did not demonstrate any prejudice to himself or his defense by the delay, and he did not assert his right to a speedy trial until two days before trial. Jamison v. State, 741 So. 2d 359, 1999 Miss. App. LEXIS 288 (Miss. Ct. App. 1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       The defendant failed to properly assert his right to a speedy trial where he made no demand for a speedy trial before the selection of the jury. Henderson v. State, 732 So. 2d 211, 1999 Miss. LEXIS 68 (Miss. 1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       The trial court did not improperly dismiss the speedy trial claim where the reasons for the delay were valid, the assertion of the right only occurred near the time of the trial, and there was no showing of actual prejudice. Hogan v. State, 730 So. 2d 94, 1998 Miss. App. LEXIS 1078 (Miss. Ct. App. 1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       The defendant’s right to a speedy trial was not violated where (1) the state offered valid reasons for all of the delays from the defendant’s arrest in October of 1994 until his trial in February of 1997, (2) most of the delays were either for neutral reasons or at the request of the defense, (3) the defendant did not show any actual trial prejudice and relied entirely on the “presumed” prejudice resulting from pre-trial incarceration, and (4) the defendant did not make a demand for a speedy trial until September of 1996 when he filed his motion to dismiss, which motion was made after he agreed to continuances, moved for his own continuance, and moved for a severance from his co-defendant. Horton v. State, 726 So. 2d 238, 1998 Miss. App. LEXIS 1122 (Miss. Ct. App. 1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant’s initial assertion of his right to speedy trial in his motion to dismiss for failure to transcribe some proceedings while defendant was represented by his original trial counsel was not equivalent of demand for speedy trial and, thus, dilatory assertion of right to speedy trial weighed against him in constitutional analysis. (Per Pittman, J., with two Justices concurring, two Justices concurring in the result only, and one Justice concurring in part.) Kolberg v. State, 704 So. 2d 1307, 1997 Miss. LEXIS 697 (Miss. 1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       In speedy trial analysis, defendant’s failure to bring denial of speedy trial issue up until trial, as well as defendant’s motion for continuance, which could be considered as contrary to any concerns about speedy trial, weighed in favor of state. Atterberry v. State, 667 So. 2d 622, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 630 (Miss. 1995).

      </p>
      <p>
       Filing of motion to dismiss for denial of defendant’s right to speedy trial 3 days prior to trial date was not fatal to defendant’s claim, but weighed less heavily than an earlier assertion of his right would have done in analysis of whether his constitutional right to speedy trial was violated.

       Defendant’s embezzlement conviction was proper where his speedy trial rights were not violated because, by falsely agreeing to repay the owner, defendant avoided pursuing an indictment against him, and thus, the delay until August 2001 was a neutral factor Further, defendant did not diligently pursue a speedy trial.

       There was no violation of defendant’s constitutional right to a speedy trial, where defendant never demanded a speedy trial, did not mention the right for almost three years, and when defendant finally did raise the issue, his trial was only four months away. More importantly, defendant failed to articulate any prejudice whatsoever. Collins v. State, 232 So.3d 739, 2017 Miss. App. LEXIS 297 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, — So.3d —, 2017 Miss.

      <p>
       <p>
   Defendant’s claims for speedy trial violations neither established a plain-error basis to justify further appellate review, nor evidenced a miscarriage of justice; regarding delay, the record reflected that defendant assented to the entry of nine separate “Agreed Orders of Continuance” and filed numerous pre-trial motions, and defendant did not suffer prejudice due to a change in a witness’s testimony. Dora v. State, 986 So. 2d 917, 2008 Miss. LEXIS 308 (Miss. 2008), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">555 U.S. 1142</cite>, <cite class="s_court">129 S. Ct. 1009</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">173 L.

       <p>
   Defendant’s right to a speedy trial did not automatically warrant reversal of defendant’s conviction for an alleged violation of the right; rather, a balancing test was conducted, and moreover, defendant’s demand for a dismissal of the charge based on an alleged violation of the right to a speedy trial was not the same as the demand for a speedy trial. Guice v. State, 952 So. 2d 129, 2007 Miss. LEXIS 9 (Miss.), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">552 U.S. 1042</cite>, <cite class="s_court">128 S. Ct. 645</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">169 L.

      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant was not denied his right to a speedy trial where he never asserted the right to a speedy trial, and the record showed that he was trying to avoid a trial, rather than assert his right to a speedy trial. He did not appear at his first scheduled trial and twice fired attorneys shortly before other trial dates were set to occur. Bindon v. State, 926 So. 2d 222, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 701 (Miss. Ct. App. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       There was no violation of defendant’s constitutional right to a speedy trial because defendant was responsible for much of the extraordinary 37-month lapse of time between his arrest and his trial due to his failure to provide necessary documentation to the hospital for a mental examination, his preparation for trial, and the illness of his counsel. Also defendant failed to assert his right to a speedy trial and to show any real prejudice that outweighed any delay resulting from the trial court’s schedule. Jones v. State, 902 So. 2d 593, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 1011 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004), cert. denied, 901 So. 2d 1273, 2005 Miss. LEXIS 336 (Miss. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant failed to raise the issue of denial of a speedy trial in his motion for a new trial; there was no trial court order to review, no findings on the record, no response from the State as to the pre-indictment delay; there was nothing to indicate that the State delayed bringing defendant to trial for any prejudicial or improper reason; and there was nothing in the record to indicate any prejudice to defendant by the delay; thus, there was simply nothing at all for the appellate court to review. Therefore, the pre-indictment speedy trial issue was not properly before the appellate court. Young v. State, 2004 Miss. LEXIS 588 (Miss. May 27, 2004), op. withdrawn, sub. op., 891 So. 2d 813, 2005 Miss. LEXIS 40 (Miss. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       While the length of delay was presumptively prejudicial and the State offered no legitimate reason for the delay, defendant failed to demand a speedy trial and failed to show any resulting prejudice; thus, defendant’s right to a speedy trial was not violated. Green v. State, 856 So. 2d 396, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 233 (Miss. Ct. App. 2003), rev'd, in part, 884 So. 2d 733, 2004 Miss. LEXIS 714 (Miss. 2004).

       The defendant’s constitutional right to speedy trial was not violated, notwithstanding that 11 months elapsed from the time of his arrest to his trial and that the state did not show good cause for the delay, where (1) although the defendant was imprisoned for a period of time before trial, most, if not all, of his period of imprisonment stemmed from his parole revocation and conviction on subsequent criminal charges, and (2) he did not assert his right to a speedy trial until nine months after his arrest.

   The defendant was not denied his constitutional right to a speedy trial, notwithstanding a delay of about 1051 days from his arrest to the commencement of trial, where (1) much of the delay was attributable to the defendant, (2) the delays attributable to the state were necessary for pre-trial business such as the appointment of counsel, a preliminary hearing, the indictment and arraignment, the hearing of several defense motions, the appointment of additional counsel, the granting of a defense expert, the hearing of more motions, a rule on expert fees, and the hearing of a suppression motion, (3) the defendant did not request a speedy trial and only moved for dismissal for the denial of a speedy trial, and (4) there was no prejudice shown by the defendant.

      <p>
       The defendant’s right to a speedy trial was not violated where (1) the case was twice continued, first by agreement of the parties, and, next due to a conflict with other trials, (2) there was no actual prejudice to the defendant other than his continued incarceration, and (3) the defendant did not demand a speedy trial until two months before trial when he made a motion to dismiss for failure to try.

      </p>
      <p>
       The defendant’s right to a speedy trial was not violated where (1) the length of the delay was 390 days, (2) the defendant did not raise the speedy trial issue until his motion to dismiss was made on the day of the trial, and (3) the defense was not prejudiced in any way by the delay, notwithstanding the contention that the victim’s recollection would have been fresher and she would not have “misidentified” the defendant if he had been tried more promptly.

       The defendant was not forced to choose between his constitutional right to confront a witness against him and his constitutional and statutory rights to a speedy trial when he chose to waive his right to confront an absent chain-of-custody witness and where the trial court questioned him about his decision to go to trial instead of waiting until the next term of court when the witness would be available to testify.

      </p>
      <p>
       A 419 day delay between arraignment and trial was not a violation of the defendant’s constitutional right to speedy trial where (1) 199 days were attributable to motions for continuances and substitutions of counsel by the defendant, (2) 97 days were attributable to an overcrowded court docket, (3) the defendant failed to assert his right to speedy trial until the day of trial, and (4) the defendant failed to show prejudice.

      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant failed to establish speedy trial violation in connection with delay of more than 18 months between his arrest and his indictment and trial, particularly as defendant failed to point to any evidence establishing reason for delay or showing how he was prejudiced, and defendant never asserted his right to speedy trial.

       Although defendant is not required to demand speedy trial, his assertion of such right will weigh more heavily in his favor when determining whether his constitutional right to speedy trial has been violated. Johnson v. State, 666 So. 2d 784, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 616 (Miss. 1995).

      <p>
       A defendant was denied his constitutional right to a speedy trial where 610 days elapsed from the date of indictment to the date of trial, even though the defendant failed to assert his right to a speedy trial. Although a defendant may have some responsibility to assert his or her speedy trial claim, the primary burden is on the courts and the prosecutors to assure that cases are brought to trial. Thus, the defendant’s failure to “consistently badger” the prosecution to proceed with his trial did not eliminate his claim that he was denied a speedy trial. Flores v.

       Where a defendant contended that his statutory and constitutional rights to a speedy trial were violated because he was tried more than 600 days after his arrest and arraignment, the State bore the burden of positively demonstrating that the backlog of drug cases in the court system and the state crime lab, which were alleged to be the reasons for the delay, actually caused the delay in that particular case.

       The defendant was not denied his constitutional right to a speedy trial, notwithstanding a two year delay, because (1) the defendant did not raise a speedy trial issue at trial and, therefore, the prosecutor had no reason to present evidence justifying the delay, and (2) there was no undue prejudice, notwithstanding the defendant’s assertion that the victim was more robust and that the defendant was on crutches at the time of the incident at issue, while the victim had diminished in size and the defendant had developed a more muscular build at the time of trial.

       The defendant’s right to a speedy trial was not violated, notwithstanding a delay between arrest and trial of about one and a half years, where no reason was given for the delay, the defendant asserted his right to a speedy trial just prior to trial, and no prejudice was shown.

   The defendant’s constitutional right to a speedy trial was not violated, notwithstanding a 970 day delay from arrest to trial, because (1) the defendant failed to provide any examples of the failure of the state to provide timely discovery material and frequently requested or consented to a number of continuances, (2) the defendant made little attempt to expedite the proceedings against him and, when he finally asserted his right to a speedy trial, it was not done in a timely fashion, and (3) the defendant failed to provide any specific example of how his defense was hampered by delay.

       The defendant was not denied his constitutional right to speedy trial, notwithstanding that the state failed to seek temporary custody of the defendant for trial while he was imprisoned in Florida after the defendant formally demanded that his constitutional right to speedy trial be honored, because the only prejudice he alleged for the delay in being tried in Mississippi was the fact that he was prevented from the possibility of serving his Florida sentence and any possible Mississippi sentence concurrently.

       The defendant’s constitutional right to a speedy trial was not violated, notwithstanding that his trial occurred more than eight months after his arrest, where (1) the main reason for the overall delay in bringing the case to trial was the state’s negligence in preparing the indictment which had to be corrected twice, (2) the defendant never moved for a speedy trial and never requested a trial date and, instead, moved to dismiss on speedy trial grounds approximately one and one-half years after his arrest, and (3) the defendant experienced no prejudice due to the delay.

       The defendant was not denied his constitutional right to a speedy trial, notwithstanding a 20-month period between the defendant’s arrest and his trial, where (1) one of the primary reasons for the delay was the defendant’s and his co-defendants’ motion to sever, (2) the defendant did not assert his right to or demand a speedy trial, although he did move for dismissal for violation of his right to a speedy trial, and (3) the defendant alleged no actual harm to his defense.

       The defendant’s constitutional right to a speedy trial was not violated where his original indictment for robbery with a deadly weapon was dismissed without prejudice because of the state’s violation of his statutory right to speedy trial, and he was subsequently reindicted for the same crime; there was no prejudice to the defendant, notwithstanding his assertion that he could not locate a material witness, as he made little effort to locate this witness after the original indictment and made no effort to locate the witness after the reindictment, and the defendant had to assume responsibility for delays due to requested continuances.

      <p>
       The defendant was not denied his constitutional right to a speedy trial, notwithstanding a delay of 14 months and the prompt assertion of his right to a speedy trial, where (1) the delay was caused by docket congestion, ongoing discovery, and other causes beyond the control of the state, and (2) although the defendant remained incarcerated during the delay, such delay did not prejudice his defense.

      </p>
      <p>
       The defendant’s right to a speedy trial was not violated, notwithstanding a 15 month delay between indictment and trial, where much of the delay was caused by the fact that the defendant had five different attorneys appointed to represent him over that period, the defendant did not assert his right to a speedy trial until 10 days before trial, and the defendant suffered no prejudice. Stokes v. State, 758 So. 2d 452, 2000 Miss. App. LEXIS 132 (Miss. Ct. App. 2000).

      <p>
       There was no violation of the defendant’s constitutional right to a speedy trial, notwithstanding a 471 day delay, where the defendant either joined or initiated continuances for all but 54 days of the delay, and she suffered no prejudice as shown by the fact that she claimed that she needed more time to prepare for trial.

      </p>
      <p>
       The state observed the defendant’s right to a speedy trial where (1) the time period between arrest and trial was about 11 months, (2) the delay was caused, in part, by a congested court docket, (3) the defendant asserted his right to a speedy trial about nine months after his arrest, and (4) no prejudice was caused by the delay.

      <p>
       The defendant’s right to a speedy trial was not violated where (1) the delay between arrest and trial was 574 days, (2) a significant portion of the delay was attributable to a series of defense motions filed over a seven month period, (3) the defendant never asserted his right to a speedy trial, and (4) the defense at trial did not suffer due to the passage of time.

       Defendant failed to show that he was prejudiced by any speedy trial violation in delay in bringing him to trial on charge of capital murder; defendant did not claim that, because of delay, witnesses scheduled to testify for defense disappeared or that any evidence was lost or destroyed, and there was no showing that defendant could not defend against charge or that State engaged in oppressive conduct.

       Defendant failed to adequately demonstrate violation of fundamental right regarding his claim of speedy trial violation in connection with delay of more than 18 months between his arrest and his indictment and trial and, thus, reviewing court would not use rule of plain error to hear speedy trial issue, which was not raised in trial court; defendant’s discussion of issue on appeal was brief and did not state how delay violated his rights.

       <p>
   Defendant was not denied right to speedy trial by delay of 1,027 days between arrest and start of trial; delays were caused by plea bargaining, 3 continuances, 2 changes of defense counsel, motion for change of venue, and requests by defense for additional discovery and trial preparation.

       Inmate’s petition for postconviction relief on grounds that his counsel was ineffective for failing to inform him of his right to a speedy trial was denied, as the record showed he had been advised of his right to a speedy trial, and by his guilty plea had waived his constitutional and statutory rights to a speedy trial.

       A defendant’s right to a speedy trial was not violated, even though 6 years elapsed between the date of indictment and the actual determination of the defendant’s habitual offender status, since habitual offender status is not a crime in and of itself, but is merely a status which enhances the sentence imposed for the conviction of an offense, and, therefore, the determination of habitual offender status is not an “offense” to which the right to a speedy trial would apply.

       A defendant was denied his constitutional right to a speedy retrial where there was a 288-day delay which was presumptively prejudicial, the prosecution offered only the court’s docket pages as evidence, there was no evidence in the record justifying the delay or rebutting the presumption of prejudice, and the defendant had made a demand for a speedy retrial on October 13, 1987 and the prosecution did nothing until the defendant moved to dismiss in February of 1988.

   A defendant was not denied his right to a speedy trial, even though his retrial did not commence until 383 days after the reversal of his original conviction, where part of the delay could be attributed to the logistics of a change in venue, the defendant apparently did not assert his right to a speedy trial, and there was no prejudice, particularly since it was in the defendant’s best interest that the retrial be delayed as both parties searched to secure the attendance of a witness whom the defendant claimed was critically important to have as a live eyewitness at trial; the delay did not violate §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.99.html#t99c17s99-17-1" target="_blank">99-17-1</a></cite> since the 270-day rule does not apply to retrials.

       Defendant’s speedy trial rights were not violated by his retrial approximately 352 days after mistrial where some of the delay was caused by overcrowded dockets necessitating continuances, the defendant failed to assert his right until approximately 3 weeks before his retrial was scheduled to begin, and defendant failed to show prejudice resulting from the delay.

   There is no constitutional right to have a jury mirror any particular community; thus, a capital murder defendant, who was granted a change of venue because of pre-trial publicity, was not improperly denied a second change of venue to a county in which the racial makeup more closely reflected that of the county where the crime occurred where the jury that tried the defendant was selected in a nondiscriminatory manner, and there was no evidence that the jurors were not impartial.

   Trial judge’s refusal to ask questions on voir dire about contents of news reports concerning accused, who was convicted of murder and sentenced to death, did not violate Sixth or Fourteenth Amendments, where eight of twelve venire persons who were sworn as jurors had answered on voir dire that they had read or heard something about case, but none of eight indicated he or she had formed opinion or would be biased; previous Supreme Court cases had stressed wide discretion of to trial court in conducting voir dire regarding pretrial publicity; since trial judge sat in locale where pretrial publicity was said to have effect, his perception of depth and extent of news stories should be of assistance in deciding how detailed an inquiry to make; voir dire in instant case was not perfunctory and covered subject of possible bias from pre-trial publicity.

       Federal district court correctly denied state death row inmate’s habeas corpus petition; although defense counsel was forced to exercise a peremptory challenge to exclude a potential juror who should have been excluded for cause, no federal constitutional error occurred because no violation of the state law governing peremptory challenges was shown and because the challenged juror did not ultimately sit on the jury.

       The defendant’s constitutional right to speedy trial was not violated, notwithstanding that 11 months elapsed from the time of his arrest to his trial and that the state did not show good cause for the delay, where (1) although the defendant was imprisoned for a period of time before trial, most, if not all, of his period of imprisonment stemmed from his parole revocation and conviction on subsequent criminal charges, and (2) he did not assert his right to a speedy trial until nine months after his arrest.

   Prosecutor’s stated reason for peremptory challenge against juror, that juror stated that there was nothing she could do about the fact that her sister had been accused of but not charged with killing her brother and that the Lord would take care of it, was sufficiently related to murder prosecution so as not to be deemed pretextual, as her statement could be viewed as placing punishment of wrongdoer in the hands of the Lord.

       A murder defendant was not denied a fair trial on the ground that the trial court refused to accept his challenges for cause to 3 potential jurors where the defendant used peremptory challenges to remove those jurors, since the loss of a peremptory challenge does not constitute a violation of the constitutional right to an impartial jury; so long as the jury that sits is impartial, the fact that the defendant had to use peremptory challenges to achieve that result does not mean that the defendant was denied his or her constitutional rights.

       Defendant was not entitled to habeas relief on claim that venire member was excused without showing of predisposition against death penalty in violation of defendant’s Sixth Amendment rights, where prospective juror was a preacher who stated that he could not put aside his strong moral and religious beliefs about the death penalty and follow instructions given by court.

   Although record in capital murder case indicated that veniremember who was excused for cause stated during voir dire that he could impose death penalty if circumstances warranted, and that another veniremember with similar name, who was not excused, indicated he could not impose death penalty under any circumstances, trial court did not err, where defense counsel’s failure to differentiate between the 2 veniremembers during questioning and parties’ subsequent arguments led to conclusion that court reporter mistakenly transposed veniremembers’ names.

   A trial judge in a capital murder prosecution did not abuse his discretion by excusing a potential juror who initially indicated that she could not impose the death penalty, even though she subsequently indicated that there were some circumstances under which she could impose the death penalty, where she failed to clearly indicate that she was willing to set aside her own beliefs and follow the instructions and law as to the death penalty.

   A prosecutor’s request of jurors during individual voir dire to give the particular circumstances that each would require in order to return a death sentence were not improperly designed to extract a promise from the jurors that they would certainly vote in favor of the death penalty given a specific set of circumstances, and therefore did not violate the defendant’s constitutional rights. Foster v. State, 639 So. 2d 1263, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 670 (Miss. 1994), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">514 U.S. 1019</cite>, <cite class="s_court">115 S. Ct. 1365</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">131 L.

      <p>
       Personal opposition to capital punishment is not a constitutional impediment to juror service so long as the juror is able to set aside his or her personal belief and fairly consider all sentencing options under the law; it was therefore error for a trial court to refuse defense counsel an opportunity to further voir dire potential jurors who had expressed reluctance to vote for the death penalty.

   Under the Batson test, the prosecutor satisfied the burden of articulating a non-discriminatory reason for striking a black juror where he explained that he struck the juror because the juror had long unkempt hair, a mustache and a beard, since the wearing of beards and long unkempt hair are not characteristics that are particular to any race.

       In a prosecution for capital murder and conspiracy to commit capital murder, the trial court committed reversible error in failing to place the initial burden on the State to establish a prima facie case of racial discrimination in the defendant’s use of his peremptory challenges, before concluding that the defendant failed to offer a race-neutral reason for challenging one of the jurors, since the defendant was arbitrarily and erroneously denied the use of one of his peremptory challenges, and the composition of the jury was directly altered as a result.

      <p>
       A defendant may make a prima facie showing of purposeful racial discrimination in selection of the venire by relying solely on the facts concerning its selection in the defendant’s case; a defendant may establish a prima facie case of purposeful discrimination in selection of the jury solely on evidence concerning the prosecutor’s exercise of peremptory challenges at the defendant’s trial.

      <p>
       A defendant failed to establish a prima facie case of racial discrimination in jury selection, even though the defendant was black and the prosecution exercised preemptory challenges to eliminate 3 black jurors, where the jurors were excluded because they were acquainted with the defendant; while excluding jurors on the ground that they were acquainted with the defendant might have had a discriminatory effect since the defendant’s acquaintances were primarily black, the law does not proscribe the mere incidental exclusion of blacks from a jury. Govan v. State, 591 So. 2d 428, 1991 Miss. LEXIS 836 (Miss. 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       No prima facie case of racial discrimination was shown in the prosecution’s use of peremptory challenges, even though the prosecutor exercised 5 of his 7 peremptory challenges against black jurors, where the victim of the crime charged and the defendant were black, the prosecutor and the defendant had several challenges left, numerous potential black jurors were left uncalled, and one black juror was in the jury box.

       A black defendant made a prima facie showing of purposeful discrimination in the selection of a jury where the jury – including one alternate juror – was composed of 10 white persons and 3 black persons, and where the prosecution exercised 12 peremptory challenges, 7 of which were used to exclude black persons from the jury.

       Under Batson v Kentucky (1986) 476 US 79, 90 L Ed 2d 69, 106 S Ct 1712, defendant raising claim must show (1) he is member of “cognizable racial group;” (2) prosecutor has exercised peremptory challenges toward elimination of veniremen of his race; and (3) facts and circumstances infer that prosecutor used his peremptory challenges for purpose of striking minorities. These components constitute prima facie showing of discrimination necessary to compel state to come forward with neutral explanation for challenging black jurors. Lockett v.

       During voir dire, defendant challenged four of the state’s peremptory strikes against African-American jurors, claiming that they violated the Batson rule requiring the state to provide race-neutral reasons for exercising peremptory strikes; the state provided race neutral reasons for striking four African-American veniremen and thus the state’s use of its peremptory strikes against the four veniremen were not pretextual or discriminatory. Mingo v. State, 944 So. 2d 18, 2006 Miss. LEXIS 679 (Miss. 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       The trial court did not err in finding the state’s reasons for peremptory challenges to be facially race neutral where (1) the state used a peremptory challenge against a black social worker and cited as a race-neutral reason, in addition to her profession, her body language and demeanor when informed that the case was a capital murder prosecution, (2) the state struck a potential black male juror for his “bad name” and because he lived in what was known to be a “bad neighborhood” as local law enforcement had informed the prosecution that many persons with this man’s surname had been prosecuted in the county, (3) another potential juror struck for living in a “bad neighborhood” was also uncertain regarding his ability to vote for the death penalty, (4) the state used a peremptory challenge against a black woman who had first vehemently expressed her stance against the death penalty and later took the opposite view – further, this woman’s brother had been convicted of aggravated assault and robbery, she had been arrested for DUI, and she lived in a high crime area; (5) a black man was struck for his position against the death penalty and for his DUI conviction, (6) another woman was struck for her body language and for the fact that a relative had been convicted of a crime, (7) the state exercised a peremptory challenge against a black mental health hospital attendant whose opinion regarding the death penalty changed some time between his initial questionnaire and voir dire – he had also been arrested for an expired driver’s license, and (8) the state struck a black man who had recently been arrested for an open container violation, while also expressing concern about his truthfulness due to discrepancies between his questionnaire and voir dire. Baldwin v. State, 784 So. 2d 148, 2001 Miss. LEXIS 90 (Miss. 2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       The state presented race-neutral reasons for its peremptory challenges to black jurors where one juror was struck because she was personally acquainted with both the defendant and the victim, one juror was struck because he was personally acquainted with the defendant, the defendant’s wife, and the defendant’s children; one juror was struck because he was a former client of the defendant’s lawyer, one juror was struck because she had a police record, was a known alcoholic, and had several run-ins with police stemming from her drinking problem, and one juror was struck because several witnesses knew him personally and he was known as a long-time alcoholic.

       A trial judge is not authorized under Batson to defer until the jury selection process has concluded the requirement that the prosecution give its race-neutral reasons for its strikes at the time the inference arises.

      </p>
      <p>
       The state presented sufficiently race-neutral reasons for its peremptory challenges to five black prospective jurors: (1) a juror’s sister had been convicted of a crime and sentenced to the penitentiary; (2) a juror’s relative had been convicted of a felony; (3) a juror’s husband had been sent to the penitentiary; (4) a juror had a reputation for using drugs and had recently been charged with a DUI; and (5) a juror had several family members who had previous convictions. Myles v. State, 774 So. 2d 486, 2000 Miss. App. LEXIS 427 (Miss. Ct. App. 2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       The state’s explanations for three of seven peremptory challenges to black prospective jurors were sufficiently race-neutral where one juror was stricken because he was acquainted with the defendant’s relatives and knew several of the witnesses, another juror was stricken because she knew some of the defendant’s family members and made contradictory statements as to whether she believed in the death penalty, and another juror was stricken because she was elderly and thus might not be able to pay proper attention at trial due to her age. Spann v. State, 771 So. 2d 883, 2000 Miss. LEXIS 197 (Miss. 2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       The trial court did not err in finding that the state’s peremptory challenges to three black jurors were for racially neutral reasons; one juror was familiar with the defendant’s family and also had a brother in prison, another juror was opposed to the death penalty on religious grounds and knew people who were relatives or friends of the defendant, and another juror lived in close proximity to the defendant’s mother. Davis v. State, 2000 Miss. LEXIS 162 (Miss. June 29, 2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       The state failed to establish race neutral reasons for its peremptory challenges to several black prospective jurors in the murder prosecution of a black man arising from the death of a white man, where the reasons proffered by the state included (1) a wildly-speculative assertion that two prospective jurors might be the parents of illegitimate children; (2) that one prospective juror seemed to be staring intently at the prosecuting attorney, even though the prosecutor himself was unable to sense any hostility or ill-will; and (3) that another prospective juror slept during a portion of voir dire, though the incident apparently went undetected by the trial court. Robinson v. State, 773 So. 2d 943, 2000 Miss. App. LEXIS 313 (Miss. Ct. App. 2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the trial judge erred in finding that the defendant failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination in the exercise of peremptory challenges by the state, the trial judge correctly determined that the explanations offered by the state were race-neutral and that the defendant failed to demonstrate that the state’s proffered reasons were pretextual. Puckett v. State, 2000 Miss. LEXIS 130 (Miss. June 1, 2000), op. withdrawn, sub. op., 788 So. 2d 752, 2001 Miss. LEXIS 168 (Miss. 2001).

   The circuit court’s ruling accepting the state’s articulated race-neutral reasons for peremptorily striking a juror was neither clearly erroneous nor against the overwhelming weight of the evidence.

       There was no Batson violation where the state offered race-neutral reasons for all of the questioned challenges and the defendant offered no rebuttal to the state’s explanations for its peremptory strikes. Gary v. State, 760 So. 2d 743, 2000 Miss. LEXIS 135 (Miss. 2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       The failure of the trial court to make detailed findings with regard to the sufficiency of the race-neutral reasons asserted by the state for its peremptory challenges to six black prospective jurors constituted error and, therefore, the case was remanded to the trial court for a hearing and findings. Johnson v. State, 754 So. 2d 1178, 2000 Miss. LEXIS 50 (Miss. 2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       The trial judge did not err in allowing the prosecution to use peremptory challenges to excuse three jurors on the basis that they were unmarried, unemployed, and had children and, therefore, had no stake in the community. Lard v. State, 749 So. 2d 276, 1999 Miss. App. LEXIS 563 (Miss. Ct. App. 1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       The trial court in a capital murder prosecution erred by not requiring the State to give racially-neutral reasons for exercising peremptory challenges against 7 out of 13 black jurors on the venire, even though there was no showing that the defendant was of a minority class, and therefore the case would be remanded for a hearing on whether the Batson criteria were violated by the State’s exercise of its peremptory challenges.

      </p>
      <p>
       The reasons proffered by the State for using 5 of its 7 peremptory challenges against black jurors were sufficient to withstand a Batson challenge where the reasons given were (1) the juror had a brother in the penitentiary; (2) the juror had attended high school with the defendant; (3) the juror wore dark glasses in the courtroom; (4) the juror was employed in a company in which there had been a riot which was quelled by the police; and (5) the juror shared a last name with many persons in the penitentiary and the prosecutor believed he was related to an inmate, and the defense made no attempt to show that the reasons proffered were pretextual, of disparate impact, or not true.

   The State’s reason for striking a potential African-American juror–to get an older man on the jury–was an acceptable, race-neutral reason for exercising a peremptory challenge. Simon v.

       A trial judge is required to make an on-the-record factual determination that each reason proffered by the State for exercising a peremptory challenge is, in fact, race neutral; this requirement is to be prospective in nature.

       The State successfully rebutted a black defendant’s Batson challenge to the State’s exercise of peremptory challenges to eliminate four black venire members where 2 of the venire members were challenged because they were of an age to be employed and had no occupation, and the other 2 were challenged because they were acquainted with the defendant or her family.

      </p>
      <p>
       A white defendant had standing to object to the State’s use of 5 of its 6 peremptory challenges to strike black jurors; however, the defendant failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination where the State offered race neutral reasons for striking each individual black juror and the defendant’s attorney offered no evidence to rebut the State’s reasons for striking the jurors.

      <p>
       The reasons given by a district attorney for exercising a peremptory challenge to excuse a black juror were sufficiently race-neutral where the district attorney stated that the juror was a truck driver “which may or may not mean he’s a transient,” the juror wore overalls with a black T-Shirt in the courtroom, and he was unmarried and did not have children “which shows that he doesn’t have a stake in the community like somebody that’s established.” Bradley v.

       Jury selection was properly conducted and jurors were not excluded on basis of race where black jurors were excluded for following race-neutral reasons: (1) 22-year-old laborer with eleventh-grade education was stricken because his youth, marital status, and educational level appeared to prosecutor to indicate instability; (2) 49-year-old minister/bus driver was stricken because he was preacher; (3) 35-year-old housewife was removed because she did not reveal her brother’s conviction for armed robbery; (4) 38-year-old cafeteria hostess was challenged because of her concerns about sequestration due to having to care for invalid mother; and (5) 25-year-old was stricken from panel because he wore hat into courtroom and his general demeanor suggested to prosecutor that he was unstable, unconcerned, and had no respect for proceedings.

   In a capital murder case, the unsworn statements of one juror showing that the juror was predisposed to voting for the death penalty without weighing mitigating factors was countered with an affidavit from the juror that the juror had considered all the evidence in the case and the unsworn statement of the second juror did not state that the juror had been silent during voir dire, that she had lied about her views on mitigating evidence, that the juror was unwilling to consider mitigating factors, or that she had a predisposition toward the death penalty that she did not disclose during voir dire; thus, the inmate’s claim that the two jurors were predisposed toward voting for the death penalty was unsupported and the inmate was not deprived of his right to a fair and impartial jury under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments or Miss.

       A defendant was denied his constitutional right to a fair trial by an impartial jury in the sentencing phase of a capital murder prosecution where, upon conclusion of the guilt phase but before the sentencing phase began, the jury prematurely deliberated and sent a note to the judge indicating their decision that the defendant should be sentenced to death. Rather than questioning the jurors in order to determine whether each of them could remain impartial during the sentencing phase, the judge merely instructed the jurors to “refrain from further deliberations,” which was insufficient to insure that the defendant’s right to a fair hearing was not prejudiced.

       Refusal to grant capital murder defendant’s request for change of venue impermissibly deprives defendant of right to impartial jury where defendant has made prima facie showing of community prejudice by submitting affidavit signed by 2 witnesses with knowledge; furthermore, testimony of 15 defense witnesses who state specific reasons why defendant cannot receive fair trial in county in which offense has been committed raises irrebuttable presumption of prejudice.

   In a prosecution for capital murder, the trial court’s excusing of 16 jurors for cause did not violate defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to a representative jury, where all 16 who were excluded indicated that they would not follow the law if it meant imposing the death penalty.

   Defendant’s Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment rights were not violated in a capital murder case, where the trial court excused a juror for cause who had unequivocally stated that he was opposed to the death penalty to the extent that it would prevent him from making an impartial decision on defendant’s guilt, that he would not even consider the court’s instructions, and that under no circumstances would he vote for the death penalty.

       Defendant was barred from asserting claim of state’s abuse of its peremptory challenges to exclude all blacks from defendant’s jury, which allegedly deprived him of his right to representative jury and to due process of law, where record failed to reflect that defendant had made contemporaneous objection to prosecuting attorney’s use of peremptory challenges.

   Defendant’s capital murder conviction was proper because his Fifth Amendment and Sixth Amendment rights were not violated by the prosecutor’s comments during closing arguments. Wide latitude was given to attorneys in making closing arguments and, given the evidence presented, the court could not say that the verdict was occasioned by unjust prejudice. Davis v.

   In a capital murder case, the inmate alleged that a deputy made improper comments to the jury amounting to unauthorized communications with jurors that prejudiced his case, but the deputy’s statement was too innocuous to be prejudicial and the statement alone did not indicate what it was in reference to or the context in which it was made and, even if it was made in reference to the inmate’s case, the statement did not show prejudice toward the inmate; thus, the inmate’s right to trial by a fair and impartial jury was not violated.

       In a prosecution for murder, an exclamation from the audience by the victim’s mother that the defendant “cold blooded killed my child” did not prejudice the defendant’s right to a fair trial where the victim’s mother was immediately escorted from the courtroom after her outburst, and the judge then properly admonished the jury to disregard the incident and questioned the jurors to determine whether they could disregard the comments.

       Counsel failed to preserve sufficient record from which it could be determined whether mistrial should have been granted where defense counsel brought alleged outside influence of jurors to court’s attention through motion for mistrial, but offered little proof in support of this motion; alleged outside influence consisted of juror reporting to bailiff during course of trial concerning rumors regarding defendant’s being visited by another prisoner in her cell while the 2 were incarcerated, statement allegedly having been made in front of all other male jurors; court noted that whenever there was question regarding outside influence of jury, trial judge himself ought to examine jury carefully to ensure that its deliberations were based on evidence produced at trial and not extraneous matters.

       There was no Confrontation Clause or hearsay violation in an officer’s testimony because the officer did not testify that the two people who identified defendant as the shooter were eyewitnesses, the officer did not convey any statements or assertions made by the two anonymous people, either directly or indirectly, and the officer did not reveal the substance of the conversations; the officer stated that defendant became a suspect during the course of her investigation, but it was clear that her investigation involved much more than a conversation with these two people. Thus, it was not apparent that the testimony at issue was hearsay or that the unnamed people could be classified as accusers. Keithley v. State, 111 So.3d 1202, 2013 Miss. LEXIS 161 (Miss. 2013).

       Defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to confront his accuser was not violated by the court’s admission of prior statements by the victim to law enforcement which were inconsistent with his testimony on direct examination and which the victim disclaimed at trial as having been false; victim’s appearance on the witness stand at trial provided defendant with the opportunity to confront and cross-examine such victim, which was all that is required by the Sixth Amendment Confrontation Clause.

       Introduction of codefendant’s statement was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt where defendant made no effort to suppress his own statements and the only objection made to the introduction of his statement was his joining codefendant’s objection on the grounds of hearsay and confrontation; no objection was made which would challenge either the truthfulness, or the voluntariness, or the reliability of defendant’s statements, and defendant’s confession was the most probative and damaging evidence admitted against him, and it constituted direct evidence of the facts related to the victim’s murder; defendant’s own statements concerning his participation in the robbery and murder of the victim were uncontradicted and unchallenged, and the evidence in the record was overwhelming and was sufficient to support the jury’s verdict.

       Defendant’s conviction for the sale of a controlled substance was appropriate, in part because defendant suffered no substantial prejudice in that he was not denied his constitutional right to confront witnesses based on the admission of audiotaped telephone recordings of the pre-drug-buy conversations between the confidential informant and unknown persons. Neither the confidential informant nor the law enforcement officials knew the identity of the voices on the tape, other than the confidential informant, nor did the State or any of its witnesses attempt to state or imply that one of the unidentified voices on the tape recording was defendant’s.

       Victim’s mother’s testimony about a letter defendant wrote to her while he was incarcerated was an admission by a party-opponent, not considered hearsay, and thus admissible under Miss. R.

       Defendant’s murder conviction was proper because there was no indication that a witness’s co-worker’s comments to the witness regarding defendant’s identity were “testimonial” within the meaning established by Crawford since the co-worker did not make his comments during a preliminary hearing, before a grand jury, at a former trial, or during a policy interrogation; the co-worker’s comments took place between two co-workers at a time when defendant was not a suspect to the murder because, at the time of the comments, no one was aware that the victim had been murdered. Bailey v. State, 956 So. 2d 1016, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 112 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 957 So. 2d 1004, 2007 Miss. LEXIS 301 (Miss. 2007).

       In a robbery case, where defendant’s co-defendant had been acquitted and his co-defendant chose “not to testify,” the full text of the co-defendant’s statement to the police that was admitted into evidence clearly reflected that no specific individual was facially implicated by same. Based on the benign character of the co-defendant’s statement in the individual case, and the assuredly disruptive impact that the retroactive application of Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36, (2004) would undoubtedly have created in the form of innumerable appeals, the appellate court held that Crawford (which barred testimonial out-of-court statements by witnesses under the Confrontation Clause, unless witnesses were unavailable and defendants had prior opportunity to cross-examine them), was not be applied retroactively in defendant’s appeal. Bynum v. State, 929 So. 2d 324, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 267 (Miss. Ct. App. 2005), aff'd, 929 So. 2d 312, 2006 Miss. LEXIS 261 (Miss. 2006).

       Where defendant asserted self defense in what he alleged was the accidental killing of his former girlfriend when he allegedly was confronted by her male friend, the trial court abused its discretion when it prohibited the question on the male friend’s prior gun ownership. However, in a second instance, the State elicited the same information on redirect examination that defendant was barred from eliciting on cross-examination, in regard to whether the male friend had also been a suspect early in the investigation; in the former respect, the error was harmless given the overwhelming weight of the evidence against defendant, and in the latter respect, defendant’s right to confrontation was not violated as he suffered no prejudice.

   Trial court erred in admitting police testimony regarding the robbery accomplice’s confession because the accomplice refused to testify and the United States Supreme Court has held that under the Bruton rule the lack of cross-examination was a violation of the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment. However, in light of the overwhelming evidence of defendant’s guilt, particularly the testimony of his roommate and former girlfriend, the violation was harmless error. Clark v.

      </p>
      <p>
       The Confrontation Clause of the United States Constitution operates in 2 separate ways to restrict the range of admissible hearsay. First, in conformity with the preference for face-to-face accusation, the Sixth Amendment establishes a rule of necessity. In the usual case, including cases where prior cross-examination has occurred, the prosecution must either produce or demonstrate the unavailability of the declarant whose statement it wishes to use against the defendant. The second aspect operates once a witness is shown to be unavailable; reflecting its underlying purpose to augment accuracy in the factfinding process by ensuring the defendant an effective means to test adverse evidence, the clause countenances only hearsay marked with such trustworthiness that there is no material departure from the reason of the general rule. Stoop v. State, 531 So. 2d 1215, 1988 Miss. LEXIS 493 (Miss. 1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial judge committed no error in allowing victim’s in-court identification of defendant, despite contention of defendant that in-court identification was result of unnecessarily suggestive viewing of defendant by victim while defendant was being treated at hospital, because under totality of circumstances as contemplated by Manson v Brathwaite (1977) 432 US 98, 53 L Ed 2d 140, 97 S Ct 2243, there was no substantial likelihood of misidentification; analysis of Manson factors showed that victim had viewed defendant at close range for approximately one hour; victim’s undivided attention was focused on defendant; victim’s initial description of her attacker to police exhibited high degree of accuracy; victim was positive of her identification of suspect, describing his as “a face I’ll never forget;” and, time between crime and subsequent confrontation defendant was approximately one hour.

       The confrontation clause operates in two ways to restrict the range of admissible hearsay. First, it establishes a rule of necessity whereby in the usual case the prosecution must either produce or demonstrate the unavailability of the declarant whose statement it wishes to use against the defendant. Even then his statement is admissible only if it bears adequate “indicia of reliability.” Reliability can be inferred without more in a case where the evidence falls within a firmly rooted hearsay exception. In other cases, the evidence must be excluded, at least absent a showing of particularized guarantees of trustworthiness. United States v. Washington, 688 F.2d 953, 1982 U.S. App. LEXIS 25386 (5th Cir. Miss. 1982).

       Defendant’s right to a fair trial was not violated where defendant could not show that a discovery violation was committed by the State or that he was prejudiced in any way when there was nothing in the record showing knowledge on the part of the State of either of the two defense witnesses, and defendant made no showing how the police could have known of them and thus failed to disclose them; even though defendant claimed prejudice because police and/or the DA’s office failed to find certain witnesses who would have helped him in his defense, he put on no proof at trial of an alleged inadequate investigation.

       A denial of a list of witnesses does not always amount to a prejudicial denial of due process, particularly where student witnesses in a school disciplinary proceeding are involved, since a school board has not been given the power of subpoena. However, school boards should be especially sensitive to the right of students to know the complete nature of the charges, especially where charges of misconduct are denied and proof is based solely on testimony of other students. Although confrontation may not be an absolute necessity–or even advisable–in every case, written statements should ordinarily be provided. Findings of fact should be made, especially where there are multiple allegations. School boards should take note that although courts should not become involved in running schools, expulsion and suspension are severe sanctions requiring solemn attention to a pupil’s rights.

       There was no plain error in the failure to either make a Sixth Amendment objection or at least to have such an objection clearly preserved on the record; thus, the court determined that defendant’s argument for the first time on appeal that the introduction of a video demonstrating a “shaken baby” episode violated his Sixth Amendment right to confront witnesses was without merit.

   In a sexual battery of a child case, the victim’s grandmother, the babysitter, the psychotherapist, and the doctor were not working in connection with the police; further, their statements were not made for the purpose of aiding in the prosecution because (1) the victim’s unsolicited statements were made to his grandmother and his babysitter for the sake of his well-being and not for the purpose of furthering the prosecution; and (2) his statements to the psychotherapist and the doctor were for the purpose of seeking medical and psychological treatment. The victim was taken to the psychotherapist and the doctor at the family’s request and not sent there by police to further their investigation; thus, their testimony did not violate the Confrontation Clause.

   In a sexual battery of a child case, the statements testified to by a police officer and a detective were testimonial and should have been excluded under the Confrontation Clause; therefore, the trial court erred in admitting them. However, similar testimony was properly admitted from four other witnesses; therefore, the testimony was duplicative, and the error was harmless. Hobgood v. State, 926 So. 2d 847, 2006 Miss.

   Sixth Amendment confrontation clause did not absolutely prohibit state from using one-way closed-circuit television for receipt of testimony by child witness in child abuse case, as face-to-face confrontation is not indispensable element of confrontation guarantee, and in narrow circumstances competing interest may warrant dispensing with confrontation at trial and word “confront” cannot simply mean face to face confrontation; statutory procedure insured reliability of evidence by subjecting it to rigorous adversarial testing and thereby preserved essence of effective confrontation; state’s interest in physical and psychological well being of child abuse victims may be sufficiently important to outweigh defendant’s right to face accusers in court in some cases.

       There was no evidence the informant was an eyewitness to defendant’s drug possession, and there were no allegations of entrapment, misidentification, or other similar claims necessitating disclosure; it was not shown how the informant’s identity was material to defendant’s drug possession, and thus the trial court did not err in not requiring the State to disclose his identity, plus defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to confrontation was not violated.

       In a case involving possession of methamphetamine, possession of precursor materials, and false pretenses, plain error was shown because there was a violation of the state and federal Confrontation Clauses based on the admission into evidence of two search warrants and an affidavit that included hearsay statements attributed to a confidential informant. Regardless of the strength of the properly admitted evidence, it could not have been said beyond a reasonable doubt that the documents did not prejudice defendant. Johnson v. State, 155 So.3d 733, 2014 Miss. LEXIS 150 (Miss. 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       Even assuming that the issue was not barred, there would be no merit to the confrontation issue where it was clear that the confidential informant did not testify; the right to confront witnesses did not extend beyond those witnesses called to testify against an accused; consequently, there was no merit to defendant’s contention that he was denied his right to confrontation as secured under the Sixth Amendment.

       Defendant’s confrontation rights are not violated when a police officer testifies about the statement of a confidential informant if the informant is available for cross-examination; moreover, an officer’s testimony regarding an informant’s statement that defendant sold drugs was not hearsay because it was merely offered to show the reason behind the officer’s actions, and it was not offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted.

       Statement of an officer to explain why a particular person was approached on a certain date was admissible because it did not constitute hearsay; moreover, the statement did not violate defendant’s right to confrontation because the officer was cross-examined at trial, despite the officer’s actions being based on the statements of several anonymous tipsters.

       A trial court erred in determining that a defendant was not entitled to disclosure of the identity of a confidential informant where, without the informant’s eyewitness testimony, the State’s case would have rested almost exclusively on the uncorroborated and doubtful testimony of 2 codefendants; however, the trial court’s error did not require reversal where the defendant discovered the informant’s identity at trial and subsequently confronted and cross-examined him, since confrontation and cross-examination are the very rights which require disclosure of material witnesses in the first place and the defendant fully exercised those rights at the trial.

       In determining whether a minor rape victim’s hearsay statements qualify under the residual hearsay exception, a proper consideration for the court as to the requirement of “sufficient guarantees of trustworthiness” of the victim’s statements would be the behavior of the victim and her own mental and emotional condition as indicative of having undergone some severe emotional trauma such as sexual abuse. In considering the admissibility of testimony of this nature, a court must be extremely careful that on the one hand the rights of a defendant are protected under the witness confrontation clauses of the federal and state constitutions and the Mississippi Rules of Evidence, and, on the other hand, that testimony which on balance should be admitted under the framework of the Rules of Evidence is not excluded.

       At the joint trial of 2 defendants charged with conspiracy to commit murder, admission, in prosecution’s case-in-chief, of co-conspirators’ post-arrest statements, wherein each co-defendant pointed a finger at the other, was reversible error, where these statements fell outside the co-conspirator’s exemption from the hearsay rule, did not interlock in substantial particulars, and were not attended by other indicia of reliability sufficient to satisfy the conspirators’ rights under the confrontation of witnesses clauses of federal and state constitutions.

       Defendant’s right to a speedy trial was not violated because while defendant arguably suffered slight prejudice due to a witness’s unavailability at the second trial, that prejudice did not affect his primary theory of self-defense, which he was able to assert at both trials; defendant offered no evidence as to whether the witness’s testimony would have differed at the second trial had he been present.

   Where defense counsel was aware that the codefendant was unavailable as a witness, but nevertheless placed another witness on the witness stand to introduce statements made by the codefendant which favored the defendant, it was rationally inconsistent and constitutionally wanting for defense counsel to later argue that the subsequent introduction of the codefendant’s statements which disfavored the defendant was in violation of the defendant’s right to confront the codefendant.

       Any error that occurred as a result of the trial court excluding defendant’s line of questioning to the victim about the victim’s grand jury testimony was harmless error as the testimony that defendant was trying to elicit, that the victim had previously told others he did not know who his assailant was, was before the jury as the victim had admitted that he had told people that during cross-examination. Thus, defendant’s confrontation rights were not violated. Harris v. State, 901 So. 2d 1277, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 1120 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004), cert. denied, 898 So. 2d 679, 2005 Miss.

       Trial court did not violate defendant’s confrontation rights in limiting his examination of two eyewitnesses to the shooting as defendant was questioning the witnesses about whether they were told what to testify by the police when he had no basis in fact for doing so, and was repeating questions that had already been answered.

       In a case involving receiving stolen property, defendant’s confrontation rights were not violated when a trial court allowed the State to exceed the scope of cross-examination during redirect to ask about money orders cashed in Mississippi because defense counsel opened the door to such testimony by inquiring about which states the money orders had been cashed in.

       Defendant did not agree to the admission of the packages of medication or waive his right to confront and cross-examine the person who labeled the medication as containing ephedrine, and the State failed to present any evidence that the medications had been chemically analyzed and determined to contain ephedrine or pseudoephedrine; thus, the State failed to carry its burden of proof as to an essential element of possession of precursor drugs with knowledge that the drugs would be used to manufacture a controlled substance, and defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to confrontation was violated; therefore, the trial court reversed his conviction.

       Where a defense witness invoked the Fifth Amendment, so that his testimony on direct-examination yielded nothing, the trial court erred in permitting the prosecutor to cross-examine the witness concerning a prior statement made by him; when the prosecutor, through the use of leading questions, parades before the jury the “testimony” of a silent witness, this violates the confrontation clause since the prosecutor cannot take the stand to be cross-examined by the defendant about the silent witness’ “testimony”.

   A defendant’s constitutional right to confront witnesses was violated by the prosecution’s attempted cross-examination of a witness who had been called as an adverse witness by the defendant, where the witness pleaded her privilege against self-incrimination on direct examination, and then, on cross-examination, the prosecuting attorney purportedly read from the witness’ pre-trial statement, which implied the defendant’s guilt, before each of the witness’ claim of privilege against self-incrimination. However, the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt where the evidence against the defendant was overwhelming. Hansen v. State, 592 So. 2d 114, 1991 Miss.

       A trial court erred in admitting accomplices’ statements into evidence in a murder prosecution under Rule 106, Miss. R. Ev., which contemplates the introduction of a writing by a party and contemporaneous introduction of other parts of the statement to prevent the misleading of the jury, where the defense counsel was merely cross-examining the police officer who investigated the accomplices and he in no way introduced parts of these statements into evidence. Additionally, there were serious confrontation problems since the jury was unable to observe the demeanor of the accomplices when they made the unsworn statements and the statements were taken under the coercive atmosphere of police interrogation. Welch v. State, 566 So. 2d 680, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 152 (Miss. 1990).

       A trial court committed reversible error during the sentencing phase of a capital case in permitting the prosecutor to use a psychiatric evaluation to cross-examine a defense witness in violation of the Sixth Amendment right to confront witnesses where the doctors who wrote the evaluation were not called for trial and could not be cross-examined by the defendant. Lanier v. State, 533 So. 2d 473, 1988 Miss. LEXIS 523 (Miss. 1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       Mere calling of witness by State who invoked Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination would not be sufficient grounds for reversal of capital murder conviction; however, where state was allowed to call other witnesses to testify regarding alleged confession given by that witness, wherein he had detailed events of murder and implicated defendant as party to murder, defendant’s right to confront and cross-examine witnesses presented against her was violated. Witness invoking Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination and refusing to answer any questions regarding confession effectively prevented defendant from conducting meaningful cross-examination in violation of her constitutionally protected rights; fact that defendant was allowed to cross-examine both witnesses concerning circumstances under which confession was given could not hardly be substitute for meaningful cross-examination of declarant himself; state’s contention that this evidence was properly admitted to impeach testimony given by witness was rejected, where state was allegedly attempting to impeach witness concerning statement that was accurate and truthful, which was that jury had previously decided whether he had killed decedent; court stated that it knew of no authority where truthful statements were held to be impeachable; instruction to jury that testimony was to be viewed only for impeachment purposes did nothing to diminish importance of this testimony and certainly did not cure constitutional error.

       Cross-examination of victim was not unduly restricted either to develop defendant’s state of mind at time of incident or for pure impeachment purpose, where cross-examination involved collateral issue concerning business practices of victim and did not constitute viable defense to indictment for aggravated assault, and was sufficiently extraneous to charge in indictment and sufficiently unprovoked by victim’s direct testimony that restriction of the cross-examination was matter within discretion of trial judge.

       In a prosecution for rape, the trial court correctly excluded evidence concerning the prosecutrix’ sexual conduct after holding an in-chambers hearing to determine if such testimony would be relevant, where the prosecutrix unequivocally testified that she had not had sexual intercourse with anyone during the month prior to the rape, where defendant produced no evidence to the contrary, and where any evidence of her sexual conduct prior to the month before the rape would be too remote and, therefore incompetent, irrelevant and immaterial; thus, defendant was not denied his constitutional right to cross-examine and confront the witnesses against him.

       In a prosecution for grand larceny, the trial court did not commit prejudicial error in admitting a codefendant’s incriminatory statement into evidence during the state’s case in chief where the codefendant later testified in his own behalf and was cross-examined by counsel for defendant; thus, defendant’s Sixth Amendment right of confrontation was not violated.

       The defendant was denied the right to a full and complete cross-examination when the witness, whether rightfully or not, successfully invoked the privilege against self-incrimination, and the defendant’s motion for the court to instruct the jury to disregard the witness’ testimony should have been sustained, and failure of the court to do so was error.

       Trial court did not violate defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to confrontation by excluding testimony that his victims were smoking marijuana at the time he assaulted them by limiting his ability to cross-examine one victim regarding the intoxication; the evidence was properly excluded under Miss. R. Evid. 401 and 402 because defendant presented no evidence that smoking marijuana increased a person’s propensity for violence generally or that smoking marijuana increased the victim’s propensity for violence. Since defendant did not meet the threshold for establishing the probative value of the evidence, the testimony on whether the victim had been smoking marijuana the morning of the assault was irrelevant.

       Trial court did not violate defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to confrontation by excluding testimony that his victims were smoking marijuana at the time he assaulted them by limiting his ability to cross examine one victim regarding the intoxication. The trial court properly balanced the probative and prejudicial effects of the evidence under Miss. R. Evid. 403, and found that the proposed testimony would have had no probative value because the possible testimony of marijuana usage was not linked to a propensity for violence; also, the prejudicial fact that the possible intoxication was of an illegal substance – marijuana – and not mere alcohol, further outweighed any probative effect.

       Introduction of statements by codefendant did not violate defendant’s rights under the Confrontation Clause where, since codefendant did the actual shooting and was the only other witness to the shooting besides defendant, given the fact that he gave conflicting statements, the obvious purpose in admitting the statements was to call into question whether anything codefendant said about defendant’s participation could be believed; since there was a legitimate trial tactic or purpose involved in putting the statements into evidence, there was no ground to find that the waiver of the right of confrontation was invalid.

       Defendant’s conviction for manslaughter was appropriate because defendant was guilty of a willful discovery violation since he offered no reason whatsoever for not disclosing the statements at issue, even though the case had been pending for approximately four years; because defendant’s discovery violation was willful, his Sixth Amendment right to compulsory process was not violated. Lindsey v. State, 965 So. 2d 712, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 357 (Miss. Ct. App. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant’s conviction for the sale of marijuana within a correctional facility was appropriate because the circuit court did not err in failing to grant defendant’s motion for a continuance since the record contained no affidavits or any other indication that anyone knew a probationer’s whereabouts, and there was no indication that the probationer would likely have been available at some time in the future. Jackson v. State, 962 So. 2d 649, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 104 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 962 So. 2d 38, 2007 Miss. LEXIS 434 (Miss. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant’s discovery violation in not providing a defense witness list to the State until the morning that the trial began was willful and motivated by a desire to obtain a tactical advantage, and therefore, the circuit court properly excluded the evidence and did not violate the Compulsory Process Clause. Morris v. State, 927 So. 2d 744, 2006 Miss. LEXIS 113 (Miss. 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       The exclusion of a defense witness by the trial court was not a violation of the defendant’s Sixth Amendment compulsory process rights where the witness was excluded because the defendant failed to provide the name of the witness to the state in a timely manner. Beckwith v. Anderson, 89 F. Supp. 2d 788, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2238 (S.D. Miss. 2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       The defendant was not denied his right to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor where (1) the state issued several subpoenas on behalf of the defendant, but each was returned unserved, and (2) the defendant failed to make a reasonable effort to locate one witness and made no effort at all to find another witness. Thompson v. State, 773 So. 2d 955, 2000 Miss. App. LEXIS 375 (Miss. Ct. App. 2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a prosecution for driving while intoxicated, the trial court’s refusal to compel production of an intoxilyzer machine into court to conduct a demonstration did not violate the defendant’s constitutional right to be confronted by the witnesses against him and to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, where the trial court ordered the city to allow the defendant the opportunity to run a test in the police station where the intoxilyzer machine was situated, the defendant failed to show that he would be unable to do what was needed in order to properly defend the case by examining and testing the machine at the police station, the defendant made no showing that he could substantially replicate the conditions of the night of his arrest, and moving the intoxilyzer machine to the court house would have been substantially disruptive and inconvenient to the city law enforcement authorities. Goforth v. Ridgeland, 603 So. 2d 323, 1992 Miss. LEXIS 348 (Miss. 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       A judge’s refusal to permit a criminal defendant’s children to testify did not violate federal and state constitutional provisions entitling a defendant to access to witnesses where the judge provided the defendant with an opportunity show a “colorable need” for calling the children to testify and the defendant failed to show such a need. Edwards v. State, 594 So. 2d 587, 1992 Miss. LEXIS 47 (Miss. 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       A defendant’s constitutional right to compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor was violated where the trial court quashed the defendant’s subpoenas to a district attorney and 2 deputy sheriffs who allegedly had first-hand knowledge of incidents that had happened at the county jail which would have been relevant to the defense of duress, since without their testimony the defendant had no defense to the charge of conspiracy to commit a jail escape. Hentz v. State, 542 So. 2d 914, 1989 Miss. LEXIS 223 (Miss. 1989).

       Since Bar disciplinary proceedings are inherently adversarial proceedings of a quasi-criminal nature, in the course of those proceedings there is secured to the accused attorney the right to due process of law, and within such secured due process right is the right of the accused attorney to have access to compulsory process for obtaining attendance of witnesses at critical stages of the proceedings.

       Fact that evidentiary rules may restrain testimony to be given by witness called by accused does not, in itself, violate accused’s right to process to call witness. Holmes v. State, 483 So. 2d 684, 1986 Miss. LEXIS 2365 (Miss. 1986).

   Trial court’s refusal to summon prisoners to testify in capital murder case, as requested by defendant, does not violate defendant’s right to compulsory process where testimony by prisoners would be inadmissible hearsay.

      <p>
       In a prosecution for forgery, the trial court’s refusal to provide defendant, an indigent, with funds to procure a handwriting expert to counter testimony of the state’s expert witness was not a denial of defendant’s state or federal constitutional right to process for such witness where defendant’s guilt or innocence was scarcely, if at all, dependent on the state’s expert witness; the determination of whether the state owes an indigent the duty of providing an expert as a part of due process must be made on a case by case basis.

       <p>
   In a criminal prosecution, where the trial court was without authority to compel the attendance of witnesses requested by the defendant under any circumstances, so long as they were outside the state, the court’s denial of compulsory process for the attendance of three witnesses confined in penitentiaries in other states, and a fourth witness who resided out of the state, did not constitute a denial of due process or equal protection. Diddlemeyer v. State, 234 So. 2d 292, 1970 Miss. LEXIS 1402 (Miss.), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">400 U.S. 917</cite>, <cite class="s_court">91 S. Ct. 177</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">27 L.

   While trial counsel was deficient for failing to request an accomplice-testimony instruction, as the State used such testimony to identify defendant as the shooter, the deficient performance did not prejudice the defense, as the jury heard testimony from a nonaccomplice witness that defendant admitted his involvement in the robbery and could have deduced from accomplice’s testimony that he had an incentive to lie.
   Carson v. State, 212 So.3d 22, 2016 Miss. LEXIS 473 (Miss. 2016), cert. denied, — U.S. —, <cite class="s_court">138 S. Ct. 482</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">199 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 367, 2017 U.S. LEXIS 7069 (U.S. 2017).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant’s trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to renew his motion for a directed verdict at the close of the defense’s case-in-chief, as counsel did file a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or, in the alternative, a new trial, giving the trial court an opportunity to review the sufficiency and weight of the evidence.
   Brooks v. State, 203 So.3d 1134, 2016 Miss. LEXIS 472 (Miss. 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendants were not denied the effective representation of counsel when the court properly denied a continuance to allow defendants’ counsel to prepare for trial after he took the case a few days before trial because defendants pointed to no witness whose questioning might have made a difference, nor did they point to anything in the documents that could have been discovered had counsel had more time to review the case. Salts v. State, 984 So. 2d 1050, 2008 Miss. App. LEXIS 199 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 984 So. 2d 277, 2008 Miss. LEXIS 334 (Miss. 2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant was not denied his Sixth Amendment right to counsel because defendant entered a valid guilty plea, waiving defendant’s rights under the Sixth Amendment, and defendant had appointed counsel from the time charged until defendant entered a guilty plea and had also retained counsel at the time defendant entered a plea. Frith v. State, 984 So. 2d 316, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 661 (Miss. Ct. App. 2007), cert. dismissed, 2008 Miss. LEXIS 293 (Miss. June 12, 2008).

       Defendant claimed ineffective assistance of counsel during his trial for possession of marihuana and cocaine, and possession of a weapon; however, defendant merely raised the issue in his brief without pointing to any part of the record that would substantiate his claim; as such, the issue was without merit. Chester v. State, 935 So. 2d 976, 2006 Miss. LEXIS 368 (Miss. 2006).

      <p>
       Appellant’s conviction for two counts of sexual battery was upheld because he did not allege that he suffered any untoward consequences because he did not have pre-indictment counsel, aside from the fact that he was indicted; he claimed only that, if counsel had been available, counsel could have objected to the hearsay testimony introduced during the grand jury proceedings, and could have filed a motion to dismiss.

      </p>
      <p>
       In an armed robbery case, defendant’s counsel was not ineffective by spending as much time as he did attempting to show that defendant left his fingerprints at the scene on an earlier occasion as defendant’s fingerprints were the only physical evidence tying defendant to the crime scene; had defense counsel succeeded in establishing that defendant left his fingerprints at some time unconnected with the robbery, then his alibi would have been strengthened. As such, the actions of defendant’s counsel concerning the fingerprint evidence fell within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance. Madison v. State, 923 So. 2d 252, 2006 Miss. App. LEXIS 155 (Miss. Ct. App. 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a possession of cocaine case, defendant was not denied effective assistance of counsel when his attorney failed to object to the jurisdiction of the trial court after the State amended the indictment to include the habitual offender charge. The trial court had jurisdiction under Miss. Unif. Cir. & County Ct. Prac. R. 7.09, and the evidence showed that defendant was afforded a fair opportunity to present a defense and was not surprised with the habitual offender amendment, as required by Rule 7.09. Troupe v. State, 922 So. 2d 844, 2006 Miss. App. LEXIS 144 (Miss. Ct. App. 2006).

       <p>
   Defendant’s counsel was not ineffective because a potential juror made no indication during the extensive questioning following her objectionable comments that in any way revealed that she would be unable to be fair and impartial in deciding whether defendant was guilty or not guilty, and if found guilty, in deciding the appropriate sentence; given the multiple opportunities that the potential juror had to notify the trial court or the attorneys of any potential problems she may have had in sitting on the jury, trial counsel’s performance was not so deficient that it prevented counsel from functioning as guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment. Havard v. State, 928 So. 2d 771, 2006 Miss. LEXIS 90 (Miss. 2006), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">549 U.S. 1119</cite>, <cite class="s_court">127 S. Ct. 931</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">166 L.

   Where defendant gave false names to police upon being detained, it was not error to allow impeachment of defendant at trial with statements he made to police prior to being given his Miranda warnings. Flora v. State, 925 So. 2d 797, 2006 Miss. LEXIS 49 (Miss.), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">549 U.S. 912</cite>, <cite class="s_court">127 S. Ct. 253</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">166 L.

      </p>
      <p>
       Denial of the inmate’s petition for post-conviction relief was proper where he was not denied the effective assistance of counsel because the record reflected that he was represented by one of two attorneys during all parts of the plea and sentencing hearing. Nothing occurred following the departure of one attorney that would have been uniquely within his knowledge so as to make that representation inadequate. McBride v. State, 914 So. 2d 260, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 524 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 921 So. 2d 344, 2005 Miss. LEXIS 720 (Miss. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       As to his conviction for murder, defendant did not demonstrate that the outcome of his trial would have been different if his counsel had objected to the district attorney’s leading questions to deputies and the district attorney’s eliciting of prior bad acts testimony from the victim’s family members and a neighbor. He merely asserted that had counsel been as diligent with objections on said matters, he would have received a fair trial, and that statement did not satisfy the prejudice prong of Strickland; defendant’s account of the events that led to the victim’s death was not corroborated by any of the eyewitnesses, the physical evidence refuted his account that the victim was shot accidentally during a close struggle, and because he was hopelessly guilty, he was not entitled to a new trial on grounds counsel was ineffective. Jones v. State, 911 So. 2d 556, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 231 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 920 So. 2d 1008, 2005 Miss. LEXIS 599 (Miss. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       There was no physical evidence linking defendant to the burglary but the jury was provided with physical evidence connecting his accomplice to the crime. Then, the jury was told that defendant was able to identify his accomplice close to the crime scene when said identification had already been suppressed due to the violation of defendant’s Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights at the time of his arrest (Miranda violation); thus, the identification testimony by the officer was unquestionably prejudicial, the prosecutor’s closing argument further compounded the problem by linking the physical evidence connecting the accomplice to the crime to defendant, and the trial court committed reversible error in denying defendant’s motions for a mistrial and for a new trial. Carpenter v. State, 910 So. 2d 528, 2005 Miss. LEXIS 110 (Miss. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although a few of the questions asked could be considered leading questions, Miss. R. Evid. 611(c), because of the age of the witnesses and the limited manner in which the questions were used, it was doubtful that the trial judge would have disallowed the questions; therefore, defendant would have benefitted little by an objection from counsel. Thus, defendant’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim was denied. Barrett v. State, 886 So. 2d 22, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 484 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 887 So. 2d 183, 2004 Miss.

      </p>
      <p>
       There is a clear line of cases authorizing a trial court in the prosecution of a sexual offense to permit evidence of past sexual crimes of the accused; thus, it was not error to admit evidence of defendant’s past sexual offenses. Therefore, there could be no claim of ineffective assistance of counsel premised on the failure of trial counsel to object. Barrett v. State, 886 So. 2d 22, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 484 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 887 So. 2d 183, 2004 Miss. LEXIS 1371 (Miss. 2004).

   Inmate’s counsel was not ineffective simply because he had not had a lot of death penalty cases and was involved in three death penalty cases at the same time as the inmate failed to show any errors that resulted from either issue that prejudiced him. Bell v. State, 879 So. 2d 423, 2004 Miss. LEXIS 543 (Miss. 2004), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">543 U.S. 1155</cite>, <cite class="s_court">125 S. Ct. 1301</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">161 L.

      </p>
      <p>
       Denial of post-conviction relief was affirmed because the inmate failed to demonstrate that his counsel’s performance was deficient, and considering the totality of the circumstances, the performance of the inmate’s counsel was neither deficient nor prejudicial. In his plea petition, the inmate affirmed that he was satisfied with the advice of his counsel, the inmate’s plea petition clearly stated that the sentencing range for the sale or transfer of cocaine was zero to 30-years, with 60-years for enhanced punishment for a habitual offender, and the inmate made no specific allegations of action or inaction on the part of his counsel that resulted in prejudice to his defense. Falconer v. State, 873 So. 2d 163, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 417 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant was not deprived of his constitutional right to effective representation as defendant failed to show that his attorney’s representation was defective and that the defective performance deprived him of a fair trial. Mayo v. State, 886 So. 2d 734, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 430 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 887 So. 2d 183, 2004 Miss. LEXIS 1383 (Miss. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a robbery and assault case, defendant failed to demonstrate that the outcome of his trial would have been different if counsel had objected to the State’s closing argument tactic, regarding comment on defendant’s failure to testify, as the contention concerning the prosecutor’s summation was without merit and there was compelling eyewitness testimony implicating defendant; therefore, defendant’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim failed. Woods v. State, 883 So. 2d 583, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 371 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Denial of post-conviction relief was proper, because counsel was not ineffective, as petitioner told the judge that his lawyer had explained all the law related to the aggravated assault offense and any possible defenses; petitioner affirmed that the decision to enter a guilty plea was his; and the affidavits offered by petitioner and his mother, which asserted that the attorney would not permit the mother’s joining the discussion between attorney and client, did not prove constitutional deficiency. Tenner v. State, 868 So. 2d 1067, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 221 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant’s aggravated assault conviction was upheld because he was not denied effective assistance of counsel by counsel’s failure to file a motion to dismiss based on speedy trial grounds, because his right to a speedy trial was not violated; therefore, counsel had no basis for filing the motion. Jackson v. State, 864 So. 2d 1047, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 66 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).

   In a case where the inmate was convicted of two counts of uttering a forgery, pursuant to Miss.

Swindle v. State, 881 So. 2d 281, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 1062 (Miss. Ct. App. 2003), rev'd, 881 So. 2d 174, 2004 Miss. LEXIS 713 (Miss. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant produced no evidence to show his attorney’s representation was deficient, or why the substitution of counsel prejudiced him; the substitution of attorneys five days before trial did not result in a denial of effective assistance of counsel, and the jury instruction given was proper; had counsel objected, he would have placed defendant in jeopardy of receiving an enhanced sentence.

       <p>
   Inmate did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel during the guilt phase of the trial or at sentencing because he did not show that counsel’s performance was deficient and he did not show prejudice due to any of the alleged errors in counsel’s performance; thus, defendant’s constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel was not violated. Crawford v. State, 867 So. 2d 196, 2003 Miss. LEXIS 755 (Miss. 2003), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">543 U.S. 866</cite>, <cite class="s_court">125 S. Ct. 205</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">160 L.

   Petitioner’s Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights were not violated when doctors, outside the presence of counsel, performed a psychiatric evaluation to determine his ability to stand trial; the doctors advised the petitioner that anything he said could be used against him during the sentencing phase of trial, and they offered to allow the petitioner to call his attorneys. Wilcher v. State, 863 So. 2d 719, 2003 Miss. LEXIS 526 (Miss. 2003), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">542 U.S. 942</cite>, <cite class="s_court">124 S. Ct. 2917</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">159 L.

   Petitioner failed to show that he was prejudiced in any fashion by his attorney’s decision not to assert a Batson challenge; the Sixth Amendment has never been held to require that petit juries actually chosen must mirror the community and reflect the various distinctive groups in the populations.

      <p>
       In a guilty plea of manslaughter and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, the record lacked any evidence that defendant presented himself as anything but mentally competent and there was no evidence to indicate that defendant’s attorney was on notice of any psychiatric problem or that defendant’s mind was or could be impaired; thus, there was no basis for defendant’s attorney to request a mental evaluation of defendant, he was not incompetent for failing to request a mental evaluation of defendant, and defendant’s motion for post-conviction relief was properly denied.

       The strategy where a defendant tries to introduce evidence, fails, and then testifies in accordance with the trial court’s evidentiary rulings, is neither perjury nor ineffective assistance of counsel. Russell v. State, 849 So. 2d 95, 2003 Miss. LEXIS 297 (Miss. 2003).

       Inmate’s petition for post-conviction relief on grounds that his counsel was ineffective for failing to inform him of his right to a speedy trial was denied, as the record showed he had been advised of his right to a speedy trial, and by his guilty plea had waived his constitutional and statutory rights to a speedy trial.

   Although the circuit court found that the justice court judge denied petitioner the constitutional right to counsel under Miss. Const. Art. 3, § 26 and the U.S. Const. Amend. VI, petitioner clearly had notice of the pending trial, petitioner and petitioner’s attorney were aware that the motion for continuance, which the trial court did not err in denying, had been denied; thus, the justice court judge did not err in proceeding to trial in petitioner’s absence pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.99.html#t99c17s99-17-9" target="_blank">99-17-9</a></cite> and petitioner was not denied the constitutional right to counsel.

       Section 47-5-138 of the Mississippi Code is not rendered unconstitutional by the fact that it contains no provision granting inmates a right to counsel in appealing a revocation of good time credits under the statute as there is no right of counsel for appeals from inmate lawsuits which have been dismissed as frivolous.

       A defendant’s right to have counsel present during interrogation was respected and his confession was admissible, where the defendant was given the opportunity to confer with his attorney who advised him to confess, even though the defendant only conferred with his attorney by telephone; there is no reason on principle why telephonic access to counsel is legally less significant than “eyeball-to-eyeball” access.

       It was basically unfair for the trial court in a prosecution for murder to force defendant to offer his testimony and that of his witnesses to the jury after a fatiguing day in court and at a time when both counsel and jury were exhausted; moreover, due process of law necessitated a forum for defendant to present his case within reasonable hours and under reasonable circumstances.

   Because the record was insufficient to address a Strickland claim, the supreme court denied relief, preserving defendant’s right to raise the issue through a post-conviction-relief petition; although defendant alleged that counsel filed subpoenas with an incorrect appearance date, the record did not contain any filed, returned copies of those subpoenas, and it was not apparent why defendant failed to seek a continuance.

       Trial court did not err in allowing defendant to proceed pro se on a kidnapping charge, and defendant could not allege ineffective assistance of counsel; record contained nothing to suggest that the trial court should have questioned defendant’s claims to have a college degree and to have taken correspondence courses in law from Harvard while defendant was in prison. Brooks v. State, 835 So. 2d 958, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 222 (Miss. Ct. App. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       The trial judge properly allowed the defendant to represent himself while ordering his court-appointed counsel to remain in the courtroom as an advisor where, although the defendant never waived his right to counsel, it was clear that he did not want to proceed with his court-appointed counsel and wanted the trial court to appoint another lawyer to represent him, which would have led to an extensive delay in his trial. Henley v. Mississippi, 729 So. 2d 232, 1998 Miss. LEXIS 588 (Miss. 1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial judge was fully justified in taking defendant’s silence as admissions of his court-appointed attorneys’ statements that defendant refused to have them represent him and wished to represent himself; attorneys’ statements were made in defendant’s presence, defendant had capacity to object or refute statements by attorneys but did not say anything, and defendant refused to answer when judge asked him if he wanted to represent himself. Dunn v. State, 693 So. 2d 1333, 1997 Miss. LEXIS 233 (Miss. 1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       “Hybrid representation” encompasses both participation of defendant in conduct of his trial when he has not effectively waived assistance of attorney to defend him and participation by attorney in conduct of trial when defendant is defending pro se. Dunn v. State, 693 So. 2d 1333, 1997 Miss. LEXIS 233 (Miss. 1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       Role of attorney in situation where defendant has not effectively waived assistance of counsel is that of “co-counsel”, and role of attorney in situation where defendant has effectively waived counsel and is proceeding pro se is that of “standby” or “advisory” counsel; former tends to involve more active role in representation of defendant than latter. Dunn v. State, 693 So. 2d 1333, 1997 Miss. LEXIS 233 (Miss. 1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       Following factors are considered in deciding whether trial judge granted hybrid representation: defendant’s accessibility to counsel; stage of trial at which he requests participatory role in his defense; magnitude of role he desires to assume; whether trial court encourages immediate and constant accessibility of counsel; and nature and extent of assistance of counsel which has been provided up to point of request, including both substantive and procedural aid. Dunn v. State, 693 So. 2d 1333, 1997 Miss. LEXIS 233 (Miss. 1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant who received hybrid representation during trial was not deprived of his right to counsel; court-appointed attorneys were at defendant’s counsel table during entire trial, attorneys’ efforts were met with defendant’s uncooperative attitude and disposition, and attorneys represented defendant vigorously when it became apparent that defendant was content to sit by and do nothing. Dunn v. State, 693 So. 2d 1333, 1997 Miss. LEXIS 233 (Miss. 1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       In determining whether a trial court granted “self-representation” or “hybrid representation” to a defendant, and thus whether a waiver of the right to counsel was necessary, the factors to be considered include: (1) the defendant’s accessibility to counsel; (2) whether and how often the defendant consulted with counsel up to the point of the request; (3) the stage of trial at which the defendant requested a participatory role; (4) the magnitude of the role the defendant desired to assume; (5) whether the trial court encouraged immediate and constant accessibility of counsel; and (6) the nature and extent of assistance of counsel which had been provided up to the point of the request, including both substantive and procedural aid. Metcalf v. State, 629 So. 2d 558, 1993 Miss. LEXIS 563 (Miss. 1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       A criminal defense counsel did not render constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel where the defendant requested during trial that the defense counsel be dismissed but the court denied the request, and thereafter the defendant acted pro se with the attorney present and ready and willing to assist the defendant in the case, and therefore the attorney, as stand-by counsel, was without authority, discretion or control. Estelle v. State, 558 So. 2d 843, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 153 (Miss. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       The trial court did not err in granting the defendant’s motion to act as co-counsel where, at trial, appointed counsel and another attorney were present at the counsel table, made suggestions and offers of advice and assistance, drew instructions, and participated to some extent in the trial of the case. Richardson v. State, 402 So. 2d 848, 1981 Miss. LEXIS 2148 (Miss. 1981).

      <p>
       <p>
   When defendant waived his right to counsel and elected to proceed pro se but where the trial court appointed counsel to assist him during trial, the hybrid representation that defendant received during trial provided him with effective assistance because it was clear from the record that the two attorneys were not casual observers where they conducted voir dire, handled jury challenges, made numerous objections throughout trial, conducted cross-examination of witnesses, conducted the direct examination of witnesses, made a motion for a directed verdict, presented the closing argument in the guilty phase, represented defendant at sentencing, made the opening statement on behalf of defendant in the sentencing phase, conducted the examination of witnesses during the sentencing phase, and filed a motion for a new trial.

       Defendant’s counsel was not ineffective during plea proceedings where the trial judge and defense counsel went to great lengths to lead defendant through the plea process and made sure that defendant’s guilty plea to the sale of cocaine was intelligent and voluntary; defendant testified under oath, during the guilty plea, that defendant was satisfied with counsel’s representation.

       A probationer was not deprived of the right to counsel at his probation revocation hearings in violation of his constitutional rights where the circuit court did not actually “disallow” the probationer to have legal representation but merely refused to continue the hearing in response to his belated request for more time to obtain counsel, the case was not “complex or otherwise difficult to develop,” and counsel was provided upon the probationer’s request prior to the fourth hearing before the circuit court and prior to his appeal to the Supreme Court.

       Confronting a suspect with the incriminating evidence compiled against him after he has invoked his right to counsel, and without any initiation on the part of the suspect, is precisely the kind of psychological ploy that definition of interrogation in Innis was designed to prohibit.

      <p>
       Defendant’s right to counsel was violated by police-initiated interrogation after he asserted his right to counsel because an officer showed defendant the evidence file in an attempt to have him reconsider his request for counsel; a tactic that proved successful as defendant was not prompted to speak until he reviewed the evidence. Because the actions of the officer constituted police-initiated custodial interrogation, a valid waiver could not be established simply by showing that defendant responded to the interrogation.

       Defendant’s capital murder convictions were proper where his Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights to counsel and to remain silent were not violated. He made no objection at trial; there was no testimony concerning defendant’s use of counsel or his right to remain silent; and the State’s questioning was designed solely to elicit a chronological version of the events involved in the investigation of the murders not the fact that the defendant requested an attorney during the State’s investigation.

       A murder defendant’s initial refusal to sign a waiver of rights form did not constitute a demand for an attorney where he was not questioned again until more than 32 hours had lapsed when he was presented with incriminating physical evidence connecting him to the crime, and he was again advised of his rights before further questioning; thus, admission of his confession into evidence did not violate his constitutional right against compulsory self-incrimination or right to an attorney.

       An accused invoked her Fifth Amendment right to counsel at the time of her arrest when she asked for an attorney and stated that she was not going to sign any papers or answer any questions without having a lawyer present; the accused invoked her Sixth Amendment right to counsel and the state counterpart right secured by Article 3, § 26 of the Mississippi Constitution at her initial appearance when she indicated a desire for representation and an interest in contacting her family to ascertain their progress in hiring a lawyer for her.

      </p>
      <p>
       A defendant’s question during interrogation–“Don’t you think I need a lawyer?”–constituted an ambiguous request for an attorney, requiring the officers to cease interrogation except for that intended to clarify the defendant’s request. The officers’ response to the defendant’s ambiguous request, which culminated in the defendant’s decision to waive his rights, did not exceed constitutional parameters where the officers responded by twice explaining the defendant’s option to exercise his Miranda rights or to relate “his side of the story.” Holland v.

       A defendant’s Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and Sixth Amendment right to counsel were not violated by the admission of his confession into evidence, even though the confession was obtained after the defendant initially refused to sign a waiver of rights form and had stated that he would not sign anything until he talked to his mental health counselor. The defendant’s refusal to sign the waiver of rights form was not a per se invocation of his Fifth Amendment rights. Additionally, the defendant’s request for a mental health counselor was not a per se invocation of his Fifth Amendment rights; a request for someone other than an attorney does not invoke a defendant’s Fifth Amendment rights, and a mental health counselor is not qualified to protect a defendant’s Fifth Amendment rights. Similarly, neither the defendant’s request to speak to his mental health counselor nor his temporary refusal to sign the waiver form constituted a request for counsel so as to invoke his Sixth Amendment right. Mohr v. State, 584 So. 2d 426, 1991 Miss. LEXIS 481 (Miss. 1991).

       A trial court’s admission of a defendant’s confession into evidence violated the defendant’s Fifth and Fourth Amendment rights where the defendant had invoked her right to counsel and 2 officers subsequently told her that a codefendant had made a statement implicating her in their criminal activity, after which the defendant wrote a statement admitting to the crimes. The admission of the confession in violation of the defendant’s constitutional rights was not harmless error where the confession in question was the only confession available. Balfour v.

   When a suspect requests counsel while being informed of his or her rights, the police should complete the reading of the suspect’s rights, then ask the suspect to state clearly what he or she elects to do. If the suspect indicates that he or she wishes to remain silent, then the interrogation must cease. Berry v. State, 575 So. 2d 1, 1990 Miss.

       Admission of written statement into evidence violated defendant’s constitutional rights where, after Miranda rights were read, father of defendant informed police that attorney was desired and that no statement would be made until one was present. After this right had been invoked, officer continued questioning at which point defendant gave oral statement, which was reduced to writing following day. Prosecution could not show that defendant understood and waived his rights where officer stated that Miranda rights were read to him and defendant was asked if he understood it, to which he replied “yes”, but rights were not discussed with defendant. Impermissible questioning which occurred in police station after defendant had invoked right to counsel bears on admissibility of written statement which was obtained following morning. Reuben v.

   Circuit Court did not deprive defendant of opportunity to secure his own counsel in pre-trial proceedings where court appointed counsel advised court he had conferred with defendant through interpreter and been informed defendant’s family would hire attorney; although arraignment on same date was premature and should have been deferred, no prejudice occurred because plea of not guilty was entered, and even if it was not settled on that date that court appointed counsel would remain defendant’s attorney, this arrangement did later become final. During 3 week lapse between time of defendant’s arraignment and beginning of trial, no further mention of another attorney was made; first mention of another attorney only came following verdict in guilt phase of trial.

   The Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments require only that no indigent criminal defendant be sentenced to a term of imprisonment unless the state has afforded him the right to assistance of appointed counsel in his defense, and thus, the constitutional rights of an indigent defendant (charged with an offense for which imprisonment, fine, or both, is authorized upon conviction) are not violated when the defendant, after being tried in state court without appointed counsel, is fined rather than imprisoned upon being convicted.

       Where a court desires to preserve its discretion to impose a jail sentence as a direct result of a conviction of an indigent misdemeanant under an alternative sentencing statute, the court must make a decision before the accused formally pleads and, in the absence of a valid waiver, appoint counsel to represent the indigent; If a court decides that only a fine will be imposed in the event of conviction, the court need not appoint counsel for the indigent, and the court’s decision as to this matter should be dictated into the record or otherwise preserved for appellate purposes; There will be no violation of the indigent’s sixth amendment right to counsel if such a fine is later converted into a jail sentence because of the defendant’s failure to pay the fine after reasonable measures designed to aid payment prove unsuccessful.

       Once an accused has asserted the Sixth Amendment right to counsel at arraignment or a similar proceeding, the police may not initiate interrogation; if the police initiate interrogation after the right has been asserted, any waiver by the defendant for that interrogation is invalid. Balfour v. State, 598 So. 2d 731, 1992 Miss. LEXIS 131 (Miss. 1992).

       A trial court erred in admitting a defendant’s confession evidence since the confession was tainted by the constitutional violation of the defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to counsel and rights secured by Article 3, § 26 of the Mississippi Constitution, where the defendant “waived her rights” and made the confession after a sheriff department investigator and deputy initiated contact with her within less than 4 hours after she invoked the right to counsel at her initial appearance; the confession was also tainted by violation of the defendant’s Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment rights since the defendant had also requested a lawyer and declined to waive any rights at the time of her arrest. Balfour v. State, 598 So. 2d 731, 1992 Miss. LEXIS 131 (Miss. 1992).

       Once an accused has requested an attorney, it is improper for either the same or another law enforcement officer to question the accused about his or her criminal conduct. If the accused indicates in any manner at any time prior to or during questioning that he or she wishes to remain silent or to have access to counsel, the officers must cease interrogation. When the accused asks for counsel, the officers may not resume interrogation until counsel has been provided, except where the accused voluntarily reinitiates the discussion of the charges. If the accused requests access to counsel, all officers of the prosecution force are bound thereby, including those who have no actual knowledge of the request. Kirkland v. State, 559 So. 2d 1046, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 200 (Miss. 1990).

       A defendant’s confession should not have been admitted into evidence where the confession was obtained by law enforcement officers after the defendant made a request for an attorney to the justice court judge who was considering binding him over to await the action of the grand jury, and one of the officers heard the defendant’s request. Although the defendant may only have meant that he wanted a lawyer for court proceedings and did not want a lawyer to advise him before being questioned about the crime, the officers did not seek to make such a determination, but simply proceeded to question the defendant, knowing that he was a cocaine addict and to some extent, because of such addiction, judgment-impaired at the time. No intelligent, knowing waiver of the right to counsel, which the defendant had expressed to the justice court judge, could be found from an officer testifying that he simply orally gave the defendant the Miranda warning. Kirkland v. State, 559 So. 2d 1046, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 200 (Miss. 1990).

   A police officer’s initiation of an interview with a murder suspect did not violate the suspect’s constitutional right to counsel, even though the suspect had invoked his right to counsel several days earlier during the course of an interview with FBI agents, he had been provided with counsel who had advised him not to speak to anyone, and he did not sign a waiver of rights form before speaking with the police officer, where the officer warned the suspect that he need not speak to him in the absence of counsel, and the suspect did not tell the officer that he wished to have a lawyer present before speaking to him.

       A defendant’s verbal statement, which was given after the defendant asserted his right to counsel, should have been suppressed even though the defendant signed a statement waiving his constitutional rights, including the right to counsel “at this time,” where the defendant invoked his right to counsel after signing the statement, and counsel was not furnished.

       Notwithstanding defendant’s claim that his request to consult an attorney had been refused, there was no error in admitting his written statement into evidence where the defendant, as well as 2 police officers attending the interrogation when the statement was given, testified that it was freely and voluntarily given, and the officers testified that there was strict adherence to the Miranda warnings.

       Defendant’s right to a speedy trial was not violated because although the total delay in the case was lengthy, the majority of the delay was justified by good cause or was attributable to defendant’s actions; the State’s efforts to retry defendant within two months after the reversal of his conviction were more than reasonable, and defendant, not the State requested a continuance to obtain a copy of the transcript from the first trial.

       Criminal defendant’s incriminating statement had to be suppressed as his right to counsel was violated when he was interrogated by a detective without his counsel present after the detective had informed defendant’s counsel that the detective would not be questioning defendant as State had not established that defendant had validly waived his right to counsel.

       The defendant was entitled to suppression of a statement given to the police where (1) an attorney was represented to appoint the defendant at his initial appearance and bond was set, (2) later the same day, the attorney passed a detective and the defendant while in the hallway of the police department, the attorney asked the detective if he was going to question the defendant, and the detective responded, “no,” and (3) the detective then questioned the defendant and obtained a statement from him.

       If a defendant has not asserted his or her Fifth Amendment right to counsel, the fact that the defendant is appointed counsel to protect his or her Sixth Amendment right does not preclude interrogation on unrelated offenses.

   Federal and state murder prosecutions of the defendant, although identical in their respective elements, were separate offenses for purposes of the Sixth Amendment because they were violations of the laws of two separate sovereigns, i.e., the State of Mississippi and the United States, and, therefore, because the Sixth Amendment is offense-specific, the defendant’s statements during an interview with federal officers were not barred in his federal prosecution, even though they were made when he was represented by counsel in the state proceeding. United States v. Avants, 278 F.3d 510, 2002 U.S. App. LEXIS 190 (5th Cir. Miss.), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">536 U.S. 968</cite>, <cite class="s_court">122 S.

   Defendant’s conviction for capital murder was proper where he was not denied his right to counsel because, at the time of his confession, he was merely a suspect who had been brought to the sheriff’s department for questioning and thus, his U.S. Const. Amend. VI right to counsel had not yet attached. Further, as his confession occurred during a custodial interrogation, he had a U.S. Const. Amends. V and XIV right to have counsel present, but the lower court found the testimony of the officers that defendant had not invoked his right to counsel more credible than defendant’s assertion that he had done so.

       A defendant was not denied effective assistance of counsel because he was not represented by counsel for approximately 2 months following his arraignment where he made no showing that he experienced any adverse effect or “untoward consequence flowing directly from denial of counsel” and there was no indication that the State took advantage of the situation or that any further proceedings were conducted.

      <p>
       The failure to provide a defendant with an initial appearance until five days after his arrest even though a judge was available at all times constituted reversible error where the defendant gave a confession in the absence of counsel and in violation of his right to counsel as a consequence of the delay, and the defendant’s conviction for capital murder was based entirely on his confession.

Brooks v. State, 905 So. 2d 678, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 616 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004), rev'd, 903 So. 2d 691, 2005 Miss. LEXIS 191 (Miss. 2005).

       Defense counsel’s failure to file a witness list until the morning of trial, which resulted in the trial court excluding defendant’s alibi witnesses, in defendant’s trial for strong-arm robbery, did not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel because defendant was not prejudiced by counsel’s negligence; both the victim and her boss had gotten a good look at defendant during the incident, the victim had picked defendant out of a photo line-up, and both were able to identify defendant at trial; the outcome of the trial would not have been different even if defendant’s girlfriend and his family members had been allowed to support defendant’s alibi. Ransom v. State, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 459 (Miss. Ct. App. May 20, 2003), op. withdrawn, sub. op., 918 So. 2d 710, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 972 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).

       Only an actual confrontation with the defendant at a lineup is the critical stage which requires the right to counsel. Thus, the presence of counsel was not required at a post-lineup encounter between the witness and the police, at which the defendant was not present, since there was no “actual confrontation” between the defendant and the witness. Wilson v. State, 574 So. 2d 1324, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 845 (Miss. 1990).
      </p>

       A photographic lineup is not a “critical stage” of criminal proceedings and, therefore, an accused enjoys no right to counsel in connection with a photographic lineup. Magee v. State, 542 So. 2d 228, 1989 Miss. LEXIS 179 (Miss. 1989).
      </p>
      <p>
       The violation of a defendant’s right to counsel at his lineup was harmless constitutional error beyond a reasonable doubt where the witness did not identify the defendant at the lineup and the witness’ in-court identification testimony was not impermissibly tainted by anything that occurred at the lineup. Magee v. State, 542 So. 2d 228, 1989 Miss. LEXIS 179 (Miss. 1989).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the denial of the defendant’s right to counsel at a line up was a technical violation of his constitutional right to counsel, it was “harmless constitutional error” where the witnesses’ identification of the defendant was based on their view of the defendant at the time of the crime rather than on the line up identification and there was other overwhelming evidence favoring conviction. Jimpson v. State, 532 So. 2d 985, 1988 Miss. LEXIS 428 (Miss. 1988).

       A voice “lineup” closely resembles the trial-like confrontation of a corporeal lineup and amounts to a critical stage of criminal proceedings for which counsel should be present. Nicholson v. State, 523 So. 2d 68, 1988 Miss. LEXIS 73 (Miss. 1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       Prosecution had commenced and, therefore, the defendant’s constitutional right to counsel had attached at the time of a line up where an arrest warrant had issued and the defendant was in custody. Livingston v. State, 519 So. 2d 1218, 1988 Miss. LEXIS 47 (Miss. 1988).

      <p>
       Defendant failed to show that defendant received ineffective assistance of counsel during a guilty plea proceeding because counsel did not coerce defendant into pleading guilty, but simply informed defendant of the likely outcome of the case, believing it would be in defendant’s best interest to enter a guilty plea. Defendant, at 55 years old, was charged with four counts of fondling a child; each count carried a maximum penalty of fifteen years in prison. Mayhan v. State, 26 So.3d 1072, 2009 Miss. App. LEXIS 327 (Miss. Ct. App. 2009), cert. denied, 27 So.3d 404, 2010 Miss. LEXIS 58 (Miss. 2010).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant’s claim that his attorney rendered ineffective assistance of counsel because he led defendant to believe that he would be placed in the drug court program was without merit as during his guilty plea hearing, defendant swore that his lawyer had not promised him anything to get him to plead guilty and defendant swore that he was satisfied with the services of his attorney. Bliss v. State, 2 So.3d 777, 2009 Miss. App. LEXIS 60 (Miss. Ct. App. 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel where in the petition to enter his guilty plea, defendant clearly acknowledged that his sentence was up to the court and that he could receive zero to ninety years imprisonment; defendant indicated his satisfaction with his attorney’s advice and recognized that if he had been told by his lawyer that he might receive a lighter sentence this was merely a prediction and not binding on the court. Davis v. State, 5 So.3d 435, 2008 Miss. App. LEXIS 366 (Miss. Ct. App. 2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant did not demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel where his guilty plea admitted all elements of a formal charge and operated as a waiver of all non-jurisdictional defects contained in an indictment; defendant was unable to name any witnesses that should have been interviewed and his attorney advised him of the maximum and minimum sentence. Nichols v. State, 994 So. 2d 236, 2008 Miss. App. LEXIS 310 (Miss. Ct. App. 2008).
      </p>

       Trial counsel was not deficient in failing to inform defendant that he could have been charged with carjacking when neither defendant nor his trial counsel had any choice in the matter. Keith v. State, 999 So. 2d 383, 2008 Miss. App. LEXIS 313 (Miss. Ct. App. 2008), cert. denied, 999 So. 2d 852, 2009 Miss. LEXIS 52 (Miss. 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant’s trial counsel was not inefficient where defendant neither professed his innocence, nor called attention to the impairment of any defense as a result of not being informed of his ineligibility for parole; trial counsel informed defendant that a conviction for armed robbery carried with it ineligibility for parole. Keith v. State, 999 So. 2d 383, 2008 Miss. App. LEXIS 313 (Miss. Ct. App. 2008), cert. denied, 999 So. 2d 852, 2009 Miss. LEXIS 52 (Miss. 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       Denial of the inmate’s motion for postconviction relief was proper in part because he failed to show the ineffective assistance of counsel, as there was no proof that his attorney did not explain the charges to him; to the contrary, the inmate twice swore under oath that his attorney explained the charges to him and that he understood them. Knight v. State, 959 So. 2d 598, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 444 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 964 So. 2d 508, 2007 Miss. LEXIS 538 (Miss. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant raised a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel which required a full evidentiary hearing where there was evidence that the victim’s girlfriend poured boiling water on him, along with defendant’s testimony that someone else committed this act, which was enough to raise a reasonable doubt that defendant committed the offense; this evidence may have changed the outcome had the parties gone forward. Hannah v. State, 943 So. 2d 20, 2006 Miss. LEXIS 578 (Miss. 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Any advice by counsel that defendant would be eligible for parole was incorrect and constituted deficient performance, and having shown deficient performance, defendant had to prove that he would not have pled guilty but for the incorrect advice; if his attorney improperly advised him of his eligibility for parole, defendant was entitled to a hearing to investigate his claim that he would not have pled guilty but for the incorrect advice. Garner v. State, 928 So. 2d 911, 2006 Miss. App. LEXIS 119 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 929 So. 2d 923, 2006 Miss.

      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant did not carry his burden of proving that ineffective assistance of counsel led him to plead guilty to armed robbery when he otherwise would have asserted his innocence where defendant, in open court, had responded during his plea allocution that he was satisfied with the legal advice and services of his attorney. At no point in his plea of guilty and sentencing did defendant assert his innocence. Vandergriff v. State, 920 So. 2d 486, 2006 Miss. App. LEXIS 50 (Miss. Ct. App. 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       Appellate court affirmed the denial of the inmate’s petition; the inmate was unable to show that but for the ineffective assistance of counsel he would not have pled guilty because the inmate stated that he was pleased with his counsel’s representation at the plea hearing. Further, the inmate’s counsel had the armed robbery charge reduced to simple robbery. Ivy v. State, 918 So. 2d 84, 2006 Miss. App. LEXIS 10 (Miss. Ct. App. 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       Inmate failed to establish his claims that he was deprived of effective assistance of counsel because he was persuaded to plead guilty, and that his guilty plea was involuntary and was entered after being ill advised by his counsel, as his counsel was obligated to advise him that the potential consequences of trial and conviction of both counts could be a maximum of 120 years imprisonment, and the inmate acknowledged that he had been informed that a guilty plea would waive his right to a public and speedy trial by jury, his right to confront adverse witnesses, and his right to protection against self incrimination. Epps v. State, 926 So. 2d 242, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 991 (Miss. Ct. App. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Appellate court affirmed the denial of an inmate’s motion for post-conviction relief as the inmate did not establish that he was deprived of effective assistance of counsel during his plea hearing, because his mother and his sister testified that the inmate’s attorney had told him that he would be pleading guilty to simple assault and would be sentenced to time served, and that testimony directly contradicted the inmate’s testimony at the actual plea hearing where he acknowledged that he was pleading guilty to aggravated assault. Riggs v. State, 912 So. 2d 162, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 712 (Miss. Ct. App. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       To the extent that the inmate’s trial counsel erroneously advised the inmate that he would be eligible for parole after 10 years, the advice was incorrect and the counsel’s performance was deficient; thus, the inmate was entitled to an evidentiary hearing to determine if he would have pled differently had the correct advice about parole been given. Garner v. State, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 695 (Miss. Ct. App. Sept. 27, 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Denial of an inmate’s motion for post-conviction relief was affirmed as the inmate’s claim that his guilty plea was not knowing and voluntary due to his counsel’s alleged deficient performance was contradicted by the inmate’s statements at the plea hearing that he understood the consequences of his plea and was satisfied with his counsel’s performance. Gonzales v. State, 915 So. 2d 1108, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 1001 (Miss. Ct. App. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Appellate court affirmed the denial of an inmate’s motion for post-conviction relief as the inmate provided nothing more than his own affidavit to establish that he was deprived of effective assistance of counsel and did not allege that had it not been for his counsel’s alleged ineffectiveness that he would not have pled guilty. Covington v. State, 909 So. 2d 160, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 582 (Miss. Ct. App. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant’s motion for post-conviction relief was properly denied because defendant’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel concerning defendant’s guilty pleas was without merit as the record showed that defendant expressed satisfaction with his guilty plea and his attorney’s performance. Further, defendant stated at the plea hearing that he understood the sentencing recommendation to which he subsequently objected. Sykes v. State, 909 So. 2d 120, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 546 (Miss. Ct. App. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant was not prejudiced after defense counsel was excused from the courtroom during a plea proceeding where the only issue raised after counsel’s departure was the trial judge’s decision to retain jurisdiction over the case. In any event, defendant was represented by another attorney at that time with whom he was familiar. McBride v. State, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 314 (Miss. Ct. App. May 10, 2005), op. withdrawn, sub. op., 914 So. 2d 260, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 524 (Miss. Ct. App. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Record clearly demonstrated that defendant was informed that should he plead guilty to the crime, his plea of guilty would act as a waiver to a direct appeal to the Mississippi Supreme Court pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.99.html#t99c35s99-35-101" target="_blank">99-35-101</a></cite>. Further, it could not be said that counsel’s brief moment of confusion regarding which charges the State would pursue, rose to the level of ineffective assistance of counsel and the record clearly indicated that the trial judge explained to defendant the terms of the plea agreement; thus, defendant was not denied either due process or effective assistance of counsel. Sykes v. State, 895 So. 2d 191, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 150 (Miss. Ct. App. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant argued that his counsel was deficient for failing to inform him of the elements of burglary and escape; however, defendant told the judge he understood the charges and sentences available and, as a result, he pleaded guilty with full knowledge. In a post-conviction relief proceeding, the elements of the claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must be pleaded with specificity, which defendant failed to do. Gaddis v. State, 904 So. 2d 1197, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 1028 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Post-conviction relief was properly denied in a D.U.I. case because the driver’s counsel was not ineffective, as counsel properly informed him that if he did not accept the offered plea bargain, the State would charge him as an habitual offender, and the driver’s claim that he could not have been charged as a habitual offender, based on his contention that at least one of his prior offenses had occurred before the habitual offender statute went into effect, was clearly wrong. Lawson v. State, 882 So. 2d 783, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 922 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant never told the trial judge in his post-conviction relief motion what additional discovery materials would have disclosed nor how such material would have affected his decision to plead guilty, such that he did not demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel that would have led to a different result; even taking defendant’s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel as true, he did not show that the performance of his trial counsel caused him to plead guilty or was in any other manner deficient. Chandler v. State, 883 So. 2d 614, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 944 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>

   As an inmate had two prior felony convictions, one of which was for aggravated assault, he could have been indicted as an habitual offender under to Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.99.html#t99c19s99-19-83" target="_blank">99-19-83</a></cite>; therefore, his counsel did not provide ineffective assistance by warning him that this would occur unless he pled guilty. Hearvey v. State, 887 So. 2d 836, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 926 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Inmate was not deprived of effective assistance of counsel prior to pleading guilty; the appellate court noted that at the inmate’s hearing he admitted to committing the crimes, admitted that he was voluntarily entering his plea, and that his attorneys had properly advised him concerning his constitutional rights and the consequences of pleading guilty. Farris v. State, 881 So. 2d 392, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 876 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because neither the plea transcript nor any other evidence showed that defendant had ever received correct information about his parole eligibility, he successfully alleged that he had received ineffective assistance of counsel due to his attorney’s incorrect advice about his parole eligibility and he was entitled to an evidentiary hearing to explore the merits of his claim. Thomas v. State, 881 So. 2d 912, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 504 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Appellant was properly denied post-conviction relief, because, regardless of a procedural bar, it was clear from the record of the plea colloquy that appellant was informed of the consequences of a guilty plea; thus, appellant’s claim that counsel was ineffective for failing to inform appellant of the consequences of a guilty plea was without merit. Williams v. State, 872 So. 2d 711, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 400 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Appellant was properly denied post-conviction relief, because appellant’s guilty plea, statements he made during the plea hearing, and his attorney’s signed certificate demonstrated that there had been effective assistance of counsel.

      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant offered no evidence to support his contention that his lawyer had given him bad advice in advising him to plead guilty to support his ineffective assistance claim; when asked at his guilty plea hearing whether he was satisfied with the advice and help given by his attorney, defendant responded affirmatively. Wofford v. State, 875 So. 2d 251, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 302 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Appellate court found no indication that defendant’s attorney had performed in a deficient manner where defendant told the judge he was guilty of manslaughter, affirmed that his attorney had explained everything in his petition to plead guilty and that he understood everything in the petition; there was no evidence that defendant’s attorney performed in a deficient manner or that any supposed deficiency in any way prejudiced defendant. Thomas v. State, 861 So. 2d 371, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 1188 (Miss. Ct. App. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       Valid guilty plea operated as a waiver of all non-jurisdictional rights or defects that were incident to trial; defendant was fully advised of his rights and the maximum sentences he faced if he chose to go to trial, and he was provided a detailed admonishment prior to accepting his guilty plea, such that defendant’s plea was made knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily and he waived any rights regarding the allegedly coerced confession. Swindoll v. State, 859 So. 2d 1063, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 1071 (Miss. Ct. App. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because defendant’s guilty plea petition failed to mention any deficient performance by his counsel and defendant represented that he was satisfied with counsel’s representation, he did not receive ineffective assistance. Swindoll v. State, 859 So. 2d 1063, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 1071 (Miss. Ct. App. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       Inmate entered his guilty plea in a manner that was knowing, voluntary, and intelligent, and he testified that no one made any promises, coerced, or induced him into pleading guilty; the record of the hearing belied the inmate’s claims that counsel was ineffective for allegedly misleading him and coercing him into pleading guilty. Glass v. State, 856 So. 2d 762, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 944 (Miss. Ct. App. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence was insufficient to establish ineffective assistance of counsel in connection with the defendant’s guilty plea where the trial court engaged in a lengthy course of inquiry with the defendant as to his understanding of the difference between a plea of guilty and not guilty and that, if he elected to plead guilty, the choice was solely his, and where the defendant merely alleged that his attorneys were insufficiently vigorous in their efforts to persuade him to submit to a trial. Magee v. State, 752 So. 2d 1100, 1999 Miss. App. LEXIS 661 (Miss. Ct. App. 1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       The defendant was not denied effective assistance of counsel in connection with his guilty plea, notwithstanding the assertion by the defendant that counsel informed him that he had an agreement with the Department of Corrections and would only serve two and one-half years as a result of his guilty plea, where the defendant was apprised of his rights and the possible consequences of his guilty plea, defense counsel’s associated, local counsel informed the defendant prior to his plea that he would receive a sentence of 20 years if he entered a plea of guilty, and the trial judge informed the defendant that the district in which he was pleading did not negotiate plea bargains and that the maximum sentence that might be imposed was 20 years. Martin v. State, 749 So. 2d 375, 1999 Miss. App. LEXIS 601 (Miss. Ct. App. 1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       Attorney provided ineffective assistance of counsel where he persuaded defendant to plead guilty to the charges with the collateral intention of covering up the fact that counsel was unprepared for trial, failed to check into defendant’s alibi defense, and defendant was unable to read the statements contained in the petition to enter a guilty plea stating that defendant was satisfied with the legal advice given him, which statements were read to him by his counsel, with no other witnesses present. Kirksey v. State, 728 So. 2d 565, 1999 Miss. LEXIS 8 (Miss. 1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defense counsel was not ineffective where (1) he negotiated a plea bargain, but the defendant failed to accept it by the deadline and, thus, the agreement lapsed, (2) he then relayed the defendant’s desire to enter a guilty plea to the court when instructed to do so by the defendant, and (3) he explained the constitutional rights waived and consequences of pleading guilty.

       test for determining whether defense counsel was ineffective applies to challenges to guilty pleas based on ineffective assistance of counsel. Walker v. State, 703 So. 2d 266, 1997 Miss. LEXIS 634 (Miss. 1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant failed to establish that his counsel’s failure to advise him, prior to his entry of guilty plea, of mandatory minimum sentence constituted ineffective assistance of counsel; defendant’s plea bargain added only concurrent sentence and dropped four pending criminal charges, defendant had answered affirmatively at plea hearing to question regarding whether he was satisfied with legal services and advice of his counsel, and defendant’s counsel stated in affidavit that defendant had known of legal consequences of plea and that defendant had agreed plea was best course of action. Ashby v. State, 695 So. 2d 589, 1997 Miss. LEXIS 243 (Miss. 1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       Counsel was not ineffective in advising defendant to plead guilty to charge of felony driving under the influence (DUI); counsel, along with district attorney, explained charges contained in indictment and possible sentencing range, and defendant was not prejudiced by counsel’s failure to advise him of typographical error in indictment. Drennan v. State, 695 So. 2d 581, 1997 Miss. LEXIS 244 (Miss. 1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       In addition to determining that defendant who seeks to plead guilty or waive right to counsel is competent, trial court must satisfy itself that waiver of his constitutional rights is knowing and voluntary. Dunn v. State, 693 So. 2d 1333, 1997 Miss. LEXIS 233 (Miss. 1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant who pled guilty to capital murder in order to avoid trial that would have subjected him to possible death sentence failed to show he was prejudiced, as required to support ineffective assistance of counsel claim; only thing that might have been different had case gone to trial was sentence defendant received.

       Allegations by defendant who had pleaded guilty to charge of capital murder in order to avoid death penalty that sentences received by his accomplices were substantially less than his were insufficient to state claim of ineffective assistance of counsel; record indicated that accomplices, with one exception, were not given extremely reduced sentences as compared to defendant, and prosecutor stated that accomplice who received substantially reduced sentence had been involved in murder to lesser extent than others. Simpson v. State, 678 So. 2d 712, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 413 (Miss. 1996).

       Defendant did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel in entering guilty plea to 2 counts of armed robbery, where counsel gave defendant accurate information about consequences of being found guilty after trial, defendant swore under oath that plea was voluntary, trial court questioned defendant as to voluntariness of plea prior to plea hearing, and defendant had prior experience in dealing with felony charges and was familiar with court proceedings.

       A murder defendant was not denied effective assistance of counsel by his attorney’s admission of his guilt of the crime where the evidence of guilt was overwhelming, and the attorney admitted that the defendant was guilty of simple murder, not capital murder, and submitted a lesser-included offense instruction in accordance with the argument.

       A defendant who, in reliance upon his counsel’s advice that he could receive the death penalty at a second trial, following upon a first trial conviction and life sentence for murder, entered a guilty plea prior to such second trial and was sentenced to life imprisonment, could not withdraw his guilty plea on the grounds that it was entered as a result of ineffective assistance of counsel, where, at the time given, counsel’s advice was correct, and became incorrect only several years later when the United States Supreme Court and the Mississippi Supreme Court ruled that the double jeopardy clause of the state and federal constitutions precluded imposition of the death penalty when defendant had previously been sentenced to life imprisonment for the same crime.

       Inmate failed to show that trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective for failing to present evidence related to the inmate’s mental state, as trial counsel subjected the inmate to extensive testing, two of whom concluded that the inmate was competent and not legally insane that he had malingered his memory deficits Crawford v. State, 218 So.3d 1142, 2016 Miss. LEXIS 305 (Miss. 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Despite that defendant’s competency evaluation was conducted in violation of his constitutional right to counsel due to a conflict between defendant and his counsel, any error was harmless because defendant was not prejudiced by the evaluation and he failed to show that his counsel’s personal conflict adversely affected his representation of defendant. Crawford v. State, 192 So.3d 905, 2015 Miss. LEXIS 445 (Miss. 2015), cert. denied, — U.S. —, <cite class="s_court">136 S. Ct. 2527</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">195 L.

       <p>
   Defense counsel was not ineffective in withdrawing his request for a mental evaluation of defendant after he could find no independent information suggesting that defendant was ever found to be in need of psychiatric or psychological care and no indication that defendant would not be competent to stand trial or that he had been legally insane at the time of the offense. Counsel was not deficient because he was intimately familiar with defendant, his family, and his background and because he conducted his own investigation and, after consulting with defendant, withdrew his request for a mental evaluation as originally filed and asked that an evaluation be conducted for purposes of securing mitigating evidence for use during the penalty phase of defendant’s capital murder trial. Goff v. State, 14 So.3d 625, 2009 Miss. LEXIS 273 (Miss. 2009), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">559 U.S. 944</cite>, <cite class="s_court">130 S. Ct. 1513</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">176 L.

      </p>
      <p>
       Denial of the inmate’s motion for post-conviction relief was appropriate because his counsel was not ineffective; his counsel had filed for the inmate to undergo a mental examination and counsel further took the inmate’s mental condition into consideration when asking for a lenient sentence.

   In an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, certainly the decision to introduce the 1985 diagnosis could be considered a reasonable strategic decision made by trial counsel inasmuch as had the evaluation been introduced, the State would have rebutted with the 2002 evaluation which found that defendant was not mentally retarded. Also, because defendant’s claim for protection under the prohibition against executing mentally retarded individuals failed, the claim of ineffective assistance of counsel based upon the failure to introduce the 1985 evaluation had to also fail. Branch v. State, 882 So. 2d 36, 2004 Miss. LEXIS 586 (Miss. 2004), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">544 U.S. 907</cite>, <cite class="s_court">125 S. Ct. 1595</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">161 L.

      <p>
       <p>
   In defendant’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim that counsel was deficient in failing to introduce evidence of mental health mitigation and the 1985 evaluation finding him mildly mental retarded, trial counsel made a strategic, tactical decision not to introduce the 1985 evaluation as that evidence was contradicted by the 2002 evaluation, which presented a strong case that defendant was not mentally retarded, evidenced that defendant was untruthful in his trial testimony, and affirmatively showed that defendant’s confession was not coerced. Thus, defense counsel was not ineffective. Branch v. State, 882 So. 2d 36, 2004 Miss. LEXIS 586 (Miss. 2004), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">544 U.S. 907</cite>, <cite class="s_court">125 S.

       The defendant was entitled to present the issue to the trial court of whether his trial counsel was ineffective in failing to seek other expert assistance when a state hospital mental examination produced no report, and whether such inaction resulted in any prejudice to his case at sentencing.

   The Sixth Amendment was not violated when a court-appointed physician testified on rebuttal during the sentencing phase of the defendant’s murder prosecution, notwithstanding that the physician gleaned information about the defendant by observing his competency hearing and that defense counsel did not have notice that such would occur, since the defense was on notice that the physician would be called in rebuttal if the defendant called his own expert to testify.

   Rebuttal testimony of psychologist and psychiatrist appointed at state’s request was not based on evidence obtained in violation of Sixth Amendment, where testimony did not result from examination beyond scope of court’s order, defense counsel was aware of psychological examination and prepared defendant for it, defense counsel decided not to be present, doctors warned defendant of his rights, and defendant exercised those rights by refusing to answer some questions during the examination.

R. 8.05 where the record was clear that even after the circuit court apprised defendant of his rights, he refused to participate in his trial. Defendant purposefully intended to use his absolute right to counsel to avoid going to trial, a course of action that the Alabama Supreme Court specifically proscribed; additionally, defendant’s waiver was knowing and voluntary since he was fully aware of the rights that he would be jeopardizing by proceeding without counsel.

       Regardless of whether defendant made an official waiver of appellate counsel on the record, he clearly asked that his appellate counsel be withdrawn, knowing that the result of that decision was that he would have to hire counsel himself or proceed pro se.

   While the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution guaranteed defendant a right to the assistance of counsel, defendant was entitled to waive that right and did so, even though he said he should not say anything until he talked to his lawyer, by reinitiating communication with police after he had broken off questioning, especially since the statements he made implicating himself in a murder were not coerced.

       The defendant’s confession was properly taken without his attorney present where there was no evidence in the record that tended to show that the defendant ever asked for his attorney throughout his entire conversation with the officer to whom he gave his confession, even when given his Miranda rights by the officer and the defendant signed a waiver of his Miranda rights before giving his confession.

       Under a totality of the circumstances, the defendant knowingly, understandingly, freely and voluntarily waived her Miranda rights, particularly the right to counsel, and her statements were admissible; while it certainly would have been permissible, and perhaps desirable, for law enforcement officials to inform the defendant that her parents were in the process of hiring an attorney for her and that an attorney had called to speak with her, they were not under a legal obligation to do so.

       A defendant’s waiver of his right to counsel and his right to remain silent when he executed a written waiver prior to confessing could not be found to be voluntary where his confession given immediately thereafter was involuntary due to improper collusion by law enforcement interrogators, since the defendant’s waiver of his right and his confession were inextricably bound and were the product of prolonged coercive police interrogation. Abram v. State, 606 So. 2d 1015, 1992 Miss. LEXIS 448 (Miss. 1992), overruled in part, Foster v. State, 961 So. 2d 670, 2007 Miss. LEXIS 315 (Miss. 2007), overruled in part, Holly v.

       Even if an accused has procured an attorney, the accused may still waive the right to have the lawyer present during any police questioning; nothing in the Sixth Amendment prevents a suspect charged with a crime and represented by counsel from voluntarily choosing, on his or her own, to speak with police in the absence of an attorney. Mettetal v. State, 602 So. 2d 864, 1992 Miss. LEXIS 413 (Miss. 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       The evidence was sufficient to support a finding that a defendant had knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to assistance of counsel when he made a statement to the police, even though the defendant testified that he had repeatedly requested an attorney and was not provided with one, where the defendant admitted that he understood his rights, and all of his contentions that he had made repeated requests for counsel were specifically refuted by 3 law enforcement officers. Mettetal v. State, 602 So. 2d 864, 1992 Miss. LEXIS 413 (Miss. 1992).

      <p>
       If a defendant has not asserted his or her Fifth Amendment right to counsel, the fact that the defendant is appointed counsel to protect his or her Sixth Amendment right does not preclude interrogation on unrelated offenses. As long as the defendant is given the Miranda warning and makes a knowing and voluntary waiver, any statements obtained during the interrogation are admissible. Willie v. State, 585 So. 2d 660, 1991 Miss. LEXIS 454 (Miss. 1991).

   It is not the duty of law enforcement officers and prosecutors, nor the function of the courts, to insist that a person accused of a crime actually confer with an attorney before talking about the crime nor is there any prescribed procedure or form to be followed in the waiver of the right to such assistance. Berry v. State, 575 So. 2d 1, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 849 (Miss. 1990), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">500 U.S. 928</cite>, <cite class="s_court">111 S. Ct. 2042</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">114 L.

       <p>
   A defendant knowingly and intelligently waived the right to counsel, and his subsequent statement was freely and voluntarily given, where the defendant initially invoked his constitutional right to counsel but indicated that he no longer wished to contact an attorney when given the opportunity to call, the defendant then indicated that he was willing to enter into a discussion of the crime, and the defendant was again advised of his Miranda rights, after which he confessed. The defendant “initiated” when he indicated that he no longer wished to telephone his attorneys; one cannot halt an inquiry by first indicating a desire to call an attorney, then declining to do so when offered the opportunity. Berry v. State, 575 So. 2d 1, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 849 (Miss. 1990), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">500 U.S. 928</cite>, <cite class="s_court">111 S. Ct. 2042</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">114 L.

       Criminal suspect who, prior to giving confession, is advised of right to counsel and states that he understands right, who makes no mention of desiring attorney and who acknowledges in written waiver of right to counsel that he has not been promised anything, nor had any threats, pressure or coercion used against him has made voluntary waiver of right to have counsel present during confession.

       While defendant alleged that counsel advised him that he was eligible for parole, defendant was unable to meet the second prong of the test for ineffective assistance of counsel because defendant was unable to show how this deficiency prejudiced defendant’s case when the defendant entered a guilty plea to the sale of cocaine. Prince v. State, 967 So. 2d 69, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 502 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. dismissed, 966 So. 2d 172, 2007 Miss. LEXIS 581 (Miss. 2007).

   Court properly denied defendant’s motion for post-conviction relief after defendant pled guilty to sexual battery; trial counsel did not provide erroneous advice in advising defendant that the 14-year-old victim’s consent was not an issue for the jury to address. Under the plain language of Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.97.html#t97c03s97-3-95ol11c" target="_blank">97-3-95(1)(c)</a></cite>, the State would not have had to address the issue of consent; State would have only had to show that the victim was between the ages of 14 and 16, that defendant was more than 36 months older than the victim, and that defendant had engaged in sexual penetration with the victim. Bates v. State, 879 So. 2d 519, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 728 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).

       <p>
   Defendant’s claim that the assistance received from counsel was ineffective because his attorney had failed to inform him that the sentence would be served without parole and had misinformed him about his eligibility for parole after a certain period of time was time barred; defendant’s claim was required by Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.99.html#t99c39s99-39-5ol11a" target="_blank">99-39-5(1)(a)</a></cite> to be brought within three years of the guilty plea; the raising of a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel alone was insufficient to overcome the procedural bar where defendant provided as sole evidence his own version of the facts.

       Allegation by post-conviction petitioner, who had pleaded guilty to charge of capital murder, that he had received ineffective assistance of counsel on basis that his guilty plea was induced by misrepresentations of his attorney was rebutted by transcript of plea hearing and could be summarily denied without hearing; record indicated that petitioner had remained silent both when given opportunity to inform court of terms of alleged “real plea bargain,” and also when accomplice received shorter sentence.

       Trial counsel was not ineffective per se due to an actual conflict of interest, as there was no actual conflict of interest but only a personality conflict between counsel and his client. Rowsey v. State, 188 So.3d 486, 2015 Miss. LEXIS 573 (Miss. 2015).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant wanted counsel’s assistance on whether to rest his case, an accused had the a right to be heard by himself, counsel, or both, and the trial court erred in assigning counsel to be advisory while at the same time allowing her to withdraw due to a conflict, and the trial court erred again in requiring counsel to remain as advisory counsel once a conflict arose between her duty to the court and her duty to defendant; defendant’s constitutional rights were generally jeopardized. Hill v. State, 134 So.3d 721, 2014 Miss. LEXIS 88 (Miss. 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendants were not denied the effective representation of counsel regarding their joint representation because nothing conclusively indicated that defendants had interests that were adverse to each other, or that counsel should have engaged in some course of conduct that would have been adverse to the interests of one or the other. Defendants merely suggested that some of the evidence indicated the possibility of a conflict between the two. Salts v. State, 984 So. 2d 1050, 2008 Miss. App. LEXIS 199 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 984 So. 2d 277, 2008 Miss. LEXIS 334 (Miss. 2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       By dismissing defendant’s former attorney, after defendant gave him counterfeit documents concerning a stolen vehicle for which defendant was being charged, the trial court did not violate defendant’s constitutional right to counsel because, as the attorney was going to be called as a witness in defendant’s subsequent trial, the conflict of interest between defendant and his former attorney required his removal as counsel. There was no evidence that the conflict was manufactured in order to deprive defendant of his former counsel’s services or that he suffered undue prejudice by proceeding with his new counsel. Hayden v. State, 972 So. 2d 525, 2007 Miss. LEXIS 646 (Miss. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant knowingly waived his right to conflict-free counsel and, further, failed to show that the fact that a single attorney represented defendant and his two co-defendants on charges of assault of a law enforcement officer prejudiced defendant or rendered defendant’s guilty plea involuntary. Blansett v. State, 841 So. 2d 165, 2002 Miss. App. LEXIS 593 (Miss. Ct. App. 2002).
      </p>
      <p>
       In order to demonstrate a violation of his Sixth Amendment rights, a defendant must establish that an actual conflict of interest affected his lawyer’s performance. Brown v. State, 798 So. 2d 481, 2001 Miss. LEXIS 196 (Miss. 2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       There was no merit to the defendant’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel where the defendant alleged that his attorney was ineffective in that she had a conflict of interest because she was the sister of an attorney working with the district attorney’s office where there was no evidence that defense counsel’s brother was involved in the case in any fashion. Miller v. State, 788 So. 2d 70, 2000 Miss. App. LEXIS 590 (Miss. Ct. App. 2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       The defendant failed to establish a violation of his right to effective assistance of counsel based on a conflict of interest where he alleged a conflict of interest based solely on the fact that his attorney represented two defendants and failed to show an actual conflict. Witt v. State, 781 So. 2d 135, 2000 Miss. App. LEXIS 377 (Miss. Ct. App. 2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       There was no conflict of interest and, therefore, no ineffective assistance of counsel occurred where counsel arranged separate pleas for the defendant and a codefendant at separate terms of court, which resulted in two different sentences, since the defendant claimed primary responsibility for the crimes at issue and was also charged with two other counts. Ingram v. State, 774 So. 2d 467, 2000 Miss. App. LEXIS 358 (Miss. Ct. App. 2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       The defendant failed to show ineffective assistance of counsel based on a conflict of interest arising from the former representation of a potential witness by defense counsel since the potential witness did not testify; therefore, there was no prejudice. Tyler v. State, 2000 Miss. App. LEXIS 188 (Miss. Ct. App. Apr. 25, 2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       Effective right of counsel encompasses the right to representation by attorney who does not owe conflicting duties to other defendants, and undivided loyalty of defense counsel is essential to the due process guarantee of the Fifth Amendment. Perry v. State, 682 So. 2d 1027, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 572 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       There was no actual conflict arising from fact that defense counsel had previously represented government rebuttal witness in unrelated prosecutions, where subject of cross-examination was witness’ prior deals with state to provide testimony in exchange for plea agreements. Perry v. State, 682 So. 2d 1027, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 572 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defense counsel’s representation was not adversely affected by fact that he had previously represented government rebuttal witness in unrelated prosecutions, where counsel was not “suddenly curtailed” in his cross-examination when subject of prior deals with prosecutors arose but, rather, proceeded onward to question witness in detail about his motivation for prior testimony in another case as well as his motivation for testifying against defendant in the present case. Perry v. State, 682 So. 2d 1027, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 572 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where no actual conflict of interest is present, defendant must demonstrate prejudice and show reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. Perry v. State, 682 So. 2d 1027, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 572 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant was not prejudiced by any adverse performance of defense counsel due to fact that he had previously represented government rebuttal witness in unrelated prosecutions; even assuming that counsel conclusively established that witness’s sole motivation in testifying was to receive a reduced sentence pursuant to agreement with the State, there remained the vast amount of evidence presented during state’s case in chief. Perry v. State, 682 So. 2d 1027, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 572 (Miss. 1996).

       Right to effective assistance of counsel includes right to representation by attorney who does not owe conflicting duties to other defendants. Smith v. State, 666 So. 2d 810, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 628 (Miss. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       Actual conflict of interest, violating defendant’s right to effective assistance of counsel, resulted from public defender’s representation of both codefendant during plea negotiations and defendant at trial in prosecution originating from simultaneous double sale of drugs. Smith v. State, 666 So. 2d 810, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 628 (Miss. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       Prejudice from attorney’s conflict of interest is presumed only if defendant demonstrates that counsel actively represented conflicting interests and that actual conflict of interest adversely affected attorney’s performance. Smith v. State, 666 So. 2d 810, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 628 (Miss. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       Prejudice from actual conflict of interest, which existed when public defender provided dual representation to both defendant and codefendant, existed when public defender prematurely terminated cross-examination of codefendant. Smith v. State, 666 So. 2d 810, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 628 (Miss. 1995).
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
       Mere fact that counsel for capital murder defendant shared office space with prosecutor who prosecuted defendant’s preliminary hearing was not sufficient to demonstrate actual conflict of interest causing prejudice to defendant in violation of defendant’s right to counsel.

      </p>
      <p>
       In a prosecution for conspiracy to distribute cocaine, a defendant’s constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel was violated due to an irreparable conflict of interest where the attorney who represented the defendant had also been counsel for the State’s main witness in the trial against the witness for the same offense. Littlejohn v. State, 593 So. 2d 20, 1992 Miss. LEXIS 8 (Miss. 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       The right to effective assistance of counsel encompasses 2 broad principals–minimum competence and loyal assistance. The right to conflict free counsel is attendant to the Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel. It is incumbent upon courts which confront and which are alerted to possible conflicts of interest to take the necessary steps to ascertain whether the conflict warrants separate counsel. Thus, where a defense attorney represented 2 codefendants during the sentencing phase of the judicial proceedings and it could easily have been anticipated that the attorney would argue that the actions of one of the codefendants should not be attributed to the other or that the attorney would opt to not say or do anything in litigation for fear that to do so would characterize one codefendant as being more culpable than the other, the failure of the trial court to disclose to the codefendants the potential dangers of joint representation by counsel laboring under a conflict resulted in a violation of the right to effective assistance of counsel, and therefore a new sentencing hearing was warranted. Armstrong v. State, 573 So. 2d 1329, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 824 (Miss. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Sixth Amendment test for violation of right to effective assistance of counsel is whether defendant can demonstrate that his attorney actively represented conflicting interest and conflict adversely affected his lawyer’s performance; conflict of interest is present whenever one defendant stands to gain significantly by counsel adducing probative evidence or advancing plausible arguments that are damaging to cause of co-defendant whom counsel is also representing. United States v. Holley, 826 F.2d 331, 1987 U.S. App. LEXIS 12093 (5th Cir. Miss. 1987), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">485 U.S. 960</cite>, <cite class="s_court">108 S.

      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant failed to demonstrate that trial counsel was ineffective due to conflict of interest in representing co-defendants at trial by failing to demonstrate that counsel chose between alternative arguments helpful to one client but harmful to other, where defense was alibi in which all defendants represented by counsel were involved, and attorney told them if they were telling him truth, he had no conflict but if they committed murders he would have conflict. It is incumbent upon defendant to establish actual conflict with specific reference to instances in record which show that counsel’s performance was adversely affected, and defendant failed to do this, although attempting to do so by pointing to prosecution’s closing argument, which stated that there were many unanswered questions in case and one of biggest ones was “why did every single witness choose” same attorney. Stringer v. Scroggy, 675 F. Supp. 356, 1987 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11203 (S.D. Miss. 1987), aff'd, 862 F.2d 1108, 1988 U.S. App. LEXIS 17949 (5th Cir. Miss. 1988).

       Defendant had been unable to present facts, and not mere inferences, to show that appellate counsel had actual conflict of interest which rendered him ineffective where counsel on appeal representing defendant had also been retained to represent co-defendant, who was defendant’s son, at his own trial; appellate counsel testified that he never consciously decided not to raise any issue in defendant’s appeal because he thought it might hurt his son. Stringer v. Scroggy, 675 F. Supp. 356, 1987 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11203 (S.D. Miss. 1987), aff'd, 862 F.2d 1108, 1988 U.S. App. LEXIS 17949 (5th Cir. Miss. 1988).

       There is nothing in the law of this state which prohibits the partner of a county attorney from representing a defendant in a criminal proceeding outside the county where the county attorney serves, and the denial of defendant’s counsel of choice on such grounds was a violation of his Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment rights.

       The fact that the defendant’s wife, indicted as an accessory to the burglaries for which he was indicted, had competent counsel who included him in their conferences with his wife, did not satisfy the mandatory constitutional requirement that one charged with a felony is entitled to be represented by counsel; and this was particularly true where the interests of the defendant and his wife were antagonistic, and it would be impossible for her attorneys to defend him with fidelity.

       Counsel was not ineffective in failing to inform petitioner of the charges against him because a review of the statements of the children contained in the presentence report and their testimony at the sentencing hearing revealed no inconsistency. The specifics of the crimes were spelled out in the petition seeking approval to enter a guilty plea, and therefore, any claim that petitioner did not know he was pleading guilty to “photographing a child in sexually explicit conduct” failed. Leavitt v. State, 982 So. 2d 981, 2008 Miss. App. LEXIS 73 (Miss. Ct. App. 2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       Counsel was not ineffective in failing to investigate because petitioner failed to present any competent evidence to establish the last time he took pictures of the girls, the date of his heart surgery, or any facts that would lend credence to his claims of innocence. Additionally, the record contained none. Leavitt v. State, 982 So. 2d 981, 2008 Miss. App. LEXIS 73 (Miss. Ct. App. 2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       Counsel was not ineffective in failing to request a competency hearing because a report filed by the Mississippi State Hospital stated that it was an expert’s opinion that petitioner was not suffering from any major mental disorder at the time of the alleged offenses such that he would not have known the nature, quality, and wrongfulness of his alleged acts at those times. Leavitt v. State, 982 So. 2d 981, 2008 Miss. App. LEXIS 73 (Miss. Ct. App. 2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       Counsel was not ineffective in failing to challenge the indictment because any error resulting from exclusion of the numerical marker of the specific statute charged was harmless. The indictment put petitioner on notice of the charges against him, and any reference to an incorrect sentence was mere surplusage. Leavitt v. State, 982 So. 2d 981, 2008 Miss. App. LEXIS 73 (Miss. Ct. App. 2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant did not show ineffective assistance of counsel where, even if defense counsel had successfully moved to have the charges severed, given the strength of the State’s case against defendant, he could not reasonably have expected a different result on the manufacture-of-marijuana charge; defendant’s counsel performed a thorough cross examination of the witnesses called by the State; and defendant showed no prejudice in having the trial judge preside over the case. Williams v. State, 971 So. 2d 581, 2007 Miss. LEXIS 571 (Miss. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   While the defendant stated that his right to a speedy trial under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.99.html#t99c17s99-17-1" target="_blank">99-17-1</a></cite> was violated and that counsel was ineffective in failing to request a speedy trial, defendant however provided no information as to whether good cause was shown for the delay or whether the trial court granted any continuances; thus, he failed to present to any viable argument or any authority in support of his argument that his trial counsel was defective for failing to file a motion for a speedy trial, and therefore his counsel was not ineffective. Golden v. State, 968 So. 2d 378, 2007 Miss. LEXIS 530 (Miss. 2007), cert. dismissed, 977 So. 2d 343, 2008 Miss. LEXIS 111 (Miss. 2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant failed to support his allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel and mainly used the issue to reassert his innocence; therefore, the issue was without merit. Turner v. State, 961 So. 2d 734, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 200 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. dismissed, 968 So. 2d 948, 2007 Miss. LEXIS 627 (Miss. 2007).

   Denial of the inmate’s petition for post-conviction relief pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.99.html#t99c39s99-39-1" target="_blank">99-39-1</a></cite> et seq. was appropriate because he failed to show that his attorneys were ineffective in part for requesting that venue be transferred; any prejudice claimed by the inmate was purely hypothetical and was insufficient to demonstrate any ineffectiveness. Turner v. State, 953 So. 2d 1063, 2007 Miss. LEXIS 2 (Miss. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant’s trial counsel was not ineffective where the indictment clearly informed defendant of the elements of the crime with which he was charged and there was nothing indicating that trial counsel’s decision not to interview defense witnesses was not a valid legal strategy; defendant acknowledged that the trial judge advised him she could impose a minimum sentence of two years at his plea colloquy. Brown v. State, 944 So. 2d 103, 2006 Miss. App. LEXIS 420 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 946 So. 2d 368, 2006 Miss. LEXIS 732 (Miss. 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       Denial of the inmate’s petition for post-conviction relief was appropriate because he failed to prove that his counsel was ineffective. The inmate entered an open plea and admitted to the judge that he took full responsibility for the crime he committed; additionally, he was sentenced within the guidelines. Hoskins v. State, 934 So. 2d 326, 2006 Miss. App. LEXIS 186 (Miss. Ct. App. 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant did not show ineffective assistance of counsel where defendant failed to point out anything counsel could have done other than proceed to trial on a theory that a witness may have committed the crimes because he turned in some of the items taken in the robbery; indigent defendants were not entitled to appointed counsel of their choice. Anderson v. State, 943 So. 2d 102, 2006 Miss. App. LEXIS 858 (Miss. Ct. App. 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       Dismissal of the inmate’s motion for post-conviction relief without a hearing was appropriate because nothing indicated that his counsel was deficient in any way; in fact, the record contained numerous motions filed by counsel in an effort to aid the inmate’s defense, and his trial counsel also negotiated to get the original charge of capital murder reduced to murder. Moss v. State, 940 So. 2d 949, 2006 Miss. App. LEXIS 536 (Miss. Ct. App. 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       Denial of the inmate’s petition for post-conviction relief was appropriate because his counsel were not ineffective; after appointment, counsel began their defense with a vigorous volley of motions and his attorneys were able to secure a plea bargain that relieved the him of a possible death sentence. Harris v. State, 944 So. 2d 900, 2006 Miss. App. LEXIS 567 (Miss. Ct. App. 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a capital murder case, an inmate’s ineffective assistance of counsel claims were either procedurally barred, or, even if not procedurally barred, were without merit, under the following circumstances: (1) the inmate’s counsel did not fail to adequately develop evidence to impeach a witness because counsel conducted a thorough cross-examination of the witness, and pursued a line of questioning attempting to call into doubt whether the witness could really have overheard a conversation in which the inmate stated that he sold the guns on the street; (2) counsel’s representation of another witness in a prior action that was completely unrelated to the inmate’s case was not a conflict of interest, and counsel conducted a full cross-examination of the witness; (3) counsel produced several witnesses placing the inmate at a nightclub on the night of the murders; (4) counsel did present a case in mitigation for the jury to consider; (5) counsel’s closing argument was coherent and not a poor strategic choice; and (6) the prosecutor’s arguments using scriptural, religious, or biblical references were proper because the prosecutor was responding to scriptural or religious arguments made by defense counsel. Manning v. State, 929 So. 2d 885, 2006 Miss. LEXIS 109 (Miss. 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Court rejected defendant’s claim that he received ineffective assistance of counsel in violation of the Sixth Amendment because defendant’s counsel did file a motion to exclude evidence admitted as the result of an allegedly illegal search, and a suppression hearing was held as a result of that motion; therefore, defendant failed to meet the two-prong Strickland test that required defendant to show that his counsel’s performance was deficient and that he was prejudiced by the deficiency. Passman v. State, 937 So. 2d 17, 2006 Miss. App. LEXIS 89 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 936 So. 2d 367, 2006 Miss. LEXIS 482 (Miss. 2006), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">549 U.S. 1324</cite>, <cite class="s_court">127 S. Ct. 1914</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">167 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 570, 2007 U.S. LEXIS 3842 (U.S. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       Inmate failed to establish that he was deprived of effective assistance of counsel due to his counsel’s failure to pursue an insanity defense, to have him evaluated or to obtain his records from the United States Army showing he was discharged for reasons related to his mental health, as he did not offer evidence in support of his claims, other than unsubstantiated allegations, sufficient to overcome the strong presumption that his attorney’s conduct fell within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance. Thomas v. State, 930 So. 2d 1264, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 993 (Miss. Ct. App. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Denial of the inmate’s petition for post-conviction relief was proper where his counsel was not ineffective, in part because it was determined that the inmate failed to demonstrate prejudice regarding the State’s scriptural references or parole argument closing argument of the sentencing phase of his trial. Thus, his counsel was not deficient for failing to object. Manning v. State, 2005 Miss. LEXIS 464 (Miss. Aug. 4, 2005), op. withdrawn, sub. op., 929 So. 2d 885, 2006 Miss. LEXIS 109 (Miss. 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       Denial of the inmate’s petition for post-conviction relief after he had pled guilty to manslaughter was proper because counsel was not ineffective since the inmate had failed to demonstrate that his attorney’s advice was not well within the range of competence required to attorneys in criminal cases. Hardiman v. State, 904 So. 2d 1225, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 394 (Miss. Ct. App. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant failed to satisfy his burden of overcoming the strong presumption that an attorney’s conduct fell within the wide range of professional assistance where, based on the detailed colloquy between defendant and the trial judge, it was clear that defendant personally understood the nature and consequences of his guilty plea. Beene v. State, 910 So. 2d 1152, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 229 (Miss. Ct. App. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel at trial failed where he did not reveal the nature of the prejudice that resulted from any of the errors he alleged by his defense counsel during his trial for possession of cocaine. Defendant was not guaranteed a “perfect” trial. Magee v. State, 912 So. 2d 1044, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 252 (Miss. Ct. App. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   In a capital murder case, defendant did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel because of counsel’s failure to use all of the peremptory challenges available since each juror concluded that they could have been fair and impartial if selected to sit on the jury; defendant failed to show that any prejudice resulted from the failure to strike the jurors. Le v. State, 913 So. 2d 913, 2005 Miss. LEXIS 151 (Miss.), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">546 U.S. 1004</cite>, <cite class="s_court">126 S. Ct. 622</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">163 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 508, 2005 U.S. LEXIS 8254 (U.S. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Inmate’s trial attorneys were not ineffective because (1) although some of the State’s race-neutral reasons for striking jurors were a close call, the trial court allowed the challenges to stand, and the inmate did not show that a different outcome would have resulted had the Batson objections been sustained; (2) his counsel filed numerous pre-trial motions, cross-examined nine out of eleven prosecution witnesses, ultimately did not call a defense witness because he would have corroborated the State’s witnesses met with the inmate on numerous occasions and even discussed a plea offer from the State that the inmate rejected; (3) the inmate’s accusation that trial counsel had failed to properly investigate was merely an unfounded allegation because the inmate supplied little or nothing of what an effective attorney performing a proper investigation would or should have found by way of mitigating testimony; and (4) trial counsel did not err in failing to raise the issue of the inmate’s competency because the inmate presented no evidence that he was currently incompetent or incompetent at the time of his trial. Knox v. State, 901 So. 2d 1257, 2005 Miss. LEXIS 190 (Miss.), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">546 U.S. 1063</cite>, <cite class="s_court">126 S. Ct. 797</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">163 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 630, 2005 U.S. LEXIS 9080 (U.S. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant’s petition for post-conviction relief from his conviction of sexual battery was properly denied because defendant failed to establish by any convincing evidence that his attorney’s performance was deficient where prior to entering his guilty plea, defendant stated that his trial counsel had discussed the charge against him and all possible defenses and that he was satisfied with his attorney’s advice. Furthermore, defendant stated that he understood that his sentence could range between zero and thirty years and that he had entered a guilty plea because he had committed the crime charged against him. Myers v. State, 897 So. 2d 198, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 1185 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant’s guilty plea petitions for grand larceny and possession of cocaine indicated that defendant was informed of the possible sentence that defendant could receive and that defendant was satisfied with counsel’s representation; hence, there was no merit to defendant’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel and the court properly denied defendant’s petition for post-conviction relief. Dockens v. State, 879 So. 2d 1072, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 770 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Counsel was not ineffective because he did direct the jury’s attention to exculpatory portions of defendant’s statement because (1) defense counsel asserted that co-defendant was the person responsible for the murder and that defendant was not present, and (2) counsel used good parts of defendant’s bad statement that he was involved in the robbery and capital murder of the victim. Branch v. State, 882 So. 2d 36, 2004 Miss. LEXIS 586 (Miss. 2004), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">544 U.S. 907</cite>, <cite class="s_court">125 S. Ct. 1595</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">161 L.

      <p>
       <p>
   There was no need to challenge the authentication of the bag and its contents, which included the victim’s gun, money, food stamps, and coin wrappers, because the bag was found in co-defendant’s yard and only served to reinforce the defense’s theory that co-defendant, not defendant, killed the victim. Therefore, one of defendant’s attorney’s was not ineffective for failing to withdraw from the case as she was not an authenticating witness. Branch v. State, 882 So. 2d 36, 2004 Miss. LEXIS 586 (Miss. 2004), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">544 U.S. 907</cite>, <cite class="s_court">125 S. Ct. 1595</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">161 L.

      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Although defendant argued that there was no meaningful adversarial testing of prosecutor’s case by defense counsel, defendant was represented by competent and zealous counsel and trial counsel challenged the State’s evidence at all stages of the case by filing and arguing numerous pre-trial motions, throughout the trial itself, throughout the sentencing hearing, and through post-trial motions; thus, defendant’s trial counsel was not ineffective. Branch v. State, 882 So. 2d 36, 2004 Miss. LEXIS 586 (Miss. 2004), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">544 U.S. 907</cite>, <cite class="s_court">125 S. Ct. 1595</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">161 L.

      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Trial counsel filed several pre-hearing motions, put on several witnesses in each phase of the trial, and zealously represented their client; the witnesses willing to come forward after the trial would have constituted redundant character testimony. Thus, trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to investigate defendant’s case and potential witnesses. Branch v. State, 882 So. 2d 36, 2004 Miss. LEXIS 586 (Miss. 2004), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">544 U.S. 907</cite>, <cite class="s_court">125 S. Ct. 1595</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">161 L.

      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Counsel’s performance in not moving for a change of venue was not deficient where all of the jurors stated that they could be fair and impartial and where the record revealed overwhelming evidence of a prisoner’s guilt. Bishop v. State, 882 So. 2d 135, 2004 Miss. LEXIS 773 (Miss. 2004), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">543 U.S. 1189</cite>, <cite class="s_court">125 S. Ct. 1401</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">161 L.

      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Defendant’s counsel was not ineffective under U.S. Const. amend. VI in defendant’s criminal trial for capital murder, where: counsel did not investigate mitigation factors after defendant was found guilty, as defendant had explicitly instructed his counsel not to fight the death penalty because defendant preferred that over life imprisonment; failure to submit physical evidence for DNA analysis was a trial strategy; and counsel’s performance with respect to a change of venue and a continuance were proper in the circumstances. Grayson v. State, 879 So. 2d 1008, 2004 Miss. LEXIS 721 (Miss. 2004), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">543 U.S. 1155</cite>, <cite class="s_court">125 S. Ct. 1301</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">161 L.

      </p>
      <p>
       Inmate’s attorney was not ineffective, in connection with the inmate’s capital murder trial, for failing to impeach a material witness with an alleged prior inconsistent statement concerning the inmate’s height because (1) there was little room for impeachment in the relative heights of the inmate, co-defendant, and the witness, and (2) it was a matter of trial strategy not to ask the witness additional questions on cross-examination. Smith v. State, 877 So. 2d 369, 2004 Miss. LEXIS 547 (Miss. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Inmate’s attorney was not ineffective, in connection with the inmate’s capital murder trial, for not objecting to the presence of a county sheriff during trial proceedings because (1) the inmate cited no authority to support the claim that the sheriff was able to tailor the sheriff’s testimony after hearing other witnesses and (2) there was no abuse of discretion in the trial court’s decision to permit the sheriff to remain in the courtroom. Smith v. State, 877 So. 2d 369, 2004 Miss. LEXIS 547 (Miss. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Court found no ineffective assistance of counsel in the failure to object to an inmate being shackled at trial where no juror had stated that the shackling affected the conviction or sentence in any respect. Smith v. State, 877 So. 2d 369, 2004 Miss. LEXIS 547 (Miss. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Inmate’s attorneys were not ineffective, in connection with the inmate’s capital murder trial, for not objecting to the trial judge’s decision to excuse potential jurors after unrecorded bench conferences because even though the bench conferences should have been recorded, and even if the attorneys were negligent in failing to see that the conferences were recorded, there was no showing of prejudice to the inmate and the reasons for the excusal of the jurors were clearly in the record. Smith v. State, 877 So. 2d 369, 2004 Miss. LEXIS 547 (Miss. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Defendant was not entitled to a free transcript in a post-conviction relief setting because his post-conviction motion could not withstand summary dismissal under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.99.html#t99c39s99-39-11ol12" target="_blank">99-39-11(2)</a></cite>; defendant did not demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel where he did not allege with any degree of specificity what constituted the mitigating evidence or the manner in which his counsel coerced him, and such naked allegations did not supply the “specificity and detail” required to establish a prima facie showing. McCray v. State, 869 So. 2d 442, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 247 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant did not prove ineffective assistance of counsel where the strategy of defendant’s counsel was to avoid incarceration, and defendant’s attorney negotiated a plea bargain for defendant and she received a suspended sentence, a monetary fine and probation; there was no evidence that a sentence pursuant to the non-adjudication laws was a condition to which the prosecution would have agreed or the trial judge would have accepted, and the record indicated that defendant chose to avoid the risk of such a sentence and sought regular probation instead. Smith v. State, 869 So. 2d 425, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 251 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant failed to meet his burden of proof regarding the allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel where his assertion that his attorney put up “no defense” during closing arguments other than to say “my client says he’s innocent” was completely false; counsel said more in closing argument than defendant asserted he did, and defendant did not show that counsel’s performance was deficient. Armstead v. State, 869 So. 2d 1052, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 68 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the evidence showed that defendant’s trial counsel extensively cross-examined a victim and a detective in a sexual assault case, and voiced objections to evidence when appropriate, there was nothing to support an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. McCoy v. State, 878 So. 2d 167, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 53 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 878 So. 2d 67, 2004 Miss. LEXIS 910 (Miss. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a burglary case, defendant failed to establish ineffective assistance of counsel where there was nothing to show that defense counsel was unprepared for the trial, defendant was allowed to participate in jury selection, and defense counsel effectively pointed out discrepancies in trial testimony; moreover, the failure to call defendant as a witness and the decision to strike jurors were not grounds for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Phinisee v. State, 864 So. 2d 988, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 19 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the inmate claimed in a post-conviction petition to have been denied effective assistance of counsel under Miss. Const. Art. III, § 26 and U.S. Const. Amend. VI due to defense counsel’s failure to request and file complete discovery and to meet more than once with the inmate, the claim failed, as the inmate did not argue that this had resulted in prejudice. Battaya v. State, 861 So. 2d 364, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 1201 (Miss. Ct. App. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Defense counsel was not ineffective at trial because (1) counsel was not ineffective for raising a Batson challenge because there was no viable Batson challenge; (2) counsel pursued a coherent defense strategy; (3) counsel was not ineffective for failing to move to have the capital murder charge reduced to manslaughter; and (4) counsel was not ineffective for failing to request lesser-included offense or lesser-offense instructions on murder or manslaughter. Powers v. State, 883 So. 2d 20, 2003 Miss. LEXIS 850 (Miss. 2003), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">543 U.S. 1155</cite>, <cite class="s_court">125 S. Ct. 1297</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">161 L.

      </p>
      <p>
       Because defendant was unable to show that counsel’s performance in a murder trial was so deficient and prejudicial as to warrant a new trial, reversal of a murder conviction was not required. Schuck v. State, 865 So. 2d 1111, 2003 Miss. LEXIS 753 (Miss. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a case where defendant was convicted of murder for the shooting death of his wife, counsel was not ineffective regarding venue because defendant presented no evidence of alleged pretrial publicity, regarding the admission of a revolver, regarding closing argument, or regarding jury instructions because defendant did not show the outcome of the trial would have been different if an instruction on his suicide theory had been given to the jury. Jones v. State, 857 So. 2d 740, 2003 Miss. LEXIS 554 (Miss. 2003).

   In a capital murder case, a review of the record, the briefs, and the arguments showed that there were no individual errors that required reversal and that there was no aggregate collection of minor errors that would, as a whole, mandate a reversal of either the inmate’s convictions or sentences; thus, the failure by the inmate’s attorneys to present issues at the trial or appellate level that the inmate now presented to the Supreme Court in his post-conviction application was not deficient and could not satisfy the first prong of the Strickland test.

   In a capital murder case, the inmate’s counsel were not ineffective for failing to seek a continuance in order to better prepare because there was no indication from the record that the inmate’s attorneys were in need of additional time or that their failure to obtain a continuance was deficient; also, the inmate failed to demonstrate how the result of his sentencing trial would have been different had his attorneys obtained a continuance.

   In a capital murder case, the inmate’s counsel were not ineffective for failing (1) to object to the reintroduction of evidence from the guilt phase because the evidence was admissible; (2) to elicit testimony from the inmate’s mother that the sheriff and deputy were alone in the inmate’s room during their search; or (3) to obtain DNA evidence that could not procedurally be introduced.

       Although all of petitioner death row inmate’s arguments were procedurally barred either by res judicata or for failure to raise the arguments earlier and no intervening case law exempted petitioner from the procedural bar, the court also reviewed petitioner’s arguments on the merits; it reiterated its earlier holdings that there were no constitutional deficiencies in the Mississippi murder and death penalty statutes, including those relating to death resulting from child abuse as capital murder, and that none of the alleged deficiencies of defense counsel could have affected petitioner’s outcome.

       In a burglary trial, defendant did not establish ineffective assistance of counsel because there was no evidence to show that defendant was deprived of a fair trial, and testimony elicited about the use of a stolen car was clearly within the ambit of trial strategy; further, counsel’s failure to pursue a post-trial hearing did not amount to ineffective assistance of counsel because there was no new and material evidence.

       In a prosecution of defendant for the unlawful sale of cocaine, defendant’s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel patently failed the first part of the test for claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, because they did not demonstrate a defective performance, much less any prejudice that could arise from such a performance.

       It is inappropriate for an attorney who represents a criminal defendant at trial to represent that same defendant on appeal where the attorney intends to raise an ineffective assistance of counsel claim in that appeal.

       Anyone claiming ineffective assistance of counsel has the burden of proving, not only that counsel’s performance was deficient, but also that he was prejudiced thereby, and that there is a reasonable probability that but for his attorney’s errors, he would have received a different result in the trial court. Pearson v. State, 740 So. 2d 346, 1999 Miss. App. LEXIS 179 (Miss. Ct. App. 1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       The defendant failed to prove that his attorney’s performance fell outside the broad spectrum of reasonable professional assistance where the defendant’s decision not to testify at trial was a reasonable trial strategy because the identification by the victim and his audio taped confession were very compelling and his attorney tried to discredit the victim’s testimony by establishing inconsistencies in her prior statements to the police and her trial testimony. Smith v. State, 737 So. 2d 377, 1998 Miss. App. LEXIS 968 (Miss. Ct. App. 1998).

       The defendant was not deprived of effective assistance of counsel when his counsel’s paralegal/investigator was hit by a car on the second day of trial, especially as counsel stated that they could continue without the paralegal/investigator. Finley v. State, 725 So. 2d 226, 1998 Miss. LEXIS 615 (Miss. 1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       On claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, court’s scrutiny of counsel’s performance is highly deferential, and court must make every effort to eliminate distorting effects of hindsight, to reconstruct circumstances of counsel’s challenged conduct, and to evaluate conduct from counsel’s perspective at the time. Pitts v. Anderson, 122 F.3d 275, 1997 U.S. App. LEXIS 25289 (5th Cir. Miss. 1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial counsel’s failure in capital murder prosecution to request funds for blood splatter expert to render opinion as to whether person who wore jeans actually fired fatal shot did not constitute ineffective assistance, where in his argument defendant appeared to assume that he was wearing jeans in question during shooting whereas throughout trial defendant argued that jeans were not his and that he had not worn them day of shooting.

   Adversarial process protected by Sixth Amendment requires that accused have counsel acting in the role of an advocate, and the right to effective assistance of counsel is the right of accused to require that prosecution’s case survive the crucible of meaningful adversarial testing.

       A Louisiana attorney’s failure to comply with court rules concerning appearances by foreign attorneys did not, per se, create ineffective assistance of counsel. Hubbard v. State, 628 So. 2d 1386, 1993 Miss. LEXIS 570 (Miss. 1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       It is not per se professionally unreasonable for an attorney to allow a client to talk to the police and give a statement; where the evidence is otherwise overwhelming, confession may be a significant step toward prompt disposition of the case and mitigation of sentence. Thus, a defendant was not denied effective assistance of counsel on the ground that his attorney advised him to talk to the police, even though the attorney advised the defendant by telephone and did not go to the police station or further assist the defendant, where it appeared that the attorney “brought to bear independent scrutiny and judgment” before advising the defendant, and the evidence against the defendant was overwhelming. Riddle v. State, 580 So. 2d 1195, 1991 Miss. LEXIS 301 (Miss. 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       Ineffectiveness of counsel should not be excused simply because counsel has been privately retained. Therefore, that portion of Bennett v. State 293 So. 2d 1 (Miss. 1974), and any other case, which attempts to draw a relevant distinction between court-appointed and retained counsel where a defendant’s right to appeal and effective assistance of counsel is concerned would be expressly overruled. Triplett v. State, 579 So. 2d 555, 1991 Miss. LEXIS 251 (Miss. 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       A defense attorney’s failure to object when a prosecution witness, who was a nurse, was sent into the jury room to attend to a juror who had become ill, did not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel where no allegation or facts were presented as to how the attorney’s failure to object resulted in any significant prejudice to the defendant at his trial. Jordan v. State, 577 So. 2d 368, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 785 (Miss. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       A trial judge’s failure to recess and adjourn at reasonable times did not deny the defendant the effective assistance of counsel where the record failed to reveal any evidence of old age, illness, fatigue or exhaustion that affected the defense counsel’s performance. Lanier v. State, 533 So. 2d 473, 1988 Miss. LEXIS 523 (Miss. 1988).

   Although §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.99.html#t99c15s99-15-17" target="_blank">99-15-17</a></cite> allows for the appointment of 2 attorneys in capital cases, a defense counsel’s withdrawal of his motion for the appointment of additional counsel did not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel where the defense counsel withdrew the motion because he had successfully developed the case and the case was not so complex that one attorney could not provide a legally sufficient defense. Marks v. State, 532 So. 2d 976, 1988 Miss. LEXIS 425 (Miss. 1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       A defense counsel’s heavy case load and limited resources are, absent specific instances of error, wholly insufficient in themselves to reverse a conviction and sentence on the ground of ineffective assistance of counsel. Cabello v. State, 524 So. 2d 313, 1988 Miss. LEXIS 92 (Miss. 1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Counsel was not ineffective for failing to move for change of venue before guilt phase of trial because defense counsel is under no duty to make such motion, and thus this would fall into realm of trial strategy. Neither newspaper articles, nor anything else, indicated that, absent change of venue, defendant would lose right to fair trial. Wiley v. State, 517 So. 2d 1373, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2915 (Miss. 1987), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">486 U.S. 1036</cite>, <cite class="s_court">108 S. Ct. 2024</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">100 L.

      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Argument that counsel was ineffective based on opening statement conceding to jury that his client was guilty of crime charged in indictment was rejected because it may have been trial strategy. Candor at guilt phase may help defendant in sentencing phase because attorney who, while sincerely trying to help his client, at same time is open and honest with jury, is more likely to receive sympathetic and open ear in his other arguments. Counsel also argued crime was not capital murder and jurors must therefore return verdict of not guilty. Wiley v. State, 517 So. 2d 1373, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2915 (Miss. 1987), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">486 U.S. 1036</cite>, <cite class="s_court">108 S. Ct. 2024</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">100 L.

      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Argument that trial counsel did not have requisite legal experience to properly try criminal case was rejected as basis for claim of ineffective assistance of counsel where trial counsel had 2 1/2 years experience and had tried 5 criminal cases, none of which were capital cases, at time of first trial of defendant. Level of criminal trial experience is one factor to be considered in determining whether there was effective assistance of counsel. Wiley v. State, 517 So. 2d 1373, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2915 (Miss. 1987), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">486 U.S. 1036</cite>, <cite class="s_court">108 S. Ct. 2024</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">100 L.

      </p>
      <p>
       Counsel’s failure to obtain services of forensic pathologist was not sufficient to constitute ineffective assistance of counsel where cause of death was important issue at trial because (1) there is no law requiring employment of forensic pathologist as prerequisite to defense counsel being considered constitutionally effective and (2) as practical matter, defense counsel did in fact consult with pathologist and discuss reports of prosecution’s pathologist and was advised that pathologist saw nothing which would be of any benefit. Merritt v. State, 517 So. 2d 517, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2875 (Miss. 1987).

      <p>
       Refusal of trial court to grant recess requested by criminal defendant, in case in which jury retires to deliberate at 9:30 p.m. and returns with guilty verdict at 11:03 p.m., does not deprive defendant of effective assistance of counsel through exhaustion where attorney for defendant declares himself fit and able and only expresses concern for jury when making motion for recess.

      <p>
       Defendant, who was convicted of manslaughter after a one-day trial that lasted until almost 11:00 P.M., despite defense counsel’s repeated motions for a recess, was denied the effective assistance of counsel, particularly in light of the fact that the aged defense attorney, who had prepared and was selected prior to the trial to making the closing argument, read the state’s requested instruction on murder to the jury four successive times and was immediately thereafter taken to a hospital appearing to be in shock. Thornton v. State, 369 So. 2d 505, 1979 Miss. LEXIS 2260 (Miss. 1979).

       Nothing in the record affirmatively showed constitutional ineffectiveness and defendant failed to show prejudice; thus, defendant failed to meet his Strickland burden. Givens v. State, 967 So. 2d 1, 2007 Miss. LEXIS 494 (Miss. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the indictment was not defective, counsel’s decision not to challenge it could not amount to ineffective assistance of counsel, as challenging it would not have changed the result of the proceeding; defendant failed to present any evidence that would prove ineffective assistance of counsel. Mosley v. State, 941 So. 2d 877, 2006 Miss. App. LEXIS 811 (Miss. Ct. App. 2006).

       Defendant failed to meet the burden required by Strickland where the circuit court judge found defendant’s counsel’s testimony regarding his representation of defendant to be more credible than defendant’s testimony.

       Appellate court rejected an inmate’s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel because the inmate made only conclusory allegations, and all of evidence indicated that the inmate’s counsel acted capably. Berry v. State, 924 So. 2d 624, 2006 Miss. App. LEXIS 179 (Miss. Ct. App. 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the counsel who represented the inmate had previously prosecuted him on similar charges, the inmate failed to establish that he was deprived of effective assistance of counsel because the inmate did not prove prejudice.

      </p>
      <p>
       Inmate was not able to establish that his attorney rendered ineffective assistance of counsel prior to entering a guilty plea as his attorney was successful in getting other felony charges dismissed, and the inmate stated at the plea hearing that he was satisfied with his attorney’s representation. Majors v. State, 946 So. 2d 369, 2006 Miss. App. LEXIS 199 (Miss. Ct. App. 2006), cert. denied, 947 So. 2d 960, 2007 Miss. LEXIS 50 (Miss. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       Denial of the inmate’s motion for post-conviction relief was proper; his counsel was not ineffective because the inmate’s argument that his attorney was not convincing enough since the judge ruled against him did not show deficient performance under Strickland. The inmate had credited his counsel with making the correct arguments before the judge. Jones v. State, 922 So. 2d 31, 2006 Miss. App. LEXIS 103 (Miss. Ct. App. 2006).

       <p>
   Although petitioner claimed that she was denied her right to effective assistance of counsel under the Sixth Amendment and Miss. Const. Art. 3, § 26, due to her counsel’s failure to actively pursue a change of venue, generally conduct an investigation of her case, conduct an adequate investigation in preparation for the guilt-innocence phase and the sentencing phase of her trial, and to object and preserve for appeal purposes the prosecutor’s improper comments during the guilt phase of the trial, the court had determined each of petitioner’s arguments was without merit because, in her efforts to meet the Strickland test criteria, petitioner failed to demonstrate that her trial counsel’s actions were deficient and that the deficiency prejudiced the defense of her case. Unless petitioner made both showings, it could not be said that the conviction or death sentence resulted from a breakdown in the adversary process that rendered the result unreliable. Byrom v. State, 927 So. 2d 709, 2006 Miss. LEXIS 43 (Miss.), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">549 U.S. 1056</cite>, <cite class="s_court">127 S. Ct. 662</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">166 L.

       Appellate court affirmed defendant’s conviction for the sale of a controlled substance and marijuana because even if defendant’s counsel’s performance was deficient, defendant was not prejudiced by it given that the drug transaction was videotaped and shown to the jury and the confidential informant testified against defendant. Westbrook v. State, 928 So. 2d 186, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 711 (Miss. Ct. App. 2005), cert. denied, 929 So. 2d 923, 2006 Miss. LEXIS 243 (Miss. 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant, to prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance, had to show deficiency of counsel’s performance and that the deficiency prejudiced his defense; there was a lack of evidence within the record that there was a reasonable probability of a different outcome, but for counsel’s alleged errors. Preuett v. State, 879 So. 2d 1116, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 782 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. dismissed, 883 So. 2d 1180, 2004 Miss. LEXIS 1337 (Miss. 2004).

   Mississippi Supreme Court utilizes the two-prong approach under Strickland when evaluating ineffective assistance of counsel claims, even in death penalty cases. Neither the Mississippi Supreme Court, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, nor the United States Supreme Court have ever recognized the “super due process” test. Branch v.

       In a sexual battery case, the inmate’s trial counsel was not ineffective for asking for several continuances. When the inmate himself claimed that he was incompetent to proceed at trial, it was frivolous for him to claim that he was prejudiced by postponing his trial so that he could undergo psychiatric evaluations.

      </p>
      <p>
       Under Strickland, test to be applied in cases involving alleged ineffectiveness of counsel is (1) whether counsel’s overall performance was deficient and (2) whether deficient performance, if any, prejudiced defense. Cole v. State, 666 So. 2d 767, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 595 (Miss. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       Claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is judged by whether counsel’s performance was deficient, and, if so, whether deficient performance was prejudicial to defendant in sense that court’s confidence in correctness of outcome is undermined. Roland v. State, 666 So. 2d 747, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 600 (Miss. 1995).
      </p>

       While effective assistance of counsel is not errorless counsel, counsel must perform services that are reasonably adequate. Counsel is ineffective if he fails to investigate sources of evidence which may be helpful to the defense. Jones v. Thigpen, 555 F. Supp. 870, 1983 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19724 (S.D. Miss. 1983), aff'd in part and rev'd in part, 741 F.2d 805, 1984 U.S. App. LEXIS 18556 (5th Cir. Miss. 1984).

   Issues of an involuntary guilty plea, ineffective assistance of counsel, a defective and improper indictment, and misconduct on the part of the state officials that were presented by an inmate in a motion for post-conviction relief, were procedurally barred because the inmate waited more than six years after the inmate was convicted to file the motion; furthermore, the trial court found that none of the exceptions to the three-year statute of limitations of Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.99.html#t99c39s99-39-5ol12" target="_blank">99-39-5(2)</a></cite> were applicable, and thus the inmate was not entitled to post-conviction relief. Davis v. State, 958 So. 2d 252, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 367 (Miss. Ct. App. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a post-conviction proceeding, an inmate’s argument that he was denied effective assistance of counsel at his trial for burglary of a dwelling was waived because the issue was procedurally barred, where the inmate had a meaningful opportunity on direct appeal to raise a claimed error by his trial counsel; further, there was no plain error in the inmate’s trial counsel’s failure to raise the issue of whether a vacant house owned by a nursing home resident was a “dwelling” because there was an intent for it to function as a dwelling. Sheffield v. State, 881 So. 2d 249, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 998 (Miss. Ct. App. 2003), cert. dismissed, 2005 Miss. LEXIS 87 (Miss. Feb. 3, 2005).

       Under Mississippi law, failure to raise ineffective assistance of counsel claim on direct review does not constitute procedural bar where litigant was represented by same counsel at trial and on direct appeal. Martin v. Maxey, 98 F.3d 844, 1996 U.S. App. LEXIS 28836 (5th Cir. Miss. 1996).

       Defendant’s ineffective assistance of counsel argument was rebutted by a lack of evidence, as well his own statements, and a prisoner’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim was without merit when the only proof offered of the claim was the prisoner’s own affidavit. Starks v. State, 992 So. 2d 1245, 2008 Miss. App. LEXIS 632 (Miss. Ct. App. 2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant’s request for post-conviction relief was denied as the circuit court did not err in holding that defendant adequately waived his right to conflict-free counsel and, under the Sixth Amendment, defendant did not show that, but for his attorney’s performance, the trial would have ended in a different result as counsel’s conduct was not ineffective. Dupuis v. State, 972 So. 2d 7, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 782 (Miss. Ct. App. 2007), cert. dismissed, 166 So.3d 23, 2012 Miss. LEXIS 651 (Miss. 2012).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant did not cite any actions by his counsel that supported an argument that the attorney’s performance was deficient or to show how his attorney’s performance was prejudicial to him. Jones v. State, 904 So. 2d 1107, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 977 (Miss. Ct. App. – 2004), writ of certiorari denied by 898 So. 2d 679, 2005 Miss. LEXIS 249 (Miss. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant’s claim that his counsel’s failure to make certain objections at trial constituted ineffective assistance was without merit where his claim was insufficient to rebut the presumption that his counsel was competent and conducted trial in a reasonable manner; proper evaluation of defendant’s other two contentions required an examination of evidence beyond the record before the appellate court, and for that reason, defendant’s entire ineffective assistance claim was better considered in post-conviction relief. Porter v. State, 885 So. 2d 92, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 952 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Appellate court declined to consider defendant’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim because the issue was not presented to the trial court, nor did defendant cite any authority in support of a claim that defense counsel’s failure to object to the prosecutor’s closing argument amounted to ineffective assistance of counsel. Stubbs v. State, 878 So. 2d 130, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 31 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 878 So. 2d 67, 2004 Miss. LEXIS 936 (Miss. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant did not prove ineffective assistance of counsel where defendant’s assertion that he wanted to go to trial and so advised his attorney was belied by the transcript of the plea hearing which stated that defendant indicated to the trial judge that he did not want to go to trial; defendant was given the opportunity to present his case to the trial court and present any complaints to the trial court regarding his attorney’s advice, which he did not do, but rather expressed satisfaction with the representation of his attorney. Hill v. State, 850 So. 2d 223, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 655 (Miss. Ct. App. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel where, although defendant received erroneous advice from his lawyer concerning the length of the sentence he might receive pursuant to his guilty plea, the attorney advised the judge of the misinformation during the hearing; when defendant was asked if he understood what the correct sentence was, he responded that he did. Johnson v. State, 848 So. 2d 906, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 588 (Miss. Ct. App. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       The defendant failed to allege ineffective assistance of counsel with sufficient specificity where he alleged that his attorney coerced him into pleading guilty and did not advise him of the correct status of his case, but neither stated the manner in which his attorney coerced him nor detailed in what way he was unaware of the correct status of his case. Ellis v. State, 811 So. 2d 296, 2001 Miss. App. LEXIS 18 (Miss. Ct. App. 2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       To be entitled to evidentiary hearing on merits of ineffectiveness of counsel claim, defendant must establish prima facie claim on both prongs of Strickland test by alleging with specificity and detail that his counsel’s performance was deficient and that the deficient performance prejudiced defense so as to deprive him of fundamentally fair trial. Cole v. State, 666 So. 2d 767, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 595 (Miss. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant who alleges that trial counsel’s failure to investigate constituted ineffectiveness must also state with particularity what investigation would have revealed and specify how it would have altered outcome of trial or how such additional investigation would have significantly aided his cause at trial.

       Nothing in the record rebutted the presumption that defendant’s attorney’s decision not to call witnesses was sound trial strategy, and defendant presented no evidence that the victim impact statement was inaccurate; defendant presented no evidence that there was any agreement that the State would not argue for the maximum sentence, and defendant received the agreed recommendation. Martin v. State, 20 So.3d 734, 2009 Miss. App. LEXIS 467 (Miss. Ct. App. 2009), cert. dismissed, 24 So.3d 1038, 2010 Miss. LEXIS 21 (Miss. 2010).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court properly denied defendant’s motion for postconviction relief after defendant was convicted of child molestation because it was not evident that, but for counsel’s decision to abstain from using defendant’s sister or her husband as witnesses, the outcome of the trial would have been different or that counsel’s decisions stemmed from anything other than strategy. Didon v. State, 7 So.3d 978, 2009 Miss. App. LEXIS 190 (Miss. Ct. App. 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a case involving the sale of cocaine, defendant did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel because it was not ruled out that a cross-examination regarding an informant’s previous trips to defendant’s house and a stipulation to the conviction of a third party who also sold drugs to the informant were just sound trial strategy. Liddell v. State, 7 So.3d 217, 2009 Miss. LEXIS 107 (Miss. 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant did not demonstrate that trial counsel was ineffective where he did not demonstrate how he was prejudiced by his attorney’s failure to object to a witness’s testimony, and defendant’s crime had not been publicized to a point where a change of venue was needed; trial counsel was not ineffective in not calling a witness to testify on defendant’s behalf as there was nothing in the statement that defendant claimed would show another shooter. Lamar v. State, 983 So. 2d 364, 2008 Miss. App. LEXIS 344 (Miss. Ct. App. 2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       Appellate court presumed that counsel’s actions were strategic and therefore within the realm of effective assistance when he elicited harmful testimony from a drug-testing expert during a prisoner’s probation revocation hearing; on cross-examination, counsel asked the expert how long marijuana remains in a person’s system. In so doing, counsel could have been trying to demonstrate that, given the prisoner’s body weight and fat content, marijuana would have remained in his system longer than it would have remained in another person’s system; given the presumptions involved, it appeared that counsel was making the only argument possible under the circumstances. Wallace v. State, 982 So. 2d 1027, 2008 Miss. App. LEXIS 332 (Miss. Ct. App. 2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       Denial of defendant’s motion for a new trial after he had been convicted of aggravated assault and rape was appropriate because his counsel was not ineffective; defendant’s prior convictions surfaced as a product of his impeachment regarding his assertions of an ongoing, consensual sexual relationship with the victim, and counsel’s decision whether to request a limiting instruction regarding a part of the evidence against defendant might have been part of the trial strategy. Moss v. State, 977 So. 2d 1201, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 632 (Miss. Ct. App. 2007), cert. denied, 977 So. 2d 1144, 2008 Miss. LEXIS 151 (Miss. 2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defense counsel was not ineffective for failing to cross-examine two witnesses concerning DNA evidence as defendant’s right to confrontation was not violated by trial counsel’s failure to cross-examine those witnesses because the reports they testified about were actually prepared by them, contrary to defendant’s arguments; thus, defense counsel’s decision not to cross-examine those two witnesses, as well as the other witnesses he chose not to cross-examine, was a tactical decision and could not be said to be unreasonable. Golden v. State, 968 So. 2d 378, 2007 Miss. LEXIS 530 (Miss. 2007), cert. dismissed, 977 So. 2d 343, 2008 Miss. LEXIS 111 (Miss. 2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial counsel was not ineffective because he filed a motion in limine to exclude the alleged prior bad acts from the jury, and counsel’s decision not to seek an instruction stating that the testimony regarding the charges was to be considered solely to establish defendant’s motive for murdering the victim was a strategic one. Jones v. State, 962 So. 2d 1263, 2007 Miss. LEXIS 473 (Miss. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant failed to satisfy the deficiency prong of the Strickland analysis where the shirt and gun were relevant evidence because he wore the shirt and had the gun that night and both were similar to the limited descriptions the victims gave; trial counsel’s failure to object in the case was reasonable trial strategy as trial counsel set out to impeach the identifications. Jackson v. State, 969 So. 2d 124, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 472 (Miss. Ct. App. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Defendant failed to show that he received ineffective assistance of counsel when trial counsel did not move for a change of venue in a capital case because the record did not support the allegation regarding pre-trial publicity, and there was no right to change venue to a jurisdiction with certain racial demographics. Howard v. State, 945 So. 2d 326, 2006 Miss. LEXIS 531 (Miss. 2006), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">552 U.S. 829</cite>, <cite class="s_court">128 S. Ct. 49</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">169 L.

      <p>
       In a murder case, defendant failed to show that he received ineffective assistance of counsel based on a failure to object to certain statements regarding the copying of keys and the failure to call the victim’s former girlfriend; defendant failed to show that the statements were relevant, and the choice not to call a witness was merely trial strategy. Sipp v. State, 936 So. 2d 326, 2006 Miss. LEXIS 336 (Miss. 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Defendant alleged that his counsel was ineffective because his counsel developed a trial strategy and then did not investigate, secure expert assistance, offer any evidence in support of the theory, or request a jury instruction in support of the theory; however, his ineffective assistance of counsel claim failed because (1) counsel attacked the weakness of the State’s case by adducing testimony on cross-examination that a sexual assault kit from the victim testing for any of defendant’s DNA in her came back negative; (2) counsel did make a request for a pathologist at state expense for assistance in interpreting the autopsy report, but the trial court exercised its discretion in refusing defense counsel’s request for an independent evaluation, and the trial court’s actions in denying defendant an expert did not deny him a fair trial; and (3) counsel’s decision not to submit lesser offense jury instructions, while it turned out to be unsuccessful (if successful, then defendant would not have been guilty of any offense and a free man), was appropriate trial strategy, and, thus, beyond the realm of serious consideration on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Havard v. State, 928 So. 2d 771, 2006 Miss. LEXIS 90 (Miss. 2006), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">549 U.S. 1119</cite>, <cite class="s_court">127 S. Ct. 931</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">166 L.

      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant alleged that he was denied his constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel, but the aid given by defendant’s trial counsel was effective and presented no basis for reversal on appeal because (1) the testimony at trial clearly indicated that the victim’s body had been moved and that any knife which might have been at the crime scene was not found until later; (2) during cross-examination, defendant’s counsel strongly questioned law enforcement as to how thorough their search and investigation of the scene was; (3) defendant failed utterly to demonstrate that character witnesses would have changed the outcome in his case, and he presented no evidence indicating that the failure to call character witnesses prejudiced his defense; (4) counsel’s decision, not to ask that the jury be allowed to view the crime scene, fell within the ambit of reasonable trial strategy; (5) the decision of trial counsel to not discuss any violent incidents of the victim could very well have been predicated upon the fact that any violent propensities of defendant could then be brought out by the State; and (6) it was unclear from defendant’s argument what other evidence he would have had his counsel present regarding his self-defense claim. Sullinger v. State, 935 So. 2d 1067, 2006 Miss. App. LEXIS 25 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 936 So. 2d 367, 2006 Miss. LEXIS 423 (Miss. 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Defendant’s counsel did not provide ineffective assistance where, although the actions of defendant’s counsel were not error-free, the error of untimely witness disclosure was not so egregious as to undermine the confidence in the outcome; the disallowed alibi testimony was very weak, unpersuasive given the strength of the opposing evidence, and even contradictory; the evidence against defendant was very persuasive. Ransom v. State, 919 So. 2d 887, 2005 Miss. LEXIS 595 (Miss. 2005), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">548 U.S. 908</cite>, <cite class="s_court">126 S. Ct. 2931</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">165 L.

      </p>
      <p>
       Defense counsel was not ineffective for not filing for a change of venue in defendant’s arson trial; although only 13 of the 82 jury panelists had not heard about the case, only five of them expressed a fixed opinion on it, and all five were struck for cause. Moreover, a decision on whether or not to file a change of venue motion fell within the purview of trial strategy. McGee v. State, 907 So. 2d 380, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 62 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 910 So. 2d 574, 2005 Miss. LEXIS 450 (Miss. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a murder case, defendant’s trial counsel was not ineffective because (1) counsel’s failure to file a motion to suppress a witness from testifying did not require reversal as the State withdrew her as a witness and the trial court instructed the jury to disregard her testimony up to that point and to disregard her State’s remarks in its opening statement regarding the witness; (2) defense counsel’s opposition to a lesser-included manslaughter jury instruction was appropriate; (3) counsel’s failure to object to the State’s closing argument statement that the police had done a good job did not merit reversal; (4) trial counsel was not deficient in failing to investigate whose shoes were at the victim’s apartment because neither defendant nor any other witness testified that they saw anyone else at the apartment when the victim was shot; and (5) defendant did not show that the failure to reduce her many statements to writing amounted to ineffective assistance of counsel. Reynolds v. State, 913 So. 2d 290, 2005 Miss. LEXIS 258 (Miss. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       In defendant’s trial for sexual battery of a child, defense counsel was not ineffective for stating during voir dire that defendant could be released on a technicality even though the proof showed defendant guilty. There was no evidence that counsel’s actions were anything other than trial strategy. Renfrow v. State, 882 So. 2d 800, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 919 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant was not denied the effective assistance of counsel during trial for three counts of statutory rape because there was nothing in defendant’s claims that, even accepted as true, would have had the likely effect of changing the outcome of case; decisions that defendant complained of were strategic. Boggan v. State, 894 So. 2d 581, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 722 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004), cert. denied, 896 So. 2d 373, 2005 Miss. LEXIS 162 (Miss. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant failed to prove claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, because the fact that defendant’s attorney did not object when defendant thought he should have objected did not establish that the attorney’s performance was ineffective, and an exhibit was offered as proof that this was part of a trial strategy. Irons v. State, 886 So. 2d 726, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 277 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 887 So. 2d 183, 2004 Miss. LEXIS 1380 (Miss. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a capital murder case, counsel was not ineffective during the penalty phase regarding the evidence, venue, voir dire, jury verdict, competency, security measures, prosecutorial misconduct, mitigating circumstances, manner of execution, investigating, witnesses, experts, opening statement, or closing argument. Russell v. State, 849 So. 2d 95, 2003 Miss. LEXIS 297 (Miss. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a capital murder case, counsel was not ineffective at trial regarding the evidence, witnesses, Batson challenges, suppression of evidence, attorney-client privilege, voir dire, courtroom security, familiarity with capital cases, investigating, competency hearing, venue, opening statement, or closing argument. Russell v. State, 849 So. 2d 95, 2003 Miss. LEXIS 297 (Miss. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defense counsel’s failure to note the race of the jurors on the jury list did not raise an issue under Batson, nor was it ineffective representation, since it related to a matters of trial strategy.

      </p>
      <p>
       Defense counsel was not ineffective as the failure to request a change of venue and the failure to call certain witnesses were matters of strategy, and defendant failed to show that the hiring of a forensic expert would have changed the result of the trial. Roy v. State, 878 So. 2d 84, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 729 (Miss. Ct. App. 2003), cert. denied, 878 So. 2d 67, 2004 Miss. LEXIS 911 (Miss. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Appellate court properly held that defendant had failed to show what specific evidence a witness would have presented or how that evidence would have been relevant to the defense; therefore, the court would assume the decision not to call the witness was strictly a matter of trial strategy and not ineffective assistance of counsel Sharkey v. State, 856 So. 2d 545, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 428 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 859 So. 2d 1017, 2003 Miss. LEXIS 594 (Miss. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       During the sentencing phase in a capital murder case, defense counsel intentionally elicited testimony that petitioner had once been accused of sexually molesting a small child as part of a showing that petitioner’s psychological instability was evident at an earlier age; this fell within the realm of trial strategy and did not amount to ineffective assistance of counsel. McGilberry v. State, 843 So. 2d 21, 2003 Miss. LEXIS 93 (Miss. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       The defendant failed to establish ineffective assistance of counsel where the two issues he raised both pertained to trial strategy and he failed to show a deficiency in performance by trial counsel or that there was prejudice. Wilson v. State, 775 So. 2d 735, 2000 Miss. App. LEXIS 216 (Miss. Ct. App. 2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       The assistance rendered by defense counsel to the defendant was not ineffective since the alleged errors enumerated by the defendant were attributable to trial strategy and, therefore, were at his counsel’s discretion and, further, as there was no evidence that the defendant would not have been convicted but for the alleged errors of his counsel. Ruttley v. State, 746 So. 2d 872, 1998 Miss. App. LEXIS 1061 (Miss. Ct. App. 1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       The defendant failed to show ineffectiveness of counsel since, while he provided a lengthy listing of alleged errors, the majority of the purported errors were the result of trial strategy, and therefore were at his counsel’s discretion and, further, there was no claim by the defendant, much less any factual evidence in the trial court record, that he would not have been convicted but for the alleged errors of his trial counsel. Armstrong v. State, 726 So. 2d 258, 1998 Miss. App. LEXIS 1104 (Miss. Ct. App. 1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       The court rejected the contention that defense counsel was ineffective since the decision by trial counsel to discuss violence or force, although not an element of the crime, could be viewed as a strategic decision to attack the credibility of the victim. Winston v. State, 726 So. 2d 197, 1998 Miss. App. LEXIS 996 (Miss. Ct. App. 1998), aff'd in part and rev'd in part, 754 So. 2d 1154, 1999 Miss. LEXIS 368 (Miss. 1999).

       The court properly rejected the contention that counsel for the defendant in a murder prosecution was ineffective in failing to investigate whether the victim had powder burns on his hands, which the defendant claimed would support his assertion that he and the victim struggled over a gun and that the gun was fired several times, since there was no factual support in the record to support the defendant’s contention and counsel may have chosen not to investigate on the basis that the absence of powder burns would have discredited the defendant’s testimony. United States v. Sylvester, 143 F.3d 923, 1998 U.S. App. LEXIS 12810 (5th Cir. Miss. 1998).

       <p>
   Where the strategy of the defendant in a murder prosecution was to concede guilt and present evidence during the sentencing phase in mitigation of the sentence, the defendant was not denied effective assistance of counsel when his counsel effectively admitted his guilt during voir dire proceedings. Evans v. State, 725 So. 2d 613, 1997 Miss. LEXIS 389 (Miss. 1997), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">525 U.S. 1133</cite>, <cite class="s_court">119 S. Ct. 1097</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">143 L.

      </p>
      <p>
       Trial counsel’s failure during sentencing phase to present mitigating evidence concerning capital murder defendant’s diminished capacity did not constitute ineffective assistance, where omission could be seen as legitimate trial strategy. Chase v. State, 699 So. 2d 521, 1997 Miss. LEXIS 320 (Miss. 1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Counsel was not deficient in arguing to jury that justice was not justice unless it was complete justice and that defendant was taking all of the blame when it was not all his, as counsel did not explicitly concede guilt and was merely utilizing trial strategy of creating reasonable doubt that defendant did not commit the crime charged because it was done by others. Blue v. State, 674 So. 2d 1184, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 304 (Miss.), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">519 U.S. 1030</cite>, <cite class="s_court">117 S. Ct. 588</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">136 L.

      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Counsel was not deficient for arguing to the jury at the penalty phase “if you want to kill him, kill him,” as counsel was strategically attempting to argue that such a penalty would not punish or teach a lesson to the people who were primarily responsible for defendant’s shortcomings, including his mother, his grandmother, and society. Blue v. State, 674 So. 2d 1184, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 304 (Miss.), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">519 U.S. 1030</cite>, <cite class="s_court">117 S. Ct. 588</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">136 L.

      </p>
      <p>
       Counsel for capital murder defendant was not ineffective for failing to investigate and develop fact of defendant’s low intelligence quotient, where absence of that evidence did not reasonably undermine confidence in outcome of trial, in that it was merely additional evidence of defendant’s mental aptitude, since counsel argued that defendant had very minimal education and deprived childhood. Cole v. State, 666 So. 2d 767, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 595 (Miss. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       Strategic decision to pursue less than all plausible lines of defense will rarely, if ever, be deemed ineffective counsel, if counsel first adequately investigated the rejected alternative. Cole v. State, 666 So. 2d 767, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 595 (Miss. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       Counsel for capital murder defendant was not ineffective for failing to file certain motions, call certain witnesses, ask certain questions, and make certain objections, where counsel’s actions fell within ambit of trial strategy. Cole v. State, 666 So. 2d 767, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 595 (Miss. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       Counsel for capital murder defendant was not ineffective for failing to make offer of proof concerning excluded mitigation-of-sentence testimony about defendant’s religious convictions and effect on him of death of his stepchild, where the evidence was adequately established via testimony of other witnesses. Cole v. State, 666 So. 2d 767, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 595 (Miss. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant charged with sexual battery and attempted sexual battery was not denied effective assistance of counsel; record was replete with objections lodged by defense counsel, and defendant showed no prejudice from counsel’s decision to refrain from making opening statement, from counsel’s failure to offer instruction on theory of defense, and from counsel’s alleged inadequacy in jury selection. Hughes v. State, 665 So. 2d 852 (Miss. 1995), reh’g denied (Miss. Dec. 21, 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a prosecution for possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, the defendant was denied his constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel where the defense strategy was to admit guilt to the charge of simple possession of cocaine, but to deny any intent to sell or distribute, the defense counsel failed to object to evidence of the defendant’s past drug sales, which was the most damaging piece of evidence presented, he failed to preserve any objection relating to the sufficiency of the evidence for trial court or appellate review, and the evidence was insufficient as a matter of law to support the charge. Holland v. State, 656 So. 2d 1192, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 261 (Miss. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       A murder defendant’s trial counsel was not ineffective for arguing that the case was one of self-defense, even though the prosecution witnesses were consistent in testifying that the defendant initiated the confrontation that lead to the victim’s death so that, with the benefit of hindsight, it was apparent that a self-defense argument did not have a strong possibility of success, where the defendant failed to show that his trial counsel’s arguments and strategy were deficient as judged from the time offered, and there was no significant probability that the result would have been different but for the alleged errors of trial counsel since the evidence against the defendant was substantial. Brown v. State, 626 So. 2d 114, 1993 Miss. LEXIS 478 (Miss. 1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       An attorney did not render ineffective assistance merely because he did not put the defendant on the witness stand during a hearing on the defendant’s motion to suppress his confession, since the attorney’s decision to keep the defendant off the stand may have been a deliberate trial strategy. Even if the attorney made a mistake, it did not rise to the level of ineffective assistance of counsel necessary to violate the Sixth Amendment right to counsel; there is a strong presumption that an attorney’s performance was within the wide range of reasonable, professional, and acceptable conduct. Mohr v. State, 584 So. 2d 426, 1991 Miss. LEXIS 481 (Miss. 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       A defense counsel’s failure to pursue an alibi defense was not unsound trial strategy, and therefore did not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel, where the defendant had admitted to the offenses but challenged the dates in the indictment as being incorrect. Schmitt v. State, 560 So. 2d 148, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 62 (Miss. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       The mere fact that an attorney did not file a motion for discovery is not sufficient to raise an ineffective assistance of counsel claim since the filing of pre-trial motions falls squarely within the ambit of trial strategy. Powell v. State, 536 So. 2d 13, 1988 Miss. LEXIS 587 (Miss. 1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       Ineffective assistance of counsel claim based on allegations concerning failure to investigate for mitigating evidence and failure to perform sufficient research was not borne out where attorney testified he was well aware of defendant’s background due to his personal acquaintance with him, co-counsel testified that witnesses had been interviewed, and both attorneys testified that co-counsel had performed necessary legal research. Stringer v. Scroggy, 675 F. Supp. 356, 1987 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11203 (S.D. Miss. 1987), aff'd, 862 F.2d 1108, 1988 U.S. App. LEXIS 17949 (5th Cir. Miss. 1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Ineffective assistance of counsel was not shown where defendant argued that counsel made decision to pursue defense of lack of intent to kill, but failed to follow up on this strategic choice, where counsel elicited evidence of defendant’s having “shot up” to negate argument that defendant intended to kill. Wiley v. State, 517 So. 2d 1373, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2915 (Miss. 1987), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">486 U.S. 1036</cite>, <cite class="s_court">108 S. Ct. 2024</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">100 L.

      </p>
      <p>
       Claim that failure to voir dire pathologists relating to their credentials constituted ineffective assistance of counsel failed where one pathologist’s credentials were beyond question and defendant failed to produce any evidence that other pathologist was not qualified; defendant’s allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel based on failure to cross-examine on merits on cause-of-death issue also failed because this was trial counsel’s decision that there was “nothing to gain” by such cross-examination because it would do nothing but allow reception of facts and bolster damaging testimony in minds of jurors. Merritt v. State, 517 So. 2d 517, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2875 (Miss. 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       Claim that counsel was ineffective at trial because defendant did not take stand in his own defense was not supported where there was no suggestion that defendant insisted upon taking stand and was precluded from doing so by counsel or court; defendant was advised by his attorney that he should not take stand because he would not be good or effective witness on his own behalf and cross-examination would bring out information that would be highly damaging. Merritt v. State, 517 So. 2d 517, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2875 (Miss. 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       In prosecution for capital murder committed during robbery, defendant was not subjected to ineffective assistance of counsel during guilt and sentencing stages, where counsel’s decisions to emphasize defendant’s youth, have defendant make unsworn statement to jury rather than testify and be subjected to cross examination, and forego character witness testimony for purposes of precluding rebuttal were strategic and within range of constitutionally competent representation and, assuming inadequate representation, case’s outcome would not have been affected. King v. State, 503 So. 2d 271, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2343 (Miss. 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Defense counsel in capital case in which evidence of guilt is overwhelming is not constitutionally inadequate in seeking merely to ameliorate force of prosecution’s case rather than vigorously pursuing defense.

       Petitioner could not show that his trial counsel was deficient for failing presenting a mitigation argument or that emphasizing petitioner’s experiences in a juvenile training facility or adult prison would have led to a different outcome because his prolonged institutionalization and incarceration was strategic; by not focusing on petitioner’s living conditions while in juvenile or adult facilities, counsel kept the State from counter attacking with his criminal history.

      <p>
       Petitioner could not show that the outcome would have been different if an expert had been presented on executive functioning because the more specific executive-functioning testimony proposed by his new expert would not have significantly differed or added to original expert’s testimony; counsel reasonably investigated petitioner’s background and the impact it had on his development and behavior.

      </p>
      <p>
       In appellant’s capital murder case, counsel was not ineffective for failing to obtain the State’s witness’s criminal history because the witness’s felony conviction occurred in 1983, almost seventeen years before the crime at issue, and whether impeachment of the witness concerning his seventeen-year-old conviction for burglary would have been admissible was doubtful. Additionally, the witness was examined thoroughly and extensively about his identification of appellant and about the lighting and other visibility factors. Howell v.

      </p>
      <p>
       During defendant’s murder trial, it was reasonable for defense counsel not to hire an expert witness to discover whether there was evidence of another shooter who might have killed the victim where defendant confessed to shooting the victim three times, which was consistent with evidence presented in the autopsy report and witnesses’ testimony.

       In defendant’s trial for capital murder, defendant alleged that her trial counsel was ineffective, but defendant’s allegations, which were unsupported by evidence, were insufficient to rebut the presumption that counsel’s performance was reasonable; defendant claimed that witnesses were available to testify about the deceased child’s mother’s treatment of the child, but defendant did not provide any supporting affidavits from these witnesses.

       Petitioner was entitled to a post-conviction hearing on the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel as counsel’s untimely disclosure of some mitigation witnesses led to their exclusion from the sentencing phase of a capital murder trial, which the trial court even characterized as ineffective assistance of counsel; in addition, counsel failed to pursue petitioner’s mental retardation claim and to offer sufficient mitigating evidence.

       Defendant’s murder conviction was appropriate where his counsel was not ineffective. Defendant listed approximately 40 instances of leading questions asked by the State of the victim’s brother, a child, but defendant failed to state how those leading questions in any way prejudiced defendant.

      <p>
       Defendant raised an ineffective assistance of counsel claim where there was evidence of conflicting statements by the victim as to who poured boiling water on him and was enough to raise a reasonable doubt that defendant committed the offense; if defense counsel had investigated and presented evidence of defendant’s prior abuse by the victim, and of the abuse that defendant testified had taken place immediately prior to the incident, the inconsistencies in testimony of the victim’s mother and sister concerning those events, and the intervening circumstances of the victim’s death from respiratory failure, it was reasonable to conclude that the outcome of a jury trial may have been different.

   Defendant did not show ineffective assistance of counsel where trial counsel could not be faulted for failing to present mitigating evidence as to defendant’s mental retardation, as it did not exist; defendant’s argument as to counsel’s failure to challenge the aggravating circumstance was barred by res judicata and his other issues were without merit.

       Trial counsel did not provide ineffective assistance of counsel where although defendant asserted that his counsel failed to obtain and present at trial any evidence that was relevant to whether the rape and sexual battery occurred, he failed to mention what this evidence would have been or who the witnesses would have been that would have testified in his support; counsel provided a sound trial strategy and it was harmless error to admit evidence that defendant provided marijuana and alcohol to the victims, given the unequivocal testimony of the victims.

   In a capital murder case, the inmate’s counsel were not ineffective for failing (1) to object to the reintroduction of evidence from the guilt phase because the evidence was admissible; (2) to elicit testimony from the inmate’s mother that the sheriff and deputy were alone in the inmate’s room during their search; or (3) to obtain DNA evidence that could not procedurally be introduced.

   In a capital murder case, the inmate’s counsel were not ineffective for failing to properly develop and present mitigating evidence at trial because the inmate’s attorneys did present mitigating evidence to the jury that the inmate’s father was an abusive alcoholic; that the inmate’s mother and father had marital problems throughout his childhood; that the inmate himself was an alcoholic and drug addict; that that inmate was suffering from extreme mental and emotional disturbances on the night of the murders; and that the inmate’s capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct on the night of the murders was impaired.

   In a capital murder case, the inmate’s counsel were not ineffective for failing to introduce rebuttal evidence regarding the inmate’s interview with a journalist because evidence that the inmate was suicidal and suffered from severe depression might have backfired and might have made it easier for the jury to decide to sentence the inmate to death because he stated that he wanted to die and because counsel reasonably wanted to keep the information that the inmate had been previously sentenced to death from the jury.

      <p>
       <p>
   In a capital murder case, the inmate’s counsel were not ineffective for failing to introduce rebuttal evidence regarding the State’s experts because the inmate’s attorneys did call two doctors to testify on the inmate’s behalf and any failure to cross-examine the State’s doctors was not deficient because it could have bolstered the State’s doctors’ testimonies and given the State more ammunition. Wilcher v. State, 863 So. 2d 776, 2003 Miss. LEXIS 492 (Miss. 2003), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">542 U.S. 942</cite>, <cite class="s_court">124 S. Ct. 2917</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">159 L.

      </p>
      <p>
       No support existed for the defendant’s post-conviction claim that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel due to his counsel’s failure to fully investigate the facts of the defendant’s case and explore the possibility that various purported witnesses could have provided evidence tending to absolve the defendant from guilt because the defendant failed to show that any witnesses who could exonerate him existed and that the unavailability of potentially favorable witnesses was due to the defense counsel’s failure to adequately pursue this avenue of defense. Davidson v. State, 850 So. 2d 158, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 493 (Miss. Ct. App. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       Petition for postconviction relief was properly denied because an inmate did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel when counsel failed to pursue an insanity defense after a psychiatric report did not reveal any evidence of insanity; moreover, even if counsel improperly told the inmate not to mention medications during the plea process, there was no evidence that the outcome of the case was affected, and any misconception regarding counsel’s advice about the inmate’s sentence was corrected by the trial court. Daughtery v. State, 847 So. 2d 284, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 504 (Miss. Ct. App. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant had to show a deficiency of counsel’s performance sufficient to constitute prejudice to his defense; however, the record was void of evidence to establish a claim of ineffective assistance. Sanders v. State, 847 So. 2d 903, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 543 (Miss. Ct. App. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       Court rejected defendant’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel because a review of the record revealed no deficiency in defense counsel’s performance, who zealously cross-examined witnesses and properly conducted a defense. Lott v. State, 844 So. 2d 502, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 380 (Miss. Ct. App. 2003).

      <p>
       In the light of testimony by the 10 year old victim that the defendant engaged in sexual intercourse with her and testimony by a physician that he found evidence of sexual contact when examining the victim, the failure of defense counsel to present allegedly exculpatory evidence that the victim, but not the defendant, had chlamydia did not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel in the defendant’s prosecution for rape. Wiltcher v. State, 724 So. 2d 933, 1998 Miss. App. LEXIS 963 (Miss. Ct. App. 1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial counsel’s failure during guilt phase to present evidence concerning capital murder defendant’s diminished capacity did not constitute ineffective assistance, where defendant did not raise insanity defense. Chase v. State, 699 So. 2d 521, 1997 Miss. LEXIS 320 (Miss. 1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial counsel’s failure to introduce evidence of capital murder defendant’s diminished capacity at suppression hearing did not constitute ineffective assistance, where suppression hearing was held prior to order which directed psychologist to examine defendant and date of psychologist’s report mentioning defendant’s diminished capacity. Chase v. State, 699 So. 2d 521, 1997 Miss. LEXIS 320 (Miss. 1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial counsel’s failure at trial to use psychologist’s report, indicating capital murder defendant’s diminished capacity, to explain defendant’s particular vulnerability to police coercion in effort to avoid admission of defendant’s statement to police that when he entered home one victim was already tied up and that he did not participate in ransacking house or killing other victim did not constitute ineffective assistance, where statement was similar to trial testimony, statement’s value was primarily to impeach defendant, and trial court was privy to report at time of trial. Chase v. State, 699 So. 2d 521, 1997 Miss. LEXIS 320 (Miss. 1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       A defendant who alleged that he was denied effective assistance of counsel in a capital murder prosecution due to his counsel’s refusal to allow him to testify was entitled to an evidentiary hearing on his claim that he was denied the right to take the witness stand and testify on his own behalf.

       Based on case law as it existed at time of trial, counsel’s refusal to take chance on waiving objection to wife’s testimony by indulging in cross-examination of her did not render his assistance constitutionally inadequate.

       Waiting until a date close to trial to request discovery is not per se deficient performance of counsel. Therefore, in a statutory rape case, ineffective assistance of counsel was not shown where discovery from the State was received a week before trial; even assuming that trial counsel was deficient, defendant failed to explain how his defense was prejudiced by the timing of his counsel’s discovery motion since he was not surprised by any of the evidence. Giles v. State, 187 So.3d 116, 2016 Miss. LEXIS 122 (Miss. 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a statutory rape case, ineffective assistance claims based on failure to investigate, failure to reciprocate discovery, and failure to identify and call additional alibi witnesses, and the question of whether defendant was prejudiced by the totality of counsel’s performance were not based on facts fully apparent from the record. The arguments could have been made in a petition for postconviction relief. Giles v. State, 187 So.3d 116, 2016 Miss. LEXIS 122 (Miss. 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a statutory rape case, counsel was deficient in failing to notify the State about the witnesses he planned to call, but because defendant made no proffer of witness testimony, it was impossible for an appellate court to know, without engaging in wild speculation, whether this omission had any impact on the outcome of the trial. The claim was dismissed without prejudice to the ability to raise it in appropriate post-conviction proceedings. Giles v. State, 187 So.3d 116, 2016 Miss. LEXIS 122 (Miss. 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant’s claim that counsel was ineffective for not interviewing defendant until the day before the trial was without merit; counsel was able to procure a sentencing deal where defendant would not be sentenced as a habitual offender and arranged for the dismissal of another charge with a potential 60-year sentence. Thompson v. State, 10 So.3d 525, 2009 Miss. App. LEXIS 48 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 17 So.3d 99, 2009 Miss. LEXIS 424 (Miss. 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       Record did not affirmatively show ineffective assistance of counsel of constitutional dimensions where a very thorough motion for pre-trial discovery was in fact made, and defendant failed to identify any witnesses who should have been interviewed or whose testimony would have strengthened his defense; defendant identified no aspect of his attorney’s performance that suggested a failure to investigate the circumstances and law surrounding his case, and the sentence defendant received was in accord with the applicable statutes. Wynn v. State, 964 So. 2d 1196, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 592 (Miss. Ct. App. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant’s conviction for burglary of a business was appropriate in part because the record was insufficient to resolve defendant’s claim that his attorney was ineffective for not reviewing a surveillance video prior to cross-examining any of the prosecution’s first three witnesses; the record’s state rendered it impossible for the appellate court to examine defendant’s allegations. Turner v. State, 962 So. 2d 691, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 182 (Miss. Ct. App. 2007), cert. dismissed, 997 So. 2d 924, 2008 Miss. LEXIS 506 (Miss. 2008).

      <p>
       Defendant’s motion for post-conviction relief was properly denied where he failed to provide sufficient evidence demonstrating his attorney’s deficiency; defendant admitted in his brief that he could not name the witness that counsel should have interviewed, nor did he disclose the “mitigating information” that counsel allegedly failed to uncover. Jones v. State, 956 So. 2d 310, 2006 Miss. App. LEXIS 871 (Miss. Ct. App. 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Defendant’s request for post-conviction relief was denied on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel due to an alleged failure to investigate in general because that issue was procedurally barred; however, there was no ineffectiveness based on an alleged failure to investigate during the guilt phase of a capital murder trial since counsel would not have been able to determine that testimony would have been perjury, defendant did not have an alibi defense, and decisions regarding the examination of an expert were trial strategy where there was no showing that the expert was not qualified. Even though the failure to call a bite mark expert was ineffective, no prejudice was shown since there was no showing that defendant did not bite the victim. Howard v. State, 945 So. 2d 326, 2006 Miss. LEXIS 531 (Miss. 2006), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">552 U.S. 829</cite>, <cite class="s_court">128 S. Ct. 49</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">169 L.

      <p>
       Federal district court correctly denied state death row inmate’s habeas corpus petition because defense counsel was not ineffective for failing to adequately interview the government’s pathologist prior to cross-examining him; although the Mississippi Supreme Court erroneously indicated that counsel had interviewed the witness for only 15 minutes, the record clearly showed that counsel had talked to him the evening before cross-examination as well as for 15 minutes prior to that and had affirmatively indicated to the trial court the next morning that he felt he had had sufficient preparation time. Holland v. Anderson, 439 F. Supp. 2d 644, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 46788 (S.D. Miss. 2006).

      <p>
       Petition for post-conviction relief was denied without an evidentiary hearing where a plea was entered to armed robbery because, despite counsel’s failure to investigate the type of weapon actually used, no prejudice resulted since an inmate failed to show that he would have proceeded to trial. Hinton v. State, 947 So. 2d 979, 2006 Miss. App. LEXIS 381 (Miss. Ct. App. 2006), cert. denied, 947 So. 2d 960, 2007 Miss. LEXIS 94 (Miss. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       In an aggravated assault case, the court erred in finding that counsel was effective where counsel’s failure to investigate the case prejudiced defendant; the testimony of the alibi witnesses, coupled with the fact that there was absolutely no physical evidence to convict defendant, could very well have changed the outcome of the trial. Johns v. State, 926 So. 2d 188, 2006 Miss. LEXIS 180 (Miss. 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       Court rejected defendant’s claim that he was denied a fair and impartial trial because while the court found it troubling that five jurors served on the jury in which the witness testified as a victim and then served on defendant’s jury where the witness testified as the State’s primary rebuttal witness, the court found no reversible error. In absence of a showing on voir dire that a juror was biased, the mere fact that the witness had testified in the jurors’ presence as to another crime did not render the panel incompetent. Burnside v. State, 912 So. 2d 1018, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 204 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 921 So. 2d 344, 2005 Miss. LEXIS 679 (Miss. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant claimed that he received ineffective assistance of counsel because his attorney failed to conduct discovery, file certain pre-trial motions, subpoena certain alibi witnesses, request a continuance, properly instruct the jury, and make the proper arrangements for the processing of his appeal; however, defendant failed to demonstrate the likelihood of a different outcome had counsel performed in a different manner. In fact, the record revealed that the trial court disposed of many of the issues that defendant complained his attorney failed to address, and, although defendant’s attorneys were negligent in perfecting his appeal, he still failed to fulfill his obligation of demonstrating prejudice; thus, his ineffective assistance of counsel claim failed. Jackson v. State, 910 So. 2d 658, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 170 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 904 So. 2d 184, 2005 Miss. LEXIS 402 (Miss. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Claims that defense counsel was unprepared because he only had two meetings with defendant were rejected, as counsel filed pretrial motions, conducted voir dire, offered challenges for cause, provided compelling opening and closing statements, objected to the admission of certain evidence, and cross-examined witnesses. Under the Sixth Amendment, defendant was entitled to and received minimum competence and loyal assistance. Rinehart v. State, 883 So. 2d 573, 2004 Miss. LEXIS 1228 (Miss. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Record demonstrated that trial counsel’s performance was not deficient where trial counsel acted according to defendant’s instructions and his efforts to investigate potential mitigation evidence were thwarted by uncooperative witnesses; defendant also failed to prove there was a reasonable probability that the outcome would have been different. Burns v. State, 879 So. 2d 1000, 2004 Miss. LEXIS 722 (Miss. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Court found no merit in an inmate’s claim that counsel was ineffective for failing to adequately investigate, develop, and present mitigation evidence at the sentencing phase for capital murder; some of the proposed evidence would have been irrelevant or inadmissible, and most of the proposed testimony was testified to by the inmate’s mother, and there was a minimal showing of deficient performance and no assertion of prejudice. Smith v. State, 877 So. 2d 369, 2004 Miss. LEXIS 547 (Miss. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       With respect to the claim that counsel failed to investigate, defendant provided no evidence or even assertions of what exactly counsel should have investigated or how such investigation would have impacted his case favorably; in the absence of any coercive behavior, counsel did not act incorrectly in offering an opinion, which in light of the State’s agreement to forgo life imprisonment, was based on more than reasonable probability. Garner v. State, 864 So. 2d 1005, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 44 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Inmate’s post-conviction relief petition was properly denied because the inmate did not produce affidavits to show that defense counsel had failed to investigate two drug charges and to interview witnesses in the case before advising the inmate to plead guilty; moreover, the inmate had given a sworn statement contradicting these complaints at the plea hearing. Steen v. State, 868 So. 2d 1038, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 8 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a murder case, defendant was not denied effective assistance of counsel, because the denial of a continuance did not mean that counsel was unprepared, as counsel filed the necessary pretrial motions, conducted a voir dire examination, offered challenges for cause, provided compelling opening and closing statements, objected to the admission of certain evidence, and cross-examined witnesses. Rinehart v. State, 2003 Miss. LEXIS 558 (Miss. Oct. 23, 2003), op. withdrawn, sub. op., 883 So. 2d 573, 2004 Miss. LEXIS 1228 (Miss. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Trial counsel was ineffective in failing to investigate, gather, and consider mitigating evidence for purposes of presentation at the defendant’s sentencing hearing as most of the mitigating evidence was readily available and would have cost no more than several long distance telephone calls or postage stamps and there was a reasonable probability that a jury would not have been able to agree unanimously to impose the death penalty if this additional evidence had been effectively presented and explained to the sentencing jury; however, the defendant was, nevertheless, not entitled to federal habeas corpus relief because the contrary decision of the Mississippi Supreme Court did not involve an unreasonable application of the law. Neal v. Puckett, 286 F.3d 230, 2002 U.S. App. LEXIS 4236 (5th Cir. Miss. 2002), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">537 U.S. 1104</cite>, <cite class="s_court">123 S. Ct. 963</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">154 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 772, 2003 U.S. LEXIS 583 (U.S. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the court disagreed with the determination of the Mississippi Supreme Court with regard to whether defense counsel was ineffective in failing to thoroughly investigate the defendant’s background to uncover evidence of mitigating circumstances that could have been presented to the jury during the sentencing phase of the defendant’s murder trial, the defendant was not entitled to federal habeas corpus relief because the court owed deference to the Mississippi Supreme Court and that court’s conclusion was not an unreasonable application of Strickland v. Washington.
   Neal v. Puckett, 239 F.3d 683, 2001 U.S. App. LEXIS 659 (5th Cir. Miss. 2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       The defendant failed to establish that his trial counsel was not prepared to go to trial where, although defense counsel initially claimed to be unprepared, he changed his mind and said he could be prepared if the trial was postponed until that afternoon, and counsel demonstrated readiness for trial through thorough cross-examination and closing arguments. Robinson v. State, 784 So. 2d 966, 2000 Miss. App. LEXIS 571 (Miss. Ct. App. 2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defense counsel did not provide bad advice and/or fail to adequately prepare for trial where (1) prior to his entry of a guilty plea, he and his attorney appeared to have a lengthy discussion, during which his attorney advised him that there was a strong likelihood that he would be convicted should he elect to proceed to trial, and (2) when questioned by the trial court regarding his representation, the defendant stated that he was completely and totally satisfied with his representation. Blanch v. State, 760 So. 2d 820, 2000 Miss. App. LEXIS 227 (Miss. Ct. App. 2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that the court did not appoint counsel for the defendant until 10 days before trial did not result in the denial of effective assistance of trial counsel in the absence of any demonstration of prejudice. Johnson v. State, 749 So. 2d 306, 1999 Miss. App. LEXIS 585 (Miss. Ct. App. 1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where defendant’s first attorney’s alleged lack of effort on his behalf was serious enough to constitute an effective deprivation of the right of representation, there was nothing to suggest that the defendant’s second attorney was unable to do the necessary investigation and preparation to mount a meaningful defense at trial because of his predecessor’s alleged dilatory conduct. Bell v. State, 733 So. 2d 372, 1999 Miss. App. LEXIS 56 (Miss. Ct. App. 1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       The defendant was entitled leave to proceed on his claim that his counsel was ineffective in that he failed to move to quash the jury based on improper contact between prospective jurors and the District Attorney’s office and the guards at the county jail. Davis v. State, 743 So. 2d 326, 1999 Miss. LEXIS 224 (Miss. 1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       The court properly rejected the contention that the defendant was denied effective assistance of counsel on the basis that his attorney failed to file any pre-trial motions to appoint or obtain funds for an independent investigator, forensic pathologist or odontologist since there was no evidence that the attorney’s conduct fell outside the realm of reasonable professional assistance in seeking further expert assistance or that the defendant’s case was prejudiced thereby. Walters v. State, 720 So. 2d 856, 1998 Miss. LEXIS 393 (Miss. 1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant’s right to counsel was not violated, although trial judge ordered court-appointed counsel to proceed instead of defendant’s hired counsel, since judge made decision based on hired counsel’s unpreparedness, and court allowed hired counsel to assist and even participate in trial. Atterberry v. State, 667 So. 2d 622, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 630 (Miss. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       Counsel for capital murder defendant was not ineffective for failing to request continuance after prosecution called so-called “surprise” witness who subsequently identified defendant, where counsel interviewed witness for 25 minutes during recess called specifically for that purpose, and defendant showed nothing that continuance would have further gained. Cole v. State, 666 So. 2d 767, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 595 (Miss. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       A defendant was not denied his right to effective assistance of counsel on the ground that his attorney failed to file any motion for discovery where the defendant provided no evidence to show that the omission was anything other than his attorney’s trial strategy, there was no allegation of critical evidence that may have come to light as a result of discovery, the record did not reflect any surprise to the defendant’s attorney as a result of the State’s case, and the defense attorney was sufficiently familiar with the State’s case and its witnesses that a discovery motion would not have elicited any change in the defense. Ivy v. State, 589 So. 2d 1263, 1991 Miss. LEXIS 802 (Miss. 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       A defendant was denied effective assistance of counsel where his attorney failed to conduct discovery, failed to object to the admissibility of statements made by the defendant after he was questioned by a police officer without being advised of his Miranda rights, failed to inquire into the constitutionality of a warrantless, nonconsensual search of the defendant’s automobile, and failed to raise at the trial level the issue of a speedy trial, though the prosecution missed the statutory deadline for a speedy trial by 148 days. Barnes v. State, 577 So. 2d 840, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 822 (Miss. 1990), modified, 577 So. 2d 840 (Miss. 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       A defendant’s counsel was not ineffective at the guilt phase of a capital murder trial where the defense counsel adequately investigated, filing discovery motions and obtaining the State’s entire file, and there was no reasonable probability that the outcome of the trial would have been different had evidence been presented that the defendant’s accomplice, rather than the defendant, delivered the fatal injuries, because it was clearly established that the defendant was present at the planning and execution of the murder and was therefore a principal. State v. Tokman, 564 So. 2d 1339, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 232 (Miss. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       A criminal defendant was denied effective assistance of counsel where his attorney subpoenaed no witnesses until the day of trial, called only one witness, a police officer whom he questioned only briefly, submitted into evidence a police report that only reinforced the testimony of the State’s witness, failed to request a pre-trial suppression hearing concerning the “show-up” identification of the defendant, failed to file jury instructions, made absurd demands upon the State to produce at trial evidence that should have been available through discovery, made numerous argumentative outbursts with the bench and refused to follow rules and instructions of the court. Yarbrough v. State, 529 So. 2d 659, 1988 Miss. LEXIS 362 (Miss. 1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       Preparation of witnesses and defendant for their testimony by counsel was sufficient to constitute effective assistance where, because alibi was offered, entire question for injury was witness credibility. Stringer v. Scroggy, 675 F. Supp. 356, 1987 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11203 (S.D. Miss. 1987), aff'd, 862 F.2d 1108, 1988 U.S. App. LEXIS 17949 (5th Cir. Miss. 1988).

       <p>
   Ineffective assistance of counsel was not shown where defendant complained that counsel made absolutely no investigation of psychological evidence, while defendant submitted psychological evidence showing, inter alia, functional I.Q. of 73, lower academic I.Q., alcoholism, and genuine remorse for crime; as trial strategy, counsel could have judged that psychological report may have been harmful. Wiley v. State, 517 So. 2d 1373, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2915 (Miss. 1987), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">486 U.S. 1036</cite>, <cite class="s_court">108 S. Ct. 2024</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">100 L.

      <p>
       Failure of attorney to investigate background of former wife of defendant, who was important prosecution witness at defendant’s murder trial, did not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel where attorney had known defendant’s former wife’s family for many years and had interviewed her when he represented defendant in divorce action brought by her.

       Charge that counsel failed to interview prosecution witnesses did not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel where counsel attempted to talk with one witness who refused, adequately familiarized himself with report of doctor, and did not talk with another witness who lived out of state but who offered no testimony which surprised defense.

       Defendant’s trial counsel was not ineffective because: (1) he filed a pre-trial motion to sever the two counts of rape and argued at the hearing that trying two counts together would be highly prejudicial to his client; (2) counsel conducted voir dire, which included instructing the jury as to the state’s burden of proof; (3) he objected to one of the state’s for-cause strikes, arguing that the potential juror said he could be fair and impartial despite the fact he had known defendant his entire life, with which the trial court agreed; (4) defense counsel cross-examined four of the state’s eight witnesses and seemingly made an effort to get some witnesses to contradict their prior testimony; (5) the defense chose not to call any witnesses; (6) defendant was thoroughly advised of his right to testify and he told the trial judge he did not want to testify; and (7) in closing, defense counsel did not rehash the damaging testimony against his client, but merely reminded the jury of the state’s heavy burden of proof and defendant’s presumption of innocence; given the strength of the state’s case against defendant, trial counsel provided reasonable, if not perfect, representation to his client.

       Trial court properly denied defendant’s motion for post-conviction relief where defendant was not entitled to a jury of any particular racial composition; therefore, defendant could not show that counsel was deficient in failing to object to an all-white jury.

   Defendant’s counsel was not ineffective because a trial judge asked if any potential juror would automatically vote for or against the death penalty, and the trial judge requested that the attorneys not be redundant in their voir dire examination, keeping in mind the voir dire the court had conducted; honoring that request, defense counsel’s failure to pursue that line of questioning during voir dire did not constitute deficient performance that prejudiced the defense. Havard v. State, 928 So. 2d 771, 2006 Miss. LEXIS 90 (Miss. 2006), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">549 U.S. 1119</cite>, <cite class="s_court">127 S. Ct. 931</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">166 L.

       Defendant’s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel in his trial for tax evasion lacked merit; defendant failed to cite any authority supporting the claim that his counsel’s failure to request a change of venue demanded reversal. Defendant also failed to cite any authority to support his argument that defense counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to make a challenge during jury selection. King v. State, 897 So. 2d 981, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 689 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004), cert. denied, 896 So. 2d 373, 2005 Miss. LEXIS 224 (Miss. 2005).

       Court found no ineffective assistance of counsel in the failure of attorneys for an inmate to object to the State’s use of peremptory strikes in connection with the inmate’s capital murder trial because (1) the inmate failed to show any prejudice, and (2) the attorneys could well have thought that the State had adequate race neutral reasons for the State’s strikes, and there was no requirement that the attorneys had to make motions that they did not believe would succeed.

   Issue raised at trial and on direct appeal from an inmate’s capital murder conviction concerning the exclusion of a juror for failing to meet the qualifications of Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.13.html#t13c05s13-5-1" target="_blank">13-5-1</a></cite> was found to be without merit, and the issue was therefore barred pursuant to Miss.

Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.13.html#t13c05s13-5-1" target="_blank">13-5-1</a></cite>, then the attorneys were not ineffective for failing to object to the jurors’ dismissal, and in any event, the attorneys’ decisions regarding the final composition of the jury were generally determined to be matters of trial strategy.

   Trial counsel’s failure to raise Batson challenges to the prosecution’s exercise of peremptory challenges was not ineffective representation of counsel as it was a tactical decision based on the counsel’s understanding of the law and the inmate’s concurrence that he did not wish to have his selection of the jury challenged. Bell v. State, 879 So. 2d 423, 2004 Miss. LEXIS 543 (Miss. 2004), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">543 U.S. 1155</cite>, <cite class="s_court">125 S. Ct. 1301</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">161 L.

   Trial counsel failed to argue that the trial court erred in denying his request to to allow individually sequestered voir dire; however as the inmate failed to show that the request would have been allowed if the attorney had argued, or that a different jury panel would have resulted, the trial counsel’s failures did not constitute ineffective representation. Bell v. State, 879 So. 2d 423, 2004 Miss. LEXIS 543 (Miss. 2004), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">543 U.S. 1155</cite>, <cite class="s_court">125 S. Ct. 1301</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">161 L.

   Inmate was not deprived of effective representation simply because the trial counsel did not ask questions that the inmate believed was necessary to cure the judge’s voir dire as the questions the inmate wanted his counsel to ask would have been redundant, and the inmate failed to show how he was prejudiced by his counsel’s voir dire. Bell v. State, 879 So. 2d 423, 2004 Miss. LEXIS 543 (Miss. 2004), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">543 U.S. 1155</cite>, <cite class="s_court">125 S. Ct. 1301</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">161 L.

   Inmate was not deprived of effective representation because his trial counsel did not try to rehabilitate jurors who were excused because they stated they could not impose the death penalty due to religious reasons as the inmate failed to prove that the jurors could have been rehabilitated.

       <p>
   Inmate was not deprived of his right to effective representation because his trial counsel failed to excuse eight jury members who had relationships with the victim or his family or the law enforcement community, as mere acquaintance or even family relationships with parties or those related to parties is not sufficient to require that a juror be excused for cause. Bell v. State, 879 So. 2d 423, 2004 Miss. LEXIS 543 (Miss. 2004), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">543 U.S. 1155</cite>, <cite class="s_court">125 S. Ct. 1301</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">161 L.

   Trial counsel’s failure to request jury questionnaires was not ineffective representation as the inmate failed to cite any legal authority that not requesting jury questionnaires was ineffective representation. Bell v. State, 879 So. 2d 423, 2004 Miss. LEXIS 543 (Miss. 2004), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">543 U.S. 1155</cite>, <cite class="s_court">125 S. Ct. 1301</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">161 L.

       <p>
   In a capital murder case, the inmate did not prove that he was prejudiced in any fashion by his attorneys’ decision not to assert a Batson challenge, which might have been sound trial strategy; thus, the inmate’s counsel were not ineffective for failing to challenge the State’s use of peremptory challenges to exclude African-American venire members. Wilcher v. State, 863 So. 2d 776, 2003 Miss. LEXIS 492 (Miss. 2003), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">542 U.S. 942</cite>, <cite class="s_court">124 S. Ct. 2917</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">159 L.

       <p>
   In a capital murder case, the inmate’s counsel were not ineffective for failing to rehabilitate a potential juror challenged as opposing the death sentence because the evidence showed that the juror was not excused based on her religious scruples or her views on the death penalty, but because she clearly indicated that she could not sit in judgment on someone if she had not seen the crime committed and that she could not return a verdict. Wilcher v. State, 863 So. 2d 776, 2003 Miss. LEXIS 492 (Miss. 2003), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">542 U.S. 942</cite>, <cite class="s_court">124 S. Ct. 2917</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">159 L.

   In a capital murder case, the inmate’s counsel were not ineffective for removing a request for a special venire under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.13.html#t13c05s13-5-77" target="_blank">13-5-77</a></cite> because nothing in the record indicated that the jury panel was insufficient or that a special venire was necessary. Wilcher v. State, 863 So. 2d 776, 2003 Miss. LEXIS 492 (Miss. 2003), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">542 U.S. 942</cite>, <cite class="s_court">124 S. Ct. 2917</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">159 L.

      </p>
      <p>
       The record did not support the defendant’s contention that the failure of trial counsel to raise a Batson challenge rendered his counsel’s performance so ineffective as to merit a mistrial; given that the decision to make or not make a Batson challenge falls within trial counsel’s trial strategy and the wide latitude given him to which appellate courts must defer, it was entirely reasonable to presume that trial counsel was comfortable with that jury. Estes v. State, 782 So. 2d 1244, 2000 Miss. App. LEXIS 491 (Miss. Ct. App. 2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       An agreement between defense counsel and the state that neither will object to the other’s exercise of its peremptory challenges, while outrageous and improper, does not constitute per se ineffective assistance of counsel; such conduct will constitute ineffective assistance of counsel only if the record shows that the agreement caused the state clearly and systematically to discriminate in the jury selection process. Wardley v. State, 760 So. 2d 774, 1999 Miss. App. LEXIS 553 (Miss. Ct. App. 1999), cert. denied, 2000 Miss. LEXIS 270 (Miss. Dec. 6, 2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial counsel’s failure to obtain gender neutral reasons for peremptory strike against female did not constitute ineffective assistance, where trial was held years before United States Supreme Court held that Batson rule applied to gender-based discrimination. Chase v. State, 699 So. 2d 521, 1997 Miss. LEXIS 320 (Miss. 1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial counsel’s failure to object to prosecutor’s exercise of challenges to jurors for cause and trial court’s upholding of these challenges did not constitute ineffective assistance, where Supreme Court, on direct appeal, considered matter on merits and found jurors were properly excused. Chase v. State, 699 So. 2d 521, 1997 Miss. LEXIS 320 (Miss. 1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial counsel’s failure to excuse juror, after challenge for cause was denied, with peremptory challenge did not constitute ineffective assistance, where counsel engaged in reasonable trial strategy by using last peremptory challenge on next person on venire, whose daughter may have been enrolled in day care where murder victim’s relative worked, whose father was highway patrol and whose uncle was murder victim in unrelated crime. Chase v. State, 699 So. 2d 521, 1997 Miss. LEXIS 320 (Miss. 1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial counsel’s failure to object to excusal of prospective jurors outside presence of jury did not constitute ineffective assistance, where capital murder defendant failed to show that he was prejudiced or that confidence in trial would be undermined because of counsel’s failure to object. Chase v. State, 699 So. 2d 521, 1997 Miss. LEXIS 320 (Miss. 1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendants were denied effective assistance of counsel where their trial counsel failed to question the jury panel during voir dire, failed to make an opening statement, failed to object to questionable identification testimony, placed into evidence a photograph of the defendants taken at the police station while they were wearing handcuffs, failed to call available alibi defense witnesses, failed to assure that the defendants were aware of their right to testify, admitted during closing argument that he had failed to bring his trial notes to court, and failed to present available mitigation evidence at sentencing. Moody v. State, 644 So. 2d 451, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 512 (Miss. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial counsel’s conduct did not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel where counsel failed to rehabilitate or object to jurors excluded for cause by prosecution based on their opposition to death penalty, because there was little direct authority for proposition that trial counsel has duty to rehabilitate jurors who have scruples against death penalty. Stringer v. Scroggy, 675 F. Supp. 356, 1987 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11203 (S.D. Miss. 1987), aff'd, 862 F.2d 1108, 1988 U.S. App. LEXIS 17949 (5th Cir. Miss. 1988).

       Where indictments charging defendant with the sale of cocaine were not defective, there was no reason for defense counsel to object; hence, counsel was not ineffective. Hunt v. State, 11 So.3d 764, 2009 Miss. App. LEXIS 322 (Miss. Ct. App. 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant’s ineffective assistance claims against a court-appointed attorney failed where he failed to show how his defense was adversely affected by an indictment amendment that changed the date of the alleged burglaries.

      </p>
      <p>
       Defense counsel was not ineffective for failing to object to defendant’s indictment because the indictment was not fatally defective and during the plea colloquy defendant stated under oath that he was satisfied with counsel’s performance and felt that it was effective. Morgan v. State, 966 So. 2d 204, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 545 (Miss. Ct. App. 2007).
      </p>

       There was no merit to the defendant’s assertion that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to defects contained within the indictment where the defendant failed to identify any such defects and a review of the indictment failed to show any such defects. Blanch v. State, 760 So. 2d 820, 2000 Miss. App. LEXIS 227 (Miss. Ct. App. 2000).
      </p>

       Claims that defendant argued to be defects in the indictment were insufficient to show deficiency in his counsel’s performance or prejudice to his case. Westbrook v.

      </p>
      <p>
       The indictment as a whole gave the defendant fair notice of the charges against him and was legally sufficient; therefore, the failure of defense counsel to object to the indictment did not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel.

       Counsel was not ineffective for failing to object to the absence of the word “knowing” in indictment for aggravated assault which charged that defendant wilfully and feloniously caused serious bodily injury. Moore v. State, 676 So. 2d 244, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 328 (Miss. 1996).

      <p>
       A defendant’s post-conviction claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, which was based on allegations that the defendant’s counsel failed to object to allegedly defective indictments and erroneously advised the defendant to plead guilty, was properly dismissed without the benefit of an evidentiary hearing because it was manifestly without merit where the defendant failed to allege with the “specificity and detail” required that his counsel’s performance was deficient and that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense, the facts alleged and the brief submitted were not supported by any affidavits other than his own, the indictments were not defective and therefore the defendant’s counsel could not be faulted for failing to challenge their validity, and the defendant failed to identify the “deficient and erroneous advice” of his counsel that allegedly resulted in his pleas of guilty.

       Defense counsel was not ineffective for failing to present evidence that defendant and the victim were meeting in an unprofessional manner and failing to object to the State’s not introducing the items stolen during the burglary into evidence because no rule of law required the items taken in a burglary to be entered into evidence; the State alleged that defendant broke into the house with the intent to steal, but actually stealing items was not an element of burglary; the items were described particularly through direct testimony by two witnesses who personally saw them in the vehicle defendant was using; and an officer specifically identified his daughter’s antique clarinet in the photograph.

       Counsel was not ineffective for failing to contest the evidence the State offered at sentencing to prove defendant’s habitual offender status because counsel contested his habitual offender status on grounds that his prior convictions did not constitute crimes of violence; the ineffective assistance claim based on the failure to contest Tony’s habitual offender status was moot because the sentences were vacated and due to plain error on separate grounds. Swinney v. State, 241 So.3d 599, 2018 Miss. LEXIS 8 (Miss. 2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial counsel was not deficient for failing to object or seek a mistrial in response to a police chief’s testimony that defendant had declined to be interviewed because the chief’s testimony was offered by the State merely to show its effect on how he proceeded with his investigation of the robbery; counsel was not deficient for choosing not to object, and defendant suffered no prejudice as a result, due to other direct evidence of his guilt. Swinney v. State, 241 So.3d 599, 2018 Miss. LEXIS 8 (Miss. 2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a murder case, even if a statement was hearsay and should have been excluded, it was not probable that the outcome would have been different because of the overwhelming evidence of defendant’s guilt. Therefore, ineffective assistance of counsel was not shown. Hall v. State, — So.3d —, 2016 Miss. LEXIS 125 (Miss. Mar. 17, 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim on direct appeal lacked merit where it was based on the admission of the engineer’s testimony into evidence, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting that testimony, and thus, the record did not affirmatively show ineffective assistance. Fleming v. State, 179 So.3d 1160, 2015 Miss. App. LEXIS 201 (Miss. Ct. App.), rev'd, 179 So.3d 1115, 2015 Miss. LEXIS 611 (Miss. 2015).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a case involving the sale of cocaine, trial counsel was not ineffective for allowing an agent to testify that defendant’s voice was on an audio recording because the agent’s testimony was not subject to the authentication requirements under Miss. R. Evid. 901, and the failure of the State to lay a predicate for the testimony was harmless error since the agent testified on cross-examination that he had personal knowledge of defendant’s voice. Moreover, even assuming that trial counsel’s elicitation of the agent’s previous dealings with defendant was so deficient as to meet the first prong of the test for ineffective assistance of counsel, plenty of other evidence existed to support the jury’s verdict. Liddell v. State, 7 So.3d 217, 2009 Miss. LEXIS 107 (Miss. 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       In an armed robbery case, counsel was not ineffective for failing to request a circumstantial-evidence instruction because defendant was pulled over thirty minutes after the robbery, and he was wearing a tan shirt and distinctive white tennis shoes similar to the clothing described by the employees as being worn by the robber. Furthermore, defendant had brown cotton gloves, a blue ski mask, a black duffel bag with rolled coins, various amounts of bills, and store receipts. Johnson v. State, 999 So. 2d 360, 2008 Miss.

       Appellate court rejected a prisoner’s claim that counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to call an expert witness to testify at his probation revocation hearing about the levels of marijuana in the prisoner’s system because the prisoner did not show he was prejudiced by counsel’s alleged failure. Specifically, the prisoner was unable to demonstrate that the outcome of his probation revocation hearing would have been different, since the circuit court could have found, more likely than not, that the prisoner violated the terms of his probation by continuing to smoke marijuana.

       Although defendant claimed that his counsel was deficient because his attorney failed to object to the admission of the cocaine found on defendant, since the officer stated that the cocaine and its packaging all appeared the same as it did on the day he seized it, defendant’s counsel did not object; defendant’s counsel’s decision not to object to the admission of the cocaine into evidence was not ineffective assistance of counsel. Williams v. State, 907 So. 2d 1016, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 306 (Miss. Ct. App. 2005).

       Where defendant argued that defense counsel engaged in ineffective assistance of counsel under Miss. Const. Art. III, § 26 and U.S. Const. Amend. VI by failing to object to testimony regarding a hearsay statement that powder cocaine had been recovered from defendant when arrested, defendant was not prejudiced, as there was substantial other testimony on this point. Walker v. State, 880 So. 2d 1074, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 765 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).

       Defendant’s claim that his trial counsel was ineffective failed, as (1) even assuming counsel should have objected to evidence that defendant possessed drug paraphernalia, about which he was not charged, defendant was not prejudiced because the other evidence was sufficient to convict him of cocaine possession; and (2) had counsel sought to suppress cocaine found in defendant’s truck, he would have been unsuccessful. McKee v. State, 878 So. 2d 232, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 171 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 878 So. 2d 67, 2004 Miss. LEXIS 961 (Miss. 2004).

   Defense counsel at the evidence suppression hearing was not ineffective because the defense counsel’s performance regarding the admissibility and voluntariness of the defendant’s statements and the credibility of the interrogation were not deficient and the defendant was not therefore prejudiced by the defense counsel’s actions.

   Trial counsel’s failure to raise meritless objections could not be considered ineffective assistance of counsel because no prejudice could result from such an omission. Simon v.

   In a capital murder case, the inmate’s attorneys did attempt to limit the victim impact evidence and asked for a continuing objection to the prosecutor’s line of questioning, but the jury was entitled to know who the victim was and what impact her death had on her family; thus, the admission of the victim’s family’s testimony was proper and the inmate’s counsel were not ineffective for failing to limit the State’s use of victim impact evidence at trial and during the final argument. Wilcher v. State, 863 So. 2d 776, 2003 Miss. LEXIS 492 (Miss. 2003), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">542 U.S. 942</cite>, <cite class="s_court">124 S. Ct. 2917</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">159 L.

       <p>
   In a capital murder case, the inmate’s counsel were not ineffective for failing to challenge the testimony of the county sheriff who was in charge of the investigation of the inmate because (1) the trial court’s refusal to admit evidence of the sheriff’s conviction seven years after his testimony in the inmate’s case was not an abuse of discretion under Miss. R. Evid. 609(a)(1); (2) the sheriff’s prior testimony was admissible under Miss. R. Evid. 804; (3) the inmate’s confrontation clause rights were not violated because he had been present when the testimony was given and was able to confront the sheriff; and (4) evidence from a civil lawsuit involving one of the sheriff’s deputies could have done little harm to the sheriff’s credibility.

       Defense counsel’s failure to make a motion to suppress defendant’s statement during a murder trial did not amount to ineffective assistance of counsel because it constituted trial strategy.

       Defense counsel’s failure to object to the admission of a pipe as a murder weapon did not amount to ineffective assistance of counsel because a proper predicate was laid for the introduction of the pipe; the evidence showed that defense counsel attempted to discredit the evidence by exploiting the absence of physical and forensic evidence linking the pipe to the murder. Johnson v. State, 876 So. 2d 387, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 943 (Miss. Ct. App. 2003), cert. denied, 878 So. 2d 66, 2004 Miss. LEXIS 881 (Miss. 2004).

       Defense counsel’s failure to object to the admission of autopsy photographs did not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel; the evidence showed that the pictures were not particularly gruesome, and their probative value outweighed any prejudicial effect that they might have had.

       Trial counsel was not constitutionally ineffective in questioning the defendant about his prior convictions and in failing to move to suppress them prior to trial where the record showed that the trial judge instructed the defendant that his prior convictions could be brought out for the purpose of impeaching his credibility as a witness; although it was not clear why trial counsel elected to bring out the prior convictions, his strategy might have been to preempt the prosecution from bringing them out and the weight of the evidence was such that the defendant would have nevertheless been convicted.

       Defense counsel’s alleged failure to respond appropriately to the introduction of various kinds of evidence that were alleged to be so prejudicial that failure to object revealed inadequacy of representation did not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel.

       Defense counsel was not deficient in failing to object to inadmissible evidence, namely money recovered from the defendant and a cash register receipt recovered from his car, since probable cause existed to search both the defendant and his car, the money was never introduced into evidence, and the cash register receipt was introduced into evidence but was properly authenticated when the chief of police testified that he was present when the vehicle was searched, that the receipt was found on the driver’s seat of the vehicle, and that the receipt was taken to the victim’s house and compared to the groceries she bought.

      </p>
      <p>
       Questions regarding prior instances of sexual intercourse between the defendant and the 10 year old victim were probative and admissible and, therefore, the failure of defense counsel to object to such questions did not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel in the defendant’s prosecution for rape. Wiltcher v. State, 724 So. 2d 933, 1998 Miss. App. LEXIS 963 (Miss. Ct. App. 1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       The court properly rejected the contention that the defendant was denied effective assistance of counsel on the basis that his attorney failed to object to hearsay testimony by a detective that the defendant was in a rage and arguing with the victim since it could not be said that a mere objection to that testimony would have changed the outcome of the trial. Walters v. State, 720 So. 2d 856, 1998 Miss. LEXIS 393 (Miss. 1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial counsel’s failure to object to evidence of other crimes and eliciting evidence of other crimes did not constitute ineffective assistance, where allowing jury to know that defendant had engaged in some petty thievery was not out of line with strategy of showing that it was not credible to claim that defendant, a petty thief, suddenly became a murderer while codefendant, who was prone to violence, did not. Chase v. State, 699 So. 2d 521, 1997 Miss. LEXIS 320 (Miss. 1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial counsel’s failure during guilt phase to object to introduction of photograph of murder victim’s house and of victim did not constitute ineffective assistance; few times Supreme Court has ever reversed due to admission of gruesome photographs revealed that this would have been futile objection.

      <p>
       Trial counsel’s failure to object to cross-examination of witness who testified that capital murder defendant grew up in teachings of church did not constitute ineffective assistance, where defendant sought to use religion to bolster his position and defendant’s credibility was impeached through witness.

       Petitioner’s claim that his counsel failed to adequately argue motion to suppress evidence that was obtained in violation of his Fourth Amendment rights or to raise that issue on appeal would be remanded for district court to consider whether counsel was professionally deficient in failing to successfully move to suppress evidence and to determine whether exclusion of that evidence would have had effect on outcome of petitioner’s case, so as to establish cause and prejudice for procedural default.

       In a prosecution for possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, the defendant’s trial counsel was not constitutionally ineffective for failing to object to allegedly inadmissible testimony portraying the defendant as a drug dealer where the attorney’s failure to object to the testimony in question might reasonably have been trial strategy related to a “personal vendetta” defense since the attorney argued from the time of opening statements that a deputy sheriff had a vendetta against the defendant and there was support for the “vendetta” defense throughout the trial record, the attorney could have concluded that any objections to the testimony in question would have magnified the comments to the detriment of the defendant, and the defendant failed to demonstrate any prejudice as there was eyewitness testimony which was “sufficient to have absolutely sealed his fate with the jury.” Edwards v. State, 615 So. 2d 590, 1993 Miss. LEXIS 97 (Miss. 1993).

      <p>
       In a prosecution for possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, the defendant’s trial counsel was not constitutionally ineffective for failing to object to an admission made by the defendant at the scene of his arrest concerning his involvement in trafficking drugs where the admission was unsolicited, voluntary, and spontaneous, and the defendant’s attorney could have reasonably expected any objection to be futile.

       A burglary defendant was not deprived of his constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel on the ground that his trial counsel failed to object to leading questions about the homes that were burglarized where the questions asked by the prosecutor could have been rephrased to elicit the same testimony, and therefore the defendant did not suffer any disadvantage because of the failure to object. Jackson v. State, 614 So. 2d 965, 1993 Miss. LEXIS 75 (Miss. 1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       A defendant was denied his right to effective assistance of counsel by his attorney’s failure to object to testimony submitted by the State that his accomplice had been tried and found guilty on the same offense for which the defendant was being tried, since the testimony was highly prejudicial and its admission was reversible error. Johns v. State, 592 So. 2d 86, 1991 Miss. LEXIS 874 (Miss. 1991).

   In prosecution for possession with intent to distribute marijuana, even though performance at trial by defendant’s counsel may have been deficient, in view of, inter alia, failure to object to damaging hearsay testimony and allowing defendant to testify in own behalf and further incriminate himself, there was nevertheless sufficient evidence to support conviction, and therefore allegedly deficient performance did not prejudice defense under Strickland v. Washington (1984) <cite class="us_code">466 U.S. 668</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">80 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 674, <cite class="s_court">104 S. Ct. 2052</cite>, and Leatherwood v.

       Defendant did not show that trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to object to the admission of his confession and to present an accomplice’s testimony because the trial court could have relied on or rejected the accomplice’s testimony; because officers testified that neither defendant nor the accomplice had asked for an attorney at any time, their testimony supported the trial court’s finding that defendant’s rights waiver was knowing, intelligent, and voluntary.

       In a statutory rape case, counsel was not deficient in failing to seek suppression of a statement that defendant made to police based on relevance grounds; even though the statement did not include the name of the person defendant had sexual relations with or the date of the encounter, it was highly probative of his guilt. At the time the statement was made, defendant was being questioned about his encounter with the victim, and his statement was corroborative of the statement the victim made. Giles v.

       Counsel was not ineffective for allegedly failing to properly consult with a DNA expert, failing to consult a serologist, and failing to adequately investigate DNA testing because a review of the cross-examination of the witness from the facility that performed the DNA testing for the state by defense counsel easily allowed one to draw the conclusion that a defense expert assisted counsel in preparation for cross-examination, and the inmate could not show that counsel was deficient.

   In a death penalty case, counsel was not ineffective for failing to obtain expert testimony to show that the victim’s body position was “staged” because it was doubtful that expert testimony regarding the positioning of the body would have likely resulted in a different verdict; the victim was found nude from the waist down with her shorts and underwear bunched at one ankle, as well as with five gunshot wounds to her head.

       Counsel was not ineffective for failing to present evidence in mitigation of the death penalty because an expert testified about the petitioner’s mental retardation, the petitioner’s mother was also questioned regarding the petitioner’s mental retardation, and therefore counsel placed the issue of the petitioner’s mental retardation before the jury for purposes of mitigation.

       Counsel was not ineffective for failing to call an expert as a witness because there was no indication that the outcome of defendant’s murder trial would have been different; the expert, a psychologist, discussed at length that defendant had a clear understanding of the trial process and knew the difference between right and wrong.

   In a capital murder case, defendant did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel because of a failure to present witnesses during sentencing where defendant chose not to testify and failed to present any evidence regarding other witnesses that could have been called; moreover the decision was tactical, since calling defendant’s mother would have opened the door to damaging testimony about drugs and gangs.

       Under a Strickland analysis, there was a sufficient basis to conclude that defendant’s attorney’s performance was deficient and that with the alibi witnesses’ testimony there was a reasonable probability that the outcome of the trial would have been different if some minimal pretrial investigation had been performed; defendant’s attorney’s conduct so undermined the proper functioning of the adversarial process that the trial court could not be relied on as having produced a just result.

   None of the evidence to which the State’s expert witnesses testified, including the DNA and blood, co-defendant’s clothing, or the wood, directly linked defendant to the victim’s murder; thus, there was no need for a DNA expert.

       In a prosecution for distribution of a controlled substance, it was not ineffective assistance of counsel to fail to call the defendant to testify where, in a previous similar prosecution in which the same counsel represented the defendant, the defendant raised the defense of entrapment and testified on his own behalf that he was forced to traffic in marijuana because the only other way he could support his family was to rob a bank.

       It was impossible to conclude from the record that defense counsel could have been constitutionally ineffective in failing to allow the defendant to testify where there was no evidence in the record that he ever desired to testify at trial and there was nothing noted in the record to doubt the honesty of his attorneys in reporting his choice not to participate in the trial.

      </p>
      <p>
       Defendants’ claim of ineffective assistance of counsel based on allegation that if they had known that their attorneys would not call any witnesses, they would have themselves testified, amounted to a sham, and therefore defendants were not entitled to evidentiary hearing to set aside validly imposed sentences based upon this claim, considering that, prior to testimony commencing, trial judge made detailed and lengthy presentation to defendants on subject of their right to testify and defendants affirmatively responded to judge’s questions as to whether they understood that they had right to testify regardless of what any other person wished or ordered them to do.

       Viewed as a whole, it was ineffective assistance for defense counsel to fail to subpoena possible witnesses, to fail to seek a continuance until he could interview every possible eyewitness, to fail to seek special venire, to fail to raise Batson, which prohibits peremptory challenges based solely on race, and to fail to seek jury instruction specifically embracing facts that defendant and witness testified occurred, which would have made killing excusable accident.

   Post-conviction relief was denied because defendant did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel based on a failure to object to a prosecutor’s closing argument since references to defendant’s possible escape from prison did not compromise his right to a fair trial; moreover, the prosecutor did not “ramble on and on” about his personal experiences. Howard v. State, 945 So. 2d 326, 2006 Miss. LEXIS 531 (Miss. 2006), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">552 U.S. 829</cite>, <cite class="s_court">128 S. Ct. 49</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">169 L.

      <p>
       Defendant failed to show that his trial counsel was ineffective because (1) a circumstantial evidence instruction would not have been proper under the facts of the case, and the failure of trial counsel to request such an instruction was not error; (2) the failure of counsel to object to the prior statement of an alleged accomplice as hearsay was not error because the trial court properly allowed the former statement of the accomplice to be used for impeachment, and any objection to hearsay by trial counsel would not have resulted in any change in the outcome; and (3) trial counsel did not err in not requesting a lesser-included offense instruction of receiving stolen property because his theory and defense were that the State did not prove its case, and an all or nothing – guilty or acquittal – trial strategy was proper. Long v. State, 934 So. 2d 313, 2006 Miss. App. LEXIS 192 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. dismissed, 939 So. 2d 805, 2006 Miss. LEXIS 610 (Miss. 2006).

       Defendant emphasized his attorney’s failure to file motions to dismiss on the grounds of due process and speedy trial violations in arguing his counsel’s ineffectiveness. However, he signed the guilty plea petition as evidenced by the exhibit he provided attached to his appellate brief and the latter issue was without merit; in addition, he did not assert any critical evidence that would have been discovered had it not been for counsel’s alleged deficiencies, and he failed to object to counsel’s representation when given the opportunity.

       Where defense counsel did not object to the prosecutor’s reference in closing arguments to defendant’s post-arrest silence, defendant’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel under Miss. Const. Art. III, § 26 and U.S. Const. Amend. VI failed; defendant was not prejudiced by the prosecutor’s brief mention of defendant’s silence, as the statement did not constitute plain error affecting a fundamental right. Walker v.

   Inmate’s attorneys were not ineffective, in connection with the inmate’s capital murder trial, for failing to object to certain prosecutorial statements made during closing argument at the guilt phase because (1) the issue was raised on direct appeal and was found to be without merit, and thus the issue was barred under Miss.

   In a capital murder case, the State’s invocation of higher biblical law did not violate the inmate’s rights under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, or under Miss. Const. Art. 3, § 14, because the prosecutor was responding to the biblical argument made by the inmate’s attorney; also, the inmate’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim for counsels’ failure to object to the State’s biblical references had to fail.

       Trial counsel’s failure to object to portion of state’s closing argument during sentencing phase of capital murder prosecution did not constitute ineffective assistance; although state said that victims and surrounding community would be affected by jury’s decision, state never used words “send a message” to jury and state never said jury had duty to return verdict of death, but stated that if state failed to prove that defendant was one who fired fatal shot, then jury was required to return life verdict.

       Trial counsel’s failure to object to prosecutor’s closing argument in guilt phase in which prosecutor attempted to connect pair of shoes and pair of jeans with capital murder defendant because blood on them was proof that person wearing them fired fatal shot did not constitute ineffective assistance, where such evidentiary conclusion could by supported by expert testimony or could be within common sense abilities of jury.

       Trial counsel’s argument during guilt phase of capital murder prosecution that defendant was guilty, but questioning whether he was as guilty as codefendant, did not constitute ineffective assistance, where defendant testified that he helped tie up victim, helped codefendant look for guns and/or money, helped codefendant take rifle out and helped codefendant load stolen guns into vehicle after other victim was shot.

      <p>
       A murder defendant was not denied her Sixth Amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel due to her attorney’s failure to object to statements made by the prosecution in their closing argument, referring to the fact that the victim was not present at trial to explain the events surrounding the killing, since it was reasonable for the prosecution to argue that the victim was no longer in existence in a murder trial in which the jury was required to determine whether the killing was justified.

   Claim of ineffective assistance of counsel based on counsel’s failure to object to closing argument of prosecutor at sentencing phase was rejected, such failure to object being presumed to be strategic, and presumption having not been rebutted.

       In a burglary prosecution, defense counsel was not ineffective for failing to request a circumstantial-evidence instruction; because the State produced direct evidence of the gravamen of the offense, defendant had not been entitled to such an instruction.

      </p>
      <p>
       Defense counsel was not ineffective for not objecting to a jury instruction, which contained language that differed from the language of the indictment, because the instruction did not accuse defendant of any other separate or distinct crime other than that of the indictment, nor did it refer to facts of which defendant had no notice; the variance was not material. Nix v. State, 8 So.3d 141, 2009 Miss. LEXIS 74 (Miss. 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant’s claim of ineffective counsel in a murder trial failed because the jury instructions were proper and requesting a jury instruction on manslaughter that was commonly given on the prosecution’s request was permissible trial strategy to try to ensure that the jury knew they were not required to find murder, and that a lesser offense was available when there was strong evidence that defendant shot the victim.

       Because defendant denied at trial that he assaulted the deputy in any way, a jury instruction on self-defense was not supported by the record; thus, his trial counsel’s performance was not deficient by failing to request a self-defense jury instruction.

       Where defendant asserted that defense counsel was ineffective under Miss. Const. art. III, § 26 and U.S. Const. amend.

       Inmate’s attorneys were not ineffective, in connection with the inmate’s capital murder trial, for failing to make an objection to an instruction that death could be imposed if aggravating and mitigating circumstances were of equal weight because as the direct claim was found to be without merit, there could be no claim that the attorneys were ineffective in failing to object to what was an acceptable instruction.

      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Because the jury impaneled for the inmate’s resentencing was charged with weighing the aggravating circumstances against any mitigating circumstances in the capital murder trial, the criminal proceeding was not inconsistent with Apprendi and Ring and, thus, the sentencing instructions were not unconstitutional; because the use of those jury instructions was permissible and any objection to them made by defense counsel would likely have been overruled, the inmate’s attorneys could not be considered deficient for failing to argue that the use of the instructions was unconstitutional and, thus, any ineffective assistance of counsel claim failed. Wilcher v. State, 863 So. 2d 776, 2003 Miss. LEXIS 492 (Miss. 2003), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">542 U.S. 942</cite>, <cite class="s_court">124 S. Ct. 2917</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">159 L.

      <p>
       The defendant was not denied effective assistance of counsel when his trial counsel failed to submit a jury instruction on the defendant’s theory of mistaken identification since defense counsel’s decision to forego a request for an identification instruction may well have been the result of trial strategy as, during closing argument, defense counsel argued lack of identification of the defendant by anyone other than the victim and pointed out what he considered to be discrepancies in her testimony. Thomas v. State, 766 So. 2d 809, 2000 Miss. App. LEXIS 397 (Miss. Ct. App. 2000).
      </p>

      <p>
       Although defense counsel improperly failed to object to a jury instruction that had been long condemned by the Mississippi Supreme Court, the defendant failed to show ineffective assistance of counsel since there was substantial evidence that he acted with malice in killing the victim and, therefore, the trial was not rendered fundamentally unfair by his counsel’s failure.

       Counsel for capital murder defendant was not ineffective for failing to object to transitional jury instruction stating that jury should not consider instruction defining lesser included offense of murder unless it found that defendant was not guilty of capital murder, where defendant was granted lesser included offense instruction defining crime of murder less than capital, and defendant showed no prejudice flowing from transitional instruction.

       A murder defendant was not denied her Sixth Amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel by her attorney’s refusal of a manslaughter instruction, even though there was a strong evidentiary basis for the submission of such an instruction, where the attorney’s decision to refuse a manslaughter instruction coupled with his decision to employ a defense based entirely on self-defense was a calculated trial strategy.

       On the inmate’s petition for post-conviction relief, the court held that counsel was not ineffective for failing to present mitigating evidence at sentencing because it was the inmate’s choice not to do so; the inmate was fully apprised of the consequences of his choice and he made an informed and voluntary decision not to present mitigating evidence.

   Defendant did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel by the failure to challenged an aggravating circumstance not named in an indictment in a capital murder case because he was not entitled to formal notice of such since an indictment for capital murder put defendant on sufficient notice that the statutory aggravating factor would have been used against him.

   Post-conviction relief in a capital murder case based on the argument that the use of the “avoiding or preventing a lawful arrest or effecting an escape from custody” aggravator was inappropriate was denied because it was procedurally barred; however, even if it was not, the argument was meritless since sufficient evidence supported this due to the fact that the victim’s telephone line was cut, two fires were set in her home, and defendant had just been released from prison.

   Post-conviction relief was denied because defendant’s assertion that he received ineffective assistance of counsel during the sentencing phase of a capital murder trial was procedurally barred; however, even if it was not, ineffectiveness was not shown because, despite mitigation evidence that defendant was a great person and had not been violent, the state could have presented evidence of his prior convictions.

   In a case where defendant was found guilty of capital murder – murder during the commission of sexual battery on a six-month old victim, the record revealed that defendant’s trial counsel procured testimony from his mother that his father deserted him at a young age and did not play a role in rearing him, and his grandmother testified to her relationship with defendant as a boy and discussed his love for children and that he had planned to marry the victim’s mother to care for both of them. Given the testimony provided in mitigation and what it did show the jury about defendant’s life and tendencies, counsel did not fail to investigate potential mitigating evidence for purposes of punishment and his performance was not prejudicially deficient.

   In a case where defendant was found guilty of capital murder – murder during the commission of sexual battery on a six-month old victim, while counsel’s closing arguments at the sentencing phase of defendant’s trial, when viewed with the benefit of hindsight, could have been presented more forcibly, closing argument fell under the ambit of defense counsel’s trial strategy. Given the wide latitude and any strategic decisions counsel could have made with regard to his approach to the trial of the case, defendant’s counsel was not ineffective. Havard v.

       Court did not err in denying defendant’s motion to supplement his petition for post-conviction relief because his claim that his attorney was ineffective by failing to assure that the sentencing judge was informed of the district attorney’s recommended sentence was without merit. Defendant’s prior motion for reconsideration of his sentence, which was granted, and the reduction of his sentence by nine years, stated that the recommendation of the district attorney’s office was disclosed to the sentencing judge despite the open plea.

   Through the penalty-phase testimony of defendant’s father, counsel was able to introduce evidence of defendant’s childhood and adolescent life, his activities and interests, as well as his involvement in his family, neighborhood, and community; also, evidence of the statutory mitigating factors were discussed including no significant history of prior criminal history and defendant’s age. Thus, trial counsel was not deficient because he did not fail to develop penalty-phase testimony. Branch v. State, 882 So. 2d 36, 2004 Miss.

       Trial counsel’s submission in capital murder prosecution of instruction, providing you must find mitigating circumstance exits if there is any substantial evidence to support it, did not constitute ineffective assistance, despite contention that instruction should not have included word “substantial,” where there was no reasonable likelihood that jury, because of use of word “substantial,” refused to consider relevant mitigation evidence.

       Trial counsel’s failure in capital murder prosecution to object to language of lesser included offense instruction, providing this section is not designed to relieve you from performance of unpleasant duty but to prevent failure of justice if evidence fails to prove original charge but does justify verdict for lesser crime, did not constitute ineffective assistance, despite contention that language prevented jury from giving effect to instruction, where defendant cited nothing which stated that this language inhibited jurors who may have voted to convict for lesser offense.

       Admission of testimony of psychologist to rebut defendant’s presentation of mitigating evidence tending to show that he was extremely emotionally disturbed at time of murders did not violate defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to counsel; defendant’s attorneys knew of examination and one attorney had met with defendant twice to prepare him, doctors told defendant that anything he said could be used against him during sentencing phase of capital murder trial, and doctors offered to allow defendant to call his attorneys.

   Counsel’s closing argument at penalty phase of capital murder prosecution in which he told the jurors “if you want to sentence him to death, don’t let me persuade you not to. If you don’t want to sentence him to death, don’t let the District Attorney persuade you to” was reasonable trial strategy encouraging jurors to make up their own minds when determining penalties without being influenced by either party.

       Counsel for capital murder defendant was not ineffective for failing to request continuance after State introduced into evidence during sentencing phase 2 prior convictions for manslaughter and attempted rape, where there was no prejudice to defendant, in that the prior convictions were valid and not subject to collateral attack.

       Counsel for capital murder defendant was not ineffective for failing to object to introduction of defendant’s prior convictions of grand larceny and simple robbery, where both were relevant to aggravating circumstances set forth under capital sentencing statute, and thus objection would have been futile.

      <p>
       Counsel for capital murder defendant was not ineffective for conducting cross-examination of witness that produced responses which allegedly strongly suggested to jury that defendant could not be rehabilitated, where most of the cross-examination was in abstract and was not related directly to defendant, and defendant had previous convictions for rape, manslaughter, robbery and grand larceny based upon which jury could have easily reached conclusion that there was little hope for defendant’s rehabilitation.

      <p>
       A capital murder defendant was denied effective assistance of counsel at the penalty phase where his attorneys presented almost no facts in mitigation upon which the jury could have acted to spare the defendant’s life, they failed to make the most of the available evidence in mitigation, and in closing argument one of the defendant’s attorneys stated that the only way the jury could spare the defendant’s life was on “redeeming love,” which was not one of the factors which the jury could have considered under the court’s instructions. Woodward v. State, 635 So. 2d 805, 1993 Miss. LEXIS 442 (Miss. 1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       In the sentencing phase of a capital murder prosecution, the introduction of a state psychologist’s testimony that it was her opinion that the defendant was not psychotic or mentally ill, did not violate the defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to counsel where the defendant’s attorney requested the psychiatric examination, the defendant testified that he wanted to have a psychiatric evaluation to determine whether he knew right from wrong, and presumably the defendant had consulted with his attorney about the nature of the psychiatric examination. Willie v. State, 585 So. 2d 660, 1991 Miss. LEXIS 454 (Miss. 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       A defense counsel’s performance at the sentencing phase of a capital murder prosecution constituted ineffective assistance of counsel where the defendant faced a potential death penalty, and the defense counsel failed to conduct any investigation at all in a search for mitigation evidence; the defense counsel conducted little or no investigation into the defendant’s background, he spent negligible time interviewing the defendant and preparing a defense, he made no effort to contact or interview any potential character witnesses other than the defendant’s mother who was contacted only after the trial had commenced, and the lack of preparation left the defense counsel unable to blunt the prosecution’s forceful case. At a minimum, counsel has a duty to interview potential witnesses and to make an independent investigation of the facts and circumstances of the case; it is critical that mitigating evidence be presented at capital sentencing proceedings. Psychiatric and psychological evidence is crucial to the defense of a capital murder case, and there is a critical interrelation between expert psychiatric assistance and minimally effective representation. Thus, the defendant’s counsel was unreasonable in not pursuing psychological evidence in support of the defense that the defendant was under the domination of his accomplice where evidence was presented in the post-conviction proceeding that the defendant was immature, dependent and easily lead. State v. Tokman, 564 So. 2d 1339, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 232 (Miss. 1990).

       Defendant failed to show ineffective assistance of counsel at probation revocation proceedings where he argued that appointed attorney was ineffective because he did not challenge legality of split sentence for armed robbery.

      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Argument that counsel was ineffective was without merit where counsel presented proof concerning defendant’s absence of criminal record, co-operation in investigation, his being model prisoner, and testimony of victim’s wife that defendant was nonviolent. Wiley v. State, 517 So. 2d 1373, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2915 (Miss. 1987), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">486 U.S. 1036</cite>, <cite class="s_court">108 S. Ct. 2024</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">100 L.

       Failure to present case in mitigation or call witnesses is not per se ineffective assistance of counsel. Stringer v. Scroggy, 675 F. Supp. 356, 1987 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11203 (S.D. Miss. 1987), aff'd, 862 F.2d 1108, 1988 U.S. App. LEXIS 17949 (5th Cir. Miss. 1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       Counsel is not ineffective for following instructions of client concerning how to or whether to present case in mitigation and not presenting such evidence by having family members testify about defendant’s family nature, war record, and medical problems, where defendant stated to attorney that he did not want to put his family through that ordeal. Stringer v. Scroggy, 675 F. Supp. 356, 1987 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11203 (S.D. Miss. 1987), aff'd, 862 F.2d 1108, 1988 U.S. App. LEXIS 17949 (5th Cir. Miss. 1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Failure to request pre-sentence report is not ineffective assistance of counsel because defendant is not automatically entitled to pre-sentence reports under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.47.html#t47c07s47-7-9ol13a" target="_blank">47-7-9(3)(a)</a></cite>, which clearly states that pre-sentence reports are given only at discretion of circuit judge.

      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Ineffective assistance of counsel was not shown concerning investigation of and failure to present mitigating circumstances where there was some mitigation by cross-examination and, strategically, it may be safer to obtain mitigating evidence from state’s witnesses than to risk aggravating evidence from witnesses called by defense. Additionally, trial counsel has no absolute duty to present mitigating evidence; strategic choices made after less than complete investigation are reasonable to extent that reasonable professional judgment supports limitations on investigation; court must apply heavy measure of deference to counsel’s judgments. Wiley v. State, 517 So. 2d 1373, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2915 (Miss. 1987), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">486 U.S. 1036</cite>, <cite class="s_court">108 S. Ct. 2024</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">100 L.

   Argument that counsel was ineffective for failing to explain to jury inapplicability and/or insignificance of aggravating circumstances and how to weigh aggravating and mitigating circumstances was rejected where counsel made excellent arguments as to aggravating circumstances, and closing argument contained variety of mitigating evidence.

       <p>
   Argument that counsel should have requested presentence report in light of his failure to investigate mitigating evidence, was rejected as basis for ineffective assistance of counsel claim where question was counsel’s competence in not investigating and presenting mitigating evidence; if this was reasonable strategic choice, there was no need for investigation by other means. Wiley v. State, 517 So. 2d 1373, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2915 (Miss. 1987), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">486 U.S. 1036</cite>, <cite class="s_court">108 S. Ct. 2024</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">100 L.

       If capital murder defendant shows that failure of trial defense counsel to call favorable, willing witnesses during penalty phase of trial and failure to investigate and present psychological evidence resulted in ineffective assistance of counsel, death penalty will be vacated and new trial set as to sentencing only.

       Defendant, as a convicted felon, could not quietly enjoy the benefits of an illegally lenient sentence and later attack the sentence when suddenly it was in his interest to do so; because defendant actually benefited from the illegal sentence, he was not denied his fundamental right from an illegal sentence, and there was no ineffective assistance of counsel or other error.

       Supreme Court looks at totality of circumstances to determine whether counsel’s efforts were both deficient and prejudicial, when evaluating claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Osborn v. State, 695 So. 2d 570, 1997 Miss. LEXIS 149 (Miss. 1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       Adequacy of counsel’s performance, as to its deficiency and prejudicial effect, should be measured by totality of circumstances. Taylor v. State, 682 So. 2d 359, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 532 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       In determining effectiveness of counsel issues, court must consider whether overall performance was deficient and whether defense was prejudiced by any such deficiencies. Moore v. State, 676 So. 2d 244, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 328 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether counsel’s performance was both deficient and prejudicial under Strickland test for ineffectiveness of counsel must be determined from totality of circumstances. Cole v. State, 666 So. 2d 767, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 595 (Miss. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       Target of appellate scrutiny in evaluating deficiency and prejudice prongs of Strickland test for ineffectiveness of counsel is counsel’s “over-all” performance. Cole v. State, 666 So. 2d 767, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 595 (Miss. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       Supreme Court must determine whether counsel’s performance was both deficient and prejudicial based upon totality of circumstances. Hughes v. State, 665 So. 2d 852 (Miss. 1995), reh’g denied (Miss. Dec. 21, 1995).
      </p>

       <p>
   A guilty verdict supported by confessions and direct evidence comes out more strongly against a claim of ineffectiveness of counsel. Evans v. State, 485 So. 2d 276, 1986 Miss. LEXIS 2403 (Miss.), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">476 U.S. 1178</cite>, <cite class="s_court">106 S. Ct. 2908</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">90 L.

      <p>
       <p>
   A defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel does not entitle defendant to errorless counsel, but rather counsel reasonably likely to render and rendering reasonably effective assistance. The standard required of trial counsel is no higher in capital cases than in noncapital cases. Although Mississippi courts may customarily appoint two lawyers in a capital case, the Constitution dictates no such requirement. The duty imposed on counsel to make an independent investigation of the facts and circumstances in the case is not without limit, and the court must take into account the totality of the circumstances in evaluating whether counsel has been effective. Defendant must demonstrate that his counsel’s ineffectiveness has resulted in at least some degree of prejudice to his case. Counsel could not be faulted for his failure to request a simple murder charge not supported by the evidence and his failure to request a definition of the underlying felony was harmless. Accordingly defendant was not denied effective assistance of counsel during the guilt stage of his trial. Bell v. Watkins, 692 F.2d 999, 1982 U.S. App. LEXIS 23546 (5th Cir. Miss. 1982), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">464 U.S. 843</cite>, <cite class="s_court">104 S. Ct. 142</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">78 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 134, 1983 U.S. LEXIS 1426 (U.S. 1983).

       Defendant’s convictions for two counts of capital murder were upheld because while defendant was able to give several examples of what defendant perceived to be counsel’s deficiencies, including counsel’s failure to fully investigate through discovery motions what information the State had related to the case, defendant was not able to satisfy the second prong of the Strickland test; defendant failed to establish a reasonable probability that but for counsel’s error he would have had a better result. Dahl v. State, 989 So. 2d 910, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 822 (Miss. Ct. App. 2007), cert. denied, 993 So. 2d 832, 2008 Miss. LEXIS 412 (Miss. 2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       Counsel was not ineffective for allegedly failing to investigate the physical evidence to find inconsistencies with the inmate’s confession because the record was full of independent evidence that was consistent with and supported the inmate’s confession to the kidnapping and murder; therefore, the inmate could not show that his trial would have been different. Thorson v. State, 994 So. 2d 707, 2007 Miss. LEXIS 497 (Miss. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       Dismissal of the inmate’s motion for post-conviction relief was proper in part because he failed to prove that his counsel was ineffective; the inmate failed to demonstrate how the outcome of his case would have been different had his attorney performed the acts that the inmate alleged that the attorney was deficient in failing to perform. Truitt v. State, 958 So. 2d 299, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 413 (Miss. Ct. App. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       Petitioner failed to demonstrate that his counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate the background of a police informant where petitioner did not argue that he would not have pled guilty but for the ineffective assistance of his counsel, or that he was prejudiced by his attorney’s alleged failure. Elliott v. State, 939 So. 2d 824, 2006 Miss. App. LEXIS 744 (Miss. Ct. App. 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant’s conviction for capital murder was appropriate because he failed to prove that his counsel was ineffective; the appellate court failed to see how examining additional photographs would have enabled defendant’s counsel to more effectively cross-examine the state’s experts to the extent that the trial outcome would have changed. Williams v. State, 937 So. 2d 35, 2006 Miss. App. LEXIS 618 (Miss. Ct. App. 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       In an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, defendant pointed to his trial counsel’s failure to object to leading questions, failure to object to jury instructions containing assumptions of fact, failure to effectively cross-examine, failure to adequately investigate his case, failure to call witnesses, and numerous other grounds; however, defendant’s trial counsel was not ineffective based on the record. Any errors defendant’s trial counsel might have committed in the case were not prejudicial to the defense so as to create a reasonable probability of a different outcome in the absence of such errors; thus, defendant’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim failed. Moore v. State, 938 So. 2d 1254, 2006 Miss. App. LEXIS 86 (Miss. Ct. App. 2006), cert. denied, 2006 Miss. LEXIS 750 (Miss. Oct. 5, 2006), cert. denied, 939 So. 2d 805, 2006 Miss. LEXIS 749 (Miss. 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       Petition for post-conviction relief based on ineffective assistance of counsel was properly denied because an inmate failed to show that allegedly discoverable evidence would have been exculpatory in light of a co-defendant’s statement that implicated the inmate in a murder. Hollingsworth v. State, 852 So. 2d 612, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 925 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 852 So. 2d 577, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 867 (Miss. Ct. App. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       If, and only if, court adjudges counsel’s performance to have been deficient, then it must determine whether there exists reasonable probability that, but for complained-of error, outcome of trial or appeal would have been different, in ruling on claim of ineffective assistance. Pitts v. Anderson, 122 F.3d 275, 1997 U.S. App. LEXIS 25289 (5th Cir. Miss. 1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant was not entitled to habeas relief based upon his claim of ineffective assistance of his trial counsel where all instances of alleged attorney ineffectiveness failed to meet either deficiency or prejudice prong of
       <i>
        Strickland
       </i>
       ; even though trial counsel’s performance could have been improved in certain instances, trial counsel sufficiently defended him during guilt and sentencing phases of both capital murder trials, proceedings were fair and reliable, and result and sentences received would not have changed had the alleged instances of deficiency not occurred. Lockett v. Puckett, 980 F. Supp. 201, 1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16218 (S.D. Miss. 1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       On claim for habeas corpus relief for ineffective assistance of counsel, an error by counsel, even if professionally unreasonable, does not warrant setting aside judgment of a criminal proceeding if the error had no effect on the judgment, and petitioner must affirmatively plead this resulting prejudice. Lockett v. Puckett, 980 F. Supp. 201, 1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16218 (S.D. Miss. 1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       Supreme Court will find ineffective representation by counsel only where there is reasonable probability that without counsel’s errors, outcome of trial would have been different. Hughes v. State, 665 So. 2d 852 (Miss. 1995), reh’g denied (Miss. Dec. 21, 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       A defendant’s complaints of ineffective assistance of counsel in his post-conviction relief motion alleging that his guilty plea was involuntarily made as a result of ineffective assistance of counsel were insufficient as a matter of law where the defendant failed to allege that the asserted errors of his attorney proximately resulted in his guilty plea and that, but for these errors, he would not have entered the plea. Garlotte v. State, 597 So. 2d 641, 1992 Miss. LEXIS 161 (Miss. 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       A defendant was not denied his right to effective assistance of counsel merely because his attorney failed to procure a preliminary hearing where no allegation or facts were presented as to the way in which this matter operated to the defendant’s prejudice. Jordan v. State, 577 So. 2d 368, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 785 (Miss. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   In case involving clear guilt supported by confessions and direct evidence, claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is less likely to be found because prejudice prong of Strickland test will be difficult to meet. Faraga v. State, 514 So. 2d 295, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2656 (Miss. 1987), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">487 U.S. 1210</cite>, <cite class="s_court">108 S. Ct. 2858</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">101 L.

      </p>
      <p>
       Even if counsel was ineffective at sentencing phase, result would not have been different given overwhelming evidence of defendant’s guilt, and therefore claim of ineffective assistance was not substantiated. Stringer v. Scroggy, 675 F. Supp. 356, 1987 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11203 (S.D. Miss. 1987), aff'd, 862 F.2d 1108, 1988 U.S. App. LEXIS 17949 (5th Cir. Miss. 1988).

      <p>
       In a prosecution for homicide, where the defendant was unable to show that there was a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s unprofessional error, the result of the proceeding would have been different, defendant was not denied effective assistance of counsel in violation of the Sixth Amendment.

       In determining whether attorney’s performance is deficient, for purposes of claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, court must indulge strong presumption that counsel’s conduct falls within wide range of reasonable professional assistance; that is, defendant must overcome presumption that, under circumstances, challenged action might be considered sound trial strategy. Pitts v. Anderson, 122 F.3d 275, 1997 U.S. App. LEXIS 25289 (5th Cir. Miss. 1997).

      </p>
      <p>
       There is strong but rebuttable presumption that counsel’s conduct falls within wide range of reasonable professional assistance; only where it is reasonably probable that but for attorney’s errors, outcome of trial would have been different, will Supreme Court find that counsel’s performance was deficient. Osborn v. State, 695 So. 2d 570, 1997 Miss. LEXIS 149 (Miss. 1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       Prejudice is presumed only if defendant demonstrates that counsel actively represented conflicting interests and that actual conflict of interest adversely affected his lawyer’s performance. Perry v. State, 682 So. 2d 1027, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 572 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>

       Burden to demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel is on defendant, who faces strong but rebuttable presumption that counsel’s performance falls within broad spectrum of reasonable professional assistance. Hughes v. State, 665 So. 2d 852 (Miss. 1995), reh’g denied (Miss. Dec. 21, 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       In order to prove that he received ineffective assistance of counsel during the guilt phase of a capital murder prosecution, the defendant was required to show deficient performance and that his counsel’s errors were so serious as to deprive him of a fair trial with a reliable result; unless a defendant makes both showings, it cannot be said that the conviction or death sentence resulted from a breakdown in the adversary process that rendered the result unreliable. State v. Tokman, 564 So. 2d 1339, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 232 (Miss. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       A post-conviction relief petitioner, who is seeking to overturn a conviction or sentence on the grounds of ineffective assistance of counsel, must demonstrate factual proof by a preponderance of the evidence of an identifiable lapse by counsel and of some actual adverse impact on the fairness of the trial resulting from that lapse. State v. Tokman, 564 So. 2d 1339, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 232 (Miss. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       In order to prevail on the claim that he was denied effective assistance of counsel, a defendant must show (1) that counsel’s performance was deficient, and (2) that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. Perkins v. State, 487 So. 2d 791, 1986 Miss. LEXIS 2389 (Miss. 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   In order to prevail on a claim that counsel’s assistance was so defective as to require reversal of conviction or death sentence, defendant must show that (1) counsel’s performance was deficient and (2) the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. Evans v. State, 485 So. 2d 276, 1986 Miss. LEXIS 2403 (Miss.), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">476 U.S. 1178</cite>, <cite class="s_court">106 S. Ct. 2908</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">90 L.

      <p>
       <p>
   The burden of proving ineffective assistance of counsel is on the defendant to prove that the counsel’s performance was (1) deficient, and (2) that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense, and a reversal of a conviction or sentence is not warranted upon failure to prove either component. Dufour v. State, 483 So. 2d 307, 1985 Miss. LEXIS 2357 (Miss. 1985), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">479 U.S. 891</cite>, <cite class="s_court">107 S. Ct. 292</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">93 L.

       Defendant’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim failed where nothing in the record supported the allegations that his attorney’s strategy of asserting self-defense rather than accident was prejudicial, and defense counsel had thoroughly developed the theory that the victim was the aggressor. Byrd v. State, 158 So.3d 1146, 2015 Miss. LEXIS 129 (Miss. 2015).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant claimed that he received ineffective assistance of counsel because his trial counsel failed to make timely disclosure of two witnesses, which resulted in exclusion of the testimony of the witnesses, but there was nothing to suggest a constitutionally deficient performance. Defendant also contended that defense counsel should have objected to a lesser-included jury instruction, but this could have been counsel’s trial strategy; finally, counsel was not deficient for failing to use a peremptory strike against a juror. McGregory v. State, 979 So. 2d 12, 2008 Miss. App. LEXIS 207 (Miss. Ct. App. 2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant’s retained counsel was not ineffective in informing the jury that defendant was a habitual offender where that information was included in the indictment. Logan v. State, 987 So. 2d 1027, 2008 Miss. App. LEXIS 190 (Miss. Ct. App. 2008), cert. denied, 999 So. 2d 852, 2009 Miss. LEXIS 45 (Miss. 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court did not err in failing to sua sponte declare a mistrial for ineffective assistance of counsel where defendant failed to show a reasonable probability that he would have received a different result given his taped confession, his presence in the church office on the day of the burglary, and his signature on two checks found in the office. Deloach v. State, 977 So. 2d 400, 2008 Miss. App. LEXIS 166 (Miss. Ct. App. 2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant’s conviction for armed robbery was proper because he failed to prove that his counsel was ineffective; in part, counsel’s failure to object to the introduction of evidence, which was clothing, was not ineffective because the evidence against defendant was overwhelming. Hancock v. State, 964 So. 2d 1167, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 35 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 964 So. 2d 508, 2007 Miss. LEXIS 526 (Miss. 2007).

       <p>
   Where a defendant raised ineffective assistance of counsel on direct appeal, and raises it again in a post-conviction proceeding, supported by extraneous materials that were not available on direct appeal, an appellate court’s consideration of the issue is not barred by res judicata; where the defendant raises ineffective assistance of counsel at the post-conviction stage, and it is the same issue raised on direct appeal but only rephrased, res judicata will apply. Hodges v. State, 949 So. 2d 706, 2006 Miss. LEXIS 692 (Miss. 2006), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">552 U.S. 1061</cite>, <cite class="s_court">128 S. Ct. 705</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">169 L.

      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Defendant was not entitled to post-conviction relief based on ineffective assistance when res judicata barred some of the claims such as counsel’s failure to support a motion to suppress defendant’s confession, counsel’s failure to properly advise on plea bargains, counsel’s failure to introduce victims’ impact statement, and failure to properly prepare defendant to give his testimony; and defendant’s remaining claims lacked merit. Hodges v. State, 949 So. 2d 706, 2006 Miss. LEXIS 692 (Miss. 2006), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">552 U.S. 1061</cite>, <cite class="s_court">128 S. Ct. 705</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">169 L.

      </p>
      <p>
       Record did not support defendant’s allegations that he had been given ineffective assistance by counsel for several alleged deficiencies, where defendant’s brief did not list or contain any possible defense witnesses that trial counsel should have called to testify or how that prejudiced his case; defendant failed to show that the defense counsel’s decision to forgo cross-examination of some witnesses was not sound trial strategy or that it prejudiced his case, and trial counsel’s conduct was within a wide range of reasonable conduct. Torrey v. State, 891 So. 2d 188, 2004 Miss. LEXIS 1375 (Miss. 2004), overruled in part, Gowdy v. State, 56 So.3d 540, 2010 Miss. LEXIS 656 (Miss. 2010).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant was not denied effective assistance of counsel where, once the youth court had jurisdiction, it did not lose jurisdiction of defendant after he turned 18, but retained jurisdiction until defendant reached age 20; therefore, defendant’s assertion that his counsel was ineffective for failing to challenge the transfer was without merit. Hicks v. State, 870 So. 2d 1238, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 76 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant did not prove ineffective assistance of counsel where he signed a petition to enter a plea of guilty in which he stated that his lawyer was competent and defendant was fully satisfied with the advice and help he received; although defendant complained about the lack of pretrial investigation, he failed to tell the trial judge or the appellate court which facts in mitigation a further investigation would have revealed, so that defendant did not demonstrate prejudice, having not alleged anything that would have led to a different result. Hebert v. State, 864 So. 2d 1041, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 77 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendants did not meet their burden of demonstrating deficient performance by trial counsel and resulting prejudice; counsel placed evidence before the jury that both witnesses had failed to identify a defendant and objected to questionable testimony. Powell v. State, 878 So. 2d 144, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 37 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 878 So. 2d 67, 2004 Miss. LEXIS 962 (Miss. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Defendant failed to present evidence that trial counsel was deficient in (1) failing to investigate and present mitigation evidence; (2) giving inadequate closing arguments by requesting mercy; and (3) failing to object to the two aggravating circumstances submitted by the State. Powers v. State, 883 So. 2d 20, 2003 Miss. LEXIS 850 (Miss. 2003), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">543 U.S. 1155</cite>, <cite class="s_court">125 S. Ct. 1297</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">161 L.

      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant made no contention as to what efforts counsel could reasonably have been expected to produce in terms of evidence or information helpful to defendant’s defense; counsel’s failure to insist on further delay was not the deficient performance that would warrant relief and defendant failed to show the basis for the conclusion that any alternate courses of action had a reasonable chance of producing a result more favorable to him. Pickett v. State, 861 So. 2d 1049, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 631 (Miss. Ct. App. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant failed to demonstrate a deficiency in his counsels’ overall performance sufficient to undermine the integrity of his trial and conviction; there was testimony that defendant had admitted shooting into the camp cabin and a confession to that effect, but counsel’s statements during closing presented an alternative defense theory, namely, that codefendant had put the shotgun to defendant’s head and ordered him to fire. Davis v. State, 849 So. 2d 1252, 2003 Miss. LEXIS 339 (Miss. 2003).

      </p>
      <p>
       The court rejected the contention that defense counsel rendered ineffective assistance to the defendant when he stated, while making an objection, that testimony by a witness should be heard outside the presence of the jury because some of the testimony might be damaging; the defendant asserted that the statement about some of the testimony being “damaging” was evidence of ineffective assistance of counsel, but such was not the case as counsel made no references to specific facts that could have prejudiced the jury. Rambus v. State, 804 So. 2d 1052, 2001 Miss. App. LEXIS 207 (Miss. Ct. App. 2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       The defendant was not denied effective assistance of counsel in connection with his guilty plea, notwithstanding the defendant’s assertions that counsel advised him to plead guilty even though counsel knew of witnesses who could have given testimony that could have been used to prove innocence at trial and that the decision to plead guilty was forced on him by counsel, because (1) the circuit judge asked the defendant if his counsel had discussed the petition to plead guilty with him and if he understood everything within the petition, and the defendant answered that he understood, (2) the judge asked if the defendant had fully discussed all the circumstances surrounding the case with his counsel and whether or not his counsel had advised him of all possible defenses that he might have if the case went to trial, and the defendant responded affirmatively, and (3) the defendant was asked if he was satisfied with the advice that his counsel had given him, and he stated that he was.

      </p>
      <p>
       The defendant failed to establish ineffective assistance of counsel because (1) other than making bare allegations of how his counsel was ineffective, the defendant failed to identify specific acts or omissions by his trial counsel that in any way prejudiced his defense, and (2) a thorough review of the record showed that trial counsel more than adequately represented the defendant. Wansley v. State, 798 So. 2d 460, 2001 Miss. LEXIS 79 (Miss. 2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       The defendant was not denied effective assistance of counsel during the guilty plea process, notwithstanding his contention that he was confused as to how much of his sentence he would be required to spend in jail because of the 85 percent law which had just been passed by the legislature in 1995, because (1) the defendant asked about the 85 percent rule, which was under review by the supreme court at the time, since he wanted to know if this rule would apply to him or not, (2) the judge told him he did not know if it would apply because the supreme court had not yet ruled on the issue, and (3) the judge also told him he did not know how the parole board handled parole eligibility, but that he did know the defendant would have to serve at least 10 years of his 20 year sentence. Clay v. State, 792 So. 2d 302, 2001 Miss. App. LEXIS 129 (Miss. Ct. App. 2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       The defendant was not denied effective assistance of counsel, notwithstanding the 17-year-old defendant’s argument that his attorney advised him to plead guilty to charges where the record failed to substantiate his guilt, where (1) the defendant acknowledged that his counsel had met and conferred with him and his family and had discussed the facts of the case fully and completely, (2) he also specifically declared his involvement in the crimes, as well as asserting that he understood the charges against him and their possible sentences, (3) the testimony of defense counsel at the guilty plea hearing revealed that he had not only discussed the crimes with the defendant but had also met with his father numerous times to keep him apprized of the case, and (4) the defendant received a reduction in both counts against him prior to entering his pleas of guilty. Young v. State, 797 So. 2d 239, 2001 Miss. App. LEXIS 2 (Miss. Ct. App. 2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       The defendant failed to establish ineffective assistance of counsel notwithstanding his assertion that his attorney did not investigate the case, coerced him into pleading guilty, and
   failed to seek suppression of illegally seized evidence, where (1) the trial court specifically found that the attorney had filed at least 31 motions on behalf of the defendant including motions seeking to have certain evidence suppressed and that the attorney provided effective assistance as counsel, and (2) the defendant failed to demonstrate that but for his attorney’s alleged ineffective assistance, a different result would have come from the charges against him.

      </p>
      <p>
       In a prosecution for felony driving under the influence, no violation of the defendant’s right to effective assistance of counsel occurred when the district attorney, on cross-examination, asked the defendant if he ever told his lawyer who the people were who heard him ask for a breathalyzer test and defense counsel successfully objected to the question; no deficiency of counsel was shown and there was no showing of a hindrance put upon the defendant’s attorney-client privilege and, therefore, there was no violation of the defendant’s rights. Phillips v. State, 783 So. 2d 731, 2000 Miss. App. LEXIS 343 (Miss. Ct. App. 2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       The defendant was not denied effective assistance of counsel, notwithstanding his assertion that his trial counsel failed to investigate thoroughly the circumstances of the crime at issue, where (1) at his plea hearing, the judge asked the defendant if his attorney had done everything he believed he should have done to represent him properly, and the defendant said yes, with the exception that he “should have got me a better plea bargain,” (2) the court then explained to the defendant that the court did not define its procedures as plea bargaining per se, but that the district attorney would reduce the charge if the defendant pled guilty and accepted a 15 year sentence on each charge, and the defendant accepted that and declined the court’s repeated offer to let the case go to trial, and (3) when asked by the court whether anyone, specifically his attorney, had pressured him into pleading guilty, the defendant responded that he had not. Taylor v. State, 766 So. 2d 830, 2000 Miss. App. LEXIS 414 (Miss. Ct. App. 2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       The defendant was not denied effective assistance of counsel in a prosecution for capital rape of an 11 year-old girl, notwithstanding his assertions that his attorney did not disagree with a continuance filed by the state, inquire about the sexual history of the victim, or inquire as to why the victim did not immediately tell her mother about the incident in question, since the defendant did not present the court with any evidence demonstrating errors made by his counsel that were so serious as to deprive him of a fair trial and failed to demonstrate how such alleged errors prejudiced his defense in any way. Patton v. State, 766 So. 2d 115, 2000 Miss. App. LEXIS 411 (Miss. Ct. App. 2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       The defendant was not denied effective assistance of counsel, notwithstanding his assertion that he was not informed of the terms of his plea agreement and that he expected a 12 year, rather than 25 year, sentence, where (1) according to the terms of the plea agreement and the petition, the defendant was aware that his guilty plea carried a maximum sentence of 30 years and that he would not be subject to the death penalty, (2) the defendant signed the plea agreement and signed and initialed the petition to enter plea, (3) at the sentencing hearing, the defendant acknowledged that he had completed nine years of school and that he could read and write and identified and verified his signature on the petition to enter plea, (4) when questioned by the court, the defendant indicated that his attorney had explained the entire petition to him, and that he was satisfied with the representation and services he had received from his attorney, and (5) the defendant was given an opportunity to make a statement or ask any questions prior to sentencing. Thomas v. State, 766 So. 2d 96, 2000 Miss. App. LEXIS 390 (Miss. Ct. App. 2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       There was no merit to the defendant’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel in connection with his guilty plea, notwithstanding the assertion that defense counsel was ineffective in that he made no effort to adequately defend the defendant against the criminal charges at issue, where the record established that defense counsel effectively counseled the defendant and that the defendant had no complaints regarding inadequate assistance of counsel at the time of his guilty plea: Jenkins v. State, 770 So. 2d 568, 2000 Miss. App. LEXIS 494 (Miss. Ct. App. 2000).

      </p>
      <p>
       Trial counsel was not ineffective for failure to request competency hearing, despite defendant’s alleged organic brain damage and Dissociative Identity Disorder; court-ordered psychological examination concluded there was no evidence defendant suffered from mental disorder and the finding that defendant was competent to stand trial was not contradicted by defendant’s experts, and even if failure to request competency hearing fell below objective standard of reasonableness, defendant failed to prove any resulting prejudice. Lockett v. Puckett, 980 F. Supp. 201, 1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16218 (S.D. Miss. 1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       A defendant did not present sufficient evidence to show that he received ineffective assistance of counsel where the defendant simply cited actions of his attorney without explaining or justifying his contention that they should be characterized as deficient and prejudicial, and the defendant made no showing that his attorney’s alleged errors affected the outcome of the case. Ahmad v. State, 603 So. 2d 843, 1992 Miss. LEXIS 321 (Miss. 1992).

       <p>
   A capital murder defendant was not denied effective assistance of counsel on direct appeal by his attorney’s alleged failure to bring to the Supreme Court’s attention a plea bargain with an accomplice who testified as a witness, where the Supreme Court was well aware that the accomplice had been permitted to plead guilty to manslaughter and that he had been sentenced to 15 years’ imprisonment but had served only 2 1/2 years. Culberson v. State, 580 So. 2d 1136, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 428 (Miss. 1990), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">502 U.S. 943</cite>, <cite class="s_court">112 S. Ct. 383</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">116 L.

      </p>
      <p>
       A defendant was not denied his right to effective assistance of counsel on the ground that his attorney gave the prosecution permission to interview the defense witnesses while allowing the prosecution to disallow the defendant from taking a deposition of the victim, since the defendant had no right to such a pre-trial deposition and the trial court lacked the authority to require the victim to talk with defense counsel where the victim was unwilling to do so; the defendant’s counsel could not be faulted as ineffective for failing to secure that which the defendant had no right to obtain.

   Claim that counsel was ineffective because certain issues were procedurally barred due to ineffective assistance of counsel did not have merit because none of issues claimed had merit and thus failure to assert them could not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel. Wiley v. State, 517 So. 2d 1373, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2915 (Miss. 1987), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">486 U.S. 1036</cite>, <cite class="s_court">108 S. Ct. 2024</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">100 L.

      <p>
       Counsel’s conduct in failing to request change of venue, to move for continuance, and to object to exhumation of body of victim, was within range of competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases and therefore did not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel. Merritt v. State, 517 So. 2d 517, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2875 (Miss. 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant was not denied effective assistance of counsel at trial where review of record did not reveal any breakdown of adversary process due to assistance rendered by defendant’s trial counsel; trial counsel performed well under facts of case where there was overwhelming proof against his client; trial judge had found that allegation by defendant that counsel did not “have his heart” in representing him was incorrect, and that attorney was very diligent in trial preparation, as well as very competent and able. Burney v. State, 515 So. 2d 1154, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2905 (Miss. 1987), but see McCarty v. State, 554 So. 2d 909, 1989 Miss. LEXIS 499 (Miss. 1989).

       <p>
   Defendant was not deprived of his Sixth Amendment rights by ineffective assistance of counsel where defendant alleged; counsel ineffectively assisted him by not retaining someone else to assist him; counsel failed to insure that pre-trial proceedings were recorded; counsel should have moved for change of venue either before trial or during voir dire; counsel’s conduct of voir dire was inadequate and prejudicial; counsel was unprepared for trial; that counsel conceded defendant’s client might be guilty of murder but not capital murder; and, counsel failed to present any expert psychological testimony at sentencing phase.

       Defendant did not show ineffective assistance of counsel where he could not show requisite prejudice because evidence of his guilt was great, although he had shown that performance of trial counsel was deficient, where little or no effort to conduct independent investigation was made and trial counsel did not speak to client after learning that he was going to be tried as habitual offender.

       In a prosecution for capital murder resulting from the commission of armed robbery, the petitioner was not subjected to ineffective counsel in violation of his Sixth Amendment right since petitioner failed to prove that the failure to have the preliminary hearing was not a strategic move, since there was no indication that a change of venue could have effected a different result in the trial, since the guilty plea entered by the petitioner was free and voluntary, and since petitioner failed to show systematic exclusion of black jurors.

       Defendant’s convictions for murder and aggravated assault were proper where he failed to show that his counsel was ineffective on direct appeal. The court did not find the record to affirmatively show ineffectiveness of constitutional dimensions, nor did the court find any stipulation by the parties regarding the adequacy of the record.

       Where defendant had a post-conviction evidentiary hearing, defendant had no constitutional guarantee to appointed counsel, and as such, without a constitutional right to counsel, there could be no deprivation of effective assistance of counsel, and defendant’s attorney was active and effective during trial, and he filed a brief providing the appellate court with logical arguments and the brief resulted in the reversal of one of defendant’s convictions; therefore, defendant had not convinced it that but for his counsel’s deficiency, a different result would have occurred. Mitchell v. State, 879 So. 2d 1082, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 766 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).

       Where an inmate offered no proof that an attorney failed to conduct an investigation, did not file certain motions, and encouraged him to plead guilty to manslaughter, a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel was properly denied in a motion seeking post-conviction relief.

       In a case related to the sale of cocaine, post-conviction relief was properly denied because appellant was not denied effective assistance of counsel as appellant’s claims about his indictment were moot, appellant having responded in the affirmative when the trial judge asked if he was satisfied with counsel; further, the signed guilty plea petition indicated that appellant was informed of the sentence he could receive and he stated he was satisfied with the representation of his counsel. Waites v. State, 872 So. 2d 758, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 429 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       In his motion for post-conviction relief, the inmate set forth sufficient evidence to undermine confidence in the outcome of the trial because counsel failed to (1) use information that a witness did not live in the apartment complex to impeach and discredit the witness’s statement that he saw the inmate leaving the victims’ apartment after the murder; (2) use the law enforcement’s door-to-door canvas of the apartment complex notes to discredit that witness; (3) discredit the statement that the inmate’s stepfather lived at the apartment complex, which provided the State with evidence placing the inmate near the victims at the time of their deaths; (4) present evidence that a shoe print found at the crime scene did not match his show size; and (5) show that two witnesses identified another suspect leaving the victims’ apartments at about the time of the murders. Therefore, the inmate was granted leave to seek post-conviction relief on the ground of ineffective assistance of counsel. Manning v. State, 884 So. 2d 717, 2004 Miss. LEXIS 469 (Miss. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Inmate’s request for leave to file an application seeking post-conviction relief was denied because the inmate was unable to show that the imposition of the death penalty was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel since defense counsel objected to the testimony of a pathologist, the admission of certain photographs, and a confession; moreover, the inmate failed to show how the introduction of medical records would have persuaded the jury to exercise leniency, and the inmate failed to show how a government-funded expert would have disputed the finding of the State’s expert. Holland v. State, 878 So. 2d 1, 2004 Miss. LEXIS 413 (Miss. 2004), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">544 U.S. 906</cite>, <cite class="s_court">125 S. Ct. 1590</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">161 L.

      </p>
      <p>
       Inmate’s request for post-conviction relief was denied because there was no showing of ineffective assistance of counsel in a plea proceeding based on the failure to advise the inmate regarding whether to accept the plea; moreover, there was no deficient performance based on the issue of failing to secure a better plea in a statutory rape case. Kelley v. State, 913 So. 2d 379, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 277 (Miss. Ct. App. 2005).

       Inmate was not denied effective assistance in a post-conviction proceeding because he had no state or federal right to counsel in the proceeding. Sheffield v. State, 881 So. 2d 249, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 998 (Miss. Ct. App. 2003), cert. dismissed, 2005 Miss. LEXIS 87 (Miss. Feb. 3, 2005).

       <p>
   In a capital murder case, the inmate filed an application for post-conviction relief based on ineffective assistance of counsel; however, several of the inmate’s ineffective assistance of counsel claims were procedurally barred because they had been discussed on direct appeal, the inmate failed to meet his burden of providing authority to support his assignment of error, and the unsworn statements of witnesses were insufficient to support the inmate’s allegations. Wilcher v. State, 863 So. 2d 776, 2003 Miss. LEXIS 492 (Miss. 2003), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">542 U.S. 942</cite>, <cite class="s_court">124 S. Ct. 2917</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">159 L.

      </p>
      <p>
       Although defense counsel’s failure to request a new trial after a murder conviction amounted to deficient performance, there was no ineffective assistance of counsel because defendant failed to demonstrate a substantial likelihood that the outcome would have been different if the motion had been granted. Johnson v. State, 876 So. 2d 387, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 943 (Miss. Ct. App. 2003), cert. denied, 878 So. 2d 66, 2004 Miss. LEXIS 881 (Miss. 2004).

      <p>
       <p>
   In a capital murder case, defendant’s petition for post-conviction relief was denied as the Supreme Court had already addressed the merits on direct appeal of his underlying ineffectiveness of counsel claims, which were found to be without merit; thus, defendant could not show the requisite deficient performance and resulting prejudice necessary to establish the ineffective assistance claims and they were res judicata. Walker v. State, 863 So. 2d 1, 2003 Miss. LEXIS 534 (Miss. 2003), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">543 U.S. 842</cite>, <cite class="s_court">125 S. Ct. 281</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">160 L.

       Post-conviction movant was entitled to evidentiary hearing on claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel; trial counsel’s failure to raise certain objections may have frustrated movant’s right to fair trial and trial court’s limited analysis of claim fell short of sufficient inquiry to justify dismissing claim on the merits.

       After Court of Appeals granted state’s petition for rehearing and affirmed conviction which it had originally reversed, defendant showed good cause for extraordinary relief from rule prohibiting losing party from filing further petition for rehearing; defendant had no occasion to address Court of Appeals’ disposition of his ineffective assistance issues and filing motion for rehearing with Court of Appeals was prerequisite to seeking further relief in Supreme Court.

   A trial court did not err in failing to sua sponte appoint counsel for a post-conviction relief petitioner at the evidentiary hearing, in spite of the petitioner’s contention that it was clear that he lacked knowledge and understanding of the proceedings being conducted by the court. A criminal defendant has neither a state nor federal constitutional right to appointed counsel in post-conviction proceedings. Additionally, the appointment of counsel at an evidentiary hearing is discretionary with the trial judge by virtue of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.99.html#t99c39s99-39-23ol11" target="_blank">99-39-23(1)</a></cite>.

       Claim that confession was taken in violation of defendant’s right to counsel was procedurally barred because it had not been raised in any previous court pleading, nor had defendant shown sufficient legal cause to excuse his failure to timely raise claim.

       Claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is not procedurally viable where defendant waived issue when he declined to assert that point in his error coram nobis pleading; defendant had not shown sufficient cause to excuse this waiver where record reflected that trial counsel exited state court proceedings at conclusion of direct appeal and did not participate in presentation of error coram nobis pleading.

       All defendants, whether indigent or not, have a constitutional right to legal counsel in any criminal proceeding filed against them, and any conviction obtained by fraud, perjury or other corrupt means may be corrected by proper post-conviction remedies. Therefore, it is not unreasonable to require a plaintiff to show that a criminal proceeding terminated in his favor before allowing recovery in a malicious prosecution action based on such criminal proceeding.

   Post-conviction relief was properly denied where trial counsel’s failure to seek a change of venue because of pretrial publicity was not error, as most of the venire was largely unaware of the case, and those who were unaware of it assured counsel and the trial court that they could be impartial. Thong Le v. State, 967 So. 2d 627, 2007 Miss. LEXIS 452 (Miss. 2007), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">552 U.S. 1300</cite>, <cite class="s_court">128 S. Ct. 1747</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">170 L.

       Federal district court correctly denied state death row inmate’s habeas corpus petition; the venue chosen for petitioner’s resentencing hearing was proper, even though it was in the county in which the crimes occurred, and even though the trial venue had been changed to a different county due to excessive pretrial publicity, because years had passed since petitioner had been found guilty, and although two of selected resentencing jurors had some knowledge of the case, petitioner failed to prove that the resentencing jury was tainted.

       In an indecent exposure, reckless driving, and malicious mischief case, defendant did not receive inadequate notice of the nature and cause of the accusations against him as all three affidavits quoted the relevant language of the applicable statutes and there was no requirement that the formal name or statutory section be listed. As a result, all three of the affidavits were facially sufficient. Johnson v. State, 879 So. 2d 1057, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 554 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004), overruled in part, Jones v.

   In a capital murder case, the trial court did not err in denying defendant’s request for a change of venue as no evidence was offered of any threatened violence toward defendant, nor was there an inordinate amount of media coverage, the testimony of the State’s witnesses demonstrated that defendant could receive a fair trial, defendant offered no additional evidence to rebut the State’s witnesses, and defendant did not present any evidence that he could not receive or had not received a fair trial from the jurors who heard his case.

       In a grand larceny case, the self-authenticating pen-packs were not inadmissible as a violation of the Confrontation Clause as the certificate on the pen-packs indicated that the custodian of records swore that the documents were true and correct copies, not that defendant actually committed any act. Accordingly, the “matter asserted” was that the pen-packs were accurate copies of official records, not that defendant was, in fact, a habitual offender, making the pen-packs admissible. Frazier v. State, 907 So. 2d 985, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 158 (Miss. Ct. App. 2005).

       Defendant’s right to a speedy trial was not violated because although the total delay in the case was lengthy, the majority of the delay was justified by good cause or was attributable to defendant’s actions; a witness’s unavailability constituted good cause for the final delay in the case because it gave the parties additional time to attempt to locate the witness and allowed defendant time to prepare for trial in his absence. Newell v. State, 175 So.3d 1260, 2015 Miss. LEXIS 505 (Miss. 2015).
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if defendant’s trial counsel was deficient in allegedly failing to make numerous potential objections to hearsay and other improper evidence, there was no reasonable probability that the proceeding would have been different given the plethora of evidence against defendant, including his confession that he had “killed the bitch.” While trial counsel’s performance may have been less than perfect, there was nothing in the record that proved that trial counsel’s performance was not within the “wide range of reasonable professional assistance.” Gibson v. State, 895 So. 2d 185, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 1142 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).

       Circuit court did not err in allowing defendant to represent himself because the circuit court abided by the law and the requirements of Miss. Unif. Cir. & Cty. R. 8.05; defendant made a knowing and intelligent waiver of his Sixth Amendment right to assistance of counsel, defendant knew that he had a right to counsel because counsel had been appointed to represent him, and defendant knew that his court-appointed counsel was representing him both before and after he elected to manage his own defense since he expressly agreed to counsel’s continued assistance.

       On the inmate’s petition for post-conviction relief, the court held that the inmate was not prejudiced by counsel’s failure to transcribe the full record because the inmate did not claim any specific error arising from the non-transcribed sections of the record. Brawner v. State, 947 So. 2d 254, 2006 Miss. LEXIS 625 (Miss. 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant, who entered a guilty plea pursuant to a plea agreement, contended in his post-conviction action that he received ineffective assistance of counsel since his counsel failed to file a motion for discovery. However, defendant provided no assertion of critical evidence that would have been discovered had it not been for counsel’s alleged deficiency; moreover, the record was clear that on two separate occasions, defendant answered the trial court that he was satisfied with trial counsel’s performance, and therefore, defendant did not meet his burden of proof that counsel was ineffective. Moore v. State, 906 So. 2d 793, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 1152 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).

   Defendant was not forced to proceed pro se without knowingly or voluntarily waiving his right to an attorney because after being warned of the dangers of self-representation, defendant made it clear that he wished to take the “lead” role in a “co-counsel” arrangement with his court-appointed attorney; defendant was never left to his own defense as a wholly pro se litigant but always had access to counsel.

   Chancellor erred by failing to transfer a dispute over contractual obligations to a circuit court because a former member did not bring most of the claims derivatively under Miss.

       While limited nature of court’s resources is not legitimate reason for it to deny party the right to jury trial, if jury is indeed mandated by the Seventh Amendment, such policy concerns should not be overlooked.

       Chapter 13 debtor was not entitled to jury trial on her damages claims against creditor for its alleged intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligent infliction of emotional distress, and slander in connection with its postpetition efforts to collect prepetition debt, though jury trial would have been available to debtor on such claims absent her bankruptcy filing; debtor’s claims, which arose from creditor’s alleged violation of automatic stay, involved adjustment of debtor-creditor relationship and implicated public rights, particularly where creditor had filed proof of claim. Gordon v. Friedman's Inc. (In re Gordon), 209 B.R. 414, 1997 Bankr. LEXIS 1052 (Bankr. N.D. Miss. 1997).

       Claimants who were asserting uninsured motorists claims were not entitled to a jury trial in chancery court or to have the case transferred to circuit court in order to provide them with a jury trial in an interpleader action brought by the insurer where the facts of the case were not disputed and only the law applicable to those facts was questioned by the parties. Cossitt v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 551 So. 2d 879, 1989 Miss. LEXIS 318 (Miss. 1989), overruled in part, Meyers v. Am. States Ins. Co., 914 So. 2d 669, 2005 Miss. LEXIS 322 (Miss. 2005).

       State courts are not controlled by this provision, even in cases arising under Federal statutes, and so on appeal may render final judgment contrary to the verdict, where the trial court should have directed a verdict.

   In a capital murder case, the State’s invocation of higher biblical law did not violate the inmate’s rights under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, or under Miss. Const. Art. 3, § 14, because the prosecutor was responding to the biblical argument made by the inmate’s attorney; also, the inmate’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim for counsels’ failure to object to the State’s biblical references had to fail. Wilcher v. State, 863 So. 2d 776, 2003 Miss. LEXIS 492 (Miss. 2003), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">542 U.S. 942</cite>, <cite class="s_court">124 S. Ct. 2917</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">159 L.

      </p>
      <p>
       Although all of petitioner death row inmate’s arguments were procedurally barred either by res judicata or for failure to raise the arguments earlier, and no intervening case law exempted petitioner from the procedural bar, the court also reviewed petitioner’s arguments on the merits; it reiterated its earlier holdings that there were no constitutional deficiencies in the Mississippi murder and death penalty statutes, including those relating to death resulting from child abuse as capital murder, and that none of the alleged deficiencies of defense counsel could have affected petitioner’s outcome. Jackson v. State, 860 So. 2d 653, 2003 Miss. LEXIS 355 (Miss. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Eighth Amendment does not apply to the fact of incarceration, but rather to its conditions. Jones v. City of Jackson, 203 F.3d 875, 2000 U.S. App. LEXIS 1992 (5th Cir. Miss. 2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Eighth Amendment imposes a duty upon responsible prison officials to protect prisoners from violence at the hands of other prisoners. Earrey v. Chickasaw County, 965 F. Supp. 870, 1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10990 (N.D. Miss. 1997).

   In a capital murder prosecution, the prosecutor’s references to a second victim did not violate the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, since these references were necessary to tell the complete story of the crime where both victims were killed in the same mobile home with the same gun. Ladner v. State, 584 So. 2d 743, 1991 Miss. LEXIS 434 (Miss.), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">502 U.S. 1015</cite>, <cite class="s_court">112 S. Ct. 663</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">116 L.

   Defendant’s sentence of death by lethal injection for the crime of capital murder with the underlying felony of robbery was not unconstitutional because defendant’s due process rights were not violated as the indictment and jury instructions were sufficient, the aggravating circumstances supported the sentence, and Mississippi’s lethal-injection protocol did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment. Batiste v. State, 121 So.3d 808, 2013 Miss. LEXIS 295 (Miss. 2013), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">572 U.S. 1117</cite>, <cite class="s_court">134 S. Ct. 2287</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">189 L.

   Defendant’s enhanced sentence of 60 years, a two million dollar fine, and fifty dollars in restitution, pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.41.html#t41c29s41-29-152" target="_blank">41-29-152</a></cite>, for possession of methamphetamine with intent to distribute and possession of a firearm while intending to distribute, was not disproportionate to the crime committed and did not amount to cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment because his sentence did not exceed the statutory limits. Even though defendant was a first time offender and possessed a small amount of methamphetamine, the trial judge had discretion under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.41.html#t41c29s41-29-149" target="_blank">41-29-149</a></cite> to reduce the statutory sentence for first time offenders; however, the trial court was not required to take into account the first time offender status when sentencing. Passman v. State, 937 So. 2d 17, 2006 Miss. App. LEXIS 89 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 936 So. 2d 367, 2006 Miss.

VIII and XIV. The fact that Mississippi’s capital murder scheme made the death penalty a possible punishment for felony murder where there was no requirement to prove an intent to kill did not make the Mississippi capital murder statute unconstitutional. Davis v. State, 914 So. 2d 200, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 269 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 921 So. 2d 344, 2005 Miss.

       Pretrial detainees are protected from harm by virtue of the Due Process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, while convicted inmates are protected from harm by the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. Earrey v. Chickasaw County, 965 F. Supp. 870, 1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10990 (N.D. Miss. 1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where parolee is incarcerated, both Fourteenth Amendment due process concerns and the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment are implicated, but the presumptive intent to punish derived from the
       <i>
        Bell
       </i>
       test does not arise in such a case involving conditions of confinement; rather, detained parolee may establish a Fourteenth Amendment due process claim for the conditions of his confinement only where he can present direct evidence of an expressed intent to punish him for the crime for which he has been charged but not yet convicted, but even without the availability of the
       <i>
        Bell
       </i>
       test, he may still utilize the Eighth Amendment to pursue a separate claim regarding conditions of confinement. Earrey v. Chickasaw County, 965 F. Supp. 870, 1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10990 (N.D. Miss. 1997).

       In defendant’s postconviction relief action, defendant submitted to the Mississippi Supreme Court an affidavit of an expert who testified that defendant had received intelligence quotient (IQ) scores of below 75 percent, and who opined to a reasonable degree of psychological certainty that defendant was mentally retarded. While the Mississippi Supreme Court’s decision in Chase v. State governed the determination of the case, and under Chase, there were other factors that defendant had to present to the trial court in order to prove mental retardation so as to avoid the death penalty, defendant minimally met defendant’s burden of production so as to be entitled to an evidentiary hearing.

       In defendant’s capital murder case, the death sentence did not violate defendant’s Eight Amendment rights where defendant’s expert witness did not offer the opinion that defendant was mentally retarded; instead, he testified that defendant functioned in the range of borderline retardation which described an IQ range higher than that for mental retardation Thus, defendant did not establish that he was entitled to a Chase hearing.

       Section 63-11-30, which imposes a maximum 5-year penalty for the operation of a vehicle in violation of the implied consent law coupled with negligently causing the death or mutilation of another, is not arbitrary and does not constitute cruel and unusual punishment.

      </p>
      <p>
       Discretion of prosecutor and his power to plea bargain did not render capital murder law unconstitutional, since both practices are necessary to the system of justice, nor did imposition of the mandatory death penalty pursuant to the statute constitute cruel and unusual punishment, especially since there was no showing that it was discriminatorily applied.

       Suit alleging that school official grabbed arm of student did not show type of action calculated to cause serious injury, nor did not such act evince malice or intention to cause injury, and even if serious injuries may have resulted, nature of contact suggested that any injuries were unintended rather than calculated and that if force used was in fact excessive, it came from carelessness or excess of zeal rather than malice. Whether physical harm by state officer rises to level of constitutional deprivation depends on extent of injury inflicted, degree of force used in proportion to amount necessary under circumstances, and motives of official; bottom-line inquiry is whether official’s conduct amounted to abuse of official power that shocks conscience.

       While Atkins determinations, as to whether one is intellectually disabled and therefore imposing the death penalty would violate the Eighth Amendment, are legal decisions, they are decisions that must be informed by medical experts, and the trial judge abused her discretion by denying the State’s motion to evaluate petitioner; the state hospital did not assess in 2006 whether petitioner had an intellectual disability, and instead it was the trial judge, not the expert, who opined that no further assessment was necessary, which was error.

       Trial court erred by holding that defendant was not intellectually disabled for capital sentencing purposes where it applied an incorrect legal standard by treating defendant’s IQ score of between 70 and 75 alone as dispositive of the case and by failing to balance and analyze his adaptive functioning deficits with his IQ score, even though the trial court found that defendant had proved the existence of two adaptive functioning deficits.

   In a capital murder case where defendant was sentenced to death, the circuit court did not clearly err by finding that defendant failed to prove intellectual disability by a preponderance of the evidence because, although defendant met his burden of proof of subaverage intellectual functioning, defendant failed to prove that he had significant deficits in adaptive functioning.

   In a capital murder case, the trial court’s refusal to grant defendant’s motion for funds to obtain mental health expert’s assistance to determine if he was exempt from execution under the Eighth Amendment because of his mental retardation was properly denied and did not constitute a violation of his due process rights because defendant did not show a substantial need for an independent expert because: (1) based on his intelligence quotient tests, one doctor already determined that defendant was mentally retarded; and (2) a second doctor stated in her affidavit that she thought defendant was mentally retarded, and that further testing and a complete social history was necessary to accurately ascertain whether defendant was in fact mentally retarded.

   Execution of mentally retarded inmates constituted cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment; the trial court did not err in finding that defendant was not mentally retarded because: (1) although two doctor’s opined that defendant was mentally retarded based on his intelligence quotient tests, a second doctor testified that he found defendant to be below average intelligence but not mentally retarded; (2) a doctor who opined that defendant was mentally retarded was asked if a person who was mentally retarded could write documents that an officer stated that defendant wrote and he stated that it would be highly unlikely; (3) the officer saw defendant create the documents in his room without assistance, saw him use the law library on several occasions, and noticed that he had legal books in his cell; and (4) a psychiatrist at the Mississippi department of corrections stated that her diagnostic impression was that mental retardation could be ruled out.

       Summary judgment for jail supervisor on prisoner’s claim of deliberate indifference to serious medical need was precluded by genuine issues of material fact on whether jail supervisor acted reasonably in not calling paramedics or taking prisoner to emergency room immediately upon learning that he had suffered eye injury three hours earlier and in not following up on his own orders, thereby allowing prisoner to go without proper medical treatment for at least another three hours.

      <p>
       In asserting Eighth Amendment claim against municipality or county for injury to inmate, it is important to distinguish between the “state of mind” required to establish a violation of a constitutional right and the culpability standard required to impose 42 U.S.C.S. § 1983 liability upon a municipality or county; while the governmental entity may only need be shown to be objectively deliberately indifferent to the known or obvious consequences of a custom or policy which does not itself violate federal law, it cannot be held liable unless the plaintiff shows that a constitutional violation has in fact occurred, which requires that a prison official must know that inmates face a substantial risk of serious harm and disregard that risk by failing to take reasonable measures to abate it. Earrey v. Chickasaw County, 965 F. Supp. 870, 1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10990 (N.D. Miss. 1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       In civil rights action against county under the Eighth Amendment arising from beating of detained parolee by other inmates at county jail, there were genuine issues of material fact, precluding summary judgment, as to existence of subjective knowledge of risk on part of jailer and sheriff, as well as actual or imputed knowledge of county itself. Earrey v. Chickasaw County, 965 F. Supp. 870, 1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10990 (N.D. Miss. 1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       In instances where inmate’s “failure to protect” claim arises out of an episodic act or omission on the part of a jail official, the appropriate standard to be applied is identical regardless of the inmate’s custodial status as pretrial detainee or convicted inmate, requiring demonstration of subjective knowledge of a substantial risk of serious harm and the failure to take reasonable measures to abate it, but where a pretrial detainee challenges a general condition of confinement, the court presumes intent on the part of prison officials and looks to whether the challenged condition of confinement is reasonably related to a legitimate governmental objective. Earrey v. Chickasaw County, 965 F. Supp. 870, 1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10990 (N.D. Miss. 1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       An underlying principle of the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment is that it only prohibits unnecessary and wanton inflictions of pain; consequently, Eighth Amendment liability only attaches when a responsible official has a sufficiently culpable state of mind: knowing that inmates face a substantial risk of serious harm and disregarding that risk by failing to take reasonable measures to abate it. Earrey v. Chickasaw County, 965 F. Supp. 870, 1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10990 (N.D. Miss. 1997).

       A complaint that a physician has been negligent in diagnosing or treating a prisoner’s medical condition does not state a valid claim of medical mistreatment under the Eighth Amendment. Medical malpractice does not become a constitutional violation merely because the victim is a prisoner. In order to state a cognizable claim, a prisoner must allege acts or omissions sufficiently harmful to evidence deliberate indifference to serious medical needs. It is only such indifference that can offend “evolving standards of decency” in violation of the Eighth Amendment. McFadden v. State, 542 So. 2d 871, 1989 Miss. LEXIS 65 (Miss. 1989).

Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.99.html#t99c39s99-39-27ol17" target="_blank">99-39-27(7)</a></cite>, the court found that due process required the court to allow the inmate’s motion to be filed in the trial court for the consideration of mental retardation evidence as a defense to the death penalty as cruel and unusual punishment under U.S. Const. amend. VIII. Chase v. State, 873 So. 2d 1013, 2004 Miss. LEXIS 548 (Miss. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       No defendant may be adjudged mentally retarded unless such defendant produces an expert who expresses an opinion that defendant is mentally retarded and defendant has completed certain tests, after which defendant may present other evidence, after which the State may offer evidence, after which the trial court must determine if defendant is mentally retarded. Chase v. State, 873 So. 2d 1013, 2004 Miss. LEXIS 548 (Miss. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       The absence of mental retardation is not an aggravating factor necessary for imposition of the death penalty, and the Ring standard, which requires a finding of aggravating circumstances for imposition of the death penalty by a jury, has no application to an Atkins v. Virginia determination, prohibiting the execution of mentally retarded offenders. Russell v. State, 849 So. 2d 95, 2003 Miss. LEXIS 297 (Miss. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       In determining whether a state court’s application of its constitutionally adequate aggravating factor was so erroneous as to raise an independent due process or Eighth Amendment violation for habeas corpus purposes, even though it is issue of law, habeas corpus court must afford a presumption of correctness to any factual findings made by state court in its determination of whether the facts were sufficient to support the challenged aggravating circumstance; however, habeas court is not necessarily bound by such factual findings. Lockett v. Puckett, 980 F. Supp. 201, 1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16218 (S.D. Miss. 1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant was entitled to habeas relief on issue of state court’s application of especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel aggravating circumstance, and to vacated death sentence with new sentencing hearing, where state Supreme Court failed to make any factual findings concerning the death of murder victim and failed to set forth any facts on which to base such an opinion; given lack of any factual basis to support court’s conclusion, no reasonable factfinder could conclude that the crime was conscienceless or pitiless and unnecessarily torturous where victim was shot immediately with little or no warning upon opening front door to defendant. Lockett v. Puckett, 980 F. Supp. 201, 1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16218 (S.D. Miss. 1997).

      <p>
       Jury executed process for narrowing class of persons eligible for death penalty by finding that defendant intended to kill and actually killed victim while contemplating that lethal force would be used in her murder, and, thus, felony murder aggravating circumstance was not constitutionally infirm and penalty was not disproportionate to crime.

   In order to uphold mentally retarded defendant’s Eighth Amendment protection against cruel and unusual punishment, jury must be provided vehicle with which to consider and give effect to mitigating evidence of defendant’s mental retardation in rendering its sentence.

      </p>
      <p>
       Felony-murder aggravator is not disproportionate within meaning of Eighth Amendment, although unintentional felony murder is punishable by death, while premeditated murder, standing alone, is not; not every defendant eligible for death penalty will have committed murder while in course of robbery or kidnapping or other statutorily enumerated felonies, and thus, felony-murder aggravator genuinely narrows class of defendants eligible for death penalty.

       Considering underlying crime of felonious abuse as aggravating factor during sentencing of capital murder defendant did not fail to narrow class of defendants eligible for death penalty, in violation of Eighth Amendment; fact that aggravating circumstance duplicates element of crime does not make death sentence constitutionally infirm.

   Submission of “robbery” aggravating circumstance during penalty phase of capital murder case did not violate constitutional prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment, although defendant was charged with murder while in commission of armed robbery.

   “Avoiding arrest” aggravating factor was properly submitted to jury in penalty phase of capital murder case, even though defendant claimed that arrest avoidance was inherent in every murder, as it by definition eliminated one of the possible witnesses and that further limiting instruction was required to channel jury’s focus on situations in which there is specific evidence demonstrating that one of the purposes beyond the killing was desire to avoid detection and apprehension for underlying crime.

   Although record in capital murder case indicated that veniremember who was excused for cause stated during voir dire that he could impose death penalty if circumstances warranted, and that another veniremember with similar name, who was not excused, indicated he could not impose death penalty under any circumstances, trial court did not err, where defense counsel’s failure to differentiate between the 2 veniremembers during questioning and parties’ subsequent arguments led to conclusion that court reporter mistakenly transposed veniremembers’ names.

It was highly unlikely that the grandfather’s statement, when read as a whole and taken in context with all the evidence before the sentencing judge, was the reason the judge imposed the death penalty; in fact, the trial judge’s sentencing order, in which he made findings of facts as to the various aggravating and mitigating factors, did not even mention the grandfather’s testimony.

   In the sentencing phase of a capital murder prosecution, the prosecutor’s comments during closing argument portraying the victim as a “grandmother” who left home “wearing her mother’s day present ring on her finger,” and asking the jury not to forget the victim “because she deserves justice” did not constitute an impermissible argument to sentence the defendant to death out of vengeance and sympathy for the victim; the introduction of evidence concerning the background and character of the victim and the impact of the crime on the victim’s family is not prohibited, as such evidence may be relevant to the jury’s decision as to whether the death penalty should be imposed.

   In the sentencing phase of a capital murder prosecution, the trial court did not err in refusing to give peremptory instructions requiring the jury to find 5 mitigating factors which the defendant claimed were undisputed, since the existence of mitigating factors should be left to the jury’s consideration; while it is constitutionally required that a jury not be precluded from considering any mitigating factor, a jury is not required to find such factors. Carr v. State, 655 So. 2d 824, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 56 (Miss. 1995), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">516 U.S. 1077</cite>, <cite class="s_court">116 S. Ct. 783</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">133 L.

   A sentencing instruction in a capital murder prosecution properly defined the “especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel” aggravating factor, and thus there was no violation of the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution, where the instruction defined the term “heinous, atrocious, or cruel” as “those situations where the actual commission of the capital felony was accomplished by such additional acts to set the crime apart from the norm of capital felonies by the consciencelessness or pitilessness of the crime which is unnecessarily tortuous to the victim.” Hansen v.

       <p>
   In the sentencing phase of a capital murder prosecution, the definition of the “especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel” aggravating factor contained in the limiting instruction was constitutionally adequate where the instruction described an especially heinous, atrocious or cruel capital offense as a “conscienceless or pitiless crime which is unnecessarily torturous to the victim” and which can be shown by the fact that the defendant “utilized a method of killing which caused serious mutilation where there is a dismemberment of the corpse, where the defendant inflicted physical or mental pain before death, where there was mental torture and aggravation before death or where a lingering or torturous death was suffered by the victim.”

   In the sentencing phase of a capital murder prosecution, a jury instruction which provided a step-by-step guide in arriving at a verdict did not impermissibly limit the consideration of mitigating evidence, in spite of the defendant’s argument that the language of the instruction could have misled the jury to believe that a finding of mitigating circumstances must be unanimous because “everything else” required a unanimous finding, where the mitigating circumstances portion of the instruction did not contain the word “unanimous” or “unanimously,” and the instruction would not have implied to any reasonably literate juror that he or she should await unanimity before considering a mitigating circumstance.

       A jury instruction at the sentence phase of a murder prosecution that it should consider as an aggravating circumstance that the capital offense was committed for pecuniary gain and while the defendant was engaged in the commission of robbery did not violate defendant’s Eighth Amendment rights, since the evidence supported both “robbery” and “pecuniary gain” instructions as aggravating circumstances in that the robbery was committed for pecuniary gain during the course of which the homicide occurred.

       Defendant’s contention that the sentence was disproportionate to the offenses which defendant committed and that it amounted to unconstitutionally cruel and unusual punishment was without merit because the sentences were within the statutory limits, and defendant did not make a serious effort to substantiate a disproportionality claim based on the controlling law.

      <p>
       The termination of a mother’s parental rights, in part because of her criminal acts and resulting imprisonment, did not amount to cruel and unusual punishment since the termination of her parental rights was a separate matter from that of her criminal conviction, and the action for termination of parental rights was not brought to further punish the mother, but was a reasonable exercise of the State’s legitimate interest in providing for the welfare of the children.

       In a sale of cocaine case, defendant’s 60-year sentence was not excessive because it was well within the statutorily proscribed limits, the trial judge noted that defendant had sold cocaine to a buyer over 100 times, and the gas station at which defendant sold cocaine was within walking distance of a school.

   Defendant’s sentence as a habitual offender after he was convicted of the possession of cocaine and the possession of hydromorphone was constitutional because he was sentenced to 108 years under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.41.html#t41c29s41-29-147" target="_blank">41-29-147</a></cite>, and that sentence was within the statutory limits. Roach v.

       Defendant’s sentence of 20 years in prison, with 10 years to be suspended and five years of post-release probation, for one count of burglary of an occupied dwelling was not grossly disproportionate where he had been involved in other domestic disturbances prior to the one in question; thus, the 20-year sentence was within the statutory guidelines.

   Circuit court had the authority to impose a life sentence for defendant’s conviction of capital rape because the legislature used words indicating judicial discretion would be the determination for crimes of statutory rape in Miss.

   In a statutory rape case, defendant’s Eighth Amendment rights were not violated by the imposition of a 40-year sentence for three convictions because the sentence imposed was within the range provided in Miss.

       In an assault case, defendant’s sentence did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment as the maximum sentence for aggravated assault was 20 years and defendant’s 15-year sentence was not excessive or disproportionate to the crime.

   Two consecutive 20-year sentences for defendant’s convictions for manslaughter and aggravated assault where he shot and killed his wife’s boyfriend and shot his wife in the neck did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment as the sentences imposed were within the statutory range for Miss.

       Consecutive sentences of 30 and 45 years for armed carjacking and armed robbery were within the statutory limits for those offenses and were not excessive despite the length of the sentences and regardless of the fact that defendant chose to go to trial rather than accept a plea bargain for 10 years on each count as his codefendants elected to do.

   On appeal, defendant alleged that the trial court’s sentence for his first offense constituted cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment, but consideration of first time offender status was not the trial judge’s only consideration in sentencing defendant to the maximum sentence available; defendant’s sentence was not grossly disproportionate to the crime of possession of precursor drugs with knowledge that the drugs would be used to manufacture a controlled substance for which he already had been convicted; thus, the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in sentencing defendant to the maximum penalty available within the statute, Miss.

       Where defendant’s 20-year sentence with only 14 years actually to serve was within the statutory parameters and was not grossly disproportionate to the crime, defendant failed to show that his sentence was disproportionately harsh for the crime charges, and therefore was cruel and unusual.

       The appellate court rejected defendant’s argument that his 12-year sentence for possession of cocaine was cruel and unusual because it was disproportionately harsh due to the fact that possession of cocaine was a victimless crime which constituted no danger to the community.

   Evidence that defendant pointed a gun at two store clerks, demanded money, and took money from the cash register drawer and the clerks’ purses, supported the imposition of consecutive 30-year and 10-year sentences against a defendant convicted of two counts of armed robbery; sentences were within the maximum range set forth in Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.97.html#t97c03s97-3-79" target="_blank">97-3-79</a></cite> and were not cruel or unusual punishment under either the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States or Miss.

       Sentence of life imprisonment for armed robbery was not cruel or unusual where statute under which defendant was charged imposed penalty of life imprisonment upon conviction, and conviction was based on testimony of accomplice who received only 5 years suspended sentence, because accomplice’s description of events on night in question was corroborated by others.

       The mandatory life sentence meted out to defendant, who was convicted of murder, did not violate the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, even though the sentencing statute did not provide for individual consideration of the offense and the offender, since no such procedure is required for a charge less than a capital charge.

   Felony-murder aggravator is not disproportionate within meaning of Eighth Amendment even though unintentional felony-murder is punishable by death while premeditated murder, standing alone, is not, as not every defendant eligible for death penalty will have committed murder while in the course of statutorily enumerated felonies, so that felony-murder aggravator genuinely narrows class of defendants eligible for the death penalty.

   A defendant’s sentence was not disproportionate to the crime and did not amount to cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution where he was convicted of possession of marijuana with intent to deliver or distribute and was sentenced to serve 20 years in the custody of the Mississippi Department of Corrections and ordered to pay a $250,000 fine, since the sentence was less than the maximum 30 years imprisonment and one million dollar fine authorized by §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.41.html#t41c29s41-29-139ol1b1" target="_blank">41-29-139(b)(1)</a></cite>.

   Sentence of life imprisonment without parole was not unconstitutionally disproportionate for defendant sentenced as habitual offender on record of convictions for burglary, armed robbery, and prison escape, and was not cruel and unusual punishment under Eighth Amendment. Even though final conviction was for auto burglary, a concededly less offense than earlier offenses, earlier record was of convictions for armed robbery, burglary, escape, and armed robbery, at least two of which were crimes of violence per se.

   Defendant could not assert that death penalty violated Eighth Amendment because statutes did not set a minimum age below which child may not be transferred from youth court to circuit court for crimes punishable by death where defendant committed his crime at age 17, an age where it is sufficiently clear that no national consensus forbids imposition of capital punishment. Blue v. State, 674 So. 2d 1184, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 304 (Miss.), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">519 U.S. 1030</cite>, <cite class="s_court">117 S. Ct. 588</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">136 L.

       <p>
   Mississippi procedure does not violate the constitutional prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment by vesting original jurisdiction in the circuit court when a person under 18 years of age is charged with a capital offense, rather than requiring a certification proceeding in youth court for transfer to the circuit court; Mississippi law allows a capital murder defendant who is under the age of 18 years to request a special hearing to consider his or her age, lack of prior offenses, likelihood of successful rehabilitation and other factors which favor sending the case to the youth court rather than continuing in circuit court.

       <p>
   Mississippi procedure does not violate the constitutional prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment by its failure to explicitly state a minimum age that a person may be subject to the death penalty, since the age at which one may receive a death sentence for the crime of capital murder is implied; no one under 13 years of age may receive the death penalty because a child under the age of 13 cannot even be charged with a felony.

   A sentence of death was not improperly based on “vengeance and sympathy,” in spite of the defendant’s argument that the jury’s sentencing determination was improperly predicated on the personal characteristics of the victim, where in response to the defendant’s parents’ request to the jury not to sentence their son to death the prosecutor merely noted that the defendant’s parents were not the only ones who had suffered and grieved and that their “tears might be outweighed by the fact of the victim’s murder,” and he reminded the jury that the victim’s parents had also suffered a loss and that they must not forget the “cold, calculated killing” of the victim.

      <p>
       A death sentence for a conviction of murder was disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar capital cases, considering both the crime and the defendant, where the defendant was 18 years old at the time of the crime, he suffered some mental illness and mental retardation, the murder was committed by another person, and the defendant did nothing physically to assist the other person in the assault.

       In his post-conviction relief petition, petitioner failed to identify an alternative method of execution that was feasible, readily implemented, and significantly reduced a substantial risk of severe pain; thus, from the face of the petition, he had no Eighth Amendment method-of-execution claim, and his request for leave to proceed in the trial court with a motion for post-conviction relief was denied.

   On the inmate’s claim that his execution would be unconstitutional under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments because he was mentally retarded, he was entitled to and did not receive an Atkins hearing because the inmate met the requirements of Chase and its progeny; the inmate’s claim was not procedurally barred under Miss.

       Petitioner’s application for leave to file a motion to vacate death sentence on the ground of mental retardation was denied; petitioner was a normal, productive citizen who was never characterized as “mentally retarded” until such time as being mentally retarded became critically important in the realm of postconviction relief.

   Imposition of death penalty was not cruel and unusual punishment where the prisoner was an active participant in the victim’s murder, he knew that the kidnapping was committed in order to teach the victim a lesson, he held the victim down while another man hit the victim in the head with a hammer, and he chased the victim and brought him back for the beating to continue.

       Court concludes that the United States Supreme Court case law granted Eighth Amendment protection from execution to all mentally retarded persons, and the definitions approved and adopted in case law provide a clear standard to be used in Mississippi by the trial court in determining, for Eighth Amendment purposes, whether a criminal defendant was mentally retarded, and a trial judge will make such determination by a preponderance of the evidence, after receiving evidence presented by defendant and State.

       The court reversed the dismissal of an inmate’s claim for declaratory and injunctive relief from an alleged Eighth Amendment violation and would remand for further proceedings where the inmate alleged (1) that the conditions of his confinement deprived him of cleanliness, sleep, and peace of mind, such conditions including housing in filthy, unsanitary cells, and (2) that he was subjected to frequent searches with no purpose but to harass him.

       Inmates who are placed in administrative segregation have no constitutional basis for demanding the same privileges as those inmates in the general prison population since prison officials have the discretion to determine whether and when to provide prisoners with privileges such as showers, exercise, visitation, and access to personal property. Thus, the 5 hours a week of exercise plus nightly showers of 15 minutes which were provided to an inmate confined to administrative segregation did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment. Additionally, the procedures provided when the inmate was placed in administrative segregation satisfied the due process clause where the inmate received notice of detention and a hearing on the matter.

   In any case in which the imposition of the death penalty is possible, the habitual offender hearing should be held prior to jury deliberations on the death penalty; where a defendant is adjudged to be a habitual offender, the jury should be informed that a life sentence means “life, without probation or parole.” Accurately informing the jury that the alternative to the death penalty is life, without benefit of probation or parole, can only enhance the sentencing process, insuring that excessive punishment shall not be inflicted.

        Proposal and Ratification.
       </b>
       This amendment was proposed to the Legislatures of the several States by the Third Congress, on March 4, 1794; and was declared in a message from the President to Congress, dated January 8, 1798, to have been ratified by the legislatures of three-fourths of the States. The States which ratified this amendment, and the dates of ratification are: New York, Mar. 27, 1794; Rhode Island, Mar. 31, 1794; Connecticut, May 8, 1794; New Hampshire, June 16, 1794; Massachusetts, June 26, 1794; Vermont, between Oct. 9 and Nov. 9, 1794; Virginia, Nov. 18, 1794; Georgia, Nov. 29, 1794; Kentucky, Dec. 7, 1794; Maryland, Dec. 26, 1794; Delaware, Jan. 23, 1795; North Carolina, Feb. 7, 1795. Ratification was completed on February 7, 1795.
      </p>
      <p>
       The amendment was subsequently ratified by South Carolina on December 4, 1797. New Jersey and Pennsylvania did not take action on the amendment.
      </p>
      <p>
       This amendment was passed in consequence of the decision of Chisholm v Georgia, 2 US 419, 1 L Ed 440 (1793), which held that a state could be sued by a citizen of another state in assumpsit.

       Because a hospital was not entitled to sovereign immunity on its probated claim against an estate, the chancellor did not err by denying its sovereign-immunity claim; the chancellor had jurisdiction to adjudicate the probated claim filed by the hospital and contested by the estate because what was before the chancery court was the validity of the hospital’s probated claim, not the estate’s counterclaim for emotional distress, fraud, and punitive damages.

       Notwithstanding Congress’ intent to abrogate Eleventh Amendment immunity in enacting the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, Congress did not act pursuant to constitutional authority and, therefore, the plaintiff’s claim against the Mississippi Department of Transportation for a violation of the ADA was barred by the Eleventh Amendment.

       Order requiring newspaper notice to allow victims named in sealed files of former Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission, which had gathered personal information about Mississippi citizens with purpose of thwarting desegregation, to object to public disclosure of files did not violate Eleventh Amendment but rather would remedy initial constitutional violations when files were made and prevent future violations if personal information about victims were disseminated without their knowledge. ACLU v. Fordice, 969 F. Supp. 403, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21108 (S.D. Miss. 1994), aff'd, 84 F.3d 784, 1996 U.S. App. LEXIS 14555 (5th Cir. Miss. 1996).

       In an action for wrongful death against the State of Mississippi, the Mississippi State Highway Commission, and several officials and employees of the Commission in their official and individual capacities, the district court properly dismissed the complaint against the state and the Commission based on the Eleventh Amendment; however, the court erred in finding that the officers and employees of the Commission could invoke the absolute protection of the amendment. Congress has not abrogated Mississippi’s immunity through enactment of the Bridge Act of 1906 and the Rivers and Harbors Appropriations Act. Karpovs v.

       An action against a county department of human services was barred by the Eleventh Amendment since the county department was an arm of the state and a non-autonomous division of the Mississippi Department of Human Services and was primarily funded by the state.

       Federal District Court had power to decide case where weighing of all relevant factors pointed away from Eleventh Amendment immunity for Levee Board. Among others, factors relevant to determination of whether Eleventh Amendment protection is proper are: (1) most significant factor in assessing entity’s status is whether judgment against it will be paid with state funds, and judgment against Levee Board could be satisfied from board itself; (2) entity had authority to sue and be sued in its own name, and (3) board had right to hold and use property.

      The electors shall meet in their respective States, and vote by ballot for President and Vice-President, one of whom, at least, shall not be an inhabitant of the same State with themselves; they shall name in their ballots the person voted for as President, and in distinct ballots the person voted for as Vice-President, and they shall make distinct lists of all persons voted for as President, and of all persons voted for as Vice-President, and of the number of votes for each, which lists they shall sign and certify, and transmit sealed to the seat of the government of the United States, directed to the President of the Senate; – The President of the Senate shall, in presence of the Senate and House of representatives, open all the certificates and the votes shall then be counted; – The person having the greatest number of votes for President, shall be the President, if such number be a majority of the whole number of electors appointed; and if no person have such majority, then from the persons having the highest numbers not exceeding three on the list of those voted for as President, the House of Representatives shall choose immediately, by ballot, the President. But in choosing the President, the votes shall be taken by states, the representation from each state having one vote; a quorum for this purpose shall consist of a member or members from two-thirds of the States, and a majority of all the States shall be necessary to a choice. And if the House of Representatives shall not choose a President whenever the right of choice shall devolve upon them, before the fourth day of March next following, then the Vice-President shall act as President, as in the case of the death or other constitutional disability of the President. The person having the greatest number of votes as Vice-President shall be the Vice-President, if such number be a majority of the whole number of electors appointed, and if no person have a majority, then from the two highest numbers on the list, the senate shall choose the Vice-President; a quorum for the purpose shall consist of two-thirds of the whole number of Senators, and a majority of the whole number shall be necessary to a choice. But no person constitutionally ineligible to the office of President shall be eligible to that of Vice-President of the United States.

       An employment discrimination action alleging that plaintiff employee had been discharged because of his race did not state a claim under the Thirteenth Amendment where there was no allegation that defendant defendant employer had imposed conditions comparable to involuntary servitude upon its employees and where no such inference could be drawn from a charge of discriminatory conduct by the employer.

       Actions on part of state officials conclusively demonstrated they were fulfilling their affirmative duty to disestablish former dejure segregated system of higher education by adopting race-neutral policies and procedures in areas of student administration and recruitment, faculty and staff hiring, and resource allocation; they had also undertaken substantial affirmative efforts in areas of other-race student and faculty-staff recruitment, funding, and facility allocation. Differentiations made by officials with respect to each of individual institutions in designation of institutional missions were reasonable and not motivated by discriminatory purpose. Ayers v. Allain, 674 F. Supp. 1523, 1987 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11692 (N.D. Miss. 1987), rev'd, 893 F.2d 732, 1990 U.S. App. LEXIS 1414 (5th Cir.

       Trial court properly denied defendant’s request to question a venireman for which the State exercised a peremptory strike, as the record indicated the trial court relied not only upon information provided by outside sources (information for the strike was provided to the State by both a criminal investigator with the district attorney’s office and the sheriff’s department), but also upon the demeanor of the venire person. Thus, the State’s reason for the strike was race neutral; as to another peremptory strike, the State was properly allowed to call a witness who worked at the district attorney’s office to explain the State’s reasons for the strike, there were no signs of discrimination; the trial court also properly denied defendant’s request to question that venireman.

       Although all of petitioner death row inmate’s arguments were procedurally barred either by res judicata or for failure to raise the arguments earlier, and no intervening case law exempted petitioner from the procedural bar, the court also reviewed petitioner’s arguments on the merits; it reiterated its earlier holdings that there were no constitutional deficiencies in the Mississippi murder and death penalty statutes, including those relating to death resulting from child abuse as capital murder, and that none of the alleged deficiencies of defense counsel could have affected petitioner’s outcome.

       Dismissal for failure to state a claim of a retired state employee’s equal protection challenge to the Legislature’s establishment of a supplemental retirement plan for legislators was proper; since the different treatment of retired legislators had a rational basis in the financial uncertainties they risked, the proper course in seeking a remedy was political, not judicial.

       Section 47-5-112 [repealed] did not violate any “right” enjoyed by a county under the Fifth amendment to the United States Constitution or § 17 of the Mississippi Constitution, since political subdivisions of a state have no Fifth or Fourteenth Amendment protections against the state, and § 17 of the Mississippi Constitution applies only to “private” property.

The statute allows for “reimbursement of actual expenses,” which can be interpreted to include reimbursement for all actual costs to the lawyer for the purpose of keeping his or her door open to handle the case; there is a rebuttable presumption that a court-appointed attorney’s actual overhead within the statute is $25 per hour. This construction of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.99.html#t99c15s99-15-17" target="_blank">99-15-17</a></cite> will allow an attorney to receive $1,000 in profit plus his or her actual expenses. A rebuttal presumption arises that the actual cost contemplated by the statute is the average of $25 per hour; this figure may be subject to change when the 1988 survey conducted by the Mississippi State Bar is updated. The trial court is bound by the $25 per hour figure only when proof to the contrary is not forthcoming. The hours submitted by an attorney are subject to scrutiny under a reasonable and necessary standard. Specific expenses must be approved by the court before the attorney incurs the expenses. Court approved expenses include, but are not limited to, such items as the cost of an investigator, the cost of an expert witness, and a trip to interview witnesses.

       Before the appellate court was authorized to overturn a trial court’s denial of a request for expert assistance at public expense, it had to find an abuse of discretion so egregious as to deny due process rendering a trial fundamentally unfair; while it was true that defendant denied signing the waiver of rights form, the overwhelming evidence was that he did, and under the circumstances, defendant did not offer concrete reasons to justify the provision of expert consultation at public expense, such that the denial of defendant’s request for public assistance was not an abuse of discretion resulting in a denial of due process.

       Errors occurred when the administrative law judge acted contrary to his ruling at a hearing in which he found that an employee accident report was inadmissible because of discovery violations and when the Mississippi Workers’ Compensation Commission chose to disregard the administrative hearing officer’s decision as to the enforcement of its own procedural rules; however, the employee could not complain that the Commission’s consideration of the employee accident report caused surprise or contend that trial by ambush would have occurred if the administrative hearing officer had allowed the report to be introduced at the hearing because she knew the document existed and what it contained. Thus, although the administrative law judge erred when he reopened the record to admit the employee accident report, the error did not rise to the level of denying the employee due process.

Lastly, the jury was properly instructed that comments from the attorneys were not to be regarded as evidence when the jury deliberated on its verdict; thus, defendant was not denied his constitutional right to a fundamentally fair trial because of prosecutorial misconduct at closing argument.

       The section of an ordinance enacted by the City of Tupelo authorizing the Chief of Police to deny a parade permit if he finds that “the conduct of the parade will probably cause injury to persons or property or provoke disorderly conduct or create a disturbance” is unconstitutional in that the term “disorderly conduct” is overbroad because it could be applied to deny permits to those seeking to engage in protected activity; the provision constitutes a prior restraint upon free speech because it is not narrowly drawn to relate to health, safety, and welfare interests, but instead sanctions the denial of a permit on the basis of the so-called “hecklers’ veto”; “the provision is unconstitutionally vague as well since it contains no instructions directing the Chief of Police in the formulation of his opinion. The phrase “will probably cause injury” is constitutionally invalid since the term “probably” is simply too vague and indefinite and does not control adequately the discretion of the Chief in his determination of when to grant or deny a permit; the phrase “create a disturbance” is unconstitutional because it vests in the licensing authority the unbridled discretion to determine when, in his opinion, it is likely that criminal conduct will occur in the future. Limiting parade activity to the hours before 6:00 pm is invalid where it remains light in Tupelo well past that hour most of the year and the protection of citizens at night is not thereby jeopardized by a later time limit. The requirements of the ordinance that all paraders be unarmed, line up no more than four abreast, in the right-hand lane of the street, in units of 100 or fewer, with 15-foot intervals between units is unconstitutional in that it violates the Equal Protection Clause since such requirements do not apply to students or governmental agencies. The requirement that marchers act in an “orderly manner” is unconstitutionally overbroad; and the restriction on the use of “profanity” is void since profanity is protected speech unless it falls into such unprotected categories as obscenity or fighting words. Exemption of governmental agencies and students participating in educational activities from the licensing and regulatory requirements constitutes a violation of the Equal Protection Clause since such discrimination is based upon the content of the speech involved. That section of the ordinance which requires that the applicant for a permit demonstrate the noise level of sound equipment to be used is not facially unconstitutional since all it requires is a demonstration of the noise level; however, in the course of applying this statute, if the Chief of Police denies permits because of the demonstrated noise level of the equipment, the applicant will be able to make the argument offered herein that the section fails to give narrow and objective standards to be used in the determination. The blanket prohibition against sound equipment in areas zoned for residential purposes is overbroad because the ordinance presumes incompatibility based on an area’s merely being zoned residential and oftentimes areas zoned residential include structures other than homes, such as churches and schools, which are not incompatible with the use of sound equipment. The restriction of the operation of sound equipment at any location between the hours of 6:00 pm and 9:00 am is invalid where, although nighttime restrictions might be justifiable, the hour at which the restriction commences is not necessarily at night.

In addition, while referee did appoint guardian ad litem for child, he failed to insure that her interests were adequately protected by such representation and thus effectively denied her right to present evidence on her behalf, as established under state law, and deprived her of a protected property interest in that respect as well. Appropriate remedy for violation was to enjoin referee to hold new hearing in full conformity with statutory and constitutional requirements. Chrissy F. v. Mississippi Dep't of Public Welfare, 780 F.

       There can be no per se prohibition against a child witness testifying in a divorce case between the child’s parents. The right of every litigant to compulsory process for witnesses and to have them testify under oath in court is so well grounded that any per se exclusion simply because he or she is a child of the divorcing parents risks offending the due process provisions of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution and Mississippi Constitution Art 3, § 14. Before excluding the testimony of a child witness of tender years in a divorce proceeding, the chancellor, at a minimum, should follow the procedure required by Crownover v Crownover (1975) 33 Ill App 3d 327, 337 NE2d 56. Although no parent can be precluded from having a child of the marriage testify in a divorce proceeding simply because of that fact, parents in a divorce proceeding should, if at all possible, refrain from calling children of their marriage as witnesses, and counsel should advise their clients against doing so except in the most exigent cases.

       Continuing and exclusive nature of chancery court jurisdiction over issues involving child custody precludes Youth Court from having exclusive original jurisdiction over proceedings involving abused child, where allegations of abuse are raised in context of custody proceeding over which chancery court already exercises jurisdiction. Rights of minor child suspected of having been sexually abused by parent, to access to court, were not impaired by chancery court’s considering allegations of sexual abuse without referring matter to Youth Court; minor was not deprived of procedural due process by alleged failure of officials to follow investigatory procedure set forth in Mississippi Youth Court Law, because of assertion of jurisdiction by chancery court; and even though Youth Court statute provided for exercise of exclusive jurisdiction over child abuse cases, such provision was not applicable to charges raised in case over which chancery court had already assumed and was exercising jurisdiction.

       Section 25-11-103(f), which provides that the spouse of a member of the Public Employees’ Retirement System shall be the member’s beneficiary unless the member has designated another beneficiary subsequent to the date of marriage, does not constitute an unreasonable impairment of an employee’s contractual right contrary to the United States and Mississippi Constitutions because it provides protection to those whose spouse fails to redesignate due to “inadvertence” while allowing an employee to make a “conscious decision” to redesignate if he or she does not want his or her spouse to receive the death benefits.

       Those residence requirements for a qualified elector which requires a residence of one year in the state, one year in the county, and 6 months in the precinct, or municipality, clearly violate the equal protection protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States; and those requirements as contained in § 241 of the Mississippi Constitution and Code § 3235 are clearly not necessary to further a compelling state interest, are violative of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States and are null and void.

   Statute, which provided that when a political party registers, no other political party may use that name which has already been registered, as applied, prevents a political party which had used the word Republican in its name for many years, from using this name because another organization had registered the word Republican, was not unconstitutional as denying the right to reassemble and petition the government or as depriving members of their liberty and property without due process of law, or as denying right of freedom of speech and of press or as destroying liberty of members of the political party to organize and associate themselves with others for political purposes and as denying for them the right to freely exercise their franchise. 214 Miss. 481, 59 So. 2d 263.

       City’s redistricting plan used to elect alderman and executive committee members violated the one-person/one-vote principle of the Fourteenth Amendment where the city did not dispute that its aldermanic wards had become malapportioned and constitutionally impermissible due to population shifts within the city since the 1990 census and the maximum deviation for the city’s wards was far in excess of the threshold established by judicial precedent.

       A Federal District Court’s legislative reapportionment plan for the houses of the Mississippi Legislature which permitted maximum population deviations of 16.5 per cent in the districts for one legislative house and 19.3 per cent in the districts for the other house, failed to meet the requirement of the Equal Protection Clause that legislative districts be as nearly of equal population as is practicable. The deviations could not be justified on the ground of the plan’s deference to Mississippi’s historic respect for the integrity of county boundaries in conjunction with legislative districts where the District Court failed to identify any unique features of the state’s political structure to support its variation from population equality and had been presented with a feasible plan which was less statistically offensive and which also better served the state policy against fragmenting county boundaries.

       A 16-year veteran police officer, who had vested permanent employment rights under the civil service laws, resigned on his own volition and was not “constructively discharged” where he obtained legal counsel when he became aware that he was the object of an investigation and resigned his job on his attorney’s advice. Thus, he could not thereafter pursue an untimely claim that he was denied procedural due process. In order to ensure that a civil service employee preserves his or her procedural due process guarantees, he or she should “stay the course” and remain with the job until relieved from the assignment by an official with statutory authority to fire. While the work environment could become the source of some irritation or embarrassment, such embarrassment will usually afford the civil servant nothing in the way of a procedural due process claim after a voluntary resignation. The instances will be few when a claim of constructive discharge will preserve procedural guarantees that the employee has waived by resigning. The wisdom of “staying the course” is especially crucial in light of state law which deems civil service administrative remedies as the exclusive remedy before relief can be sought in state court.

Additionally, the probationer was not wrongfully denied the opportunity to call his own witnesses where he made a last-minute request during the third hearing to call witnesses who allegedly would have testified in his behalf, the court concluded that the witnesses would have offered no new evidence, the probationer had already admitted that he committed probation violations, and at most the witnesses would have testified in regard to the probationer’s character and would have had no effect on the outcome of the case.

       Inmate’s allegations of a Fourteenth Amendment violation against a dispatcher did not comport with the stringent requirements necessary to maintain a claim of deliberate indifference by the individual defendant; the episodic act or omission of a state jail official did not violate a pretrial detainee’s constitutional right to be secure in his basic human needs, such as medical care and safety, unless the detainee demonstrated that the official acted or failed to act with deliberate indifference to the detainee’s needs.

       In instances where inmate’s “failure to protect” claim arises out of an episodic act or omission on the part of a jail official, the appropriate standard to be applied is identical regardless of the inmate’s custodial status as pretrial detainee or convicted inmate, requiring demonstration of subjective knowledge of a substantial risk of serious harm and the failure to take reasonable measures to abate it, but where a pretrial detainee challenges a general condition of confinement, the court presumes intent on the part of prison officials and looks to whether the challenged condition of confinement is reasonably related to a legitimate governmental objective.

       A prisoner has a constitutional right of access to the civil courts founded in the due process clause of the 14th Amendment, though this right is not absolute; at a minimum, due process requires that absent a countervailing state interest of overriding significance, prisoners must be afforded meaningful access to the courts and an opportunity to be heard.

      <p>
       In determining whether to allow a prisoner to make a personal appearance and give testimony in a civil action wherein he or she is a party/litigant, the trial judge should take into consideration the following guidelines: (1) the costs and inconvenience of transporting the prisoner from the place of incarceration to the courtroom, (2) any potential danger or security risk which the presence of the particular inmate would pose to the court, (3) the substantiality of the matter at issue, (4) the need for an early determination of the matter, (5) the possibility of delaying trial until the prisoner is released, (6) the probability of success on the merits, (7) the integrity of the correctional system, (8) the interest of the inmate in presenting his or her testimony in person rather than by deposition, (9) the possibility of a change of venue to the appropriate trial court in the county where the prisoner is domiciled when legally permissible, and (10) any other appropriate criteria which the trial judge, in his or her sound discretion, might consider.

   Neither due process nor equal protection rights are violated by requiring a prisoner to demonstrate some specific need before requiring the State or county to furnish the prisoner with free copies of trial records in post-conviction relief proceedings.

   The unexplained failure to award an inmate meritorious earned time did not amount to a violation of his federal and state constitutional rights to due process and equal protection, since an inmate’s earning of “time” is a matter of grace or privilege under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.47.html#t47c05s47-5-142" target="_blank">47-5-142</a></cite>, which provides that “meritorious earned time may be awarded.” Since correctional officials are vested with discretionary power to award time under certain conditions, inmates are not entitled to it.

   Neither the due process clause nor Mississippi law gives rise to a protected liberty interest in the form of an expectation of release on probation. There is no liberty interest in release pursuant to the provisions of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.47.html#t47c07s47-7-47" target="_blank">47-7-47</a></cite>, which creates a procedure whereby the courts may place a prisoner on probation, since the language of the statute is permissive rather than mandatory in nature; the statute vests absolute discretion in both the Department of Corrections and the court in determining whether probation should be recommended and granted, and this discretion affords a prisoner no constitutionally recognized liberty interest.

       Inmates who are placed in administrative segregation have no constitutional basis for demanding the same privileges as those inmates in the general prison population since prison officials have the discretion to determine whether and when to provide prisoners with privileges such as showers, exercise, visitation, and access to personal property. Thus, the 5 hours a week of exercise plus nightly showers of 15 minutes which were provided to an inmate confined to administrative segregation did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment. Additionally, the procedures provided when the inmate was placed in administrative segregation satisfied the due process clause where the inmate received notice of detention and a hearing on the matter.

       A person may not be involuntarily committed to a state mental institution unless (1) there is clear and convincing evidence that the person is in substantial need of mental treatment, and (2) the state renders to him a minimally adequate course of care and treatment; accordingly, a deceased had a substantive right not to be “warehoused,” and if he was substantially mentally ill, the state’s right to commit him involuntarily was conditioned on its affording him minimally adequate care and treatment.

       An attorney who was suspended from the practice of law following a felony conviction in the federal courts and who was disbarred 3 years later at the conclusion of his appeal of the federal conviction, was not denied equal protection or due process rights on the ground that he would be required to wait 3 years longer before reinstatement than an attorney who chose not to appeal a conviction. All disbarred attorneys are treated equally; the disparity of time arises when an attorney resists the disbarment pending his or her appellate procedures. Had the attorney accepted the disbarment following his conviction, no delay in entering a final order of disbarment would have resulted, and therefore there was no unequal treatment or denial of due process. Additionally, the attorney’s disbarment was not retroactive to the date of his suspension since the attorney’s initiative delayed the entry of the final order; retroactivity cannot be applied when the attorney seeks a stay of the final order.

Before a fine can be imposed by a private association, there must be a schedule of maximum fines that may be imposed to which schedule each member has agreed to be bound by joining the association.

       Teacher’s constitutional right to due process was not violated by school board despite claim that he was denied fair and impartial hearing because school board had already determined to dismiss him when it informed him of his right to public hearing, and because even though board conducted hearing through hearing officer, the ultimate decision rested with board. First, teacher had made no complaint at time of hearing about possibility of impartiality of school board, and such failure waived point. Second, where board acts both investigatively and adjudicatively, court establishes presumption of honesty and integrity in those serving as adjudicators, and in order to rebut presumption, teacher must show that board members had personal or financial stake in decision, or that there was some personal animosity toward teacher. Finally, showing that board was involved in events preceding termination is not enough, absent showing of either personal animosity, personal stake, or financial stake in decision, to overcome presumption of honesty and integrity of board members.

       When student admits to conduct giving rise to suspension, need for due process hearing is obviated, since purpose of hearing is to safeguard against punishment of students who are innocent of accusations against them. Cole v. Newton Special Municipal Separate School Dist., 676 F. Supp. 749, 1987 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12455 (S.D. Miss. 1987), aff'd, 853 F.2d 924, 1988 U.S. App. LEXIS 10868 (5th Cir. Miss. 1988).

       Suit alleging that school official grabbed arm of student did not show type of action calculated to cause serious injury, nor did not such act evince malice or intention to cause injury, and even if serious injuries may have resulted, nature of contact suggested that any injuries were unintended rather than calculated and that if force used was in fact excessive, it came from carelessness or excess of zeal rather than malice. Whether physical harm by state officer rises to level of constitutional deprivation depends on extent of injury inflicted, degree of force used in proportion to amount necessary under circumstances, and motives of official; bottom-line inquiry is whether official’s conduct amounted to abuse of official power that shocks conscience. Cole v. Newton Special Municipal Separate School Dist., 676 F. Supp. 749, 1987 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12455 (S.D. Miss. 1987), aff'd, 853 F.2d 924, 1988 U.S. App. LEXIS 10868 (5th Cir. Miss. 1988).

       Any deprivation of student’s interest in attending school must be attended by at least minimal procedural safeguards, but where suspension is for 10 days or less, due process requires only that student be given oral or written notice of charges against him, basis of accusation, and opportunity to present his side of story. Cole v. Newton Special Municipal Separate School Dist., 676 F. Supp. 749, 1987 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12455 (S.D. Miss. 1987), aff'd, 853 F.2d 924, 1988 U.S. App. LEXIS 10868 (5th Cir. Miss. 1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       Even assuming that hearing before school board met minimal procedural safeguards, facts did not establish that hearing given to student by board comported with more formal procedures necessary for long-term suspensions, where it was unclear from facts developed through pleadings and discovery whether or not isolation at issue involved sufficient educational deprivation to warrant being treated as equivalent of suspension; upon returning to school after 10 days suspension, student was required to remain in detention room, isolated from other students and excluded from regular classes. Cole v. Newton Special Municipal Separate School Dist., 676 F. Supp. 749, 1987 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12455 (S.D. Miss. 1987), aff'd, 853 F.2d 924, 1988 U.S. App. LEXIS 10868 (5th Cir. Miss. 1988).

       Assuming that a Mississippi privilege tax imposed on persons and corporations doing a business of purchasing commercial paper secured by means thereof was invalid because it exempted banks and local merchants from the payment of the tax, the invalidity of the exemption would not render the statute unconstitutional as to the tax levied against a particular finance company in view of the general rules for construction of statute and an express provision in the privilege tax act that if any provisions thereof should be found invalid, that fact would not render the remaining provisions of the statute void.

       The constitutional requirement of uniformity and equality in taxation is satisfied when, in establishing the true value of property, the public assessor considers all factors affecting the value of the property and employs the same assessment ratio as is applied to other like properties.

   Under the Batson test, the prosecutor satisfied the burden of articulating a non-discriminatory reason for striking a black juror where he explained that he struck the juror because the juror had long unkempt hair, a mustache and a beard, since the wearing of beards and long unkempt hair are not characteristics that are particular to any race.

   A city council’s closing of the city’s public swimming pools after their operation on a racially segregated basis was declared unconstitutional did not violate either the Thirteenth or the Fourteenth Amendment, even though there was some evidence supporting the conclusion that the closing was because of some ideological opposition to racial integration in swimming pools, where (1) there was substantial evidence supporting the conclusion that the council felt that the pools could not be operated safely and economically on an integrated basis, and (2) there was no evidence that the city was covertly aiding the maintenance of swimming pools private in name only, or that there was any state action affecting blacks differently from whites.

   There is no constitutional right to have a jury mirror any particular community; thus, a capital murder defendant, who was granted a change of venue because of pretrial publicity, was not improperly denied a second change of venue to a county in which the racial makeup more closely reflected that of the county where the crime occurred where the jury that tried the defendant was selected in a nondiscriminatory manner, and there was no evidence that the jurors were not impartial.

       The trial court in a narcotics prosecution did not err in overruling defendant’s motion to quash the indictment and petit venire, which motion alleged that the statutory exclusion of persons 18, 19 and 20 years of age to serve on grand and petit juries violated defendant’s federal constitutional rights and systematically excluded black persons from grand and petit juries; the fact that such age group has been permitted to register and vote by amendment to the US Constitution did not qualify persons under 21 to serve as jurors under state law.

       Where it was shown that the voters who were registered by federal registrars were added to the list of registered voters used to prepare master jury lists and coded “FR” such facts required quashing of the venire when considered together with a disproportionate number of whites on the jury list, and required reversal of a criminal conviction based on a jury verdict.

      <p>
       Where a county was 72 percent nonwhite and the number of nonwhites on the master jury list during the period in question was about 28 percent of the total, such facts established a prima facie case of discrimination which was not sufficiently rebutted by evidence that the county supervisors prepared master lists from voter registration books without regard to race, creed, or color.

      </p>
      <p>
       A wide disparity shown between percentage of Negro population in the district and the percentage of Negroes on jury lists during the period in question was a prima facie showing of purposeful discrimination on the part of the state which the state was required to rebut in proceedings on an accused’s motion to quash the indictment, jury panel and venire.

       Evidence that a jury selection system was based on a list of registered voters coded as to race and sex of the individuals, that the names of persons registered by federal registrars, most of which persons were Negroes, were not included in the list, and that the jury list showed 2.97% Negro men and 4.31% Negro women in the year in which the defendant was indicted, tried and convicted, while the Negro population of the county was 36.2%, was sufficient to make a prima facie case of discrimination against Negroes, placing the burden on the state to show that the underrepresentation resulted from factors other than purposeful discrimination.

       Jurors are not to be summoned because of their race, but rather summoned without discrimination from all persons qualified as jurors, and where a record does not show a systematic exclusion of Negroes from jury service, the state has met the burden of proof necessary to show that there is no systematic exclusion of Negroes from the jury.

       Where defendant’s proof showed that a disproportion between Negroes and whites on the jury lists had existed over a long period of time, he had made out a prima facie case of the systematic exclusion of Negroes from the jury which indicted him, and it was incumbent upon the state to show that there was no systematic exclusion of Negroes from the grand jury and that defendant’s constitutional rights were not infringed by the manner and procedure in which the grand jurors were drawn, and in the absence of such rebuttal testimony on the part of the state, the presumption of purposeful prior exclusion stands and the motion to quash the indictment should have been sustained.

       In a county where the jury lists were made from the roster of qualified, registered voters, and the registrar had been enjoined by a federal court from discriminating against Negroes in their attempts to register and he did not deny that the injunction had been properly granted, such fact of itself was evidence that Negroes had been systematically excluded as jurors.

   Defendant’s Batson challenges were without merit, even though the State did ask more questions of potential African-American jurors than white jurors, because disparate questioning alone was not dispositive of purposeful discrimination. The State’s contention that the additional questions were asked to clarify and follow up on certain issues was supported by the record. Flowers v. State, 158 So.3d 1009, 2014 Miss. LEXIS 569 (Miss. 2014), vacated, — U.S. —, <cite class="s_court">136 S. Ct. 2157</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">195 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 817, 2016 U.S. LEXIS 3930 (U.S. 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a capital murder case, defendant’s rights under the Equal Protection Clause were violated by the state’s continuous striking of African-American jurors, whose views on the death penalty were virtually indistinguishable from those of similarly situated white jurors who went unchallenged by the state, thereby raising an inference of racial discrimination. Flowers v. State, 947 So. 2d 910, 2007 Miss. LEXIS 24 (Miss. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       In defendant’s capital murder case, the striking of an African-American juror was suspect because there was no evidence in the record to show that she had any connection with members of defendant’s family, despite the fact that she had previously worked at the same business as those family members. Flowers v. State, 947 So. 2d 910, 2007 Miss. LEXIS 24 (Miss. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       In defendant’s capital murder case, the striking of an African-American juror was suspect because his opposition to the death penalty was not as strong as that of two white jurors who served, and the genuineness of the juror’s prior jury service as a reason for the state to strike him was questionable since the state failed to voir dire other white jurors concerning their prior jury service. Flowers v. State, 947 So. 2d 910, 2007 Miss. LEXIS 24 (Miss. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       State’s actions in striking an African American juror in a capital murder case were specious as there was no evidence in the record to support the state’s proffered reason for striking her, and it appeared that the state fabricated a supposedly race-neutral reason in an attempt to strike yet another African American juror. Flowers v. State, 2006 Miss. LEXIS 356 (Miss. June 29, 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       In defendant’s trial for the sale of cocaine, the prosecutor’s reasons for striking two potential African-American jurors, based on age and marital status in one instance, and because a juror had had regular contact with defendant in a second instance, were sufficiently race-neutral to survive defendant’s Batson challenges. Rogers v. State, 891 So. 2d 268, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 1041 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where four African-Americans were struck from jury, the State’s arguments that it had prosecuted many defendants in area with their last names, that one was related to a prior defendant who made accusations against the judicial system, and one was unemployed and failed to complete questionnaire, the reasons were sufficiently race neutral to survive defendant’s Batson challenge. Clay v. State, 881 So. 2d 354, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 852 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       In an aggravated assault case, there was no error in the trial court’s decision that the State provided race-neutral reasons for its peremptory challenges, based on the response by two jurors to a question of whether any family member or close friend had ever been charged with a crime, and another juror’s friendship with defendant. Robinson v. State, 870 So. 2d 669, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 307 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Mississippi Supreme Court has held that the trial judge is afforded great deference in determining if the expressed reasons for exclusion of a venire person from the challenged party is in fact race neutral. Murphy v. State, 868 So. 2d 1030, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 1161 (Miss. Ct. App. 2003), cert. denied, 868 So. 2d 345, 2004 Miss. LEXIS 297 (Miss. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the reasons the trial court is granted such deference in a Batson issue is that the demeanor of the attorney making the challenge is often the best evidence on the issue of race neutrality; the judge is in the best position to assess the overall credibility of the statements made in voir dire and by presenters of the peremptory strikes. Murphy v. State, 868 So. 2d 1030, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 1161 (Miss. Ct. App. 2003), cert. denied, 868 So. 2d 345, 2004 Miss. LEXIS 297 (Miss. 2004).

       Where defense counsel exercised peremptory strikes on two white jurors, and in response to the State’s Batson challenge, counsel stated he had a “bad feeling” about the jurors due to their demeanor, the trial court’s denial of the peremptory strikes on grounds that this was not a race-neutral reason was not clearly erroneous. Murphy v. State, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 683 (Miss. Ct. App. Aug. 5, 2003), op. withdrawn, sub. op., 868 So. 2d 1030, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 1161 (Miss. Ct. App. 2003).

       The defendant failed to make a prima facie showing as to the number of African Americans in the jury pool where he asserted that out of the 50 venire persons present to participate in the jury selection process only four (or eight percent) were African American and that the percentage of eligible African Americans in the county was several times eight percent, but there were no indicia of prejudice or fraud in the method used by the clerk of the lower court in the selection of venire persons.

       test for equal protection challenge to state’s use of peremptory challenge to exclude all black jurors from both of defendant’s juries where defendant failed to allege or prove that during relevant time period no black persons served on any juries in cases involving same prosecutors; fact that prosecutors identified certain jurors by their race did not prove that prosecutors intended to strike all of those jurors from panel because of race.

   In order to prove that state used peremptory challenges in unconstitutional manner, defendant had to show that he was a member of cognizable racial group, that prosecutor exercised peremptory challenges to excuse venireperson of defendant’s case, and that there was an inference that the venirepersons were excluded on account of their race; burden thereafter shifts to state to come forward with race-neutral explanation for challenging jurors, but prosecutor’s explanation need not rise to level of challenge for cause.

   One factor in determining whether prosecutor’s race-neutral explanation for challenge to juror is pretextual is relationship with the reason to the actual facts of the case. Blue v.

   Prosecutor’s stated reason for peremptory challenge against juror, that juror stated that there was nothing she could do about the fact that her sister had been accused of but not charged with killing her brother and that the Lord would take care of it, was sufficiently related to murder prosecution so as not to be deemed pretextual, as her statement could be viewed as placing punishment of wrongdoer in the hands of the Lord.

       In a prosecution for capital murder and conspiracy to commit capital murder, the trial court committed reversible error in failing to place the initial burden on the State to establish a prima facie case of racial discrimination in the defendant’s use of his peremptory challenges, before concluding that the defendant failed to offer a race-neutral reason for challenging one of the jurors, since the defendant was arbitrarily and erroneously denied the use of one of his peremptory challenges, and the composition of the jury was directly altered as a result.

   A trial court in a capital murder prosecution did not abuse its discretion by refusing to grant the defendant’s motion for individual sequestered voir dire of the entire venire where the court asked the collective venire about the effect of pretrial publicity or information received about the case, and the court later asked if there was any reason that a juror felt that he or she could not be fair and impartial, and anyone who responded affirmatively was questioned individually in chambers. Carr v. State, 655 So. 2d 824, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 56 (Miss. 1995), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">516 U.S. 1077</cite>, <cite class="s_court">116 S. Ct. 783</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">133 L.

   In a capital murder prosecution in which a black defendant was convicted and sentenced by an all-white jury for the murders of 4 white victims, the trial court did not err by allowing the State to peremptorily strike the sole potential black juror, since the reason stated by the prosecution for the peremptory challenge that the juror indicated she would have difficulty finding suitable child care during the trial was sufficiently race-neutral. Carr v. State, 655 So. 2d 824, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 56 (Miss. 1995), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">516 U.S. 1077</cite>, <cite class="s_court">116 S. Ct. 783</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">133 L.

      </p>
      <p>
       The trial court in a capital murder prosecution erred by not requiring the State to give racially-neutral reasons for exercising peremptory challenges against 7 out of 13 black jurors on the venire, even though there was no showing that the defendant was of a minority class, and therefore the case would be remanded for a hearing on whether the Batson criteria were violated by the State’s exercise of its peremptory challenges. Thorson v. State, 653 So. 2d 876, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 600 (Miss. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       The reasons proffered by the State for using 5 of its 7 peremptory challenges against black jurors were sufficient to withstand a Batson challenge where the reasons given were (1) the juror had a brother in the penitentiary; (2) the juror had attended high school with the defendant; (3) the juror wore dark glasses in the courtroom; (4) the juror was employed in a company in which there had been a riot which was quelled by the police; and (5) the juror shared a last name with many persons in the penitentiary and the prosecutor believed he was related to an inmate, and the defense made no attempt to show that the reasons proffered were pretextual, of disparate impact, or not true. Henderson v. State, 641 So. 2d 1184, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 374 (Miss. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Some acceptable race-neutral reasons for challenging a juror are: (1) involvement in criminal activity; (2) unemployment; (3) employment history; (4) relative of juror involved in crime; (5) low income occupation; (6) juror wore gold chains, rings and watch; and (7) dress and demeanor. Foster v. State, 639 So. 2d 1263, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 670 (Miss. 1994), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">514 U.S. 1019</cite>, <cite class="s_court">115 S. Ct. 1365</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">131 L.

      </p>
      <p>
       The State’s reasons for using 4 of its 5 peremptory challenges against black jurors were sufficiently race-neutral where the first juror had a pending civil lawsuit, the second juror had worked with a defense witness and the prosecution objected to his age and demeanor, the third juror had previously sat on 2 criminal juries which resulted in one “not guilty” verdict and one mistrial, and the prosecutor was unable to make eye contact with the fourth juror while the juror continuously made eye contact with the defendant. Harper v. State, 635 So. 2d 864, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 201 (Miss. 1994), limited, Flowers v. State, 947 So. 2d 910, 2007 Miss. LEXIS 24 (Miss. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       A trial judge is required to make an on-the-record factual determination that each reason proffered by the State for exercising a peremptory challenge is, in fact, race neutral; this requirement is to be prospective in nature. Hatten v. State, 628 So. 2d 294, 1993 Miss. LEXIS 522 (Miss. 1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       The State successfully rebutted a black defendant’s Batson challenge to the State’s exercise of peremptory challenges to eliminate four black venire members where 2 of the venire members were challenged because they were of an age to be employed and had no occupation, and the other 2 were challenged because they were acquainted with the defendant or her family. Porter v. State, 616 So. 2d 899, 1993 Miss. LEXIS 115 (Miss. 1993).
      </p>

       The Batson rule applies to both a prosecutor’s and a defendant’s peremptory challenges. Griffin v. State, 610 So. 2d 354, 1992 Miss. LEXIS 749 (Miss. 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       A defendant may make a prima facie showing of purposeful racial discrimination in selection of the venire by relying solely on the facts concerning its selection in the defendant’s case; a defendant may establish a prima facie case of purposeful discrimination in selection of the jury solely on evidence concerning the prosecutor’s exercise of peremptory challenges at the defendant’s trial. Griffin v. State, 607 So. 2d 1197, 1992 Miss. LEXIS 603 (Miss. 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       A white defendant had standing to object to the State’s use of 5 of its 6 peremptory challenges to strike black jurors; however, the defendant failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination where the State offered race neutral reasons for striking each individual black juror and the defendant’s attorney offered no evidence to rebut the State’s reasons for striking the jurors. Green v. State, 597 So. 2d 656, 1992 Miss. LEXIS 206 (Miss. 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       A defendant failed to establish a prima facie case of racial discrimination in jury selection, even though the defendant was black and the prosecution exercised peremptory challenges to eliminate 3 black jurors, where the jurors were excluded because they were acquainted with the defendant; while excluding jurors on the ground that they were acquainted with the defendant might have had a discriminatory effect since the defendant’s acquaintances were primarily black, the law does not proscribe the mere incidental exclusion of blacks from a jury. Govan v. State, 591 So. 2d 428, 1991 Miss. LEXIS 836 (Miss. 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       A county’s jury venire selection did not systematically exclude blacks in violation of a black defendant’s constitutional equal protection rights, even though there were only 2 blacks out of 12 on the jury which rendered a verdict against the defendant when 37 percent of the county was black, where the jury selection was based upon voter registration lists of the county without regard to race. Harris v. State, 576 So. 2d 1262, 1991 Miss. LEXIS 121 (Miss. 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       The reasons given by a district attorney for exercising a peremptory challenge to excuse a black juror were sufficiently race-neutral where the district attorney stated that the juror was a truck driver “which may or may not mean he’s a transient,” the juror wore overalls with a black T-Shirt in the courtroom, and he was unmarried and did not have children “which shows that he doesn’t have a stake in the community like somebody that’s established.” Bradley v. State, 562 So. 2d 1276, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 267 (Miss. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       A murder defendant’s argument that the jury was patently flawed because the jury was white and the defendant was black was without merit. The mere fact that a jury is white and a defendant is black does not violate Batson, but rather it is the racially discriminatory exercise of peremptory challenges to strike black jurors from the jury that violates the Batson rule. Sudduth v. State, 562 So. 2d 67, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 235 (Miss. 1990).

Ct 1712, defendant raising claim must show (1) he is member of “cognizable racial group;” (2) prosecutor has exercised peremptory challenges toward elimination of veniremen of his race; and (3) facts and circumstances infer that prosecutor used his peremptory challenges for purpose of striking minorities. These components constitute prima facie showing of discrimination necessary to compel state to come forward with neutral explanation for challenging black jurors. Lockett v.

      </p>
      <p>
       Jury selection was properly conducted and jurors were not excluded on basis of race where black jurors were excluded for following race-neutral reasons: (1) 22-year-old laborer with eleventh-grade education was stricken because his youth, marital status, and educational level appeared to prosecutor to indicate instability; (2) 49-year-old minister/bus driver was stricken because he was preacher; (3) 35-year-old housewife was removed because she did not reveal her brother’s conviction for armed robbery; (4) 38-year-old cafeteria hostess was challenged because of her concerns about sequestration due to having to care for invalid mother; and (5) 25-year-old was stricken from panel because he wore hat into courtroom and his general demeanor suggested to prosecutor that he was unstable, unconcerned, and had no respect for proceedings.

   Claim that court erred in permitting state to systematically exclude black veniremen by peremptory challenge, where no objection was raised either during trial or on motion for new trial, was waived and counsel’s excuse for waiving claim at trial, that under prior law he felt he would be unsuccessful on point, was insufficient.

   Statement by prosecuting attorney that State denied systematically excluding blacks from jury panel and that record should reflect that state had used peremptory challenge on an individual male who was white was inadequate response under Batson v.

      <p>
       Absence of black jurors on jury panel after peremptory challenge by state of only black person who has been called as prospective juror does not violate defendant’s right to impartial jury and equal protection where no request has been made for evidentiary hearing and there is nothing to indicate willful, systematic exclusion of black persons from jury.

   The issue of whether a capital murder conviction should be reversed because the prosecutor improperly used all of his peremptory challenges to exclude all blacks from the jury was not preserved for review, where the record did not reflect the race of the jurors who had been peremptorily challenged by the prosecutor.

      </p>
      <p>
       Although it is settled law that systematic and discriminatory exclusion of Negroes from jury service is unconstitutional, this Amendment does not require proportionate representation of the races on a jury, or even that members of a particular race must be on a particular jury, but, as a practical matter, what is required is that county officials must see to it that the jurors are in fact and in good faith selected without regard to race.

       Peremptory challenge exercised by the state against one African American juror in a capital murder case was clearly pretextual
   as there was no basis in the record for two of the grounds proffered by the state, and the state’s third ground was predicated on the jury’s acquaintance with defendant’s sister 10 years prior, a tenuous relationship at best. Flowers v. State, 2006 Miss. LEXIS 356 (Miss. June 29, 2006).

   In a capital murder case, the trial court did not err in denying defendant’s Batson challenges; the evidence indicated that the State’s reasons for its peremptory strikes were valid and not merely pretextual. Flowers v. State, 240 So.3d 1082, 2017 Miss. LEXIS 431 (Miss. 2017), rev'd, — U.S. —, <cite class="s_court">139 S. Ct. 2228</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">204 L.

       <p>
   Defendant’s Batson challenges were without merit where the State provided multiple race-neutral reasons for the peremptory strikes against each of the five African-Americans, including their knowledge of defense witnesses, knowledge of defendant’s family, views on the death penalty, and hesitation about serving as a juror. The evidence indicated that the race-neutral reasons were valid and not merely pretextual. Flowers v. State, 158 So.3d 1009, 2014 Miss.

      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court’s denial of defendant’s Batson challenge was not clearly erroneous because the reasons offered by the State were race-neutral and supported by the record; the State’s use of the two peremptory strikes in question did not evince such a clear pattern of discrimination that its proffered explanations for the strikes were mere pretext.

   Defendant’s equal protection rights were not violated because, although defendant, who was an African-American, was tried by an all-white jury, the State of Mississippi provided race neutral reasons for exercising peremptory challenges on African-American jurors, the death-qualification process itself did not disproportionately impact African-American venire persons, and the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant’s challenges to jurors for cause.

       If a prosecutor’s distrust of a venire member is a race-neutral reason, then a defendant’s distrust must be as well, and a trial court cannot deprive defendants of their right to a peremptory strike unless the trial judge properly conducts the analysis outlined in Batson; the Batson analysis has three steps, and it is imperative that a trial judge follow those steps accordingly, and when a trial judge erroneously denies a defendant a peremptory strike by failing to conduct the proper Batson analysis, prejudice is automatically presumed, and a court will find reversible error. Hardison v. State, 94 So.3d 1092, 2012 Miss. LEXIS 383 (Miss. 2012).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial could erroneously denied defendant a peremptory strike by holding that a juror’s previous service on a jury in a criminal case was not a race-neutral reason for the strike because defendant’s reason for the peremptory challenge, that the juror’s responses about a prior jury experience indicated he could be pro-prosecution, qualified as race-neutral; the trial could never addressed the issue of pretext but simply held that the stated reason was not race-neutral, and the denial of defendant’s peremptory challenge without a proper Batson analysis constituted reversible error. Hardison v. State, 94 So.3d 1092, 2012 Miss. LEXIS 383 (Miss. 2012).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant’s right to a fair trial under Batson was not violated by the prosecutor’s use of peremptory strikes because a large number of potential jurors knew defendant, defendant’s mother, defendant’s family, potential witnesses in the case, or the attorneys; the other peremptory challenges by the state were used against a juror whose son was a witness, two jurors who were close friends of the family, and another juror who had a close family member prosecuted by the same district attorney’s office. Fisher v. State, 989 So. 2d 893, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 687 (Miss. Ct. App. 2007), cert. denied, 993 So. 2d 832, 2008 Miss. LEXIS 429 (Miss. 2008).

       Where defendant raised a Batson challenge during voir dire, the prosecutor gave gender as her race-neutral reason for striking an African-American juror; allowing the state to exclude the potential juror based on his gender was a violation of the equal protection clause; the entire judicial process was infected, warranting a new trial. McGee v. State, 953 So. 2d 211, 2007 Miss. LEXIS 19 (Miss. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   In a capital murder case, defendant’s Batson challenge was meritless because the prosecution set forth race-neutral reasons for its use of peremptory strikes on African-American jury pool members; a failure to understand the proceedings, service on a prior jury that acquitted, reluctance to serve due to employment, lack of belief in the death penalty, and a failure to complete a jury questionaire were all race-neutral reasons. Le v. State, 913 So. 2d 913, 2005 Miss. LEXIS 151 (Miss.), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">546 U.S. 1004</cite>, <cite class="s_court">126 S. Ct. 622</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">163 L.

      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court overruled defendant’s Batson challenge because two white jurors were challenged by the State and the State had two remaining peremptory challenges which it did not exercise, which would indicate that the State did not attempt to exclude jurors on a racial basis. Because defendant did not establish a prima facie case that the State excluded jurors on the basis of race, there was no need for the State to present race-neutral reasons for its peremptory strikes. Moore v. State, 914 So. 2d 185, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 60 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 921 So. 2d 344, 2005 Miss. LEXIS 745 (Miss. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant failed to prove that the State used its peremptory strikes in a discriminatory manner as defendant (1) failed to preserve the record for the voir dire; and (2) did not show the racial composition of the venire, the jury, or the county. However, the record showed that the State used peremptory strikes against three African-Americans and that four African-Americans were seated on the jury, but, on those bare facts, defendant did not show a reasonable inference of purposeful discrimination or that the State attempted to systematically remove African-Americans from the venire; therefore, defendant’s Batson challenge failed. Jones v. State, 904 So. 2d 149, 2005 Miss. LEXIS 221 (Miss. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   In a capital murder case, no racial bias was found in the use of peremptory strikes against minority jurors because the prosecutor cited race-neutral reasons as to each juror, including the desire to get off the jury, employment hardship, the prosecutor’s past professional difficulties with a juror, physical disability, and unemployment. Lynch v. State, 877 So. 2d 1254, 2004 Miss. LEXIS 591 (Miss. 2004), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">543 U.S. 1155</cite>, <cite class="s_court">125 S. Ct. 1299</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">161 L.

      </p>
      <p>
       Included among the reasons accepted as race neutral are: age, demeanor, marital status, single with children, prosecutor distrusted juror, educational background, employment history, criminal record, young and single, friend charged with crime, unemployed with no roots in community, posture and demeanor indicating juror was hostile to being in court, juror was late, short term employment; the Mississippi Supreme Court has also accepted demeanor as a legitimate, race neutral basis for a peremptory challenge.

       Though a school district had recently been desegregated, the process had been accomplished without problems by the time of non-rehire of plaintiff, a black high school teacher, and her employment rights thus were properly measured by general principles of contract and state law; the district had in fact hired more white than black replacement teachers, explaining that the disparity was due to greater turnover among white teachers, and it was cautioned henceforth to employ teachers, and to consider plaintiffs application for re-employment, solely on objective criteria and without regard to any fixed racial hiring ratio.

       Where evidence showed that the county supervisors had leased unused school buildings located on “sixteenth section land” to a civic association in good faith and without any knowledge that it would subsequently be used to house a private segregated school, such lease was not set aside; however, the sublease by the civic association to the whites-only private academy had a “chilling effect” on the operation of recently desegregated public schools and was set aside.

       Although a county board of supervisors is entitled to lease sixteenth section land for a nominal sum, it is well established that the state, acting through its various local bodies, is charged with the affirmative duty to take whatever steps might be necessary to bring about a unitary educational system free of racial discrimination, and where the state is the lessor of a former public school converted into a segregated private school, located on property specifically designated for the benefit of the public schools, there is a state involvement with such schools, and under such circumstances the proscriptions of the Fourteenth Amendment against racial discrimination by the state must be complied with by the lessee and sublessee as certainly as though they were binding covenants written into the agreement itself.

       A chancellor’s refusal to grant a motion to set aside judgment pursuant to MRCP 60(b)(6) was an abuse of discretion where the record was devoid of any notice to the defendant as to the date of the trial; notice, whether of the time and place of a hearing, the contents of a complaint, or of the specific nature of a criminal charge, is the essence of due process.

       Mississippi federal district court held that USCS Const.

       Section 11-11-5 [repealed], a venue statute permitting suits against power companies in any county in which a company may have a power line, is constitutional despite its provision for discretion to try a case in one of several counties, since Art III § 14 of Miss Const of 1890 and the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution (both, inter alia, imposing due process requirements), though safeguarding fundamental rights, do not extend to the forum which a state may designate for protection of such rights.

Also, the interest of the hundreds of other Mississippi property owners in obtaining convenient and effective relief was furthered by keeping the suit in Mississippi because their property was located in the county where the suit was filed; maintenance of the suit did not offend “traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice,” and application of the “long-arm” statute in the case did not violate the United States Constitution.

       The defendant nonresident corporation was entitled to dismissal of the complaint because the court had no basis for asserting personal jurisdiction over it, notwithstanding that the alleged tort was committed partly in Mississippi where the plaintiff was residing when he discovered an allegedly erroneous credit report by the defendant, since the defendant did not have minimum contacts with Mississippi and did not purposely avail itself of the benefits and privileges of the state.

       The exercise of long arm jurisdiction over the defendants was appropriate where the plaintiffs alleged, and the defendants failed to rebut, that the defendants maintained ongoing business relationships within Mississippi related to the present causes of action, i.e., that the defendant private investigators conducted several investigations in Mississippi, including an investigation concerning the plaintiffs.

   Exercise of personal jurisdiction over nonresident defendant comports with due process principles only when two requirements are met: nonresident defendant must have purposefully availed himself of benefits and protections of forum state by establishing minimum contacts with that forum state, and exercise of personal jurisdiction over nonresident defendant must not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.

       In determining whether exercise of long arm jurisdiction under state statute comports with due process requirements, court must determine whether defendant has established sufficient contacts with forum state indicating purposeful availment of privilege of conducting activities within forum and thereby invoking benefits and protection of its laws, with focus of inquiry at this stage being upon nature of underlying litigation.

       Under particular facts, it would not be unfair or offend due process for Mississippi court to exercise jurisdiction in suit by Mississippi corporation against Illinois corporation which had agreed to move Mississippi corporation’s barges which had become stranded in river; defendant’s activities in Mississippi were such that it could reasonably foresee being hailed into court in Mississippi.

       In deciding whether federal court sitting in diversity has jurisdiction over nonresident defendant, reach of long arm statute should be determined before considering whether exercise of jurisdiction would comport with due process, for if service was defective under state statute, constitutional issue should not even be considered.

       Where the Associated Press sent a dispatch from Louisiana to its Mississippi members incorrectly indicating that plaintiff, a Mississippi resident, had been convicted of marijuana possession, the district court had jurisdiction of plaintiffs libel action under the terms of the amended Mississippi long-arm statute; the AP’s contacts with Mississippi were sufficient to justify, under the due process clause, Mississippi’s exercise of its jurisdiction.

Falco Lime, Inc. v. Tide Towing Co., 779 F. Supp. 58, 1991 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17756 (N.D. Miss. 1991).

       The application of the long-arm statute did not deny defendants due process of law where, inter alia, the execution of the contract at issue occurred largely in Mississippi, following telephone negotiations initiated in the state, and where defendant partially performed its part of the contract in Mississippi.

       A judgment obtained against a foreign corporation which owned no property and did no business in Mississippi under an attempted personal service upon an employee designated as a superintendent of the defendant corporation but who was employed by another corporation, and received no compensation from the defendant corporation, would be in violation of the due process of law clause of § 1 of Article 14 of the Constitution of the United States. Alabama, T. & N. R. Co. v. Howell, 244 Miss. 157, 141 So. 2d 242, 1962 Miss. LEXIS 433 (Miss. 1962).

       Due process of law requires personal service to support a personal judgment, and, when the proceeding is strictly in personam brought out to determine the personal rights and obligations of the parties, personal service within the state or a voluntary appearance in the case is essential to acquisition of jurisdiction so as to constitute compliance with the constitutional requirement of due process.

Ch. Ct.

However, the State has a legitimate interest in protecting the family and the estates of the deceased by requiring adjudication of paternity within a reasonable timeframe; the purpose of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.91.html#t91c01s91-1-15" target="_blank">91-1-15</a></cite> in the context of intestate succession is to (1) avoid litigation of stale or fraudulent claims, (2) cause fair and just disposal of property, and (3) facilitate repose of title to real property.

Further, appellants were not deprived of either their procedural or substantive due process rights as Mississippi had a legitimate state interest in the legislation propounded in § 91-1-15, therefore, the statute did not violate any substantive due process rights; in addition, appellants had notice of the putative father’s death and would have been afforded a hearing for adjudication of paternity, however, they failed to make such a petition within the statutory limits of § 91-1-15.

   The administrator of an estate is required to provide actual notice to known or reasonably ascertainable legitimate children who are potential heirs and whose claims would be barred by the running of the 90-day period from the notice of publication to creditors under the nonclaim statute, §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.91.html#t91c01s91-1-15ol13c" target="_blank">91-1-15(3)(c)</a></cite>.

       Key to whether judicial compensation plans which include alleged financial incentives to convict defendants are unconstitutional as a deprivation of due process to a defendant is the presence or absence of judicial power in the person compensated.

       A murder defendant’s confession was not the product of an illegal arrest, since conflicting statements regarding the events surrounding the killing related by the defendant to law enforcement officers provided probable cause for his arrest; moreover, the defendant’s confession was not the product of the arrest, since he gave his confession only after incriminating physical evidence was found by the officers, and the discovery of the physical evidence was the result of separate questioning of another witness and was therefore unconnected with the arrest.

       There are “degrees” of detainments which fall short of an arrest which requires probable cause; detainments which would become an arrest depending on the outcome of a pending investigation are permissible, though police officers do not have unlimited authority, and may not be clothed with the authority to detain where they are not diligently investigating in such a way which will resolve the matter.

Alexander v. State, 605 So. 2d 1170, 1992 Miss. LEXIS 573 (Miss. 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       A guilty plea must be made voluntarily in order to satisfy the defendant’s constitutional rights. A plea is voluntary if the defendant knows what the elements are of the charge against him or her, including an understanding of the charge and its relation to him or her, what effect the plea will have, and what the possible sentence might be because of the plea. Where a defendant is not informed of the maximum and minimum sentences he or she might receive, his or her guilty plea has not been made either voluntarily or intelligently. A complete record should be made to ensure that the defendant’s guilty plea is voluntary. While a transcript of the proceeding is essential, other offers of clear and convincing evidence which prove that the defendant entered a guilty plea voluntarily are sufficient. For example, where an evidentiary hearing has established that a defendant’s guilty plea was entered voluntarily, the fact that a record was not made at the time the plea was entered will not be fatal. Wilson v. State, 577 So. 2d 394, 1991 Miss. LEXIS 179 (Miss. 1991).

       A defendant’s constitutional right to privacy was not violated by the State’s taking the defendant to the health department for treatment of gonorrhea where the defendant was charged with capital rape of a child who was found to have gonorrhea, since the State’s interest in operating a prison and providing for the health of inmates outweighed the privacy interests of the defendant.

       A smear test for gonorrhea, which was conducted after the defendant was arrested for rape, did not constitute a “critical stage” of the criminal proceedings, and therefore the defendant had no right to the presence and advice of counsel under the Sixth Amendment.

       A trial court in a murder prosecution erred in allowing the prosecutor to cross-examine a witness about a certified lab report of results of the defendant’s drug screen test, where the test results were never offered into evidence during the trial and the witness had no actual knowledge of the drug screen analysis; without the testimony of a sponsoring witness with personal knowledge of the facts contained therein, the drug screen report was inadmissible hearsay, and without the opportunity to cross-examine the person responsible for the information contained in the report, the defendant’s right to confront witnesses secured by the Sixth Amendment and Article 3, § 26 of the Mississippi Constitution were violated.

       In a capital murder prosecution involving an underlying felony of rape, the defendant’s due process rights were not violated by a delay in providing the defendant with a “sexual assault kit” which collected samples of the victim’s body fluids, even though the defendant did not receive the samples until almost one year after the State’s expert conducted his testing, which allegedly resulting in the “degradation” of the samples so that the defendant was unable to perform accurate tests, where the State fully complied with a court order to preserve half the samples, and any delay in receiving the samples was due to the defendant’s failure to “simply go and get the samples” from the State’s expert and the defendant’s mistaken belief that the expert had used up all the samples.

       Due process and equal protection claims arising out of arrestee’s lack of access to civil commitment process, as result of pendency of “unresolved criminal charges,” were moot, even if arrestee could in the future become involved in criminal activity and thus again be in position of having “unresolved criminal charges pending” against him, absent any basis for predicting future arrest and ineligibility for psychiatric care.

      <p>
       Statute precluding civil commitment to state psychiatric hospital of those charged with crimes did not proscribe provision of treatment, psychiatric or otherwise, for persons charged with crimes and, thus, statute did not violate equal protection; county could provide arrestee with treatment for his mental illness, but responsibility for providing treatment was county’s duty, not State’s duty.

       In the sentencing phase of a capital murder prosecution, the introduction of a state psychologist’s testimony that it was her opinion that the defendant was not psychotic or mentally ill, did not violate the defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to counsel where the defendant’s attorney requested the psychiatric examination, the defendant testified that he wanted to have a psychiatric evaluation to determine whether he knew right from wrong, and presumably the defendant had consulted with his attorney about the nature of the psychiatric examination.

       Identification of defendant was not impermissibly suggestive because the men in the photographs were all African-American males, had the same build, and possessed the same facial features in accordance with the store clerk’s description of the armed robber. The fact that defendant was the only individual wearing a coat was a minor difference and did not rise to the level of impermissible suggestion. Jones v. State, 993 So. 2d 386, 2008 Miss.

       Defendant’s conviction for the sale of cocaine within 1,500 feet of a church was proper where his due process rights were not violated by the pre-court identification procedure because there was little likelihood of misidentification and the officer’s degree of attention could have been considered to have been at a high level because he did not view defendant in passing or from a great distance.

       In a shoplifting case, the trial court did not err in admitting the identification testimony or in court identifications by two witnesses, as both witnesses gave an accurate description of defendant to those who assisted in the pursuit, were certain that the man in a picture shown to them by the police was the same man who had been in the store, and both testified that they identified defendant as the shoplifter based on their familiarity with him, rather than because his was the only photograph shown to them by the police.

The victim had the opportunity to view defendant two or three times before the armed robbery occurred, the victim testified that he was indeed paying attention before, during, and after the robbery, the record indicated that the victim gave a detailed description of defendant that was largely accurate, and the victim was, insofar as the record revealed, unequivocal in his ability to identify defendant on four separate occasions.

       Where a defendant is to be identified at trial, and the defendant requests that he or she be seated among other people in the courtroom, the trial judge should exercise broad discretion in determining whether the request should be granted; the factors to be considered by the trial judge include (1) any danger presented to the public by the defendant, (2) the danger of misidentification, (3) the courtroom facilities available, and (4) any other pertinent factors known to the trial judge.

       When a reasonably intelligent eyewitness has had a good opportunity to view the features of the perpetrator of a crime, the method the police use in having the witness identify the defendant recedes in importance in inverse ratio to the intelligence of the witness and opportunity to view the perpetrator. Thus, a rape defendant’s argument that the victim’s in-court identification resulted from an impermissibly suggestive photographic identification of the defendant, or from seeing him at the preliminary hearing, was without merit where the victim was a sensible child who had ample opportunity to view the rapist in the daylight, she gave a description of the defendant to a police officer, the accuracy of which was undisputed, and she identified the defendant’s photograph without hesitation no more than 1 1/2 hours after the crime.

       A pretrial voice identification of a burglary defendant was impermissibly suggestive and, therefore, denied the defendant due process of law where the witness heard only one voice after he was shown his stolen items by the police and was told by the police that the man whose voice he was hearing had those items on his person.

   There is no discovery violation as to an officer’s notes, taken in the presence of witnesses and destroyed in good faith. Thus, the destruction of original handwritten notes of a defendant’s statement, which were transcribed into a typed statement, and admission of the typed statement into evidence, did not deprive the defendant of his rights to a fair and impartial trial and adequate defense as provided by the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.

       Although defendant’s rights under the Equal Protection Clause were violated by the state’s striking of one male juror, a court of appeals erred by reversing armed robbery convictions under the plain error standard of review because there was no prejudice to the outcome of the trial since the jury was substantially gender-neutral. McGee v. State, 2006 Miss. LEXIS 469 (Miss. Aug. 31, 2006), op. withdrawn, sub. op., aff'd, 953 So. 2d 211, 2007 Miss. LEXIS 19 (Miss. 2007).

       Defendant’s Batson challenge was properly rejected by the trial court because the fact that the State exercised peremptory strikes on two African-American veniremen did not establish a prima facie case of racial discrimination.

   Mississippi caselaw did not extend the Batson protection to religious-based peremptory strikes of jurors; the only objection offered by defendant was a Batson objection. Because defendant did not object that religious-based peremptory strikes violated Miss. Const. Art. 3, § 18 and Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.13.html#t13c05s13-5-2" target="_blank">13-5-2</a></cite>, the trial judge did not err in accepting the reason offered by the State as a race-neutral reason not prohibited by Batson.

       Manner in which the trial court conducted the polling of the jury did not deny defendant equal protection of the law where the circuit court adhered to the dictates of case law in determining that in the course of post-trial hearings, juror testimony was only admissible as to objective facts bearing on extraneous influences on the deliberation process.

      <p>
       Defendant argued that a missing juror was tantamount to a silent juror and because of the absent juror, the trial court could not eliminate all doubts as to the exposure of all jurors, and the fact that one juror was not present during the polling process alone was sufficient to establish a denial of due process; however, there was ample evidence that the circuit court went out of its way to assemble the jury and to conduct the polling in strict adherence to the appellate court’s instructions, so that the absence of one juror did not invalidate an otherwise sound procedure.

       Where the trial court required each side to explain the reasons for peremptory strikes, disallowed some strikes by both parties, but for several of the strikes denied to the defense or permitted to the State, there was no adequate fact-finding, the case would have been remanded for further fact-finding had it not been reversed on other grounds.

       Where all of defendant’s peremptory challenges were made against Caucasian jurors, and out of the seven total Caucasians on the jury venire, he challenged four, the trial court erred by summarily overruling the State’s Batson objection without going forward with the analysis of whether the Batson objection was warranted.

      <p>
       The defendant failed to make out a prima facie case of gender discrimination in the state’s exercise of peremptory challenges where (1) half of the venire was composed of women, (2) the state exercised 10 or 12 peremptory challenges against women, but tendered three women, (3) nothing about the voir dire, nothing about the prosecutors’ conduct, nothing about the habitual policies of these prosecutors or any stated policies of the district attorney’s office, and nothing about the nature of the case supported an inference of discriminatory intent, and (4) a review of the record established that the state had valid reasons to reject several of the jurors.

       Where the trial court failed to provide an on-the-record factual determination of the reasons given by the state for the exercise of its peremptory challenges, and also failed to ensure that the reasons offered by the state for the exercise of its peremptory challenges were not a pretext for discrimination, the defendant suffered a violation of his right to equal protection and, therefore, he was entitled to reversal of his conviction and a new trial.

      <p>
       Defendant failed to establish prima facie case of gender discrimination arising from prosecution’s exercise of seven peremptory challenges against females where percentage of female venire members struck was nearly equivalent to percentage of females in venire upon which prosecution passed with three peremptory strikes unused; ultimate composition of jury, with eight females, produced percentage of women higher than percentage of females on original venire.

   Although record in capital murder case indicated that veniremember who was excused for cause stated during voir dire that he could impose death penalty if circumstances warranted, and that another venire-member with similar name, who was not excused, indicated he could not impose death penalty under any circumstances, trial court did not err, where defense counsel’s failure to differentiate between the 2 veniremembers during questioning and parties’ subsequent arguments led to conclusion that court reporter mistakenly transposed veniremembers’ names.

   Even if veniremember who gave conflicting statements as to whether he could impose death penalty was erroneously stricken for cause in capital murder case, defendant’s right to impartial jury was not violated, where, because veniremember was panel member number 35, defense would have had to use all 12 peremptory challenges and prosecution would have had to use at least 11 of its peremptory challenges to enable veniremember to serve on jury, and defendant did not claim that any of the 12 jurors who did serve were not impartial.

   A prosecutor’s request of jurors during individual voir dire to give the particular circumstances that each would require in order to return a death sentence were not improperly designed to extract a promise from the jurors that they would certainly vote in favor of the death penalty given a specific set of circumstances, and therefore did not violate the defendant’s constitutional rights.

   A murder defendant was not denied a fair trial on the ground that the trial court refused to accept his challenges for cause to 3 potential jurors where the defendant used peremptory challenges to remove those jurors, since the loss of a peremptory challenge does not constitute a violation of the constitutional right to an impartial jury; so long as the jury that sits is impartial, the fact that the defendant had to use peremptory challenges to achieve that result does not mean that the defendant was denied his or her constitutional rights. Foster v. State, 639 So. 2d 1263, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 670 (Miss. 1994), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">514 U.S. 1019</cite>, <cite class="s_court">115 S. Ct. 1365</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">131 L.

       <p>
   A prerequisite to presentation of a claim of a denial of constitutional rights due to denial of a challenge for cause is a showing that the defendant had exhausted all of his or her peremptory challenges and that the incompetent juror was forced to sit on the jury due to the trial court’s erroneous ruling. Foster v. State, 639 So. 2d 1263, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 670 (Miss. 1994), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">514 U.S. 1019</cite>, <cite class="s_court">115 S. Ct. 1365</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">131 L.

      </p>
      <p>
       A capital murder defendant was not denied a fair trial because he was forced to use his last peremptory challenge to remove a juror who was allegedly potentially biased since the loss of a peremptory challenge does not constitute a violation of the constitutional right to an impartial jury so long as the jury that sits is impartial, and the defendant did not show that an incompetent juror was forced to sit on the jury. Mettetal v. State, 615 So. 2d 600, 1993 Miss. LEXIS 96 (Miss. 1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       Personal opposition to capital punishment is not a constitutional impediment to juror service so long as the juror is able to set aside his or her personal belief and fairly consider all sentencing options under the law; it was therefore error for a trial court to refuse defense counsel an opportunity to further voir dire potential jurors who had expressed reluctance to vote for the death penalty.

       A trial court did not deny defendant’s constitutional right to a fair and impartial jury, where it eliminated only those prospective jurors who indicated that their conscientious scruples against the death penalty would prevent them from properly considering the issue of defendant’s guilt in accordance with their oath.

       Prosecutors are not limited in use of any legitimate informational source available as to jurors, nor does prosecutor have to question juror in open court about such information before using it as racially neutral ground to make peremptory strike, as long as source of information and practice itself are not racially discriminatory.

       Defendant’s Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment rights were not violated in a capital murder case, where the trial court excused a juror for cause who had unequivocally stated that he was opposed to the death penalty to the extent that it would prevent him from making an impartial decision on defendant’s guilt, that he would not even consider the court’s instructions, and that under no circumstances would he vote for the death penalty.

       A defendant, found guilty of murder and for whom the jury recommended a sentence of life imprisonment was not deprived of due process and equal protection of the law because of the exclusion of a prospective juror who had scruples against the death penalty, and his exclusion did not result in a panel biased with respect to defendant’s guilt.

   In a capital murder case, the unsworn statements of one juror showing that the juror was predisposed to voting for the death penalty without weighing mitigating factors was countered with an affidavit from the juror stating that the juror had considered all of the evidence in the case, and the unsworn statement of the second juror did not state that the juror was silent during voir dire, that she had lied about her views on mitigating evidence, that the juror was unwilling to consider mitigating factors, or that she had a predisposition toward the death penalty that she did not disclose during voir dire; thus, the inmate’s claim that the two jurors were predisposed toward voting for the death penalty was unsupported and the inmate was not deprived of his right to a fair and impartial jury under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments or Miss.

       Where evidence, based on statement of juror, disclosed that jury after twenty-three hours of deliberations stood 11 to 1 for verdict of guilty of murder when bailiff stated to jury that judge told him he had until next convening of court to wait until they reached verdict and that as far as he was concerned they could stay there until they rotted, and that shortly thereafter the jury returned a verdict of guilty, such conduct constituted a coercive influence on the jury prejudicial to defendant, it being immaterial whether the judge actually made such statement.

       Defendant was entitled to a new trial because counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to so move as (1) there was no strategic reason for failing to so move, and (2) it was reasonably probable the motion would have been granted, since defendant had a right to be where defendant was, the victim was an immediate aggressor by forcibly entering a dwelling, and defendant engaged in no unlawful activity, so defendant had no duty to retreat.

       Defendant was properly denied a new trial based on the State’s alleged misrepresentations about counsel being present at the lineup because it was not a use of false evidence in violation of the 14th Amendment, as the police chief testified that he could have been mistaken but he did not lie when he said that counsel was present at the lineup.

       Defendant’s due process rights were violated where the State destroyed a video of a traffic stop and the moments before it while under a court order to preserve it, which impaired the defense since the video would have clarified material disputed facts as to whether defendant admitted to drinking alcohol, whether he slurred his words, whether his coordination was impaired, how he was driving immediately prior to the stop, the interaction between the two men and the portable breath test results.

       In a manslaughter case, defendant’s right to a fundamentally fair trial was denied because the trial court refused to allow the admission of the testimony of two police officers under Miss. R. Evid. 404(a)(2) where there was sufficient testimony to create a jury issue as to whether the victim was the aggressor in the incident that led to his death; the officers’ testimony was relevant to show prior incidents so that the jury could have placed itself in defendant’s shoes at the time of the incident.

       Defendant voluntarily waived his right to testify after being informed that his prior embezzlement conviction could be used against him for impeachment purposes; while defendant’s enthusiasm for testifying might have suffered a chilling effect upon his being advised by the trial judge that his embezzlement conviction could be used against him for impeachment purposes, that was the reality of the adversarial system. Additionally, as the impeaching crime of embezzlement was a Miss. R. Evid. 609(a)(2) crime involving dishonesty or false statements, no balancing analysis was required for the admission of that prior conviction; thus, the trial court did not err in finding that the prior conviction would be admissible if defendant decided to testify. Jackson v. State, 910 So. 2d 658, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 170 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 904 So. 2d 184, 2005 Miss. LEXIS 402 (Miss. 2005).

   Even if the record clearly showed that a petitioner was in shackles in front of the jury in the sentencing phase of a capital murder trial, there was no merit in the petitioner’s arguments that his Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment rights were violated; the petitioner had already been convicted twice and had already received a death sentence for the murder of one victim, and he had a history of escaping from authority as a juvenile.

       Eyewitness testimony of multiple witnesses was sufficient evidence that homicide committed by defendant, an armed late arriver to a nightclub fight, was not self-defense, and defendant was not prejudiced by the failure of the original indictment to state a specific overt act by which the homicide was committed, particularly where the indictment was amended to read “by shooting with a pistol.” Jones v.

       In a prosecution for capital murder and armed robbery arising from the robbery of two adjacent businesses, the testimony of one business owner, who was also shot, regarding the events was properly admitted into evidence as the assault and robbery of that business owner was so intertwined with the murder of the other business owner that it could be perceived as a single occurrence.

       In a prosecution for murder, there was no error in the introduction into evidence of photographs of the murder victim where (1) there was nothing in the record to indicate that the admission of the photographs was simply a ploy on the part of the prosecutor to arouse the passion and prejudice of the jury, (2) the photographs established that the victim was dead as a result of a criminal act, and the extent, position, and nature of the wounds the victim sustained, and (3) the photographs assisted the jury in visualizing the crime scene and corroborated the testimony of the investigators of the crime scene.

      <p>
       In a prosecution for murder, an exclamation from the audience by the victim’s mother that the defendant “cold blooded killed my child” did not prejudice the defendant’s right to a fair trial where the victim’s mother was immediately escorted from the courtroom after her outburst, and the judge then properly admonished the jury to disregard the incident and questioned the jurors to determine whether they could disregard the comments.

       A defendant’s right to a fair trial by an impartial jury was not prejudiced by the fact that the defendant was brought shackled into the hallway outside the courtroom while some of the jurors were in the hallway, where the defendant was not brought into the courtroom until the shackles were removed, the incident was a technical violation which was not intentional but was coincidental to the jury being out in the hallway, and no evidence was presented to show that the defendant was seen shackled by some of the jury members.

       It was basically unfair for the trial court in a prosecution for murder to force defendant to offer his testimony and that of his witnesses to the jury after a fatiguing day in court and at a time when both counsel and jury were exhausted; moreover, due process of law necessitated a forum for defendant to present his case within reasonable hours and under reasonable circumstances.

   Refusal to grant continuance on third trial of prosecution for rape, which trial took place some two weeks after employment of new counsel for defendant, did not constitute a denial of defendant’s right to effective representation by counsel contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution, where more than two years had elapsed since the commission of the offense, such counsel had advantage of voluminous and comprehensive briefs, records and opinions of the court in two previous trials and the assistance of two investigators to help them in preparing for the trial.

   A defendant’s constitutional right to confront witnesses was violated by the prosecution’s attempted cross-examination of a witness who had been called as an adverse witness by the defendant, where the witness pleaded her privilege against self-incrimination on direct examination, and then, on cross-examination, the prosecuting attorney purportedly read from the witness’ pretrial statement, which implied the defendant’s guilt, before each of the witness’ claim of privilege against self-incrimination.

       A murder defendant was not denied a fair trial by the denial of his motion for a court-appointed psychologist, in spite of the defendant’s argument that he was thereby prevented from properly presenting his theory of defense related to his state of mind when he was assaulted by the victim, where the State offered no expert testimony regarding the defendant’s state of mind, the defendant did not testify as to his state of mind, and the record did not “even hint at a defense of this nature.” Green v.

       While the due process clause requires that an indigent defendant should at times be allowed an expert in the interest of fundamental fairness, a court is not required to appoint an expert upon demand. Some of the factors to be considered in determining if the defendant was denied a fair trial when the court did not appoint a requested expert include the degree of access the defendant had to the State’s experts and whether those experts were available for vigorous cross-examination. Another consideration is the lack of prejudice or incompetence on the part of the State’s experts. Fisher v. Eupora, 587 So. 2d 878, 1991 Miss. LEXIS 669 (Miss. 1991).

       In absence of anything in the record that suggests that a defendant charged with uttering a forgery was prejudiced to the point of warranting a new trial by the failure to furnish him with a handwriting expert, the trial court did not err in refusing defendant’s request for the expert.

       Capital murder defendant is not denied due process by trial court’s refusal to provide defendant funds with which to obtain own experts, nor does defendant suffer any disadvantage thereby where defendant’s counsel has full access to experts of state, together with investigation and reports of those experts, counsel is able to subject them to rigid cross-examination, and there is nothing to indicate that state experts are biased or incompetent.

       Considerable prejudice resulted from the prosecutor’s inappropriate statements to the jury and the supreme court was unable to say, beyond a reasonable doubt, that such prejudice was overcome by the evidence; thus, defendant’s sentence and conviction were reversed and remanded to the trial court for a new trial.

   In a capital murder case, the State’s invocation of higher biblical law did not violate the inmate’s rights under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, or under Miss. Const. art. 3, § 14, because the prosecutor was responding to the biblical argument made by the inmate’s attorney; also, the inmate’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim for counsels’ failure to object to the State’s biblical references had to fail.

       In a prosecution for auto theft, the state’s cross-examination of the defendant and closing argument regarding his post-arrest failure to state that it was the passenger in the vehicle he was driving that had stolen the vehicle were impermissible references to his post-arrest right to remain silent, and it was error for the trial court to permit the cross-examination and comments during closing argument; the court rejected the state’s contention that reference to the defendant’s post-arrest silence was permissible because the defendant had not yet been given his Miranda warnings.

       For district court to grant habeas relief based upon remarks by the prosecutor, district court must find more than that prosecutor’s comments were undesirable or even universally condemned, and relevant question is whether the prosecutors’ comments so infected the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process, and in the context of a death penalty case, the comments must have been such as to render the sentencing fundamentally unfair.

       Claim of improper jury argument by state does not present claim of constitutional dimensions unless it is so prejudicial as to render defendant’s trial fundamentally unfair within meaning of Fourteenth Amendment due-process clause; to show prejudice to his substantive rights, defendant must demonstrate either persistent and pronounced misconduct or that evidence was so insubstantial that but for remarks no conviction would have occurred; arguments concerning aggravating circumstances, appropriateness of mercy, and whether or not jury was final authority, represented neither persistent and pronounced misconduct nor was evidence so insubstantial that conviction would not have occurred but for prosecutor’s remarks.

   Trial court did not mislead jury, in capital murder case involving underlying felony of sexual battery, by instructing that “the fact that the actual moment of the victim’s death may have preceded alleged consummation of the underlying felony of Sexual Battery does not void the charge of Capital Murder,” even though defendant claimed that jury was misled on intent necessary for capital murder as instruction could be correct statement of law only if jury also found that defendant had formed intent to commit sexual battery; when taken in conjunction with other instructions, jury was clearly informed that it must find defendant intended to kill victim while engaged in commission of sexual battery.

       In a prosecution for aggravated assault on an indictment charging defendant with being a habitual criminal, the trial court’s failure to give a limiting instruction on its own motion informing the jury not to consider defendant’s prior convictions as evidence of the assault charges did not deny him due process of law, where defendant had testified freely as to the offenses made part of the indictment and where no limiting instruction was requested by defendant’s counsel; under the totality of the circumstances, such an instruction was not constitutionally required.

   Admission of evidence in habitual offender capital murder case that defendant’s habitual offender status makes him ineligible for parole is founded upon theory that Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments require that sentencer not be precluded from considering, as mitigating factors, aspects of defendant’s character or record proffered as a basis for sentence less than death.

   In any case in which the imposition of the death penalty is possible, the habitual offender hearing should be held prior to jury deliberations on the death penalty; where a defendant is adjudged to be a habitual offender, the jury should be informed that a life sentence means “life, without probation or parole.” Accurately informing the jury that the alternative to the death penalty is life, without benefit of probation or parole, can only enhance the sentencing process, insuring that excessive punishment shall not be inflicted.

It was highly unlikely that the grandfather’s statement, when read as a whole and taken in context with all the evidence before the sentencing judge, was the reason the judge imposed the death penalty; in fact, the trial judge’s sentencing order, in which he made findings of facts as to the various aggravating and mitigating factors, did not even mention the grandfather’s testimony.

       Sufficiency of evidence claim is pure question of law and “rational factfinder” standard is the appropriate standard of review in habeas proceeding in determining whether a state court’s application of its constitutionally adequate aggravating factor in capital murder case was so erroneous as to raise an independent due process or Eighth Amendment violation.

       Instruction given in capital murder trials contained proper limiting definition of the especially heinous, atrocious or cruel aggravating factor; court defined especially heinous, atrocious or cruel as a conscienceless or pitiless crime which is unnecessarily torturous to the victim, and state Supreme Court determined that such language properly channeled jury’s discretion during sentencing phase.

   A prosecutor’s remarks during the penalty phase of a capital murder prosecution did not constitute an improper comment on the defendant’s failure to testify where the prosecutor stated that the defendant “showed no compassion, but would send a lawyer up here and ask you for compassion,” since the argument pointed out the lack of a mitigation defense presented by the defendant, and that he was reduced to sending his lawyer in to plead for his life after all else had failed.

   In the sentencing phase of a capital murder prosecution, the trial court did not unconstitutionally limit consideration of emotional disturbance mitigation evidence to “extreme” emotional disturbance by submitting an instruction on “extreme mental or emotional disturbance” where the instructions on mitigating factors, when read as a whole, provided ample opportunity for the jury to give consideration to any emotional disturbance the defendant may have suffered.

   In the sentencing phase of a capital murder prosecution, the trial court did not err in refusing to give peremptory instructions requiring the jury to find 5 mitigating factors which the defendant claimed were undisputed, since the existence of mitigating factors should be left to the jury’s consideration; while it is constitutionally required that a jury not be precluded from considering any mitigating factor, a jury is not required to find such factors.

   In imposing a sentence of death in a capital murder case, the fact that the jury’s specific written findings supporting its verdict were “parroted” from the sentencing forms did not render the verdict ambiguous in violation of the 6th and 14th Amendments to the United States Constitution and Article 3, § 24 of the Mississippi Constitution.

       In the sentencing phase of a capital murder prosecution, the State’s closing argument did not constitute a comment on the defendant’s failure to take the witness stand in his own defense where the State made the following argument: “Do you think she was suffering? Do you think that’s cruel and atrocious, and what’s even more than that, what do you think was running through [defendant’s] head as he sat through watching her gag on her own blood? What do you think he was thinking?” Thorson v. State, 653 So. 2d 876, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 600 (Miss. 1994).

   A sentencing instruction in a capital murder prosecution properly defined the “especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel” aggravating factor, and thus there was no violation of the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution, where the instruction defined the term “heinous, atrocious, or cruel” as “those situations where the actual commission of the capital felony was accomplished by such additional acts to set the crime apart from the norm of capital felonies by the consciencelessness or pitilessness of the crime which is unnecessarily tortuous to the victim.” Hansen v.

   Submission to a capital sentencing jury of the mitigating factor that the defendant had no “significant” history of criminal activity was not improper, in spite of the defendant’s argument that the factor was unconstitutionally applied in his particular case because it implied that he had at least some criminal history when in fact he had none, where the mitigating factor was taken verbatim from the list provided by the legislature to be considered in imposing sentence, and the defendant had the opportunity during closing argument to dispel any notion the jury might have had that he had a history of criminal activity.

   In the sentencing phase of a capital murder prosecution, the definition of the “especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel” aggravating factor contained in the limiting instruction was constitutionally adequate where the instruction described an especially heinous, atrocious or cruel capital offense as a “conscienceless or pitiless crime which is unnecessarily torturous to the victim” and which can be shown by the fact that the defendant “utilized a method of killing which caused serious mutilation where there is a dismemberment of the corpse, where the defendant inflicted physical or mental pain before death, where there was mental torture and aggravation before death or where a lingering or torturous death was suffered by the victim.”

   In the sentencing phase of a capital murder prosecution, a jury instruction which provided a step-by-step guide in arriving at a verdict did not impermissibly limit the consideration of mitigating evidence, in spite of the defendant’s argument that the language of the instruction could have misled the jury to believe that a finding of mitigating circumstances must be unanimous because “everything else” required a unanimous finding, where the mitigating circumstances portion of the instruction did not contain the word “unanimous” or “unanimously,” and the instruction would not have implied to any reasonably literate juror that he or she should await unanimity before considering a mitigating circumstance.

   A trial court’s limitation of closing argument to 15 minutes in the sentencing phase of a capital murder prosecution did not violate the defendant’s constitutional right to a fair trial where the defendant made no proffer as to what he would have argued had he been given additional time, and he raised no objection to the time limit at the time of trial.

   In the sentencing phase of a capital murder prosecution, the prosecutor’s comments during closing argument portraying the victim as a “grandmother” who left home “wearing her mother’s day present ring on her finger,” and asking the jury not to forget the victim “because she deserves justice” did not constitute an impermissible argument to sentence the defendant to death out of vengeance and sympathy for the victim; the introduction of evidence concerning the background and character of the victim and the impact of the crime on the victim’s family is not prohibited, as such evidence may be relevant to the jury’s decision as to whether the death penalty should be imposed.

   The imposition of the death penalty against a mentally retarded defendant with the functional equivalent of a 7-year-old did not violate the cruel and unusual punishment clause of the Eighth Amendment, where the jury was instructed as to the mitigating factors enumerated in §§<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.99.html#t99c19s99-19-101ol16b" target="_blank">99-19-101(6)(b)</a></cite>, (f) and (g) and these 3 mitigating factors were argued to the jury, so that the jury was provided a vehicle, through appropriate jury instructions and argument, to consider and give effect to the mitigating evidence of the defendant’s mental retardation in rendering its sentencing decision.

       A defendant was denied his constitutional right to a fair trial by an impartial jury in the sentencing phase of a capital murder prosecution where, upon conclusion of the guilt phase but before the sentencing phase began, the jury prematurely deliberated and sent a note to the judge indicating their decision that the defendant should be sentenced to death. Rather than questioning the jurors in order to determine whether each of them could remain impartial during the sentencing phase, the judge merely instructed the jurors to “refrain from further deliberations,” which was insufficient to insure that the defendant’s right to a fair hearing was not prejudiced.

   In a prosecution for capital murder committed during a burglary, the jury’s verdict imposing the death penalty complied with this section, despite defendant’s contention that the jury did not state the specific facts upon which it based its sentence, where neither this section nor case law required such detailed findings. However, pursuant to §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.99.html#t99c19s99-19-105" target="_blank">99-19-105</a></cite>, the death sentence would be reversed and the case remanded for sentencing to life imprisonment, where the victim, upon seeing defendant, began firing his pistol and was then shot by defendant, and where defendant had the opportunity to shoot the victim’s wife but did not; the penalty of death in this case was disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases.

       Section 97-3-65, governing sentencing procedures in rape cases, does not violate due process or equal protection of the law, even though no provision is made for the jury to consider mitigating circumstances in fixing a defendant’s sentence; the rule requiring a bifurcated trial is applicable only to cases involving capital offenses.

   Prisoners awaiting execution in Mississippi were not entitled to an injunction preventing the State from conducting executions with compounded pentobarbital because Mississippi’s sovereign immunity prevented a federal court from enjoining state officials to follow state law, Mississippi state law empowered prisoners to challenge their sentence, and the prisoners did not show they were likely to succeed in establishing a violation of either their procedural or substantive due process rights. Jordan v. Fisher, 823 F.3d 805, 2016 U.S. App. LEXIS 11734 (5th Cir. Miss. 2016), cert. denied, — U.S. —, <cite class="s_court">137 S. Ct. 1069</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">197 L.

      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant’s motion for post-conviction relief was properly denied because his sentence was not unconstitutionally vague and subject to more than one interpretation; he was sentenced to 18 years in prison with 12 years to serve, and 18 minus 12 left six years suspended, which is what the language in the sentencing order reflected. Jones v. State, 956 So. 2d 310, 2006 Miss. App. LEXIS 871 (Miss. Ct. App. 2006).

       There was no equal protection violation when appellant received a 15-year sentence for statutory rape; appellant conceded that the statute applied equally to male and female defendants. McKenzie v. State, 946 So. 2d 392, 2006 Miss. App. LEXIS 388 (Miss. Ct. App. 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant’s sentence of two days in jail for driving under the influence and failing to dim his headlights was upheld where there was no absolute constitutional bar to sentence enhancement at a second trial; an on-the-record explanation of an enhanced sentence was not warranted after a trial de novo in a superior court following an appeal from an inferior court. Carr v. State, 942 So. 2d 816, 2006 Miss. App. LEXIS 856 (Miss. Ct. App. 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because the record was clear that defendant was six days past his 18th birthday at the time of the capital murder, he was over the age of 18, and was therefore eligible for the death penalty. Scott v. State, 938 So. 2d 1233, 2006 Miss. LEXIS 534 (Miss. 2006), overruled,

      </p>
      <p>
       Harsher sentence imposed on defendant was proper where, in his second sentencing hearing, the judge heard new evidence concerning the events of the crimes and that evidence led him to believe that the crime was more heinous than the judge originally believed. There was no indication of vindictiveness and neither the double jeopardy provision nor the Equal Protection Clause imposed an absolute bar to the more severe sentence upon reconviction. Fowler v. State, 919 So. 2d 1129, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 581 (Miss. Ct. App. 2005), cert. denied, 921 So. 2d 1279, 2006 Miss. LEXIS 56 (Miss. 2006).

       Defendant’s due process rights were not violated by his removal from the intensive supervision program; when defendant was taken off house arrest and placed in the Mississippi Department of Corrections’ custody, he merely experienced a change in his housing assignment and classification, which did not require a hearing since it did not involve a liberty interest. Brown v. Miss. Dep't of Corr., 906 So. 2d 833, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 1157 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).

   The defendant was not deprived of due process in connection with his forfeiture of good time credits as it was apparent that §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.47.html#t47c05s47-5-138" target="_blank">47-5-138</a></cite> provides much greater procedural protections than those which are typically found in extra-judicial prison revocation proceedings in that it only provides for a revocation of good time credits in the event that a “final order” is issued dismissing the prisoner’s lawsuit. Tubwell v. Anderson, 776 So. 2d 654, 2000 Miss. LEXIS 189 (Miss. 2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 47-5-138 is not unconstitutional in that it violates the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment since neither prison inmates nor indigents constitute a suspect class entitled to heightened scrutiny under the equal protection clause. Tubwell v. Anderson, 776 So. 2d 654, 2000 Miss. LEXIS 189 (Miss. 2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       The banishment of the defendant from a 100 mile radius of the place that he committed a burglary was not justified where the trial court did not make an on the record finding of the benefits of banishment. Weaver v. State, 764 So. 2d 479, 2000 Miss. App. LEXIS 351 (Miss. Ct. App. 2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   The defendant’s 25 year sentence fell within the guidelines of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.97.html#t97c03s97-3-79" target="_blank">97-3-79</a></cite>, was not excessive, and did not violate his Sixth and Fourteenth amendment rights, notwithstanding the defendant’s assertion that he was merely an accessory after the fact, where the trial judge found no reason to suspend any of the sentence the defendant had a previous conviction of burglary of an occupied dwelling. Lawson v. State, 748 So. 2d 96, 1999 Miss. LEXIS 289 (Miss. 1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       The defendant’s due process rights were not breached when the trial court added court costs and assessments to the written order and administered additional conditions of the suspension of sentence. Goss v. State, 721 So. 2d 144, 1998 Miss. LEXIS 552 (Miss. 1998), overruled,
   Carter v. State, 754 So. 2d 1207, 2000 Miss. LEXIS 7 (Miss. 2000), overruled in part, Johnson v. State, 925 So. 2d 86, 2006 Miss. LEXIS 116 (Miss. 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       Contention that it was error for harsher sentence to be imposed after defendant invoked his constitutional right to fair trial would be considered on appeal, though it was not preserved at trial, as right to due process was implicated. Pierce v. Delchamps, Inc., 667 So. 2d 26, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 27 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       There was no violation of due process in imposing 25-year sentence for armed robbery following trial, after prior conviction and 15-year sentence pursuant to plea bargain had been set aside; there was no evidence of vindictiveness, particularly since there were two different sentencers and the second sentencer had benefit of hearing evidence at trial, and was the same judge who had granted motion to vacate first sentence on ground that defendant was not properly advised of his rights. Pierce v. Delchamps, Inc., 667 So. 2d 26, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 27 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court is prohibited from imposing heavier sentence upon defendant because he has exercised his constitutional right to trial by jury than sentence offered defendant in plea bargaining process. Johnson v. State, 666 So. 2d 784, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 616 (Miss. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       Imposition by trial court of heavier sentence than that which was offered in plea bargaining process is not abuse of discretion and violates no right of defendant where lenient sentence is proposed in pretrial plea bargain negotiations, where after rejecting same defendant is found guilty by jury, where before imposition of sentence trial judge is presented with evidence of aggravating circumstances relevant to sentencing not known to him at time of original plea bargain negotiations, where in fact trial judge imposes heavier sentence than was proposed at time of plea bargain and in fact bases imposition of heavier sentence upon information of aggravating circumstances of which he has been newly made aware, and where heavier sentence has not been imposed upon accused in whole or in part as penalty for his exercise of his constitutional right to trial by jury. Johnson v. State, 666 So. 2d 784, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 616 (Miss. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       Sentence of life imprisonment for crime of capital rape was appropriate for defendant convicted of raping 6-year-old child, despite act that defendant had been offered 5-year sentence during plea negotiations prior to trial; court was not involved in plea negotiations, did not impose heavier sentence merely because defendant exercised his constitutional right to jury trial, and merely followed statutory sentencing dictates. Johnson v. State, 666 So. 2d 784, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 616 (Miss. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       A court must base its revocation of a suspended sentence on a violation of the clear terms and conditions of the suspended sentence; due process requires that the trial judge at least orally inform the defendant of the terms and conditions upon which his or her suspended sentence is contingent before it may be properly revoked for the violation of those terms and conditions. Artis v. State, 643 So. 2d 533, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 468 (Miss. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   A sentence of death was not improperly based on “vengeance and sympathy,” in spite of the defendant’s argument that the jury’s sentencing determination was improperly predicated on the personal characteristics of the victim, where in response to the defendant’s parents’ request to the jury not to sentence their son to death the prosecutor merely noted that the defendant’s parents were not the only ones who had suffered and grieved and that their “tears might be outweighed by the fact of the victim’s murder,” and he reminded the jury that the victim’s parents had also suffered a loss and that they must not forget the “cold, calculated killing” of the victim. Foster v. State, 639 So. 2d 1263, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 670 (Miss. 1994), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">514 U.S. 1019</cite>, <cite class="s_court">115 S. Ct. 1365</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">131 L.

       Where police chief, who had apprehended students after responding to report of fight on or near school property, noticed single profanity written in dust on his car when he arrived at police station with four of students, and made several of them wash it and several other vehicles, students were entitled to partial summary judgment that their Fourteenth Amendment Rights were violated by being forced to wash car; and although no physical harm occurred, violation was not de minimis, considering plaintiff’s age and fact that exercise took place in view of passersby and of news media; “punishment” of pretrial detainees is prohibited and although regulatory restraints incident to detention are permissible, they must be reasonably related to legitimate goal, and in instant case were not.

      <p>
       A defendant’s equal protection challenge to his sentence of 14 years in the state penitentiary with 7 years suspended if he paid a $125,000 fine was premature because there was nothing in the record showing the defendant to be indigent. Arnett v. State, 532 So. 2d 1003, 1988 Miss. LEXIS 457 (Miss. 1988).

      <p>
       Judge may impose more severe sentence upon defendant following new trial and conviction for same charge for which defendant has successfully appealed original conviction but only if judge affirmatively states in record reasons for harsher sentence and only if reasons are based upon objective information concerning identifiable conduct on part of defendant occurring after time of original sentencing proceeding, or based upon objective information concerning events occurring after time of original sentencing proceeding that may throw new light upon defendant’s life, health, habits, conduct, or mental and moral propensities.

       Denial of credit for time served in jail and of “good time” to person convicted of felony who appeals judgment of conviction and who remains in jail pending disposition of appeal due to inability to make bond, while allowing credit for time served in jail and award of “good time” to convicted felons serving sentence in county jail without appealing conviction is denial of equal protection, contrary to Fourteenth Amendment. Lacy v. State, 468 So. 2d 63, 1985 Miss. LEXIS 2040 (Miss. 1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where defendant was convicted of possession of a controlled substance with intent to distribute, and sentenced to seven years in prison with two years suspended upon payment of a $3000 fine, the appellate court would hold that the question of whether the imposition of an additional two year imprisonment upon nonpayment of the fine constituted an impermissible discrimination against indigents in violation of equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment was premature, in that the record did not reflect that the defendant was, in fact, indigent, nor did it reflect that the sentencing court was aware of any alleged indigency. Payne v. State, 462 So. 2d 902, 1984 Miss. LEXIS 1986 (Miss. 1984).
      </p>
      <p>
       A term of probation requiring defendant to remain at least 125 miles away from a particular county did not violate his First, Fifth, or Fourteenth Amendment rights, where the record indicated that the trial judge carefully and meticulously explained to defendant his rights, the trial court found that defendant voluntarily and knowingly pled guilty, the Department of Corrections conducted an investigation of defendant prior to sentencing, and defendant accepted the terms of probation, which were neither unreasonable nor arbitrary. Cobb v. State, 437 So. 2d 1218, 1983 Miss. LEXIS 2926 (Miss. 1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       It is impermissible for a trial judge to enhance a sentence because the defendant refused a plea bargain and put the state and court to the trouble of trial by jury. Pearson v. State, 428 So. 2d 1361, 1983 Miss. LEXIS 2505 (Miss. 1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       A court may not first fine a defendant and then, because of his indigency, convert the fine into a jail sentence for failure of the defendant to make immediate payment. Reasonable alternatives to incarceration must first be resorted to in an attempt to afford the indigent an opportunity to satisfy his fine. Nelson v. Tullos, 323 So. 2d 539, 1975 Miss. LEXIS 1565 (Miss. 1975).
      </p>
      <p>
       There was no denial of equal protection of the law or of due process in the imprisonment of an indigent, who, after pleading guilty to a misdemeanor charge, was sentenced to a jail term and to pay a fine, and who after serving her jail term was unable to pay the fine because of her indigency, and remained in jail to work out her fine. Wade v. Carsley, 221 So. 2d 725, 1969 Miss. LEXIS 1506 (Miss. 1969).

   Due process in Mississippi requires the punishment of one charged with murder to be determined and fixed by the jury, rather than by the court. Yates v.

       Court rejected the inmate’s claim that the parole board’s discretion to deny him parole denied him equal protection as provided under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, because the inmate did not argue that he was a member of a suspect class or that a fundamental right had been violated, and the State naturally had an interest in protecting members of society from dangerous criminals and in punishing criminals for failing to abide by the law; therefore, a rational relationship existed between the parole board’s discretion and the State’s interests.

   In a capital murder case, the inmate asserted that he had been subjected to cruel and inhuman treatment in violation of his Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights because he had been kept in maximum confinement on Mississippi’s death row under conditions that included lock-down and isolation for at least 23 hours of the day and because he had been subjected to numerous execution dates during those 19-20 years; however, there was no law in the United States or Mississippi that supported the inmate’s claim and, thus, there were no grounds for post-conviction relief on that issue.

   Mississippi procedure does not violate the constitutional prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment by vesting original jurisdiction in the circuit court when a person under 18 years of age is charged with a capital offense, rather than requiring a certification proceeding in youth court for transfer to the circuit court; Mississippi law allows a capital murder defendant who is under the age of 18 years to request a special hearing to consider his or her age, lack of prior offenses, likelihood of successful rehabilitation and other factors which favor sending the case to the youth court rather than continuing in circuit court.

   Mississippi procedure does not violate the constitutional prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment by its failure to explicitly state a minimum age that a person may be subject to the death penalty, since the age at which one may receive a death sentence for the crime of capital murder is implied; no one under 13 years of age may receive the death penalty because a child under the age of 13 cannot even be charged with a felony.

       In a murder prosecution involving a victim who died of smoke inhalation after receiving a blow to the head, the admission of facts concerning the murder of another victim who died from shotgun wounds did not violate the defendant’s rights under the Eighth Amendment to the federal constitution or the due process clauses of the Mississippi Constitution and the federal constitution, where the revelation that a second person was missing was necessary in putting together the pieces of the case, evidence that the investigating officers discovered 2 bodies in the trunk of the victim’s car was unavoidable, and the testimony of the other victim’s mother was necessary in that she was the only witness who could testify to seeing the defendant near the victim’s house, she was able to discuss what the victim was doing on the day he was killed, and she was able to give some important time frames.

   Although long delays between the time of arrest and arraignment have the potential to violate the defendant’s constitutional right to a speedy trial even if the 270 day mandate of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.99.html#t99c17s99-17-1" target="_blank">99-17-1</a></cite> has been met, the State’s compliance with § 99-l7-l would be viewed as significant when determining whether the defendant’s constitutional right to a speedy trial had been violated.

       A defendant’s statutory right to a speedy trial was not violated, even though 338 days elapsed between the defendant’s original arraignment and the first day of his trial, where the defendant was granted a 63-day continuance during that time, and the case was continued for 37 days due to a congested docket. Additionally, the defendant’s constitutional right to a speedy trial was not violated, even though 456 days elapsed between the time the defendant was arrested and the first day of his trial, where a significant part of the delay was attributable to the defendant, the balance of the delay was attributable to mere negligence and court congestion, and the defendant failed to assert his right to a speedy trial until the day the trial was scheduled.

Additionally, the defendant’s constitutional right to a speedy trial was not violated where the defendant moved for 2 continuances during the period between the indictment and the trial which resulted in 181 days of time lost, much of the remaining delay could be attributed to 5 changes in the defendant’s attorney, the delay was for good cause to allow his counsel sufficient time to prepare for trial, there were no deliberate attempts by the State to cause a delay to hamper the defendant’s ability to prepare a defense, and there was no showing of prejudice to the defendant.

   For constitutional purposes, the right to a speedy trial attaches and time begins to run with arrest. The statutory right to a speedy trial set forth in §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.99.html#t99c17s99-17-1" target="_blank">99-17-1</a></cite> attaches with arraignment; calculation of statutory time requires exclusion of the date of arraignment and inclusion of the date of trial and weekends, unless the last day of the 270-day period falls on Sunday. Any delays in prosecution attributable to a defendant under either the constitutional or statutory scheme tolls the running of time. Any continuances for “good cause” will toll the running of time unless “the record is silent regarding the reason for delay,” in which case “the clock ticks against the State because the State bears the risk of non-persuasion on the good cause issue.” The statutory 270-day rule is satisfied once the defendant is brought to trial, even if that trial results in a mistrial.

       Perfecting of defendant’s appeal took an inordinately long time; however, defendant did not satisfy the most important factor in the appellate delay analysis, the requisite showing of prejudice, because (1) defendant’s appeal was meritless; (2) he did not show that any anxiety and concern during the pendency of his appeal was of such a degree that it would distinguish his case from that of any other prisoner awaiting the outcome of an appeal; and (3) the delay in perfecting defendant’s appeal did not impair his grounds for appeal or impair his defense in the event of a retrial. Thus, the 12-year delay in processing his appeal did not result in a violation of his due process rights. Jackson v. State, 910 So. 2d 658, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 170 (Miss. Ct.

   In speedy trial analysis, defendant was not prejudiced by his inability to talk with potential alibi witnesses, due to his incarceration prior to trial; record mentioned names of no potential alibi witnesses who had suffered memory loss or who could not be found, and defense counsel could have traced leads at defendant’s direction.

       Without evidence of absent witness’ departure date or expected testimony, accused could not show prejudice from delay in commencement of trial, a factor in speedy trial analysis; moreover, even if accused could have shown prejudice due to absent witness, he would have been barred from doing so, as he raised prejudice from absent witness for first time on appeal.

       In determining whether violation of defendant’s constitutional right to speedy trial has occurred, defendant may be prejudiced by fact that he has been detained before trial, that he has suffered anxiety as result of delay, or that his defense has been impaired by delay.

      <p>
       In determining whether violation of defendant’s constitutional right to speedy trial has occurred, where incarceration is only ground raised by defendant as basis for prejudice, reversal generally will not be required. Johnson v. State, 666 So. 2d 784, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 616 (Miss. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       In determining whether defendant has been prejudiced by delay between arrest and trial such that violation of his constitutional right to speedy trial is implicated, impairment of defendant’s defense may occur as result of witnesses dying or disappearing or of loss of memory on part of witnesses.

      </p>
      <p>
       A defendant’s right to a speedy trial was not violated, even though 6 years elapsed between the date of indictment and the actual determination of the defendant’s habitual offender status, since habitual offender status is not a crime in and of itself, but is merely a status which enhances the sentence imposed for the conviction of an offense, and, therefore, the determination of habitual offender status is not an “offense” to which the right to a speedy trial would apply. Gray v. State, 605 So. 2d 791, 1992 Miss. LEXIS 481 (Miss. 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a constitutional speedy trial analysis, prejudice to the defendant may take several forms: (1) delay may prejudice the outcome of the defendant’s case; (2) prejudice may take the form of harm to the defendant’s personal interests, such as the debilitating effect of delay on the defendant’s financial, societal, and emotional circumstances; and (3) lengthy pretrial incarceration may be unnecessarily oppressive and may pose societal disadvantages, though a defendant’s assertion of prejudice attributable solely to incarceration, with no other harm, typically is not sufficient to warrant reversal. Ross v. State, 605 So. 2d 17, 1992 Miss. LEXIS 419 (Miss. 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       A 6-month delay between a mistrial and a retrial was not “presumptively prejudicial,” and therefore the defendant’s constitutional right to a speedy trial was not violated by the delay.

   Where defendant was tried 538 days after arraignment, and 264 days of the delay could be attributed against the State, there was no statutory violation under the guidelines set forth in Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.99.html#t99c17s99-17-1" target="_blank">99-17-1</a></cite>. Further, the delay could be attributed to continuances requested upon the motion of defendant’s attorneys, substitution of counsel, plea negotiations, ongoing discovery, and potentially the trial date being lost due to a crowded docket, and applying the balancing test to the four factors listed in Barker, and the conduct of the State and defendant, defendant’s constitutional right to a speedy trial was not denied. Summers v. State, 914 So. 2d 245, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 476 (Miss. Ct. App. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant was arrested on July 5, 2000, indicted one year later, and his trial commenced on April 2, 2002; because defendant was released on bond shortly after his indictment there was no oppressive pretrial detention after he was indicted. Further, at least part of the delay to trial, following his indictment, was attributable to the two continuances granted at defendant’s request; thus, there was no merit to defendant’s denial of a speedy trial claim as to the period of time following his indictment.

       A defendant’s constitutional right to a speedy trial was not violated, even though the length of the delay was 636 days, where the bulk of the delay was caused by the defendant’s frequent changes of counsel and his reneging on a plea agreement, the multitude of pretrial motions filed on the defendant’s behalf further contributed to the delay, the defendant made no assertion of his right other than a motion to dismiss the charges after the fact, and the defendant could not show tangible prejudice but relied only on the anxiety caused by incarceration and pending charges.

       A defendant was not denied his statutory or constitutional rights to a speedy trial, even though he was arrested on February 13, 1989, arraigned May 5, 1989, and his trial began March 5, 1990, where the defendant filed 15 motions before he was brought to trial which substantially contributed to the delay, the record supported the State’s position that it could not try the case until the issues of change of venue and admissibility of forensic DNA analysis had been resolved, and the defendant did not contend that the delay either diminished his defense or strengthened the State’s evidence, but stated only that he suffered “a great deal of anxiety.” Polk v. State, 612 So. 2d 381, 1992 Miss. LEXIS 820 (Miss. 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       A defendant’s constitutional and statutory rights to a speedy trial were not violated, even though the delay between the defendant’s arrest and trial was 378 days and the delay between arraignment and trial was 370 days, where only one of the delays–a continuance requested by the State solely for its prosecutorial tactical advantage–was attributable to the State, and, after calculating the delays caused by the defendant, he came to trial 164 days after his arrest and 156 days after his waiver of arraignment.

       Defendants did not suffer a deprivation of the right to a speedy trial, even though there was a 414-day delay between the date the defendants were arrested and the date of their trial, where a substantial part of the reason for the delay was that the defendants took no steps to secure counsel, and the delay did not operate to their substantial prejudice since there was no evidence of prejudice at trial and the defendants’ arrest resulted in their parole revocation and immediate incarceration to complete prior sentences, so that the defendants’ lives were not “put on hold” solely as a result of the delay.

       A defendant was not denied his constitutional right to a speedy trial, even though 574 days elapsed from the date of his arrest to the date of trial and he properly asserted his right to a speedy trial, where the delay was caused by an overcrowded trial docket and the county’s system of assigning each case to a particular judge as that case proceeded up to and through the trial process, and the defendant demonstrated no actual prejudice.

       An aggravated assault defendant was not denied his constitutional right to a speedy trial, even though there was a delay of more than 25 months between the date of his arrest and his trial and the State blamed part of the delay on an overcrowded docket which weighed against the State, where the defendant requested a continuance of an earlier trial date, the victim had to undergo several surgical treatments and it was several months before he was physically able to proceed with the case, the defendant did not raise the speedy trial issue until more than one and 1/2 years after his arrest, and the defendant failed to show any material prejudice as a result of the delay.

       A defendant was not denied his constitutional right to a speedy trial, even though the length of the delay between the defendant’s arrest and his trial was 334 days and the defendant asserted his right to a speedy trial in a timely manner, where most of the delay was attributable to ordinary lag from crowded dockets and court terms, and the defendant did not even attempt to show any particular prejudice resulting from the delay but merely maintained that he had increased anxiety due to the delay.

       A defendant’s right to a speedy trial was violated where 301 days elapsed between the day of arraignment and the day of the trial, and the case was continued twice by court order stating that “all cases not otherwise disposed of are hereby ordered continued to the next regular term of court.” Although docket congestion is “good cause” for delay in certain circumstances, the State never sought a continuance for this or any other reason, but instead relied on the “mass continuances” routinely made at the end of each court term.

   A defendant’s double jeopardy right not to be re-prosecuted for the same offense accrues instantly upon the happening of some event in criminal proceedings against him or her, though the original jeopardy must have “terminated” in order for such a right to accrue; thereafter, lapse of time neither strengthens nor diminishes the right as no subsequent event affects an accrued double jeopardy right.

       The double jeopardy clause did not bar reprosecution of a defendant for murder following the Supreme Court’s reversal of his conviction where the conviction was reversed on procedural grounds and the defendant was allowed to plead guilty to lesser offenses pursuant to the bargain, but the defendant subsequently refused to plead guilty to the lesser offenses. The defendant could be prosecuted for the murder under the original indictment since the reversal of his murder conviction on procedural grounds did not constitute a rendering of the case nor a discharge of the defendant, and the defendant’s refusal to plead guilty to the lesser offenses was a breach of the bargain.

       Since Mississippi’s capital sentencing procedure requires the jury to determine whether the State has proved its case for the death penalty, the double jeopardy clause will protect a defendant from any subsequent attempt to subject him or her to the death penalty after a jury has impliedly acquitted him or her of the death penalty by determining that only a life sentence was warranted. Lanier v. State, 635 So. 2d 813, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 165 (Miss. 1994), overruled in part, Twillie v. State, 892 So. 2d 187, 2004 Miss. LEXIS 1322 (Miss. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       The double jeopardy clause did not afford a capital murder defendant protection against further capital sentencing procedures where he was originally sentenced to death by a jury, the death sentence was subsequently reversed due to a confrontation clause problem but there was no finding that the State had failed to prove its case for the death penalty, and the defendant and the State then entered into a sentencing agreement which was found to be void; since there was no acquittal of the death penalty, the double jeopardy clause would not prohibit the State from seeking the death penalty at a subsequent sentencing hearing. Lanier v. State, 635 So. 2d 813, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 165 (Miss. 1994), overruled in part, Twillie v. State, 892 So. 2d 187, 2004 Miss. LEXIS 1322 (Miss. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       The prohibition against double jeopardy did not preclude the State at resentencing from enhancing a defendant’s life sentence for murder with the habitual offender statute where the defendant was initially sentenced to death and therefore his status as an habitual offender was not determined until after the sentencing trial on remand; since the defendant’s status as an habitual offender had not previously been determined, the finding of habitual offender status on resentencing was not barred by double jeopardy.

       Pursuant to automobile exception to warrant requirement, evidence seized without warrant from automobile is admissible if there is probable cause and exigency.

       Both probable cause and exigency prong of automobile exception to warrant requirement were satisfied, despite defendant’s claim that narcotics agents should have gotten search warrant in the several hours that passed between informant’s giving defendant informant’s car and defendant’s arrest; in recorded conversations, defendant had agreed to go out-of-state and get cocaine for informant, who had allegedly made similar transactions with defendant in past, and at time vehicle was stopped, nearness of state line and ease with which defendant could have fled agents’ jurisdiction made getting search warrant impracticable.

      <p>
       For purposes of exigency prong of automobile exception to warrant requirement, exceptional circumstances excusing issuance of warrant are: when vehicle searched is in motion; when officers have probable cause to believe vehicle contains contraband subject to search; and when it is impracticable to secure warrant because vehicle can and may be removed from jurisdiction.

       In a prosecution for possession of crack cocaine, the search of an automobile was not valid as a search incident to an arrest for driving with a suspended license where the police officer searched the car after the defendant had been frisked, handcuffed and placed in the back seat of the officer’s patrol car, and therefore the officer could have had no reasonable fear that the defendant might have had a weapon or could have been in a position to destroy incriminating evidence from the crime which led to his arrest.

       In a prosecution for possession of crack cocaine, the search of an automobile was not valid under the plain view exception to the search warrant requirement where the police officer entered the car to retrieve the keys, he saw an ordinary matchbox on the passenger seat and opened it to find only matches, and he then noticed another matchbox between the 2 front seats and opened it to find that it contained 9 rocks of crack cocaine; no incriminating evidence was visible at the time the officer entered the car, since the mere presence of a matchbox on the front seat of a car ordinarily cannot be termed an incriminating object in plain view.

       Substantial evidence existed to support a finding that probable cause existed for a warrantless search of a defendant’s automobile where there was probable cause to obtain a warrant to search the defendant’s home, and evidence found in the home provided probable cause to believe that a murder may have been committed in the home and that the victim’s body may have been placed in the automobile for transportation.

       A trial court did not err in overruling a capital murder defendant’s motion to exclude certain physical evidence seized from his automobile, even though the search was conducted pursuant to consent given by the defendant’s wife who may not have had mutual use of the car, since the police were reasonable in their belief that the wife had common authority, mutual use, and joint control over the car where the wife held title to the car, she told the police she owned the car and provided them with keys, and she never indicated that the car had been in the defendant’s sole possession.

       Police officers who set up a roadblock after receiving information that employees of two nearby factories were driving without licenses and who were checking all drivers did not violate defendant’s constitutional rights in stopping his automobile and detaining its occupants and, upon smelling the odor of burning marijuana emanating from defendant’s car, had probable cause to search it; the police officers were also authorized to seize the marijuana in defendant’s car where one of the officers observed a purse or bag in the lap of defendant’s wife with the corner of a plastic bag protruding therefrom in which he saw a green leafy substance that he suspected to be marijuana.

       An officer’s failure to inform the defendant that he had a right to refuse the officer’s request for a blood sample did not render the test results inadmissible in a manslaughter prosecution against the defendant where the officer had probable cause to obtain the blood sample in that the officer knew that the defendant was the driver of an automobile which had collided head on with another vehicle, the collision occurred on a straight and level highway when the road condition was dry, the officer knew that at least two people were dead in the vehicle which the defendant hit, the officer had observed a beer in the defendant’s vehicle, and the defendant had slurred speech and dilated pupils. For a search which would otherwise be illegal, absent consent, knowledgeable waiver of one’s constitutional right not to be searched is guaranteed by Article 3, § 23 of the Mississippi Constitution. However, blood searches which are based upon probable cause are not illegal, and, therefore, the question of the defendant’s knowledgeable waiver was not relevant. Longstreet v.

       In a prosecution for possession of a controlled substance, cocaine which had been discarded by the defendant was not the fruit of an illegal search and seizure, and was therefore properly admitted into evidence, since the defendant was not “seized or arrested” when he discarded the drugs where the defendant did not stop when police officers ordered him to do so for the purpose of checking his identification, and he threw down the cocaine while he was walking away from the officers; the defendant was not restrained or stopped at the time he discarded the cocaine, and therefore the cocaine was abandoned and not the fruit of an unlawful seizure or arrest.

       A warning advising a suspect “that anything he said might be used against him in a court of law” is constitutionally adequate; an officer is not required to advise a suspect of all specific possible criminal consequences.

       A defendant’s confession should not have been admitted into evidence where the confession was obtained by law enforcement officers after the defendant made a request for an attorney to the justice court judge who was considering binding him over to await the action of the grand jury, and one of the officers heard the defendant’s request. Although the defendant may only have meant that he wanted a lawyer for court proceedings and did not want a lawyer to advise him before being questioned about the crime, the officers did not seek to make such a determination, but simply proceeded to question the defendant, knowing that he was a cocaine addict and to some extent, because of such addiction, judgment-impaired at the time. No intelligent, knowing waiver of the right to counsel, which the defendant had expressed to the justice court judge, could be found from an officer testifying that he simply orally gave the defendant the Miranda warning.

When the accused asks for counsel, the officers may not resume interrogation until counsel has been provided, except where the accused voluntarily reinitiates the discussion of the charges. If the accused requests access to counsel, all officers of the prosecution force are bound thereby, including those who have no actual knowledge of the request. Kirkland v.

The defendant’s refusal to sign the waiver of rights form was not a per se invocation of his Fifth Amendment rights. Additionally, the defendant’s request for a mental health counselor was not a per se invocation of his Fifth Amendment rights; a request for someone other than an attorney does not invoke a defendant’s Fifth Amendment rights, and a mental health counselor is not qualified to protect a defendant’s Fifth Amendment rights. Similarly, neither the defendant’s request to speak to his mental health counselor nor his temporary refusal to sign the waiver form constituted a request for counsel so as to invoke his Sixth Amendment right.

       Defendant’s post-arrest statement, that victim “come out on me with a gun,” was sufficiently inconsistent with his trial testimony, that third-party shook defendant’s rifle and shooting was accidental, to establish that prosecutor’s comments on statement were designed and had effect of highlighting arguable inconsistency, rather than commenting improperly on defendant’s exercise of his right to remain silent.

       Where a defense witness invoked the Fifth Amendment, so that his testimony on direct-examination yielded nothing, the trial court erred in permitting the prosecutor to cross-examine the witness concerning a prior statement made by him; when the prosecutor, through the use of leading questions, parades before the jury the “testimony” of a silent witness, this violates the confrontation clause since the prosecutor cannot take the stand to be cross-examined by the defendant about the silent witness’ “testimony”.

       Although there is no constitutional requirement to examine the mental capacity of the defendant in making a determination as to whether a confession was voluntary, it remains true as a matter of evidence that before any confession is admissible, it must have been given by a person with enough intelligence to be a competent witness.

       The evidence was sufficient to support a finding that the defendant knowing, intelligently, and voluntarily waived his Miranda rights, even though the defendant had been drinking prior to his arrest, he had not slept for nearly 24 hours prior to waiving his rights, and he had periodic bouts of crying, where the defendant repeatedly acknowledged that he understood his Miranda rights and expressed this acknowledgment both orally and in writing, he was 49 years old, had a high school and vocational education, and considered himself to be a “very intelligent person,” his criminal past provided him with some experience and knowledge about a suspect’s Miranda rights, 5 witnesses testified that he did not appear to be impaired by alcohol and did not slur his speech, the defendant testified that he had been a chronic drinker, the defendant was for the most part calm and cooperative throughout the investigation and particularly at the moment he waived his rights, the defendant had meticulously schemed to “cover his tracks” to avoid arrest which reflected a coherent, unimpaired state of mind, and the defendant’s taped confession contained the admission that no one had “threatened,” “intimidated,” or “promised him anything.” Holland v. State, 587 So. 2d 848, 1991 Miss. LEXIS 648 (Miss. 1991).

       A defendant’s confession was not the product of mental deficiency, and therefore the defendant “knowingly” confessed, even though there was evidence that the defendant was mildly mentally retarded, where the defendant graduated from high school though he flunked 3 grades in school, there was no evidence that he was ever placed in special education classes, he admitted that he could read and write and that he understood the charges against him, and all who witnessed the interrogation said they saw no evidence that the defendant suffered mental abnormalities such that he could not understand the interrogation process or its consequences.

       Delay of approximately 24 hours between time of arrest and initial appearance before magistrate did not warrant suppression of confession given by defendant prior to initial appearance; defendant was arrested by warrant while he was already in jail, defendant was informed of his right to remain silent, his right to attorney, and his right to stop answering questions at any time and to ask for attorney, and defendant did not ask for appointment of counsel on charge for which he was arrested.

       The delay from the time of a defendant’s arrest until he was taken before a judicial officer did not violate Rule 1.04, Miss. Unif. Crim. R. Cir. Ct. Prac. and the 4th Amendment to the United States Constitution where his initial hearing was held within 48 hours of the time he was taken into custody for questioning, and there was no indication that the officers were purposely holding him in custody to gather sufficient evidence to justify his arrest; thus, his confession was not a product of any delay in taking him before a magistrate and was therefore admissible.

      </p>
      <p>
       The failure to provide a defendant with an initial appearance until five days after his arrest even though a judge was available at all times constituted reversible error where the defendant gave a confession in the absence of counsel and in violation of his right to counsel as a consequence of the delay, and the defendant’s conviction for capital murder was based entirely on his confession.

   Detention of accused without commitment is only one factor for consideration in reaching conclusion as to whether or not confession is free and voluntary, and it is only where confession is obtained as result of unreasonable delay in taking prisoner before magistrate for examination into his case that his admissions of guilt under such psychological pressure are inadmissible.

       The court rejected defendant’s claim that confessions were involuntary because (1) rights were read to defendant, (2) defendant acknowledged understanding those rights, (3) defendant exhibited no erratic behavior calling into question the voluntariness of a desire to confess, and (4) no evidence of police coercion was found, and thus there was no violation of U.S. Const. amend.

       Trial court did not err when it failed to suppress defendant’s statement where the State made out a prima facie case of voluntariness by demonstrating in the suppression hearing that contact was initiated by defendant and multiple Miranda warnings were given; the arresting officer testified as to the voluntariness of the statements and defendant made no attempt to refute the officer’s testimony.

       Generally, for confession to be admissible, it must have been given voluntarily and not given as result of promises, threats, or inducements. Morgan v. State, 681 So. 2d 82, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 429 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Finding that defendant understood his right to remain silent was supported by defendant’s testimony that he understood that he had right to stop answering questions and by videotape of confession showing that detective explained to defendant that he could stop answering questions at any time and have attorney appointed, which defendant indicated he understood.

      </p>
      <p>
       A defendant’s confession was freely and voluntarily given, and was therefore admissible into evidence in his murder trial, where law enforcement officers testified that he was given all the Miranda warnings prior to giving his confession and that he did not ask for an attorney at any time, he was familiar with his constitutional rights as evidenced by his refusal to sign a waiver form and the fact that he had previously been convicted of a felony, and his video-taped confession did not suggest any coercion.

       The principle enunciated in
   Agee v. State (1966, Miss.) 185 So. 2d 671 with respect to proving the voluntariness of a confession remains sound, but its importance to an accused has receded in view of the strong affirmative mandates of Miranda; only those persons who are claimed to have induced a confession through some means of coercion are required to be offered by the State as a witness under Agee.

   A trial court did not err in allowing a defendant’s statement to the police into evidence, in spite of the defendant’s argument that his statement was not voluntary because of his age, education, and intelligence, where the defendant was 17 years old at the time of his arrest and interrogation, he had an 8th grade education, his parents were uneducated, he had suffered head injuries as a young child which allegedly sometimes caused impairment of his mental faculties, and the arresting officers testified that the defendant was read his Miranda rights at least twice before any interrogation, he stated that he understood those rights and the waiver of those rights, and he stated that he did not have any trouble reading or writing.

      <p>
       A defendant’s waiver of his right to counsel and his right to remain silent when he executed a written waiver prior to confessing could not be found to be voluntary where his confession given immediately thereafter was involuntary due to improper collusion by law enforcement interrogators, since the defendant’s waiver of his right and his confession were inextricably bound and were the product of prolonged coercive police interrogation.

       Competency of confession should be ascertained preliminarily to its introduction before jury, and accused has right to take witness stand during such preliminary hearing and limit his testimony to facts bearing upon whether confession was free and voluntary, and his testimony is entitled to be considered and weighed, along with other evidence, by trial judge upon fact whether accused made confession freely and without hope of reward or fear of punishment, and defendant has right not to take stand and testify.

       Probationers and parolees do not “have, per se, a right to counsel at revocation hearings.” Whether probationers have a right to counsel must be answered “on a case-by-case basis in the exercise of a sound discretion by the state authority charged with responsibility for administering the probation and parole system.” Riely v.

       While it was error to not make a determination on whether a father was entitled to appointed counsel before allowing him to proceed pro se, the error was harmless because he was given a fair and adequate hearing, and the presence of an attorney would not have made a difference; the father received adequate notice of the pending adoption proceeding and was present and actively involved at all stages of the proceedings.

      </p>
      <p>
       In determining whether a trial court granted “self-representation” or “hybrid representation” to a defendant, and thus whether a waiver of the right to counsel was necessary, the factors to be considered include: (1) the defendant’s accessibility to counsel; (2) whether and how often the defendant consulted with counsel up to the point of the request; (3) the stage of trial at which the defendant requested a participatory role; (4) the magnitude of the role the defendant desired to assume; (5) whether the trial court encouraged immediate and constant accessibility of counsel; and (6) the nature and extent of assistance of counsel which had been provided up to the point of the request, including both substantive and procedural aid.

       A criminal defense counsel did not render constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel where the defendant requested during trial that the defense counsel be dismissed but the court denied the request, and thereafter the defendant acted pro se with the attorney present and ready and willing to assist the defendant in the case, and therefore the attorney, as stand-by counsel, was without authority, discretion or control.

      </p>
      <p>
       Defense counsel’s representation was not adversely affected by fact that he had previously represented government rebuttal witness in unrelated prosecutions, where counsel was not “suddenly curtailed” in his cross-examination when subject of prior deals with prosecutors arose but, rather, proceeded onward to question witness in detail about his motivation for prior testimony in another case as well as his motivation for testifying against defendant in the present case.

       Defendant was not prejudiced by any adverse performance of defense counsel due to fact that he had previously represented government rebuttal witness in unrelated prosecutions; even assuming that counsel conclusively established that witness’s sole motivation in testifying was to receive a reduced sentence pursuant to agreement with the State, there remained the vast amount of evidence presented during state’s case in chief.

       In a prosecution for conspiracy to distribute cocaine, a defendant’s constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel was violated due to an irreparable conflict of interest where the attorney who represented the defendant had also been counsel for the State’s main witness in the trial against the witness for the same offense.

       The right to effective assistance of counsel encompasses 2 broad principals–minimum competence and loyal assistance. The right to conflict free counsel is attendant to the Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel. It is incumbent upon courts which confront and which are alerted to possible conflicts of interest to take the necessary steps to ascertain whether the conflict warrants separate counsel. Thus, where a defense attorney represented 2 codefendants during the sentencing phase of the judicial proceedings and it could easily have been anticipated that the attorney would argue that the actions of one of the codefendants should not be attributed to the other or that the attorney would opt to not say or do anything in litigation for fear that to do so would characterize one codefendant as being more culpable than the other, the failure of the trial court to disclose to the codefendants the potential dangers of joint representation by counsel laboring under a conflict resulted in a violation of the right to effective assistance of counsel, and therefore a new sentencing hearing was warranted.

       Defendant’s capital murder convictions were proper where his Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights to counsel and to remain silent were not violated. He made no objection at trial; there was no testimony concerning defendant’s use of counsel or his right to remain silent; and the State’s questioning was designed solely to elicit a chronological version of the events involved in the investigation of the murders not the fact that the defendant requested an attorney during the State’s investigation.

   Defendant’s conviction for capital murder was proper where he was not denied his right to counsel because, at the time of his confession, he was merely a suspect who had been brought to the sheriff’s department for questioning and thus, his U.S. Const. amend. VI right to counsel had not yet attached. Further, as his confession occurred during a custodial interrogation, he had a U.S. Const. amends. V and XIV right to have counsel present, but the lower court found the testimony of the officers that defendant had not invoked his right to counsel more credible than defendant’s assertion that he had done so.

       Statements made by a defendant’s sister in the defendant’s presence that she intended to get an attorney were not sufficient to trigger the defendant’s right to counsel during police questioning and to preclude any subsequent waiver on his part where the record was devoid of any evidence that the defendant attempted to adopt, or even understood, the statements made by his sister.

       Requesting assistance of counsel at an initial appearance or bail hearing to defend a pending charge is not the same type of invocation of counsel contemplated by the Fifth Amendment Miranda-Edwards interest against compulsory self-incrimination, which is associated with police-initiated custodial interrogations; in order to invoke the Fifth Amendment right against compulsory self-incrimination, some “expression of a desire for the assistance of an attorney in dealing with custodial interrogation by the police” is required.

       An accused invoked her Fifth Amendment right to counsel at the time of her arrest when she asked for an attorney and stated that she was not going to sign any papers or answer any questions without having a lawyer present; the accused invoked her Sixth Amendment right to counsel and the state counterpart right secured by Article 3, § 26 of the Mississippi Constitution at her initial appearance when she indicated a desire for representation and an interest in contacting her family to ascertain their progress in hiring a lawyer for her.

       A defendant’s question during interrogation–“Don’t you think I need a lawyer?”–constituted an ambiguous request for an attorney, requiring the officers to cease interrogation except for that intended to clarify the defendant’s request. The officers’ response to the defendant’s ambiguous request, which culminated in the defendant’s decision to waive his rights, did not exceed constitutional parameters where the officers responded by twice explaining the defendant’s option to exercise his Miranda rights or to relate “his side of the story.” Holland v.

       Defendant’s right to counsel was violated by police-initiated interrogation after he asserted his right to counsel because an officer showed defendant the evidence file in an attempt to have him reconsider his request for counsel; a tactic that proved successful as defendant was not prompted to speak until he reviewed the evidence. Because the actions of the officer constituted police-initiated custodial interrogation, a valid waiver could not be established simply by showing that defendant responded to the interrogation.

       A trial court erred in admitting a defendant’s confession evidence since the confession was tainted by the constitutional violation of the defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to counsel and rights secured by Article 3, § 26 of the Mississippi Constitution, where the defendant “waived her rights” and made the confession after a sheriff department investigator and deputy initiated contact with her within less than 4 hours after she invoked the right to counsel at her initial appearance; the confession was also tainted by violation of the defendant’s Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment rights since the defendant had also requested a lawyer and declined to waive any rights at the time of her arrest.

       A trial court’s admission of a defendant’s confession into evidence violated the defendant’s Fifth and Fourth Amendment rights where the defendant had invoked her right to counsel and 2 officers subsequently told her that a codefendant had made a statement implicating her in their criminal activity, after which the defendant wrote a statement admitting to the crimes. The admission of the confession in violation of the defendant’s constitutional rights was not harmless error where the confession in question was the only confession available. Balfour v.

   When a suspect requests counsel while being informed of his or her rights, the police should complete the reading of the suspect’s rights, then ask the suspect to state clearly what he or she elects to do. If the suspect indicates that he or she wishes to remain silent, then the interrogation must cease. Berry v. State, 575 So. 2d 1, 1990 Miss.

       The explanation of lineup procedures did not constitute improper further interrogation of the defendant after he invoked his right to counsel, where the lineup procedures were not explained for the purpose of eliciting incriminating statements from the defendant, and the explanation of the lineup procedures did not constitute words or actions reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response.

       Only an actual confrontation with the defendant at a lineup is the critical stage which requires the right to counsel. Thus, the presence of counsel was not required at a post-lineup encounter between the witness and the police, at which the defendant was not present, since there was no “actual confrontation” between the defendant and the witness.

       Although it is true that the preliminary hearing in a criminal case is a critical stage in the legal proceedings requiring the aid of counsel, such determination should not be enlarged to include a transcript of the preliminary proceedings in the absence of statutory authority therefor and particularly so when it does not appear that the lack of a transcript prejudiced the defendant.

       It is the duty of the court to see that one accused of a capital crime is represented by counsel, and where it became known to the court prior to the beginning of the trial that counsel had not conferred and advised with the accused, the court should have taken appropriate steps to assure to the accused the advantage guaranteed by him under Code 1942 § 2505, and failure to do so was failure to follow the mandatory provisions of the statute and constituted a denial of due process.

       Under Code 1942 § 2505, the right of the accused to have counsel, and the requirement that such counsel shall have access to the accused, includes the right on the part of the accused to be represented by counsel who have conferred with him prior to trial so that his case may be properly prepared.

       In a case in which defendant argued that the trial court should have suppressed her statements because they were taken in violation of her constitutional right to counsel. The record supported a finding that defendant received the Miranda warning, that she knowingly and intelligently waived the rights, and that she freely and voluntarily made the statements, and, pursuant to the Davis decision, she failed to make an unambiguous, unequivocal request for an attorney.

       Even if an accused has procured an attorney, the accused may still waive the right to have the lawyer present during any police questioning; nothing in the Sixth Amendment prevents a suspect charged with a crime and represented by counsel from voluntarily choosing, on his or her own, to speak with police in the absence of an attorney. Mettetal v. State, 602 So. 2d 864, 1992 Miss. LEXIS 413 (Miss. 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       The evidence was sufficient to support a finding that a defendant had knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to assistance of counsel when he made a statement to the police, even though the defendant testified that he had repeatedly requested an attorney and was not provided with one, where the defendant admitted that he understood his rights, and all of his contentions that he had made repeated requests for counsel were specifically refuted by 3 law enforcement officers.

      <p>
       If a defendant has not asserted his or her Fifth Amendment right to counsel, the fact that the defendant is appointed counsel to protect his or her Sixth Amendment right does not preclude interrogation on unrelated offenses. As long as the defendant is given the Miranda warning and makes a knowing and voluntary waiver, any statements obtained during the interrogation are admissible. Willie v.

   A defendant knowingly and intelligently waived the right to counsel, and his subsequent statement was freely and voluntarily given, where the defendant initially invoked his constitutional right to counsel but indicated that he no longer wished to contact an attorney when given the opportunity to call, the defendant then indicated that he was willing to enter into a discussion of the crime, and the defendant was again advised of his Miranda rights, after which he confessed. The defendant “initiated” when he indicated that he no longer wished to telephone his attorneys; one cannot halt an inquiry by first indicating a desire to call an attorney, then declining to do so when offered the opportunity.

       A defendant was not denied effective assistance of counsel because he was not represented by counsel for approximately 2 months following his arraignment where he made no showing that he experienced any adverse effect or “untoward consequence flowing directly from denial of counsel” and there was no indication that the State took advantage of the situation or that any further proceedings were conducted.

       It is not per se professionally unreasonable for an attorney to allow a client to talk to the police and give a statement; where the evidence is otherwise overwhelming, confession may be a significant step toward prompt disposition of the case and mitigation of sentence. Thus, a defendant was not denied effective assistance of counsel on the ground that his attorney advised him to talk to the police, even though the attorney advised the defendant by telephone and did not go to the police station or further assist the defendant, where it appeared that the attorney “brought to bear independent scrutiny and judgment” before advising the defendant, and the evidence against the defendant was overwhelming.

       A defendant was not denied his right to effective assistance of counsel on the ground that his attorney gave the prosecution permission to interview the defense witnesses while allowing the prosecution to disallow the defendant from taking a deposition of the victim, since the defendant had no right to such a pre-trial deposition and the trial court lacked the authority to require the victim to talk with defense counsel where the victim was unwilling to do so; the defendant’s counsel could not be faulted as ineffective for failing to secure that which the defendant had no right to obtain.

       A defense attorney’s failure to object when a prosecution witness, who was a nurse, was sent into the jury room to attend to a juror who had become ill, did not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel where no allegation or facts were presented as to how the attorney’s failure to object resulted in any significant prejudice to the defendant at his trial.

   Ineffective assistance of counsel was not shown where defendant complained that counsel made absolutely no investigation of psychological evidence, while defendant submitted psychological evidence showing, inter alia, functional I.Q. of 73, lower academic I.Q., alcoholism, and genuine remorse for crime; as trial strategy, counsel could have judged that psychological report may have been harmful.

   Argument that counsel was ineffective based on opening statement conceding to jury that his client was guilty of crime charged in indictment was rejected because it may have been trial strategy. Candor at guilt phase may help defendant in sentencing phase because attorney who, while sincerely trying to help his client, at same time is open and honest with jury, is more likely to receive sympathetic and open ear in his other arguments. Counsel also argued crime was not capital murder and jurors must therefore return verdict of not guilty. Wiley v. State, 517 So. 2d 1373, 1987 Miss.

If you don’t want to sentence him to death, don’t let the District Attorney persuade you to” was reasonable trial strategy encouraging jurors to make up their own minds when determining penalties without being influenced by either party.

       A capital murder defendant was denied effective assistance of counsel at the penalty phase where his attorneys presented almost no facts in mitigation upon which the jury could have acted to spare the defendant’s life, they failed to make the most of the available evidence in mitigation, and in closing argument one of the defendant’s attorneys stated that the only way the jury could spare the defendant’s life was on “redeeming love,” which was not one of the factors which the jury could have considered under the court’s instructions. Woodward v. State, 635 So. 2d 805, 1993 Miss. LEXIS 442 (Miss. 1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       A defense counsel’s performance at the sentencing phase of a capital murder prosecution constituted ineffective assistance of counsel where the defendant faced a potential death penalty, and the defense counsel failed to conduct any investigation at all in a search for mitigation evidence; the defense counsel conducted little or no investigation into the defendant’s background, he spent negligible time interviewing the defendant and preparing a defense, he made no effort to contact or interview any potential character witnesses other than the defendant’s mother who was contacted only after the trial had commenced, and the lack of preparation left the defense counsel unable to blunt the prosecution’s forceful case. At a minimum, counsel has a duty to interview potential witnesses and to make an independent investigation of the facts and circumstances of the case; it is critical that mitigating evidence be presented at capital sentencing proceedings. Psychiatric and psychological evidence is crucial to the defense of a capital murder case, and there is a critical interrelation between expert psychiatric assistance and minimally effective representation. Thus, the defendant’s counsel was unreasonable in not pursuing psychological evidence in support of the defense that the defendant was under the domination of his accomplice where evidence was presented in the post-conviction proceeding that the defendant was immature, dependent and easily lead. State v. Tokman, 564 So. 2d 1339, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 232 (Miss. 1990).

   Argument that counsel was ineffective was without merit where counsel presented proof concerning defendant’s absence of criminal record, cooperation in investigation, his being model prisoner, and testimony of victim’s wife that defendant was non-violent. Wiley v. State, 517 So. 2d 1373, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2915 (Miss. 1987), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">486 U.S. 1036</cite>, <cite class="s_court">108 S. Ct. 2024</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">100 L.

       <p>
   Ineffective assistance of counsel was not shown concerning investigation of and failure to present mitigating circumstances where there was some mitigation by cross-examination and, strategically, it may be safer to obtain mitigating evidence from state’s witnesses than to risk aggravating evidence from witnesses called by defense. Additionally, trial counsel has no absolute duty to present mitigating evidence; strategic choices made after less than complete investigation are reasonable to extent that reasonable professional judgment supports limitations on investigation; court must apply heavy measure of deference to counsel’s judgments. Wiley v. State, 517 So. 2d 1373, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2915 (Miss. 1987), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">486 U.S. 1036</cite>, <cite class="s_court">108 S. Ct. 2024</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">100 L.

   Argument that counsel was ineffective for failing to explain to jury inapplicability and/or insignificance of aggravating circumstances and how to weigh aggravating and mitigating circumstances was rejected where counsel made excellent arguments as to aggravating circumstances, and closing argument contained variety of mitigating evidence.

   Argument that counsel should have requested presentence report in light of his failure to investigate mitigating evidence, was rejected as basis for ineffective assistance of counsel claim where question was counsel’s competence in not investigating and presenting mitigating evidence; if this was reasonable strategic choice, there was no need for investigation by other means.

   Counsel was not ineffective for failing to move for change of venue before guilt phase of trial because defense counsel is under no duty to make such motion, and thus this would fall into realm of trial strategy. Neither newspaper articles, nor anything else, indicated that, absent change of venue, defendant would lose right to fair trial. Wiley v. State, 517 So. 2d 1373, 1987 Miss.

       A defendant was not deprived of his constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel on the ground that his attorney failed to perfect a timely appeal where his attorney filed for a new trial and J.N.O.V., thereby protecting the defendant’s right of appeal to the Supreme Court.

   A capital murder defendant was not denied effective assistance of counsel on direct appeal by his attorney’s alleged failure to bring to the Supreme Court’s attention a plea bargain with an accomplice who testified as a witness, where the Supreme Court was well aware that the accomplice had been permitted to plead guilty to manslaughter and that he had been sentenced to 15 years’ imprisonment but had served only 2 1/2 years.

       Counsel for capital murder defendant was not ineffective for failing to investigate and develop fact of defendant’s low intelligence quotient, where absence of that evidence did not reasonably undermine confidence in outcome of trial, in that it was merely additional evidence of defendant’s mental aptitude, since counsel argued that defendant had very minimal education and deprived childhood.

       Defendants’ claim of ineffective assistance of counsel based on allegation that if they had known that their attorneys would not call any witnesses, they would have themselves testified, amounted to a sham, and therefore defendants were not entitled to evidentiary hearing to set aside validly imposed sentences based upon this claim, considering that, prior to testimony commencing, trial judge made detailed and lengthy presentation to defendants on subject of their right to testify and defendants affirmatively responded to judge’s questions as to whether they understood that they had right to testify regardless of what any other person wished or ordered them to do.

   Use of 1982 reapportionment plan, which had been found unconstitutional, rather than court-drawn plan or plan proposed by parties, was constitutional and could properly be used on interim basis in order that primary and general elections for state legislature could take place as scheduled prior to implementation of valid, permanent plan, despite fact that 1982 plan did not maximize members of majority black districts; because of swiftness with which population changes, and high cost of creating new election districts, and in view of lack of sufficient time to conduct full hearings and fact that proponents of one proposed plan failed to show that plan cured objections by United States Attorney General, and since possibility of corrective relief at later date existed, use was appropriate.

   Wholesale markup applied to liquor sold to federal military installations in Mississippi constituted a sales tax, the legal incidence of which rested upon instrumentalities of the United States as the purchasers, and therefore the markup was unconstitutional as a tax imposed upon the United States and its instrumentalities; The Twenty-First Amendment did not abolish federal immunity with respect to taxes on the sales of liquor to the concurrent jurisdiction bases. United States v. Tax Comm'n of Mississippi, <cite class="us_code">421 U.S. 599</cite>, <cite class="s_court">95 S. Ct. 1872</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">44 L.

       Since this Amendment allows the states constitutionally to prohibit the use of intoxicating liquor, it allows the states also to prohibit the possession of intoxicating liquor, since possession is an essential and vital part of the delivery or use of intoxicants.

   State liquor tax exemption for locally produced alcoholic beverages violates commerce clause because it has purpose and effect of discriminating in favor of local products, and tax is not saved by Twenty-First Amendment because tax violates central tenet of commerce clause without indication that it is useful in combating perceived evils of unrestricted traffic of liquor.

      Whenever the President transmits to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives his written declaration that he is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, and until he transmits to them a written declaration to the contrary, such powers and duties shall be discharged by the Vice President as acting President.

      <b>
       Section 4.—
      </b>
      Whenever the Vice President and a majority of either the principal officers of the executive departments or of such other body as Congress may by law provide, transmit to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives their written declaration that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, the Vice President shall immediately assume the powers and duties of the office as Acting President.
     </p>
     <p>
      Thereafter, when the President transmits to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives his written declaration that no inability exists, he shall resume the powers and duties of his office unless the Vice President and a majority of either the principal officers of the executive department or of such other body as Congress may by law provide, transmit within four days to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives their written declaration that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office. Thereupon congress shall decide the issue, assembling within forty-eight hours for that purpose if not in session. If the congress, within twenty-one days after receipt of the latter written declaration, or, if congress is not in session, within twenty-one days after congress is required to assemble, determines by two-thirds vote of both houses that the president is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, the vice president shall continue to discharge the same as acting president; otherwise, the president shall resume the powers and duties of his office.
