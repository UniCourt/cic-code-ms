      Any contract of sale for the future delivery of cotton, grain, stocks, or other commodities, which is to be settled according to or upon the basis of the public market quotations or prices made on any board of trade, exchange or similar institutions, upon which contracts of sale for future delivery are executed and dealt in without any actual bona fide execution and the carrying out or discharge of such contracts upon the floor of such exchange, board of trade or similar institution, in accordance with the rules thereof, shall be null and void and unenforceable in any court of this state, and no action shall lie thereon at the suit of any party thereto.

       Where the legislature passed a law authorizing brokers to transmit for execution contracts for sale for future delivery, the legislature did not intend to change the law providing that any contract of sale for future delivery of cotton made without any actual bona fide execution in carrying out such contract shall be void and unenforceable. Laird, Bissell & Meeds v. Capps, 224 Miss. 361, 80 So. 2d 49, 1955 Miss. LEXIS 500 (Miss. 1955).
      </p>
      <p>
       Sales of cotton futures, where there was no contemplation of actual delivery of cotton, were not valid despite the statute which authorized brokers to transmit for execution contracts for sale for future delivery. Laird, Bissell & Meeds v. Capps, 224 Miss. 361, 80 So. 2d 49, 1955 Miss. LEXIS 500 (Miss. 1955).
      </p>
      <p>
       A hedging contract contemplated by this section is void and can furnish no foundation upon which to predicate a civil claim for damages. Capps v. Postal Telegraph-Cable Co., 197 Miss. 118, 19 So. 2d 491, 1944 Miss. LEXIS 280 (Miss. 1944).
      </p>
      <p>
       Telegraph company is not liable for failure to send telegram to firm’s officer informing of sale of cotton by firm, delivery to be made at future date, for sole purpose of having officer make hedging contract with firm’s brokers on New York exchange to protect firm against any rise in price that the firm would have to pay for the cotton, since reliance on the holding contract, which is void under the statute, is essential to plaintiffs’ case. Capps v. Postal Telegraph-Cable Co., 197 Miss. 118, 19 So. 2d 491, 1944 Miss. LEXIS 280 (Miss. 1944).
      </p>
      <p>
       In brokers’ suit to recover money paid client under mistaken belief that margin of client was greater than needed, evidence as to whether contract between client and broker was gambling contract held for jury, even though contract had appearance of legality, and stated that actual delivery of commodities bought or sold was contemplated. Knox v. Clark, 177 Miss. 195, 171 So. 340, 1936 Miss. LEXIS 278 (Miss. 1936).
      </p>
      <p>
       Notwithstanding statute relating to contracts for future delivery of commodities according to rules of boards of trade or exchanges, formal contract is not conclusive where other evidence discloses that it was used as a means of dealing in futures. Alamaris v. John F. Clark & Co., 166 Miss. 122, 145 So. 893, 1933 Miss. LEXIS 329 (Miss. 1933).
      </p>
      <p>
       Intention of both parties to contract for future delivery that transaction was to be closed by settlement of difference between price when made and price at time of closing may be shown by what parties said and did in respect of contract. Alamaris v. John F. Clark & Co., 166 Miss. 122, 145 So. 893, 1933 Miss. LEXIS 329 (Miss. 1933).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where there is substantial evidence that will support inference that both parties did not intend actual delivery under contract for future delivery, question is for jury. Alamaris v. John F. Clark & Co., 166 Miss. 122, 145 So. 893, 1933 Miss. LEXIS 329 (Miss. 1933).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where evidence of seller of corn for future delivery on board of trade tended to show that neither seller nor brokers intended actual delivery but that cash settlement of difference between contract price and market price at time fixed for delivery should be made, direction of verdict for brokers was error. Alamaris v. John F. Clark & Co., 166 Miss. 122, 145 So. 893, 1933 Miss. LEXIS 329 (Miss. 1933).

       The sale of cotton on call did not constitute gambling in futures, where the cotton thus sold contemplated actual delivery and not a settlement alone on the market quotations, although it would be a gambling transaction if the real intent of the parties was simply to speculate on the rise and fall of prices, and the goods were not to be delivered.

   Mississippi courts cannot deny to a judgment of a Missouri court, based upon an award in arbitration the full faith and credit secured by U. S. Const. Art. 4 § 1, to the judgments of sister states, simply because the original controversy grew out of a gambling transaction in futures in Mississippi, a misdemeanor under Mississippi law, which further provide that contracts of that character shall not be enforced by any court. Fauntleroy v. Lum, <cite class="us_code">210 U.S. 230</cite>, <cite class="s_court">28 S. Ct. 641</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">52 L. Ed. 1039</cite>, 1908 U.S. LEXIS 1506 (U.S. 1908).

       Chancery Court has jurisdiction to hear and adjudicate controversy involving validity and effect of power of attorney, which has not been acknowledged and recorded in manner of conveyance of land, with respect to conveyance of real property situated in Republic of Greece where all parties reside in Mississippi and have been effectively subjected to in personam jurisdiction of Chancery Court; court may enter personal judgment, even though controlling substantive law is that of Greece; final adjudication would effectively bind parties in Mississippi and presumably in all other states even though adjudication may not be enforceable in Greece as matter of right and maybe not even as matter of comity.

       Parties to controversy involving validity and effect of power of attorney which has not been acknowledged and recorded in manner of conveyance of land with respect to conveyance of real property situated in Greece may stipulate to application and enforcement of Mississippi rules of law, rather than otherwise applicable Greek law; if parties do so, trial judge may proceed to adjudge all issues according to Mississippi law and enter final judgment which, subject to appeal, would be enforceable against parties in courts of Mississippi, even though, in Republic of Greece, judgment may not be enforceable. Kountouris v. Varvaris, 476 So. 2d 599, 1985 Miss. LEXIS 2245 (Miss. 1985).

       Power of attorney need not be acknowledged or recorded in manner of instrument of conveyance of interest in land in order to authorize attorney in fact to make contracts on behalf of principal and to deal with personal property in Mississippi in which principal holds interest.

       Before one empowered as attorney in fact may execute and deliver valid instrument of conveyance of interest in land in Mississippi prior in right to interests of (1) subsequent purchasers for value without notice or (2) subsequent judgment lien creditors, written power of attorney must be acknowledged and recorded in conformity with requirements generally applicable to instruments of conveyance of interests in land.

       Before court may resolve question of whether power of attorney which has not been acknowledged and recorded in manner provided for instruments of conveyance of interests in land is valid and enforceable with respect to real property located in Republic of Greece, Greek law must be consulted to determine whether there is conflict between laws of Mississippi and those of Greece with respect to real property and powers of attorney.

       When an attorney-in-fact is prohibited from giving himself gifts from the principal’s property, extrinsic evidence of the principal’s intent to allow such gifts is not admissible, and while nothing prohibits a principal from expressly authorizing such gifts in writing, the attorney-in-fact cannot rely on an alleged oral authorization where the power of attorney itself expressly prohibits such gifts; the decedent’s alleged oral statements to her relative could not negate the express terms of her power of attorney that prohibited the relative from recognizing any personal gain, and any such transaction was void ab initio.

       Where a son signed an arbitration agreement on the son’s mother’s behalf when the mother was admitted to a nursing home, the son brought a wrongful death action against defendants, and defendants sought to compel arbitration, the son lacked actual authority to sign the arbitration agreement on the mother’s behalf because no power of attorney was executed, and the Mississippi Supreme Court would regard the informal proof of authority in this case to be clearly insufficient to establish an express agency under Mississippi law. Gross v. GGNSC Southaven, LLC, 83 F. Supp. 3d 691, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14071 (N.D. Miss. 2015), vacated, 817 F.3d 169, 2016 U.S. App. LEXIS 4749 (5th Cir. Miss. 2016).

       Trial court did not err in failing to enforce an arbitration provision contained within an admission agreement entered into between a nursing home and a resident’s daughter who assertedly operated under a power of attorney because only an unauthenticated copy of the power of attorney appeared in the record.

       The joint owner of three certificates of deposit was entitled to them by right of survivorship where the decedent’s attorney in fact under a power of attorney placed the joint owner’s name on the certificates of deposit, the attorney in fact and the joint owner never shared a confidential relationship while the attorney in fact acted for the decedent, and there was no evidence that the attorney in fact acted in bad faith.

       Relative violated the power of attorney (POA) by making herself a joint owner of certain funds, and she personally benefitted from another transaction, and thus the estate was entitled to recover these certificate of deposit; however, as to another, the decedent had made the relative an owner of the account, and thus the relative did not personally gain from purchasing the new certificate of deposit and she only merely moved funds, and thus the funds attributable to those certificates of deposit were not tainted by any violation of the POA.

     <p>
      As to acts undertaken in good faith reliance thereon, an affidavit executed by the attorney in fact under a power of attorney, durable or otherwise, stating that he did not have at the time of exercise of the power actual knowledge of the termination of the power by revocation or of the principal’s death, disability, or incapacity is conclusive proof of the nonrevocation or nontermination of the power at that time. If the exercise of the power of attorney requires execution and delivery of any instrument that is recordable, the affidavit when authenticated for record is likewise recordable. This section does not affect any provision in a power of attorney for its termination by expiration of time or occurrence of an event other than express revocation or a change in the principal’s capacity.

       Where a contract under which a landowner agreed to be obligated to a lender for the debts of his tenant, was one of guaranty rather than suretyship, and further provided that the lender was not bound to exhaust its recourse against the tenant before being entitled to payment from the landowner, the landowner’s demand that the lender proceed against the tenant did not affect its liability for the unpaid loans.

       Where mortgagee looked to others than mortgagors for payment of indebtedness for ten years after conveyance by mortgagors to purchasers who assumed indebtedness, gave no notice to mortgagor of invalid foreclosure proceeding, and allowed principal and interest to remain in default for several years without suit, mortgagor held not discharged as surety for her grantees, because of mortgagee’s want of diligence, especially where mortgagor made no attempt to put creditor in default under statute. North American Life Ins. Co. v. Smith, 178 Miss. 238, 172 So. 135, 1937 Miss. LEXIS 175 (Miss. 1937).

      </p>
      <p>
       A judgment discharging a surety by reason of his release, under this section, if such judgment is not appealed from, will bar a proceeding for contribution by a co-surety held liable in the same judgment, and the discharge of one surety does not discharge his co-sureties.

      When any surety or guaranty company has executed any bond or other contract as surety for any person, company or corporation, guaranteeing the performance of any duty or the payment of any money, and such person, company or corporation make default therein and said surety or guaranty company pays the amount for which the party insured or guaranteed is legally liable, the said surety or guaranty company becomes thereby subrogated to all the rights of the party in whose favor the security or guaranty is given, and such company may have and maintain an action against the principal in its own name to recover the amount paid out in satisfaction thereof.

       In addition to paying a premium, the recipient of an indemnity bond must also prove to the surety company that he has adequate assets to permit recovery of some portion of the loss if the bond is ever called upon since a surety may seek reimbursement from the principal after payment on a bond. First Southwest Corp. v. Lampton, 724 So. 2d 988, 1998 Miss. App. LEXIS 1060 (Miss. Ct. App. 1998).

       General contractor would be granted relief from stay to assert setoff against prepetition obligations to debtor where general contractor was obliged to pay debtor’s materialmen on project. In re E & D Electric Co., 68 B.R. 3, 1986 Bankr. LEXIS 5907 (Bankr. S.D. Miss. 1986).

      <p>
       A surety’s right of subrogation is unaffected by the filing requirements of the Uniform Commercial Code, since the assignment in a bond application is in aid of an equitable right but does not create that right, and the rights of the surety to subrogation for its losses are founded upon equitable principles independent of any assignment of contract proceeds in the application of the contractor. Travelers Indem. Co. v. Clark, 254 So. 2d 741, 1971 Miss. LEXIS 1270 (Miss. 1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       A surety’s right to subrogation for amounts paid to materialmen and laborers was not limited to the 10 percent retainage provided for in the construction contract, the contractor’s performance of which was guaranteed by the surety, but instead whatever funds were in the hands of the contractor’s debtors under such contract at the time of the appointment of a receiver for the contractor should be made available to the surety to the extent necessary to indemnify the surety for losses sustained on the construction project involved. Travelers Indem. Co. v. Clark, 254 So. 2d 741, 1971 Miss. LEXIS 1270 (Miss. 1971).

       In an action against a municipal policeman and the surety upon his official bond for assault upon the plaintiff by the policeman, the trial court did not err in refusing to instruct that the surety company would not be liable for anything unless the policeman was first liable and, if the surety was required to pay any part of the judgment, then the individual defendant would be obligated to reimburse the surety for that amount. Vanderslice v. Shoemake, 233 Miss. 523, 102 So. 2d 804, 1958 Miss. LEXIS 411 (Miss. 1958).

      If a judgment or decree be rendered by any court against a principal debtor and his surety, or against his sureties, and one or more of his sureties shall pay and satisfy the judgment or decree, the same shall, by operation of law, be thereby transferred and assigned to the surety or sureties paying and satisfying it, who shall have all the liens and equities of such judgment or decree and of the debt or claim on which the same is founded, which the creditor therein had. The surety, on making affidavit of his suretyship, and of his having paid the judgment or decree, and filing the affidavit and any evidence of such payment that he may hold, with the officer authorized to issue execution on the judgment or decree to whom he may apply for execution, shall be entitled to have execution issued on the judgment or decree, in the name of the plaintiff or complainant against the defendants therein, as if the judgment or decree had not been paid and satisfied. The officer issuing the execution shall indorse thereon that it is issued for the use of the surety who paid the judgment or decree; and the officer serving it shall collect the money, for the use of the surety, from the principal debtor, if he be a party to the judgment or decree and the money can be made out of him; and, if not, he shall collect a ratable proportion of the money from each of the co-sureties.

       Sureties on the replevin bond of a claimant of goods under attachment, who are the beneficiaries in a deed of trust made to indemnify them against loss by reason of their suretyship, have no right to enforce the deed of trust until a judgment has been rendered against the claimant and paid by them, and in the absence of such right the attaching creditor cannot be subrogated thereto.

    Proportional payment of subcontractors; penalty for late payment.

     </h3>
     <p>
      When a contractor receives any payment from the owner under a construction contract, other than a public construction contract, the contractor shall, upon receipt of that payment, pay each subcontractor and material supplier in proportion to the percentage of work completed by each such subcontractor and material supplier. If for any reason the contractor receives less than the full payment due from the owner, the contractor shall be obligated to disburse on a pro rata basis those funds received, with the contractor, subcontractors and material suppliers each receiving a prorated portion based on the amount due on the payment. If the contractor without reasonable cause fails to make any payment to his subcontractors and material suppliers within fifteen (15) days after the receipt of payment from the owner under the construction contract, the contractor shall pay to his subcontractors and material suppliers, in addition to the payment due them, a penalty in the amount of one-half of one percent (1/2 of 1%) per day of the delinquency, calculated from the expiration of the fifteen-day period until fully paid. The total penalty shall not exceed fifteen percent (15%) of the outstanding balance due. The provisions of this section shall not be applicable to contracts for the construction of single-family dwellings.

       When a contract calls for one (1) party to reimburse the other party for the federal manufacturer’s excise tax levied by 26 USCA4081 through 26 USCA4083, whether as a separate item or as part of the price, the party required to make the reimbursement may tender payment for the taxes one (1) business day before the time that the other party is required to remit the taxes to the United States Internal Revenue Service.
