     </h3>
     <p>
      The municipal corporations existing in this state are divided into three classes, to wit: cities, towns and villages. Those having two thousand inhabitants or more shall be classed as cities; those having less than two thousand and not less than three hundred inhabitants shall be classed as towns; and those having less than three hundred and not less than one hundred inhabitants shall be classed as villages. No municipal corporation shall be created hereafter except those classed as cities or towns. However, a municipality may be created in an area embracing not less than one square mile wherein there is then in existence or under construction not less than one mile of improved hard surface streets, with a total of not less than six streets making up said one mile of hard surface streets and there then exists or is under construction a public utilities system which shall include a waterworks system or sewerage system, or both. Nothing herein shall affect the status of any municipal corporation heretofore created and now existing, and all such municipal corporations, including villages, shall continue to exist as such with all the rights and privileges thereof.

       The chancellor cannot pass upon question of public convenience and necessity of enlargement of municipality, inasmuch as that is a legislative question for municipal board in adopting the extension ordinance. In re Extension of Boundaries, 217 Miss. 860, 217 Miss. 876, 65 So. 2d 832, 1953 Miss. LEXIS 503 (Miss. 1953).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a petition for adoption of city ordinance seeking enlargement of municipal boundaries literally complied with the statute, it was not necessary to allege in the petition that the ordinance was published as required by law. In re Extension of Boundaries, 217 Miss. 860, 217 Miss. 876, 65 So. 2d 832, 1953 Miss. LEXIS 503 (Miss. 1953).
      </p>
      <p>
       Question of reasonableness of enlargement of municipality is a judicial question and determination is a proper exercise of judicial function. In re Extension of Boundaries, 217 Miss. 860, 217 Miss. 876, 65 So. 2d 832, 1953 Miss. LEXIS 503 (Miss. 1953).
      </p>
      <p>
       City ordinance which sets forth the improvements to be made in the annexed territory, describing them in general terms, and providing that they would be made when necessary and economically feasible, sufficiently complied with statutory requirement that ordinance shall in general terms describe improvements to be made in manner and extent thereof. In re Extension of Boundaries, 217 Miss. 860, 217 Miss. 876, 65 So. 2d 832, 1953 Miss. LEXIS 503 (Miss. 1953).

       A Mississippi municipality acting under the commission form of government has all the powers possessed by other municipalities, except as otherwise provided by statute. Independent Paving Co. v. Bay St. Louis, 74 F.2d 961, 1935 U.S. App. LEXIS 3576 (5th Cir. Miss. 1935).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a municipality comes under the operation of this chapter, all of its powers under its original charter cease except such as are kept alive by the provisions of this chapter. Harris v. Water Valley, 78 Miss. 659, 29 So. 401, 1900 Miss. LEXIS 152 (Miss. 1900).
      </p>
      <p>
       The manifest purpose of this chapter was that all municipalities should come under it and thus have uniformity in the charter powers of municipalities according to their several classes, but the right of election was given the municipalities then existing not to come under the provisions of the chapter by resolution of corporate authority to be certified to the secretary of state. Resolution without certification as directed is insufficient. State ex rel. Shields v. Govan, 70 Miss. 535, 12 So. 959, 1893 Miss. LEXIS 46 (Miss. 1893).
      </p>
      <p>
       When a statute primarily refers to matters foreign to the ordinary functions of public corporations and imposes burdens or liabilities on persons without any corresponding benefits, the word “persons” will not be held to embrace municipal corporations exercising a part of the state’s sovereignty. Dollman v. Moore, 70 Miss. 267, 12 So. 23, 1892 Miss. LEXIS 84 (Miss. 1892).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a municipality against which as garnishee, a decree has been rendered in an attachment suit against a non-resident, fails to object to the garnishment, the objection not being jurisdictional cannot be made by the defendant in attachment on appeal. Dollman v. Moore, 70 Miss. 267, 12 So. 23, 1892 Miss. LEXIS 84 (Miss. 1892).

   Section<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t21c01s21-1-33" target="_self">21-1-33</a></cite>, rather than §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t21c01s21-1-13" target="_self">21-1-13</a></cite>, is a controlling statute where a petition is filed to confirm the annexation of territory to a municipality. McElhaney v. Horn Lake, 501 So. 2d 401, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2272 (Miss. 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       Some factors to be considered in determining whether public convenience and necessity require incorporation are: the governmental services presently provided; the quality and adequacy of all services provided; the services expected from other sources; the impairment of an immediate vested right in an adjoining city; the substantial or obvious need justifying incorporation. City of Pascagoula v. Scheffler, 487 So. 2d 196, 1986 Miss. LEXIS 3105 (Miss. 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       The determination as to whether the incorporation of a new municipality is reasonable is for the trial court. City of Pascagoula v. Scheffler, 487 So. 2d 196, 1986 Miss. LEXIS 3105 (Miss. 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       The requirements for a petition to incorporate are not necessarily the same as the requirements for an ordinance extending the boundaries of an existing municipality, the legislature having dealt with the two situations in separate statutes. Boling v. Jackson, 258 So. 2d 443, 1972 Miss. LEXIS 1504 (Miss. 1972).

      </h4>
      <p>
       <p>
   Failure of incorporators to include page three when they filed a first petition for incorporation was a clerical error and not a failure to comply with the specific requirements of Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t21c01s21-1-13" target="_self">21-1-13</a></cite>; incorporation pleadings were amendable pursuant to Miss. R. Civ. P. 15. City of Jackson v. Byram Incorporators, 16 So.3d 662, 2009 Miss. LEXIS 145 (Miss. 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       Petitioners for incorporation were in substantial compliance in showing the assessed valuation of real property in the area sought to be incorporated, and contradiction between the pleading, showing an assessment of $17,755,488, and the proof, showing $13,362,275 assessed valuation, was decided by the chancellor who was not in manifest error. City of Pascagoula v. Scheffler, 487 So. 2d 196, 1986 Miss. LEXIS 3105 (Miss. 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Mississippi Code §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t21c09s21-9-15ol12" target="_self">21-9-15(2)</a></cite> was inapplicable to render defective a petition seeking to establish in Jackson County a new municipality, with a form of government consisting of a mayor and five council members. City of Pascagoula v. Scheffler, 487 So. 2d 196, 1986 Miss. LEXIS 3105 (Miss. 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       Petitioners for municipal incorporation have burden of proving the sufficiency of their petition. Boling v. City of Jackson, 279 So. 2d 590 (Miss. 1973); City of Pascagoula v. Scheffler, 487 So. 2d 196, 1986 Miss. LEXIS 3105 (Miss. 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       A petition for incorporation which stated, inter alia, that such incorporation would permit the providing of fire and police protection, that the proposed municipal corporation would enact ordinances to correct health problems created by inferior sewer systems, that other ordinances would be enacted relating to electrical standards, plumbing standards, and building code standards, and that improved sanitation and garbage disposal within the incorporated territory would be provided, fully met the requirement of the statute that the petition set forth the municipal and public services which the municipal corporation proposed to render. Boling v. Jackson, 258 So. 2d 443, 1972 Miss. LEXIS 1504 (Miss. 1972).
      </p>
      <p>
       A petition by qualified electors for incorporation of a new municipality failed to comply with the requirements of the statute and would be dismissed where it consisted of a so-called extended petition containing the required allegations, and numerous so-called short petitions which the extended petition undertook to incorporate and which, while they contained the signatures of an alleged two-thirds of the territory’s qualified electors, failed to comply with other statutory requirements such as setting forth the number of inhabitants of the territory, stating with reasonable definiteness the petitioners’ aims in seeking incorporation, and describing the territory to be incorporated in metes and bounds. City of Jackson v. Boling, 241 So. 2d 359, 1970 Miss. LEXIS 1336 (Miss. 1970).

      <p>
       In determining the number of qualified electors in area sought to be incorporated to ascertain that requisite percentage thereof have signed petition, resort to registration and poll books is permissible but, since these records require updating to reflect changes, resort to other sources to supplement them is not impermissible. City of
   Pascagoula v. Scheffler, 487 So. 2d 196, 1986 Miss. LEXIS 3105 (Miss. 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       In determining whether two thirds of the qualified electors were in favor of a proposed incorporation, the chancellor should have considered the fact that a number of the signers of the original petition had asked to have their names withdrawn; one can withdraw from a petition at any time prior to the determination of the hearing.
   Myrick v. Incorporation of a Designated Area into Municipal Corp. to be Named Stringer, 336 So. 2d 209, 1976 Miss. LEXIS 1501 (Miss. 1976).
      </p>
      <p>
       In seeking the incorporation as a municipality of an unincorporated area, it is essential under subdivision (3) that the petition be signed by at least two-thirds of the qualified electors residing in the territory proposed to be incorporated, and where the original petition contains less than the required number of petitioners, this defect cannot be remedied by amendments thereafter filed including the names of additional petitioners. Bridges v. Biloxi, 250 Miss. 717, 168 So. 2d 40, 1964 Miss. LEXIS 492 (Miss. 1964).

     <p>
      After the filing of said petition, and upon request therefor by the petitioners, the chancellor shall set a day certain, either in term time or in vacation, for the hearing of such petition and notice shall be given to all persons interested in, affected by, or having objections to the proposed incorporation, that the hearing on the petition will be held on the day fixed by the chancellor and that all such persons will have the right to appear and enter their objections, if any, to the proposed incorporation. The said notice shall be given by publication thereof in some newspaper published or having a general circulation in the territory proposed to be incorporated once each week for three consecutive weeks, and by posting a copy of such notice in three or more public places in such territory. The first publication of such notice and the posted notice shall be made at least thirty days prior to the day fixed for the hearing of said petition, and such notice shall contain a full description of the territory proposed to be incorporated. However, if any of the territory proposed to be incorporated is located within three miles of the boundaries of an existing municipality, then such existing municipality shall be made a party defendant to such petition and shall be served with process in the manner provided by law, which process shall be served at least thirty days prior to the date set for the hearing.

       Circuit Court properly granted summary judgment in favor of a city because a lessee was not entitled to compensation where the city notified the lessee that it could no longer sell fireworks on newly annexed land, the regulation of fireworks sales was considered a police power, and the pre-existing-use doctrine and/or grandfathering was not applicable to ordinances relating to police powers, and the regulation of fireworks sales was considered a police power.

   Objectors to the annexation contended that the city failed to prove that adequate notice was given. However, in the affidavit filed by the city, the affiant specifically stated the exact locations and dates of his postings of notice of the hearings in his affidavit as required by Miss. R. Civ. P. 4(f) and Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t21c01s21-1-15" target="_self">21-1-15</a></cite> and Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t21c01s21-1-31" target="_self">21-1-31</a></cite>; the chancellor did not commit manifest error by allowing the detailed affidavit to constitute adequate proof of notice.

      </p>
      <p>
       Since notice to a nearby existing municipality is statutorily required before incorporation, and statute further provides that all persons interested in, affected by, or objecting to an incorporation, shall be noticed, city of Pascagoula was a “person” entitled to object to all facets of a hearing to incorporate a nearby unincorporated area.

   Proper notice was not posted in the territory annexed, as required by §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t21c01s21-1-15" target="_self">21-1-15</a></cite>, where notice was posted only within the already existing corporate boundaries of the municipality that initiated the annexation process, and not within the territory sought to be annexed, notwithstanding assertions that notice was posted in three public places within the existing municipality, and that there were no public places located within the territory to be annexed other than a public school, which was in vacation when the notices were posted.

   In an action to confirm a city’s proposed annexation of territory, the returns of the deputy sheriff who posted the notices thereof were sufficient to comply with the statute regarding proof of posting of notice, even though there was no affidavit attesting to the posting. In re Extension of Boundaries, 365 So. 2d 952, 1978 Miss. LEXIS 2431 (Miss. 1978), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">441 U.S. 946</cite>, <cite class="s_court">99 S. Ct. 2167</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">60 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 1049, 1979 U.S. LEXIS 1858 (U.S. 1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Notice requirements of this statute, being in lieu of personal service and thus necessitating strict compliance, were not shown to have been met where there was no affidavit or attempted other proof that notices had been posted, and provisions of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.13.html#t13c01s13-1-145" target="_blank">13-1-145</a></cite> [Repealed] that, when posting of notice is required, such may be proved by affidavit, was thus not satisfied; since notice requirements of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t21c01s21-1-15" target="_self">21-1-15</a></cite> are mandatory and jurisdictional, failure to comply required dismissal of petition for incorporation. 336 So. 2d 209.

       Where the statutes providing for a hearing on a petition to create a municipal corporation, and to objections to such petition, extend the right to objectors to personally appear at the hearing on the merits and to present their objections orally, the published notice of the hearing could not limit such right.

     </h3>
     <p>
      At the time fixed, the chancellor shall proceed to hear all evidence offered in support of said petition, together with all objections, if any, that may be presented touching or bearing upon the question of whether or not the proposed incorporation is reasonable and is required by the public convenience and necessity. The chancellor shall have the power, however, to grant such reasonable continuances as justice may require. If the chancellor finds from the evidence that the proposed incorporation is reasonable and is required by the public convenience and necessity, then he shall enter a decree declaring such municipal corporation to be created as requested in such petition, which decree shall give an accurate description of the territory included in such municipal corporation, shall classify such municipal corporation according to law, and shall set forth the names of the persons which the petitioners desire as officers of such municipality. The chancellor shall have the power, however, in granting any such incorporation to grant same in whole or in part by modifying or decreasing the territory to be included within such municipal corporation. If the chancellor finds from the evidence that the proposed incorporation is not reasonable and is not required by the public necessity and convenience, then a decree shall be entered denying such incorporation. Whenever any municipal corporation shall be created as herein provided, a map or plat of the boundaries of such municipal corporation shall be filed with the chancery clerk and shall be recorded by him in the official plat book of the county. The decree of the chancellor, either creating or denying such incorporation, shall become effective after the passage of ten days from the date of such decree, unless an appeal be taken therefrom as is provided in Section 21-1-21.

       Supreme Court, in reviewing chancellor’s findings about whether proposed municipal incorporation is required by considerations of public convenience and necessity and is reasonable, must merely determine whether the findings were supported by substantial credible evidence, and should reverse only if findings are manifestly in error. Incorporation of Oak Grove v. City of Hattiesburg, 684 So. 2d 1274, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 679 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Substantial evidence regarding police protection, traffic control, sewage systems, fire service, and business owners’ concerns supported chancellor’s finding that considerations of public convenience and necessity did not require granting petition for municipal incorporation of semirural residential area that petitioners brought after nearby city unsuccessfully attempted to annex the area, especially considering that area was large and sparsely populated, that incorporation effort was largely defensive measure against annexation, and that chancellor’s findings were consistent with findings made in prior proceeding concerning the annexation attempt. Incorporation of Oak Grove v. City of Hattiesburg, 684 So. 2d 1274, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 679 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Size and population density of semirural residential area whose land mass measured 40 square miles but whose population was only around 10,000 citizens presented logistical problems of such enormity as to make it unreasonable to grant petition for municipal incorporation of the area, within meaning of statute governing municipal incorporation, which requires that such incorporation be “reasonable.” Incorporation of Oak Grove v. City of Hattiesburg, 684 So. 2d 1274, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 679 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancellor ruling on petition for municipal incorporation of semirural residential area whose land mass measured 40 square miles but whose population was only around 10,000 citizens did not abuse his discretion in denying petition rather than “narrowing down” the proposed incorporation area, where testimony at trial was more than sufficient to indicate that there was no real public necessity to incorporate the area even assuming that reasonable, smaller municipality could be carved out, especially considering that petitioners failed to present proposal for viable municipality. Incorporation of Oak Grove v. City of Hattiesburg, 684 So. 2d 1274, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 679 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Proceeding on petition for municipal incorporation of semirural residential area was not proper forum for school district to argue that denial of petition would adversely affect district by leading to future annexation of area by nearby city and concomitant inclusion of annexed area in the nearby city’s own school district; rather, proper forum would be proceeding on any future annexation petition filed by the nearby city. Incorporation of Oak Grove v. City of Hattiesburg, 684 So. 2d 1274, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 679 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       In determining whether two thirds of the qualified electors were in favor of a proposed incorporation, the chancellor should have considered the fact that a number of the signers of the original petition had asked to have their names withdrawn; one can withdraw from a petition at any time prior to the determination of the hearing. Myrick v. Incorporation of a Designated Area into Mun. Corp. to be Named Stringer, 336 So. 2d 209 (Miss. 1976).
      </p>
      <p>
       Legislation authorizing creation of utility district did not encroach upon or restrict trial court’s discretion so that it was in any way prevented from decreasing the size of the incorporated territory if it were determined that public convenience and necessity dictated a smaller area. Hamilton v. Incorporation of Petal, 291 So. 2d 190, 1974 Miss. LEXIS 1725 (Miss. 1974).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Incorporation was justified pursuant to §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t21c01s21-1-17" target="_self">21-1-17</a></cite> where parties stipulated that citizens of area would be convenienced thereby, and circumstances disclosed were more than sufficient to establish public necessity, particularly in view of need for police and fire protection, public health and education, in a burgeoning area. Hamilton v. Incorporation of Petal, 291 So. 2d 190, 1974 Miss. LEXIS 1725 (Miss. 1974).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Argument that trial court in assuming jurisdiction of annexation proceedings by municipality and consolidating them with incorporation proceedings of residents of community placed an undue burden upon the would-be incorporators causing them to not only prove the reasonableness of the incorporation pursuant to statutory requirements, but also burdened them with refuting the reasonableness of the city’s annexation proceedings, thereby confusing the issue by combining causes of action which were the antithesis of each other, was technically well-founded; however since under the statutes appertaining to either incorporation or annexation the issue basic to each was whether it was reasonable and required by public convenience and necessity, and since the trial court’s opinion conclusively indicated that it was formulated from the evidence before it with the statutory issues clearly in mind, the consolidation, under the circumstances was not prejudicial error. In re Incorporation of Forest Hill, 280 So. 2d 837, 1973 Miss. LEXIS 1496 (Miss. 1973), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">414 U.S. 1130</cite>, <cite class="s_court">94 S. Ct. 869</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">38 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 755, 1974 U.S. LEXIS 1446 (U.S. 1974).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where there was an urgent need for the incorporation of the Pearl area into a municipality so that the community could cope with the problems of police protection, garbage, fire protection, drug control, health hazards, recreation, sanitation, street improvement and zoning, and the City of Jackson could not lawfully incorporate or annex the area inasmuch as the Rankin County board of supervisors had refused consent to do so and there was no indication that there would be any change on the part of the board, the chancellor erred in holding that incorporation would be unreasonable because the costs of operating the proposed municipality would be prohibitive. Boling v. City of Jackson, 279 So. 2d 590 (Miss. 1973).
      </p>
      <p>
       The chancellor correctly permitted two individuals to intervene as objectors to a petition to create a municipality by incorporation. Boling v. Jackson, 258 So. 2d 443, 1972 Miss. LEXIS 1504 (Miss. 1972).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the statutes providing for a hearing on a petition to create a municipal corporation, and to objections to such petition, extend the right to objectors to personally appear at the hearing on the merits and to present their objections orally, the published notice of the hearing could not limit such right. Boling v. Jackson, 258 So. 2d 443, 1972 Miss. LEXIS 1504 (Miss. 1972).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence that a city would not extend its corporate limits so as to afford water and sewer facilities to the territory in question for at least 15 years, supported a finding that incorporation of an area one-half mile from the city, which would aid in constructing and maintaining a municipal water and sewer system, was necessary in the interest of public convenience and necessity. Meridian v. Marion, 255 So. 2d 906, 1971 Miss. LEXIS 1299 (Miss. 1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       The commingling of powers in the chancellor to determine the question of the existence of public convenience and necessity for the incorporation of a new municipality, as well as that of the reasonableness of the incorporation, does not violate the prohibition against unlawful delegation of governmental powers, since a finding by the chancellor of the existence of specified requirements for such incorporation is largely ministerial, affording little if any discretion on the part of the chancellor. Rouse v. Pascagoula, 230 So. 2d 543, 1970 Miss. LEXIS 1549 (Miss. 1970).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where, for reasons of public policy, the legislature has limited the time for appeal from a decree creating a municipality to 10 days from the date of the decree, and the appeal bond was not filed within that period, the appeal must be dismissed. Wood v. Warren, 193 So. 2d 123, 1966 Miss. LEXIS 1274 (Miss. 1966).

       The right of appeal given by the statute is not limited to those parties who actively participated in the proceedings in chancery court, but, to fulfill the requirements of due process, since the statute provides for publication of notice to all owners of property within the area proposed to be annexed, the notice having been given, property owners within that classification became “parties to the proceedings” in the chancery court, and this status continued through the final decree which became conclusive and binding upon such owners unless reversed or modified on appeal.

       The filing of a $500 cost bond by a party appealing to the Supreme Court of Mississippi from a decree confirming a municipal ordinance extending the city limits does not operate as a supersedeas where, following an unsuccessful appeal to that court, the appellant filed a petition for certiorari in the Supreme Court of the United States. Bridges v. Biloxi, 253 Miss. 812, 178 So. 2d 683, 180 So. 2d 154, 180 So. 2d 641, 1965 Miss. LEXIS 1054, 1965 Miss. LEXIS 1055, 1965 Miss. LEXIS 1056 (Miss. 1965).
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the statutes give an interested party a right to appeal in annexation proceeding on his furnishing a good bond in the sum of $500, and to have such bond operate as a supersedeas, the chancellor had no authority to require bonds in excess of that amount, notwithstanding that such bonds were insufficient to assure the payment of accrued costs on appeal. Dodd v. Jackson, 238 Miss. 372, 118 So. 2d 319, 1960 Miss. LEXIS 417 (Miss. 1960).
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the two $500 bonds were sufficient to perfect an appeal in an annexation proceeding, the $5,000 bond, erroneously required by the chancellor, would be treated as surplusage and discharged, thereby releasing the sureties thereon. Dodd v. Jackson, 238 Miss. 372, 118 So. 2d 319, 1960 Miss. LEXIS 417 (Miss. 1960).

   It was error for a chancellor to order a city to file a supplemental preclearance request with the United States Attorney General under § 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, as amended, 42 U.S.C.S. § 1973c, because whether and how to initiate or to continue litigation was a matter of discretion for any governmental body, but, because, under both Miss.

Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t21c01s21-1-21" target="_self">21-1-21</a></cite>, a chancellor’s decree went into effect 10 days after an appeal was decided, and the city had not requested supersedeas, the city’s notice of appeal did not stay the judgment of the chancery court and prevent the city from being held in contempt.

       In granting a proposed incorporation, a chancery court properly considered that the incorporation would not impair an immediate right to annex of an adjoining city; although the incorporation might substantially hinder the city’s future growth, the city did not have an unfettered right to annexation. City of Jackson v. Byram Incorporators, 16 So.3d 662, 2009 Miss. LEXIS 145 (Miss. 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       Fair reading of the annexation statutes, Miss. R. Civ. P. 15(a), Miss. R. Civ. P. 81(a)(11), and applicable case law leaves no doubt that, in most instances, annexation pleadings are amendable pursuant to Miss. R. Civ. P. 15; in annexations proceedings, when errors appear in the legal description of the territory proposed to be annexed and/or in the legal description of the entire boundary as changed after enlargement/annexation, such errors may be amended pursuant to the Mississippi Rules of Civil Procedure and case law. Lamar County v. City of Hattiesburg (In re Extension of the Boundaries of Hattiesburg ), 840 So. 2d 69, 2003 Miss. LEXIS 41 (Miss. 2003).
      </p>

       <p>
   Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t21c01s21-1-27" target="_self">21-1-27</a></cite> is not unconstitutionally vague. Lamar County v. City of Hattiesburg (In re Extension of the Boundaries of Hattiesburg ), 840 So. 2d 69, 2003 Miss. LEXIS 41 (Miss. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 21-1-27 does not specifically state that the “entire boundary as changed” must be defined with certainty in an annexation ordinance, and therefore the failure of an original annexation ordinance to correctly define the city’s existing corporate boundaries was not a critical error which should have deprived the chancery court of jurisdiction to grant an annexation; thus, the chancellor did not err in allowing the city to amend the annexation ordinance to correctly describe the entire boundary of the city. City of Southaven v. City of Lake Horn (In re City of Horn Lake), 630 So. 2d 10, 1993 Miss. LEXIS 392 (Miss. 1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   This statute is constitutional despite its lack of a requirement that inhabitants of an area proposed for annexation be allowed to vote on the issue, and it does not deny equal protection despite the fact that inhabitants do, by statute, vote on proposed incorporations and on citizen-sought annexations to or exclusions from areas already incorporated, incorporation and annexation being fundamentally different legal processes. Lowe v. Jackson, 336 So. 2d 490, 1976 Miss. LEXIS 1508 (Miss.), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">429 U.S. 980</cite>, <cite class="s_court">97 S. Ct. 493</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">50 L.

       A municipality is not required to hold a public hearing or to give notice prior to adopting an ordinance expressing its intent to expand its boundaries. Jackson v. Flowood, 331 So. 2d 909, 1976 Miss. LEXIS 1886 (Miss. 1976).

      </p>
      <p>
       The requirements for a petition to incorporate are not necessarily the same as the requirements for an ordinance extending the boundaries of an existing municipality, the legislature having dealt with the two situations in separate statutes. Boling v. Jackson, 258 So. 2d 443, 1972 Miss. LEXIS 1504 (Miss. 1972).
      </p>
      <p>
       A city could not escape its federal constitutional and statutory duties by use of the deannexation procedure, and what might be regarded as a routine municipal ordinance or proceeding in state law may be subjected to a thorough examination in federal law when the effect of the ordinance or proceeding is to deprive citizens of federally protected rights. Franklin v. Marks, 439 F.2d 665, 1971 U.S. App. LEXIS 11585 (5th Cir. Miss. 1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       The general criteria for determining whether an annexation ordinance is reasonable are: (1) the city’s need for expansion; (2) whether the area sought to be annexed is reasonably within the path of such expansion; (3) the potential health hazard from sewage and waste disposal in the annexed area; and (4) the city’s financial ability to make the improvements and furnish municipal services as promised. Bridges v. Biloxi, 253 Miss. 812, 178 So. 2d 683, 180 So. 2d 154, 180 So. 2d 641, 1965 Miss. LEXIS 1054, 1965 Miss. LEXIS 1055, 1965 Miss. LEXIS 1056 (Miss. 1965).

   The power conferred on municipalities to extend their boundaries is subject to legislative control. Delta Electric Power Asso. v.

      <p>
       The title to an ordinance, under which a city sought to alter its boundaries by adding certain adjacent territory and excluding certain territory already included within the existing corporate limits, was clearly expressed in a title reading “An ordinance to be enlarged, extend, modify and define the corporate limits and boundaries” of the city. Dodd v. Jackson, 238 Miss. 372, 118 So. 2d 319, 1960 Miss. LEXIS 417 (Miss. 1960).
      </p>
      <p>
       Notwithstanding the mandatory requirement of Code 1942, § 3374-74 that an ordinance shall not contain more than one subject, a city seeking to alter its boundaries by adding certain adjacent territory and excluding certain territory already included within the existing limits is not required to adopt two different ordinances, and thus initiate at the same time two different proceedings in a chancery court. Dodd v. Jackson, 238 Miss. 372, 118 So. 2d 319, 1960 Miss. LEXIS 417 (Miss. 1960).

       The annexation of lands to a city over the objection of their owners is not a taking of property without compensation. In re Extension of Boundaries, 237 Miss. 486, 115 So. 2d 323, 1959 Miss. LEXIS 495 (Miss. 1959).
      </p>
      <p>
       Provisions of the statute dealing with the manner, procedure and the right of the municipal authorities to enlarge or contract the corporate limits do not contain any restriction or limitation on the right of the municipal authorities to proceed under the statute as often as they may think that the proposed enlargement or contraction is reasonable and is required by the then public convenience and necessity. In re Extension of Boundaries of Indianola, 226 Miss. 760, 85 So. 2d 212, 1956 Miss. LEXIS 460 (Miss. 1956).

       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       Approval of a proposed annexation in favor of the city was proper, in part because the city was in a strong financial condition and was well-equipped to implement the services and facilities plan and the objectors conceded that the city had the financial ability to provide municipal services to the proposed annexation area. Additionally, trash pickup in the proposed annexation area occurred only once a week, which contributed to uncollected waste and the spread of disease in the area; the city presented evidence that it planned to provide garbage collection twice per week. Russell v. City of Madison (In re City of Madison), 983 So. 2d 1035, 2008 Miss. LEXIS 173 (Miss. 2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancery court has a duty to conduct a full evidentiary hearing to determine the reasonableness of a proposed annexation; therefore, the denial of a city’s petition to annex a piece of land and a right-of-way without hearing any evidence was erroneous. In re Extension & Enlarging of the Boundaries of Laurel, 863 So. 2d 968, 2004 Miss. LEXIS 17 (Miss. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       When a city proposing the annexation of certain real property had previously agreed with a neighboring city that this property was in the neighboring city’s path of growth, the city proposing the annexation was not equitably estopped from annexing the property because equitable estoppel could not be applied to the annexing city as it was not shown that this would not be inconsistent with the public interest. In re Enlargement & Extension of the Municipal Boundaries v. City of Southaven, 864 So. 2d 912, 2003 Miss. LEXIS 692 (Miss. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       When a city proposing the annexation of certain real property had previously agreed with a neighboring city that this property was in the neighboring city’s path of growth, the city proposing the annexation was not judicially estopped from annexing the property because the prior agreement was not in the form of a consent decree, and, even if it had been, the city proposing the annexation would, most likely, have been relieved of its prior agreement, under Miss. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(5), because a prior city administration entered into the agreement, and one city administration could not bind its successor. In re Enlargement & Extension of the Municipal Boundaries v. City of Southaven, 864 So. 2d 912, 2003 Miss. LEXIS 692 (Miss. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       Substantial and credible evidence supported trial court’s decision that a city’s proposed annexation of certain real estate was reasonable because (1) the annexing city needed to expand; (2) the proposed annexation area (PAA) was in the annexing city’s path of growth; (3) the proposed annexation created no health hazards; (4) the annexing city could serve the PAA; (5) the PAA needed the city’s zoning and planning services; (6) the PAA would need the city’s other municipal services; (7) no natural barriers existed between the PAA and the city; (8) the city could serve its residents; (9) the PAA’s owner sought annexation; (10) there was no impact on minority voting strength; and (11) the city’s relationship with the holder of the right to provide water and sewer services to the PAA favored annexation, but it was not shown that the PAA benefitted from the city’s provision of services as it was pasture land. In re Enlargement & Extension of the Municipal Boundaries v. City of Southaven, 864 So. 2d 912, 2003 Miss. LEXIS 692 (Miss. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   City’s proposed annexation was approved as being fair to all parties, with fairness being the proper focus of a reasonableness inquiry under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t21c01s21-1-33" target="_self">21-1-33</a></cite>, as a complaint of higher taxes, which appeared to be minimal, could not by itself defeat the proposed annexation, where there were various benefits, including savings on fire insurance, as well as a decrease in water and sewer rates, and improved police protection, fire protection, public works, streets and drainage maintenance, paving of streets, street lighting, zoning, building codes, planning and enforcement, water, and sewer services; these benefits were well worth the additional taxes residents would be forced to pay, and when the equities were balanced, the evidence showed that the proposed annexation was reasonable. In re Enlargement &amp; Extension of the Boundaries of the City of Macon v. City of Macon, 854 So. 2d 1029, 2003 Miss. LEXIS 474 (Miss. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       Municipalities must demonstrate through plans and otherwise, that residents of annexed areas will receive something of value in return for their tax dollars in order to carry the burden of showing reasonableness. Lamar County v. City of Hattiesburg (In re Extension of the Boundaries of Hattiesburg ), 840 So. 2d 69, 2003 Miss. LEXIS 41 (Miss. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       While the court may be approaching a need to employ a timetable approach and implementing a procedural remedy in the nature as discussed by Justice Sullivan and Justice Pittman in the Vicksburg and Columbus decisions, respectively, “the balancing of equity, fairness and determination of what is reasonable in the annexation process” was best accomplished in the instant matter by utilizing the well-established indicia of reasonableness. Lamar County v. City of Hattiesburg (In re Extension of the Boundaries of Hattiesburg ), 840 So. 2d 69, 2003 Miss. LEXIS 41 (Miss. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       While a general statement of proposed improvements is sufficient in the ordinance that begins the annexation process, reliable cost estimates and assurances that promised services will be provided are necessary to establish reasonableness; thus, a city did not satisfy its burden as to reasonableness, and therefore the lower court properly limited the annexation, where the city failed to provide adequate evidence that residents of the entire proposed annexation area would receive anything of value in return for their municipal tax dollars. Robinson v. City of Columbus (In re Extension of the Boundaries of the City of Columbus), 644 So. 2d 1168, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 332 (Miss. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       A chancellor erred in refusing to allow a city to annex part of the territory it sought where the city’s need for expansion was documented by numerous expert and lay witnesses, the constraints upon development within the current boundaries were substantiated, the city was experiencing a rapid rate of growth, and the chancellor failed to consider all of the city’s potential paths of growth when he ruled out the area sought to be annexed as within the normal path of the city’s growth. City of Southaven v. City of Lake Horn (In re City of Horn Lake), 630 So. 2d 10, 1993 Miss. LEXIS 392 (Miss. 1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Chancery Court is charged to determine whether under the totality of the circumstances the annexation (or any part thereof) is reasonable, having due deference to the interests of the municipality and, as well, the interests of the parties affected. Bassett v. Taylorsville, 542 So. 2d 918, 1989 Miss. LEXIS 222 (Miss. 1989).
      </p>
      <p>
       Municipality’s efforts to annex were denied upon findings by the chancery court, supported by substantial evidence, that the municipality lacked financial ability to make improvements and furnish municipal services to the area sought to be annexed, and that it had failed to provide adequate services to the residents of a community within its present boundaries. Extension of Boundaries v. Sherman, 492 So. 2d 289, 1986 Miss. LEXIS 2559 (Miss. 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   An expansion proceeding was valid where, although the annexing city failed to present evidence as to the reasonableness of annexing two areas and the court accordingly deleted those two areas, such action did not constitute an unlawful amendment to the annexation ordinance; the city was not required to go forward with evidence regarding these areas, and the court, pursuant to §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t21c01s21-1-33" target="_self">21-1-33</a></cite>, had the authority to omit them from the proposed annexation area. Jackson v. Flowood, 331 So. 2d 909, 1976 Miss. LEXIS 1886 (Miss. 1976).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where city met the burden of establishing that proposed annexation was feasible and reasonable and that it was financially able to provide the services it proposed to furnish residents of the annexed area, the annexation was approved. Bridges v. Biloxi, 253 Miss. 812, 178 So. 2d 683, 180 So. 2d 154, 180 So. 2d 641, 1965 Miss. LEXIS 1054, 1965 Miss. LEXIS 1055, 1965 Miss. LEXIS 1056 (Miss. 1965).
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that a municipal corporation would like to install a sanitary sewerage system in the territory to be added at the same time such a sewerage system is being installed within the present corporate limits is not a sufficient ground for expanding the city boundaries.

       This section [Code 1942, § 3374-10] does not require a municipality prior to executing its ordinance of extension to ascertain the precise cost of improvements and the sources from which town will obtain water and sewage pipes and other materials. Parker Gin Corp. v. Drew, 214 Miss. 147, 58 So. 2d 372, 1952 Miss. LEXIS 454 (Miss. 1952).

      <p>
       The use of the phrases “approximate time” and “reasonable time” indicates a legislative intent to vest a broad area of discretion in the governing body, however availability of materials, their costs and the financial ability of the town to meet that cost are relevant on whether the services can be rendered within a reasonable time.

   Evidence supported chancellor’s conclusion that public convenience and necessity would be served by annexing an area where, inter alia, the annexing city had adequate facilities to take care of the area’s sewage and waste water disposal, which were currently a potential health hazard, and where police service and better fire protection could be provided through annexation; though there was opposing testimony that much of the area was open or swamp land not justifying annexation, since the area was likely to become a part of the city within a reasonable period of time, annexation was appropriate so as to permit orderly development.

       A trial court decree approving an ordinance enlarging a city’s boundaries, as provided by this section, would be affirmed as modified where the trial court’s finding that the annexation was reasonable and required by the public convenience and necessity was not manifestly wrong or clearly against the overwhelming weight of the evidence.

      <p>
       Evidence as to the city’s alleged need for expansion, whether the specified area was reasonably within the path of such expansion, the potential health and the hazard from sewage and waste disposal, and the city’s financial ability to make the improvements and furnish municipal services as promised, sustained chancellor’s finding that annexation of the specified territory was reasonable.

       The extension of provisions relating to the change of boundaries of municipalities so as to make it applicable to all municipalities necessarily carried with it the limitation contained in Code 1942, in § 3377.

       The application of this section to a commission form of government as to extending boundaries of the municipality also carries the limitations on the power of municipality to adopt ordinances as contained herein.

       Under this section a provision in the ordinance extending the limits of a municipality that the ordinance shall take effect at once is void; An ordinance properly passed under this section will take effect only as provided for by law.

      </p>
      <p>
       Under Laws 1912 ch. 120 (§ 3635, Code of 1942), authorizing a commission form of government, a municipality acting under said chapter and having no authority to extend its boundaries cannot supersede an appeal by providing for referendum of such ordinance.

      </p>
      <p>
       In determining whether an ordinance to extend the limits of a municipality be or be not reasonable, upon an issue made up to try that question in the circuit court as provided by this section, the extension must be considered as an entirety, the question not being whether each and every portion of the territory included in the extension should, if considered separately, have been included. Forbes v. Mayor, etc., of Meridian, 86 Miss. 243, 38 So. 676, 1905 Miss. LEXIS 71 (Miss. 1905).
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether a city is entitled to annex unincorporated adjacent territory or whether the inhabitants of the territory are entitled to incorporate as a town, depends on the priority of the initial step taken by the respective side.

      </p>
      <p>
       A municipal corporation having no other powers than those granted to towns by the provisions of this chapter cannot enjoin the use of its name by designating another place and the inconvenience resulting to its citizens therefrom does not give the municipality a right to complain. Gulf & S. I. R. Co. v. Seminary, 81 Miss. 237, 32 So. 953, 1902 Miss. LEXIS 135 (Miss. 1902).

      </p>
      <p>
       Upon appeal to the circuit court from the judgment of the municipal authorities changing the boundaries of a municipality under this and the next succeeding section, the trial is de novo and there is no necessity for a bill of exceptions.

   City’s proposed annexation was approved as being fair to all parties, with fairness being the proper focus of a reasonableness inquiry under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t21c01s21-1-33" target="_self">21-1-33</a></cite>, as a complaint of higher taxes, which appeared to be minimal, could not by itself defeat the proposed annexation, where there were various benefits, including savings on fire insurance, as well as a decrease in water and sewer rates, and improved police protection, fire protection, public works, streets and drainage maintenance, paving of streets, street lighting, zoning, building codes, planning and enforcement, water, and sewer services; these benefits were well worth the additional taxes residents would be forced to pay, and when the equities were balanced, the evidence showed that the proposed annexation was reasonable. In re Enlargement &amp; Extension of the Boundaries of the City of Macon v. City of Macon, 854 So. 2d 1029, 2003 Miss. LEXIS 474 (Miss. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Chancery Court is charged to determine whether under the totality of the circumstances the annexation (or any part thereof) is reasonable, having due deference to the interests of the municipality and, as well, the interests of the parties affected. Bassett v. Taylorsville, 542 So. 2d 918, 1989 Miss. LEXIS 222 (Miss. 1989).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t21c01s21-1-29" target="_self">21-1-29</a></cite>, a city can confirm an annexation only through formal judicial proceedings instituted in the Chancery Court where the city or land is located.

      </p>
      <p>
       The alleged failure of a city to comply with a requirement that an ordinance expanding city limits be approved pursuant to the Federal Voting Rights Act before it can become effective, was not ground for reversal of a decree ratifying, approving, and confirming the city ordinance expanding the city’s limits, since the Mississippi statute does not require the city to have its ordinance approved or confirmed by anyone other than the chancery court, and the Voting Rights Act requires compliance only in order to have the ordinance enforced. Sperry Rand Corp. v. Jackson, 248 So. 2d 810, 1971 Miss. LEXIS 1495 (Miss. 1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where city met the burden of establishing that proposed annexation was feasible and reasonable and that it was financially able to provide the services it proposed to furnish residents of the annexed area, the annexation was approved. Bridges v. Biloxi, 253 Miss. 812, 178 So. 2d 683, 180 So. 2d 154, 180 So. 2d 641, 1965 Miss. LEXIS 1054, 1965 Miss. LEXIS 1055, 1965 Miss. LEXIS 1056 (Miss. 1965).

      <p>
       The contention of property owners in a new area annexed to a city that they are thereby denied due process and equal protection of the laws because their property will be subject to taxation to pay general obligation bonds issued by the city before the annexation ordinance was passed is not supported either by reason or by authority. Bridges v. Biloxi, 253 Miss. 812, 178 So. 2d 683, 180 So. 2d 154, 180 So. 2d 641, 1965 Miss. LEXIS 1054, 1965 Miss. LEXIS 1055, 1965 Miss. LEXIS 1056 (Miss. 1965).
      </p>
      <p>
       The burden of proof of public convenience and necessity for the expansion of the corporate limits is upon the city seeking court approval of its actions in that respect. Walker v. Moss Point, 252 Miss. 511, 175 So. 2d 173, 1965 Miss. LEXIS 1128 (Miss. 1965).
      </p>
      <p>
       On an application to obtain the court’s approval of a proposed annexation, the city has the burden of showing it to be reasonable, and if the chancellor’s finding of reasonableness or unreasonableness is supported by substantial evidence, the supreme court will not disturb it. In re Forest, 247 Miss. 340, 153 So. 2d 688, 1963 Miss. LEXIS 306 (Miss. 1963).
      </p>

      Upon the filing of such petition and upon application therefor by the petitioner, the chancellor shall fix a date certain, either in term time or in vacation, when a hearing on said petition will be held, and notice thereof shall be given in the same manner and for the same length of time as is provided in Section 21-1-15 with regard to the creation of municipal corporations, and all parties interested in, affected by, or being aggrieved by said proposed enlargement or contraction shall have the right to appear at such hearing and present their objection to such proposed enlargement or contraction. However, in all cases of the enlargement of municipalities where any of the territory proposed to be incorporated is located within three miles of another existing municipality, then such other existing municipality shall be made a party defendant to said petition and shall be served with process in the manner provided by law, which process shall be served at least thirty days prior to the date set for the hearing.

   Objectors to the annexation contended that the city failed to prove that adequate notice was given. However, in the affidavit filed by the city, the affiant specifically stated the exact locations and dates of his postings of notice of the hearings in his affidavit as required by Miss. R. Civ.

   A county board of education was an agent of the State, and therefore had the authority to object to a proposed annexation. The board of education was a party interested in, affected by or aggrieved by the proposed annexation within the meaning of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t21c01s21-1-31" target="_self">21-1-31</a></cite>, where the territory sought to be annexed was served by schools administered by the county board of education.

   A county had standing under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t21c01s21-1-31" target="_self">21-1-31</a></cite> to object to the annexation of county territory by a city since it was a party interested in, affected by or aggrieved by the annexations.

       A party’s assertion of an interest or effect goes a long way toward establishing that it has an interest in, or will likely be affected by, an annexation. Harrison County v. Gulfport, 557 So. 2d 780, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 44 (Miss. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       In an action by objectors to the proposed annexation of property by a municipality, the determination of the reasonableness of the annexation was a judicial function, and thus, the chancellor’s failure to recognize his role as a judicial officer, rather than as a ministerial one, would require remand for a new hearing.

In so doing the chancellor shall have the right and the power to modify the proposed enlargement or contraction by decreasing the territory to be included in or excluded from the municipality, as the case may be.

   Chancellor erred in its denial of the parties’ motion in that it put forth as the effective date of the decree of annexation the date of entry instead of ten days after determination of appeal, Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t21c01s21-1-33" target="_self">21-1-33</a></cite>, and usurped the exclusively legislative function of the city’s determining whether to pursue annexation procedures. In re Extension of the Boundaries of Sardis, 954 So. 2d 434, 2007 Miss. LEXIS 228 (Miss. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       Annexation is reasonable only if it is fair; in making this determination, annexation must be viewed from perspective of both city and landowners of proposed annexation area. Bunch v. City of Jackson (In re Enlargement & Extension of the Mun. Boundaries), 691 So. 2d 978, 1997 Miss. LEXIS 97 (Miss. 1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       Court asked to approve municipality’s annexation request must determine whether annexation is reasonable under totality of circumstances. Burch v. Town of Mantachie (In re Extension of Corporate Boundaries), 685 So. 2d 724, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 685 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       The 12 indicia of reasonableness of an annexation are: (1) the municipality’s need to expand; (2) whether the area sought to be annexed is reasonably within a path of growth of the city; (3) potential health hazards from sewage and waste disposal in the annexed areas; (4) the municipality’s financial ability to make the improvements and furnish municipal services promised; (5) the need for zoning and overall planning in the area; (6) the need for municipal services in the area sought to be annexed; (7) whether there are natural barriers between the city and the proposed annexation area; (8) past performance and the time element involved in the city’s provision of services to its present residents; (9) economic or other impact of the annexation upon those who live in or own property in the proposed annexation area; (10) the impact of the annexation upon the voting strength of protected minority groups; (11) whether the property owners and other inhabitants of the areas sought to be annexed have in the past, and in the foreseeable future unless annexed will, because of their reasonable proximity to the corporate limits of the municipality, enjoy economic and social benefits of the municipality without paying their fair share of taxes; and (12) any other factors that may suggest reasonableness; these 12 factors are not separate, independent tests which are conclusive as to reasonableness, but rather are “mere indicia of reasonableness.” Perry v. Guion, 650 So. 2d 490, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 77 (Miss. 1995); Burch v. Town of Mantachie (In re Extension of Corporate Boundaries), 685 So. 2d 724, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 685 (Miss. 1996); Bunch v. City of Jackson (In re Enlargement & Extension of the Mun. Boundaries), 691 So. 2d 978, 1997 Miss. LEXIS 97 (Miss. 1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       The factors enumerated in Dodd v. City Jackson (Miss. 1960) 118 So. 2d 319, 330, as expanded over the years in later decisions, are not separate and independent tests but mere indicia of reasonableness, and the court’s determination in the end must be whether, under the totality of the circumstances, the annexation, or any part thereof, is reasonable. In re Boundaries of Vicksburg, 560 So. 2d 713, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 191 (Miss. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Chancery Court is charged to determine whether under the totality of the circumstances the annexation (or any part thereof) is reasonable, having due deference to the interests of the municipality and, as well, the interests of the parties affected. Bassett v. Taylorsville, 542 So. 2d 918, 1989 Miss. LEXIS 222 (Miss. 1989).

   Section<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t21c01s21-1-33" target="_self">21-1-33</a></cite>, rather than §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t21c01s21-1-13" target="_self">21-1-13</a></cite>, is a controlling statute where a petition is filed to confirm the annexation of territory to a municipality. McElhaney v. Horn Lake, 501 So. 2d 401, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2272 (Miss. 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       An expansion proceeding was valid where, although the annexing city failed to present evidence as to the reasonableness of annexing two areas and the court accordingly deleted those two areas, such action did not constitute an unlawful amendment to the annexation ordinance; the city was not required to go forward with evidence regarding these areas, and the court, pursuant to this section, had the authority to omit them from the proposed annexation area. Jackson v. Flowood, 331 So. 2d 909, 1976 Miss. LEXIS 1886 (Miss. 1976).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Argument that trial court in assuming jurisdiction of annexation proceedings by municipality and consolidating them with incorporation proceedings of residents of community placed an undue burden upon the would-be incorporaters causing them to not only prove the reasonableness of the incorporation pursuant to statutory requirements, but also burdened them with refuting the reasonableness of the city’s annexation proceedings, thereby confusing the issue by combining causes of action which were the antithesis of each other, was technically well-founded; however since under the statutes appertaining to either incorporation or annexation the issue basic to each was whether it was reasonable and required by public convenience and necessity, and since the trial court’s opinion conclusively indicated that it was formulated from the evidence before it with the statutory issues clearly in mind, the consolidation, under the circumstances was not prejudicial error. In re Incorporation of Forest Hill, 280 So. 2d 837, 1973 Miss. LEXIS 1496 (Miss. 1973), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">414 U.S. 1130</cite>, <cite class="s_court">94 S. Ct. 869</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">38 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 755, 1974 U.S. LEXIS 1446 (U.S. 1974).
      </p>
      <p>
       The contention of property owners in a new area annexed to a city that they are thereby denied due process and equal protection of the laws because their property will be subject to taxation to pay general obligation bonds issued by the city before the annexation ordinance was passed is not supported either by reason or by authority. Bridges v. Biloxi, 253 Miss. 812, 178 So. 2d 683, 180 So. 2d 154, 180 So. 2d 641, 1965 Miss. LEXIS 1054, 1965 Miss. LEXIS 1055, 1965 Miss. LEXIS 1056 (Miss. 1965).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a proceeding under this section [Code 1942, § 3374-13], there is no constitutional right to trial by jury. In re Extension of Boundaries, 237 Miss. 486, 115 So. 2d 323, 1959 Miss. LEXIS 495 (Miss. 1959).

       Mississippi Supreme Court declares as antiquated the prior jurisdiction doctrine as it relates to annexation litigation, and to the extent that any of its prior cases have recognized and applied this doctrine, these prior cases are to that limited extent overruled.

      <p>
       Chancery court has a duty to conduct a full evidentiary hearing to determine the reasonableness of a proposed annexation; therefore, the denial of a city’s petition to annex a piece of land and a right-of-way without hearing any evidence was erroneous. In re Extension & Enlarging of the Boundaries of Laurel, 863 So. 2d 968, 2004 Miss. LEXIS 17 (Miss. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Ultimate determination in annexation case must be whether annexation is reasonable under totality of circumstances. Bunch v. City of Jackson (In re Enlargement & Extension of the Mun. Boundaries), 691 So. 2d 978, 1997 Miss. LEXIS 97 (Miss. 1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       Role of judiciary in annexations is limited to determining whether annexation is reasonable. In re Extension of Boundaries, 238 Miss. 405, 117 So. 2d 199, 1960 Miss. LEXIS 419 (Miss. 1960); McElhaney v. Horn Lake, 501 So. 2d 401, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2272 (Miss. 1987); Bunch v. City of Jackson (In re Enlargement & Extension of the Mun.

      </p>
      <p>
       In determining reasonableness of city’s annexation proposal, court must consider proposal in light of area as a whole, considering concern of both city and landowners. Burch v. Town of Mantachie (In re Extension of Corporate Boundaries), 685 So. 2d 724, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 685 (Miss. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancellor’s determination of reasonableness of proposed annexation is judicial function, not ministerial one. Western Line Consol. School Dist. v. Greenville, 465 So. 2d 1057, 1985 Miss. LEXIS 1970 (Miss. 1985).

       A cross-petition by residents of a town seeking to be excluded from the existing corporate limits, filed in a proceeding to confirm an ordinance extending city boundaries, was properly dismissed because the powers of the chancery court in such a proceeding are limited to approving, modifying, or denying the proposed ordinance, and the court cannot consider matters not concerning the ordinance.

       To show reasonableness of annexation, municipalities must demonstrate, through plans and otherwise, that residents of annexed areas will receive something of value in return for their tax dollars.

       In a proceeding for confirmation of a city’s proposed annexation of adjoining land, any detriment to a nearby city was only required to be given “great weight” under the twelfth “other factors” indicium of reasonableness, and therefore the annexing city was not required to show “clear, strong proof” on the 12 indicia of reasonableness merely because the nearby city claimed that the proposed annexation would have a detrimental impact on it by limiting its northern path of growth. Perry v. Guion, 650 So. 2d 490, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 77 (Miss. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       While a general statement of proposed improvements is sufficient in the ordinance that begins the annexation process, reliable cost estimates and assurances that promised services will be provided are necessary to establish reasonableness; thus, a city did not satisfy its burden as to reasonableness, and therefore the lower court properly limited the annexation, where the city failed to provide adequate evidence that residents of the entire proposed annexation area would receive anything of value in return for their municipal tax dollars.

       Chancery court properly determined that a city’s annexation of its neighbors into its boundaries was reasonable and supported by the evidence where the city had spilled over into the proposed annexation area (PAA) and was continuing to expand into the county; unregulated development in the PAA was putting a strain on utilities and other municipal services. In re Enlarging City of Brookhaven, 957 So. 2d 382, 2007 Miss. LEXIS 345 (Miss. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancellor’s finding of reasonableness in a city’s annexation petition for the proposed annexation area (PAA) was affirmed given the factors shown, such as population increase, the city’s growth path toward the PAA, and the city’s spillover. Also, the city had zoning ordinances to assist in planning, and the city had substantially fulfilled past annexation promises. Poole v. City of Pearl (In re Extension of the Boundaries), 908 So. 2d 728, 2005 Miss. LEXIS 490 (Miss. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancellor’s finding that two cities each had a reasonable need for expansion but were limited in the direction in which they could expand, that it would be premature to award a certain portion of the proposed annexation area to either city because it was largely undeveloped, and that the area awarded to each was sufficient to meet its needs, were all reasonable contentions and supported by the evidence; therefore, the chancellor’s decision to partially grant and partially deny the cities’ petitions was reasonable City of D'Iberville v. City of Biloxi (In re Enlargement & Extension of the Municipal Boundaries), 867 So. 2d 241, 2004 Miss. LEXIS 242 (Miss. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court properly found that the proposed annexation of an area was reasonable because (1) the city had a need for expansion, (2) the area was in the path of the city’s growth, (3) there were no natural boundaries between the city and the area, (4) there were potential health hazards in the area, (5) the city had a financial ability to provide services to the area, (6) the area needed zoning, (7) the city’s municipal services were of benefit to the area, (8) the city provided adequate services to its citizens, (9) there was no adverse impact, other than the raising of taxes, on the area residents, (10) minority voting strength was not going to be negatively affected, and (11) area residents were receiving benefits from the city and it was appropriate that they shared in the tax responsibility for such services. Prestridge v. City of Petal, 841 So. 2d 1048, 2003 Miss. LEXIS 53 (Miss. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence supported the reasonableness of a proposed annexation where (1) the city established a need to expand due to it’s population increase, economic growth, limited areas in which to grow, traffic congestion, and need for access to an interstate highway, (2) the area that the city sought to annex was in the city’s path of growth, (3) over 85 percent of the people in the area the city sought to annex were without public water or sewer and thus presented a potential health hazard, (4) the city had the financial ability to make improvements and pay the necessary increase in operating expenses caused by the annexation, (5) there was a need for overall planning and zoning, (6) the area that the city sought to annex was in need of municipal services, (7) the natural barriers were not sufficient to prohibit the annexation, (8) the city had provided in a timely fashion the capital improvements and municipal services to the area as provided in an earlier annexation, (9) the residents of the area that the city sought to annex would receive capital improvements and municipal services that would outweigh the impact of additional taxes, (10) the annexation would not cause any dilution of minority voting strength, and (11) many of the residents of the area that the city sought to annex worked in the city and used city facilities.

       Record did not support finding that state capital’s proposed annexation of 24.25 square miles of territory outside of its existing corporate limits was reasonable; city’s population was decreasing, commercial building permits had decreased considerably despite availability of considerable vacant, developable land within city, city admitted that it wanted revenues that annexation would provide by expanding city’s tax base, city failed to prove that current services in proposed annexation area were inadequate, and city school official testified that, with exception of possibly two schools, all city schools were operating at or above capacity, and that no thought had been given to where annexed students would attend school.

      <p>
       Facts that there had been no significant population growth and/or that there was relatively high percentage of undeveloped land within existing city limits, should, at very least, be impediment to annexation.

      <p>
       Chancellor’s decision that town’s annexation request was reasonable was supported by evidence that town population was growing, no good residential building locations were left, proposed area was in path of growth, lack of sewer hookups in proposed area created health hazard, town had plan and financial ability to provide services to area, garbage collection costs would be lowered, and annexation would make industrial development possible.

      </p>
      <p>
       Plans that call for extension of services into annexation areas when economically feasible are not per se unreasonable, but if there is evidence of lack of commitment, such as general failure to estimate costs and plan for implementation of municipal services, then reasonableness of annexation proposal can fairly be questioned.

       Evidence was not sufficient to justify chancellor’s finding that city accountant testified that without MP & L plant, annexation was not feasible, where record revealed that city accountant only admitted that loss of MP & L would adversely affect city’s bonding capacity and would significantly affect feasibility of annexation.

       Municipality’s efforts to annex were denied upon findings by the chancery court, supported by substantial evidence, that the municipality lacked financial ability to make improvements and furnish municipal services to the area sought to be annexed, and that it had failed to provide adequate services to the residents of a community within its present boundaries.

       A decree which ratified, approved, and confirmed a city ordinance expanding the city’s limits, as modified by the trial court to exclude the property of objectors pursuant to an agreement between the city and objectors, was not a “consent decree” insofar as modification was concerned, and the decree which recited that the trial court had heard testimony and that the ordinance as modified was reasonable did not amount to an amendment of the ordinance by the city without a proper amendatory ordinance.

       While it is better form for the decree in a proceeding to confirm the extension of city boundaries to state that the chancellor has found that reasonable municipal services will be rendered in the annexed territory within a reasonable time, failure to so state does not render the decree invalid, it being apparent that this section [Code 1942, § 3374-13] requires only that the chancellor enter a decree approving, ratifying, and confirming the proposed enlargement if he finds that the proposed enlargement is reasonable and that the proper municipal services will be rendered within a reasonable time.

       Chancellor’s partial grant of a town’s annexation petition was appropriate because the chancellor considered all of the evidence presented and balanced the town’s annexation request against objectors’ concerns. Furthermore, the chancellor’s findings were based on substantial, credible evidence, were not manifestly wrong, and were within the chancellor’s discretion. Wilson v.

Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t21c01s21-1-33" target="_self">21-1-33</a></cite> because, in addition to indicia of reasonableness that objectors had conceded, it had long been providing many services to portions of the proposed annexation area, and annexation power was legislative, not judicial, so that the state supreme court declined an invitation to add yet another factor in its consideration; the area sought to be annexed was reasonably within a part of growth of the city, which needed to expand, and there was a need for zoning, overall planning, and municipal services in the proposed area. In re City of Brookhaven, 2007 Miss. LEXIS 204 (Miss. Apr. 5, 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       If chancellor employed correct legal standards in determining reasonableness of annexation, Supreme Court’s standard of review is limited; reversal of chancellor’s findings is warranted only if chancellor is manifestly wrong and his findings are not supported by substantial credible evidence.

       Chancellor’s findings in annexation case are reviewed to determine whether they are supported by substantial, credible evidence; if there is credible, conflicting evidence, Supreme Court defers to Chancery Court’s findings.

      </p>

       A failure of proof on 6 of the 12 factors for determining reasonableness of an annexation would not mandate reversal as a matter of law of the chancellor’s finding of reasonableness; the chancellor was required to determine reasonableness under the totality of the circumstances, employing the 12 applicable indicia of reasonableness merely as an aid to this determination. Perry v. Guion, 650 So. 2d 490, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 77 (Miss. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       A chancellor’s approval of an annexation was correct where he made a finding of reasonableness regarding each of the 12 factors for determining reasonableness, and there was a showing of benefits to be gained by the residents of the proposed annexation area in exchange for their city taxes. Perry v. Guion, 650 So. 2d 490, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 77 (Miss. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancellor was manifestly wrong in finding entire annexation to be unreasonable, and should have denied annexation of those areas for which annexation would be unreasonable, and allowed annexation of remaining areas, where chancellor relied too heavily on highly speculative evidence when he included an 8.3 million dollar contingent bond liability in computing city’s financial ability to fund annexation. City of Greenville v. Farmers, Inc., 513 So. 2d 932, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2835 (Miss. 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence was not sufficient to justify chancellor’s finding that city accountant testified that without MP & L plant, annexation was not feasible, where record revealed that city accountant only admitted that loss of MP & L would adversely affect city’s bonding capacity and would significantly affect feasibility of annexation. City of Greenville v. Farmers, Inc., 513 So. 2d 932, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2835 (Miss. 1987).

       Supreme Court has authority, in appropriate case on appeal, to modify chancellor’s order concerning annexation. City of Greenville v. Farmers, Inc., 513 So. 2d 932, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2835 (Miss. 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       As a reviewing court, the Supreme Court is limited to a determination of whether the chancellors finding on the question of reasonableness is manifestly wrong, and, where there is conflicting evidence, it will give great deference to the chancellor’s findings. McElhaney v. Horn Lake, 501 So. 2d 401, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2272 (Miss. 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       In an action by a city to annex a utility district, the trial court properly found that the city had failed to prove that the annexation was reasonable where the evidence was sufficient to support the trial court’s findings that the city had no existing need for expansion, that a flood plain was a natural barrier between the city and the area sought to be annexed, and that the area proposed to be annexed had adequate public services. Extension of Boundaries of Horn Lake v. Renfro, 365 So. 2d 623, 1978 Miss. LEXIS 2419 (Miss. 1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       On an application to obtain the court’s approval of a proposed annexation, the city has the burden of showing it to be reasonable, and if the chancellor’s finding of reasonableness or unreasonableness is supported by substantial evidence, the supreme court will not disturb it. In re Forest, 247 Miss. 340, 153 So. 2d 688, 1963 Miss. LEXIS 306 (Miss. 1963).

       The statutory 10-day period for appeal from a chancery decree deannexing territory from a city was not a true statute of limitations in the sense that such a statute fixes the interval between the time of accrual of a right and the time allowed for commencement of an action to enforce the right. As the brevity of the period in itself showed, it was instead merely a procedural limitation on the parties’ use of appellate process in a municipal deannexation proceeding, and it was not a limitation on the right to bring a civil rights action in federal court based on an alleged abuse of the statutory deannexation procedure. Franklin v. Marks, 439 F.2d 665, 1971 U.S. App. LEXIS 11585 (5th Cir. Miss. 1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       The filing of a $500 cost bond by a party appealing to the Supreme Court of Mississippi from a decree confirming a municipal ordinance extending the city limits does not operate as a supersedeas where, following an unsuccessful appeal to that court, the appellant filed a petition for certiorari in the Supreme Court of the United States. Bridges v. Biloxi, 253 Miss. 812, 178 So. 2d 683, 180 So. 2d 154, 180 So. 2d 641, 1965 Miss. LEXIS 1054, 1965 Miss. LEXIS 1055, 1965 Miss. LEXIS 1056 (Miss. 1965).
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the statutes give an interested party a right to appeal in annexation proceeding upon furnishing a good bond in the sum of $500, and to have such bond operate as a supersedeas, the chancellor had no authority to require bonds in excess of that amount, notwithstanding that such bonds were insufficient to assure the payment of accrued costs on appeal. Dodd v. Jackson, 238 Miss. 372, 118 So. 2d 319, 1960 Miss. LEXIS 417 (Miss. 1960).
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the two $500 bonds were sufficient to perfect an appeal in an annexation proceeding, the $5,000 bond, erroneously required by the chancellor, would be treated as surplusage and discharged, thereby releasing the sureties thereon. Dodd v. Jackson, 238 Miss. 372, 118 So. 2d 319, 1960 Miss. LEXIS 417 (Miss. 1960).

       Where the board of mayor and aldermen of city of Louisville, by passage of the ordinance proposing to add the new territory, adjudicated that the extension was reasonable and also where the chancellor held that the objectors failed to show the extension to be unreasonable, the Supreme Court will not overrule this action without clear ground or reason of justification.

       On appeal from ordinance enlarging geographical area of town from 800 acres to 1237 acres, issue of reasonableness of ordinance is for jury and its verdict upholding ordinance is not without substantial support where record on behalf of objectors relates chiefly to disinclination of citizens in added area to be burdened with additional taxes and their doubts that city will furnish benefits commensurate with burdens placed upon them, and testimony on behalf of city shows purpose and ability to furnish new area with street improvements, water and sewerage facilities, police and fire protection, and garbage disposal. Nicholson v. Booneville, 208 Miss. 800, 45 So. 2d 594, 1950 Miss. LEXIS 301 (Miss. 1950).

       On appeal from ordinance enlarging geographical area of town, jury has right to take into account practical necessity of extending new improvements gradually and probability that existing bond issues will be reduced during reasonable period of extension so that ultimately entire new area will be supplied reasonably. Nicholson v. Booneville, 208 Miss. 800, 45 So. 2d 594, 1950 Miss. LEXIS 301 (Miss. 1950).

       On appeal from ordinance enlarging geographical area of town, light and water utilities furnished by private corporations but in conjunction with aid rendered by town and under its supervision, can be credited to town as showing ability of town to furnish these improvements. Nicholson v. Booneville, 208 Miss. 800, 45 So. 2d 594, 1950 Miss. LEXIS 301 (Miss. 1950).

      <p>
       Purpose and intent of this section is for speedy disposition of appeal involving municipal expansion and Code 1942, § 1519, providing that no issue of fact shall be tried before next succeeding term after issue is made up unless defendant has been personally served with process for thirty days before return-date, has no application to appeals under this section. Vail v. City of Jackson, 206 Miss. 299, 40 So. 2d 151, 1949 Miss. LEXIS 263 (Miss. 1949).
      </p>
      <p>
       Proposed extension that is prohibited by this section for one year is extension by ordinance that is adjudged unreasonable, and this section does not prohibit within year new extension ordinance that is in no way similar to that found unreasonable; and city may include in subsequent ordinance any part of lands included in ordinance previously declared invalid. Vail v. City of Jackson, 206 Miss. 299, 40 So. 2d 151, 1949 Miss. LEXIS 263 (Miss. 1949).
      </p>
      <p>
       On appeal to circuit court from ordinance extending municipal boundaries, reasonableness of ordinance is issue to be determined and need of streets, if any, is only one circumstance among many to be considered by jury in arriving at conclusion upon whether or not ordinance is reasonable. Neely v. Charleston, 204 Miss. 360, 37 So. 2d 495, 1948 Miss. LEXIS 374 (Miss. 1948).
      </p>
      <p>
       The necessary and inevitable increase in taxation on the property in the new area within extended municipal limits is not a proper subject of testimony on appeal where the actual or probable city assessments are not shown so that it can be determined whether the increase would be so disproportionate to the compensating benefits as to become unreasonable. Kennedy v. Kosciusko, 203 Miss. 4, 33 So. 2d 285, 1948 Miss. LEXIS 222 (Miss. 1948).
      </p>
      <p>
       Tender by the contestants of the issue of reasonableness vel non is sufficiently met by a general issue plea. Walker v. Waynesboro, 202 Miss. 830, 32 So. 2d 455, 1947 Miss. LEXIS 346 (Miss. 1947).
      </p>
      <p>
       Extension of the limits of a municipality was sustained where the testimony of contestants disclosed chiefly their personal reactions and their opinions that no substantial benefits would probably accrue to them, whereas the entire record sufficiently revealed a purpose toward and a probability of benefit both to the citizens of the old and of the new areas. Walker v. Waynesboro, 202 Miss. 830, 32 So. 2d 455, 1947 Miss. LEXIS 346 (Miss. 1947).
      </p>
      <p>
       On appeal from ordinance, court could not consider question of loss of power to tax, on part of school district, territory included in municipality under ordinance. Pass Christian v. Long Beach, 157 Miss. 778, 128 So. 554, 1930 Miss. LEXIS 321 (Miss. 1930).
      </p>
      <p>
       Proof of publication held not requisite part of record on appeal from ordinance extending city limits. Pass Christian v. Long Beach, 157 Miss. 778, 128 So. 554, 1930 Miss. LEXIS 321 (Miss. 1930).
      </p>
      <p>
       Taxpayer failing to appeal from ordinance of annexation was estopped to question validity of ordinance in collateral proceeding. City of Greenwood v. Humphreys, 157 Miss. 879, 127 So. 694, 1930 Miss. LEXIS 268 (Miss. 1930).
      </p>
      <p>
       An ordinance extending the territory of a town cannot be collaterally attacked by one who has waived his rights of appeal. Sanders v. Starkville, 128 Miss. 742, 91 So. 422, 1922 Miss. LEXIS 162 (Miss. 1922).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where on appeal there was no conflict in the evidence which conclusively showed the reasonableness of the ordinance, a peremptory instruction for the city was correct. Kraetzer Cured Lumber Co. v. Moorhead, 118 Miss. 736, 80 So. 4, 1918 Miss. LEXIS 128 (Miss. 1918); Gregory v. Amory, 112 Miss. 604, 73 So. 614, 1916 Miss. LEXIS 152 (Miss. 1916).
      </p>
      <p>
       A municipality operating under a commission form of government ordering a referendum is held not to supersede an appeal from such ordinance. Gregory v. Amory, 112 Miss. 604, 73 So. 614, 1916 Miss. LEXIS 152 (Miss. 1916).
      </p>
      <p>
       The question of the return of revenue which the municipality may receive from the territory proposed to be annexed is not a criterion by which to determine the reasonableness or unreasonableness of the ordinance. Forbes v. Mayor, etc., of Meridian, 86 Miss. 243, 38 So. 676, 1905 Miss. LEXIS 71 (Miss. 1905).
      </p>
      <p>
       Appeal under § 3380, Code of 1942 is tried de novo. Yerger v. Greenwood, 77 Miss. 378, 27 So. 620, 1899 Miss. LEXIS 89 (Miss. 1899).

    Combining of municipalities.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Any two or more cities or towns being adjacent or situated sufficiently near to each other may combine into and become one municipality in the same manner as is provided for the enlargement or contraction of municipal boundaries. It shall be necessary for the governing authorities of each municipality to adopt the ordinance with regard thereto in the same manner as is provided in Section 21-1-27 with regard to the enlargement or contraction of municipal boundaries. It shall also be necessary that such municipal authorities shall file a joint petition in the proper chancery court, and thereafter proceedings shall be had in the same manner as is provided in cases of enlargement or contraction of municipal boundaries. The ordinance and the petition filed with the chancery court shall state the name that shall be given to the municipality to be formed. In the event of the consolidation of two or more municipalities into one as herein provided, the decree of the chancellor shall correctly classify the municipality so formed in accordance with the facts, based upon the total population of all of such municipalities as shown by the latest available federal census. When said consolidation shall have become final and operative, all of such municipalities shall be merged into one under the name set forth in the ordinances adopted by the governing authorities of the municipalities so consolidated. The governing authorities of all the municipalities so consolidated shall become members of the governing authority of the municipality so formed until the next regular election, when the proper number of members of the governing authority shall be elected as provided by law, and the mayor or chief executive officer of the largest municipality, according to population, shall become the mayor or chief executive officer of the municipality so formed. The assessments and levies for ad valorem taxation in force at the time of the consolidation of such municipalities for the territory of each municipality shall be the assessment and levy upon which taxes shall be collected for the then current fiscal year, but in all other respects the existing laws and ordinances of the largest municipality, according to population, shall be operative throughout the enlarged limits.
     </p>
     <p>
      Nothing in this section shall authorize the combination of two or more villages unless such villages shall have a combined population of five hundred or more, according to the latest available federal census.

      The qualified electors of any territory contiguous to and adjoining any existing municipality and the qualified electors of any territory which is a part of an existing municipality, may be included in or excluded from such municipality, as the case may be, in the manner hereinafter provided. Whenever the inhabitants of any incorporated territory adjacent to any municipality shall desire to be included therein, and whenever the inhabitants of any territory which is a part of an existing municipality shall desire to be excluded therefrom, they shall prepare a petition and file same in the chancery court of the county in which such municipality is located, which said petition shall be signed by at least two-thirds of the qualified electors residing in the territory proposed to be included in or excluded from such municipality. Said petition shall describe accurately the metes and bounds of the territory proposed to be included in or excluded from such municipality, shall set forth the reasons why the public convenience and necessity would be served by such territory being included in or excluded from such municipality, as the case may be, and shall be sworn to by one or more of the petitioners. In all cases, there shall be attached to such petition a plat of the municipal boundaries as same will exist in the event the territory in question is included in or excluded from such municipality. No territory may be so excluded from a municipality within two years from the time that such territory was incorporated into such municipality, and no territory may be so excluded if it would wholly separate any territory not so excluded from the remainder of the municipality. No petition for the inclusion or exclusion of any territory under this section shall be filed within two years from the date of any adverse determination of any proceedings originated hereinafter under this chapter for the inclusion or exclusion of the same territory.

   Although Mississippi Code §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t21c01s21-1-45" target="_self">21-1-45</a></cite> contains no dispositive definition for the term “qualified electors,” it would be inappropriate to adopt the definition of that term found in Mississippi Code §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.23.html#t23c05s23-5-85" target="_blank">23-5-85</a></cite> [Repealed], and to employ the entire panoply of rules applicable to public elections to a proceeding to obtain annexation of unincorporated area by an adjacent existing municipality. Schmidt v. City of Jackson, 494 So. 2d 348 (Miss. 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       The legislature has prescribed means by which persons residing in an unincorporated area may obtain annexation to a municipality adjacent to the area in which they live. Schmidt v. City of Jackson, 494 So. 2d 348 (Miss. 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Persons living within an incorporated territory at the time of petitioning, as well as persons living within an unincorporated area, may upon a proper showing enjoy the remedy afforded by Mississippi Code §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t21c01s21-1-45" target="_self">21-1-45</a></cite>. Schmidt v. City of Jackson, 494 So. 2d 348 (Miss. 1986).

       <p>
   Citizens living in an unincorporated area which is a territory contiguous to and adjoining an existing municipality may proceed under Mississippi Code §§<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t21c01s21-1-45" target="_self">21-1-45</a></cite> and<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t21c01s21-1-47" target="_self">21-1-47</a></cite> to obtain annexation by the municipality. Schmidt v. City of Jackson, 494 So. 2d 348 (Miss. 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       The allegations of a complaint filed by residents of an unincorporated area seeking to obtain annexation by an adjacent existing municipality were sufficient to confer upon the chancery court authority to proceed in the matter. Schmidt v. City of Jackson, 494 So. 2d 348 (Miss. 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       For the purposes of an action to obtain annexation of an unincorporated area by an adjacent existing municipality, the question of whether the two-thirds requirement has been met must be determined by ascertaining the number of persons living in the area to be annexed who, on the date the complaint was filed, were registered voters in the area, and then determining whether two-thirds of that number have signed the complaint. Schmidt v. City of Jackson, 494 So. 2d 348 (Miss. 1986).

       Where town residents filed a cross-petition seeking to be excluded from the existing corporate limits in a proceeding for confirmation of an ordinance extending the city boundaries, the cross-petition was properly dismissed; a proceeding by inhabitants of any territory which is part of an existing municipality to be excluded therefrom is entirely separate, apart from, and not germane to the proceeding of a municipality to enlarge or contract its boundaries.

   Because petitioner was the only qualified elector residing within the proposed inclusion area at the time petitions for inclusion were filed, the chancellor was correct in finding the two-thirds requirement for qualified electors of any area adjacent to an existing municipality to file a petition for inclusion, as set out in Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t21c01s21-1-45" target="_self">21-1-45</a></cite>, was met. Farrell v. Babb (In re Inclusion into Oxford), 142 So.3d 401, 2014 Miss. LEXIS 323 (Miss. 2014).

     </h3>
     <p>
      Upon the filing of such a petition, all of the proceedings of this chapter with regard to proceedings in the chancery court upon petitions for the creation, enlargement, and contraction of municipalities shall apply in like manner thereto. Notice of the filing of such petition and the time for the hearing shall be given in the manner and for the length of time as is required in cases of proceedings for the creation, enlargement, or contraction of a municipality. Any parties to the proceedings aggrieved by the decree of the chancellor may appeal therefrom in the same manner and within the same time as is provided in cases of decrees on petitions involving the creation, enlargement or contraction of a municipal corporation. In all proceedings under this section, however, the municipal corporation involved shall be made a party to such proceedings and shall be served with process in the manner provided by law at least thirty days prior to the date of the hearing. If the chancellor finds from the evidence that the proposed inclusion or exclusion is reasonable and is required by the public convenience and necessity, then he shall enter a decree declaring the territory in question to be included in or excluded from the municipality, as the case may be, which decree shall contain an adjudication of the boundaries of the municipality as altered. In so doing, the chancellor shall have the right and power to modify the proposed enlargement or contraction by decreasing the territory to be included in or excluded from the municipality, as the case may be. If the chancellor shall find from the evidence that the proposed inclusion or exclusion, as the case may be, is unreasonable and is not required by the public convenience and necessity, then he shall enter a decree denying same. In any event, the decree of the chancellor shall become effective after the passage of ten days from the date thereof or, in the event an appeal is taken therefrom, within ten days from the final determination of such appeal. In all cases where territory is included in or excluded from a municipality under the provisions hereof, a certified copy of the decree of the chancellor shall be sent to the Secretary of State and a map or plat of the boundaries of the municipality as altered shall be filed with the chancery clerk, all as provided in Sections 21-1-39 and 21-1-41.

     <p>
      In the event any census taken under an act of congress shall show that any municipality contains less than fifty (50) inhabitants, then such municipality shall be automatically abolished and all its rights and powers as a municipal corporation shall thereupon cease. In such cases it shall be the duty of the secretary of state to make an appropriate notation on the records of such municipal corporation in his office showing that such municipal corporation has been abolished because of having less than fifty (50) inhabitants, and he shall forthwith send a notice to the municipal authorities advising them of such fact, and shall send a copy of the notice to the chancery clerk of the county in which such municipality is located. However, the failure of the secretary of state to make such notation or to send such notice shall not prevent the abolition of such municipal corporation as is herein provided, but such abolition shall result automatically from the fact that the census shows that such municipal corporation has less than fifty (50) inhabitants. Any municipality having not less than fifty (50) inhabitants and having heretofore been abolished under the federal census of 1970 by operation of language formerly employed in this section providing for such abolition should a municipality contain less than ninety-two (92) inhabitants, is hereby restored to all rights and privileges as a municipality after the most recent governing authority of the municipality gives notice to the secretary of state that such municipality desires to be restored to all rights and privileges as a municipality.

     <p>
      Any municipal corporation having a population of less than one thousand inhabitants, according to the latest available federal census, may be abolished and dissolved in the manner hereinafter provided. In order to abolish or dissolve such a municipality, the mayor and board of aldermen, or other governing authorities of the municipality, shall first adopt an ordinance declaring their intention to abolish or dissolve such municipality, which ordinance shall set forth in full the reason or reasons why such municipality should be abolished and why the public convenience and necessity would be served by the abolition thereof. When such ordinance shall have been adopted, the municipal authorities shall file a petition in the chancery court in which such municipality is located, which said petition shall recite the fact of the adoption of such ordinance and shall pray that the said municipality be abolished and dissolved as provided in such ordinance. A certified copy of said ordinance shall be attached to said petition as an exhibit thereto. All the provisions of this chapter with regard to proceedings in chancery court on petitions for the creation, enlargement and contraction of municipalities shall apply in like manner to the proceedings for the abolition of a municipal corporation. Notice of the filing of said petition and the time for the hearing thereof shall be given in the manner and for the length of time as is required in cases of petitions for the creation, enlargement or contraction of municipalities. Parties aggrieved by the decree of the chancellor may appeal from such decree in the same manner and within the same time as is provided in cases of decrees on petitions involving the creation, enlargement or contraction of a municipal corporation. If the chancellor shall find from the evidence that the proposed abolition is reasonable and will serve the public convenience and necessity, he shall enter his decree declaring the said municipal corporation to be dissolved and abolished, and said decree shall become effective after the passage of ten days from the date thereof, except in cases of appeal in which cases the decree shall become effective after the passage of ten days from the final determination of the appeal. If the chancellor shall find from the evidence that the proposed abolition is unreasonable and is not required by the public convenience and necessity, he shall enter his decree denying such abolition. The hearing provided for herein may be held either in term time or in vacation.
     </p>
     <p>
      Whenever a municipal corporation shall be so abolished, the chancery clerk shall, after the expiration of ten days from the date of such decree, if no appeal be taken therefrom, forward to the secretary of state a certified copy of such decree, which shall be filed in the office of the Secretary of State and remain a permanent record thereof. The secretary of state shall note on his official records pertaining to such municipal corporation the fact that such corporation has been so abolished. In the event an appeal be taken from such decree and such decree be affirmed, then the certified copy thereof shall be forwarded to the secretary of state within ten days after the receipt of the mandate from the supreme court notifying the clerk of such affirmance.

     <p>
      The abolition of a municipal corporation under any of the provisions of this chapter shall not relieve the property thereof of liability for the debts of the municipality, but the governing authorities of the municipality shall forthwith make up a statement of the indebtedness of the municipality, if any, and a statement of its assets, and shall certify the same and deliver such statement, together with the records of the municipality, to the chancery clerk of the county in which the municipality is located. The board of supervisors of the county shall levy a special tax upon the property embraced in such municipality so abolished, which shall be in force from year to year so long as may be necessary, and such tax shall be collected by the tax collector of the county. The tax collector shall deposit the funds derived from such levy in a special account in the county treasury, and the same shall be paid to the creditors of such municipality upon order and allowance of claims by the board of supervisors. When all of the indebtedness of the municipality shall have been paid, then such special levy shall be discontinued.

     <p>
      Any municipality not now operating under a “Code Charter” may acquire such charter and come under the provisions of this chapter by a majority vote of the electors therein, cast at a general or special election held for such purpose. At such election, the propositions to be voted on shall be “FOR THE CODE CHARTER” and “AGAINST THE CODE CHARTER.” If a majority of the legal votes cast are in favor of adopting the code charter, then the municipality shall be subject to and governed by all the following provisions of this chapter, and the result of the election shall be certified to the secretary of state, who shall make a record of same in his office. If a majority of the votes cast shall be against the code charter, the municipal authorities shall so enter of record, and another election submitting the question shall not be held within four years thereafter. After the rejection of the provisions of the code charter by a municipality, and until its acceptance thereof as herein provided, the corporate powers, rights and franchises thereof shall be and remain as now provided by law.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The elective officers of all municipalities operating under a code charter shall be the mayor, the aldermen, municipal judge, the marshal or chief of police, the tax collector and the tax assessor. From and after July 1, 2017, the governing authorities of the municipality shall appoint a city or town clerk who shall likewise serve as an officer of the municipality. However, the governing authorities of the municipality shall have the power, by ordinance, to combine the office of clerk or marshal with the office of tax collector and/or tax assessor. Such governing authorities shall have the further power to provide that all or any of such officers, except those of mayor and aldermen, shall be appointive, in which case the marshal or chief of police, the tax collector, the tax assessor, and the city or town clerk, or such of such officers as may be made appointive, shall be appointed by the governing authorities. Any action taken by the governing authorities to make any of such offices appointive shall be by ordinance of such municipality, and no such ordinance shall be adopted within ninety (90) days prior to any regular general election for the election of municipal officers. No such ordinance shall become effective during the term of office of any officer whose office shall be affected thereby. If any such office is made appointive, the person appointed thereto shall hold office at the pleasure of the governing authorities and may be discharged by such governing authorities at any time, either with or without cause, and it shall be discretionary with the governing authorities whether or not to require such person appointed thereto to reside within the corporate limits of the municipality in order to hold such office.

      <p>
       Pursuant to Section 1-1-109, the Joint Legislative Committee on Compilation, Revision and Publication of Legislation corrected a typographical error in this section. The word “such” was deleted so that “...appointed by the such governing authorities” would read as “... appointed by the governing authorities” in the fourth sentence.
   The Joint Committee ratified the correction at its August 5, 2016, meeting.

       Mayor of a city was entitled to terminate a former municipal judge, with or without cause at any time, because the judge, who was an appointed municipal judge, was an at-will employee. Moreover, an employee handbook which stated in its introduction that nothing in the handbook implied or assured employment or created an employment contract did not alter the at-will status of the employment relationship.

   Pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t21c03s21-3-3" target="_self">21-3-3</a></cite>, the Chief of Police is an elected position unless a municipality makes it an appointive position. An elected Chief of Police must be a qualified elector of the municipality and is therefore required by statute to reside within the corporate limits. A municipality that has made the Chief of Police an appointive position has the discretion to require or not require the Chief of Police to reside within the corporate limits. Noble, February 9, 2007, A.G. Op. #07-00043, 2007 Miss. AG LEXIS 16.
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   There is no authority for municipal governing authorities to remove or suspend an elected police chief based on an indictment. A municipal governing authority may make the police chief or other municipal officers appointive, rather than elective, by adopting an ordnance, not within 90 days of an election, that will become effective when the current officer’s term expires. If an elected Chief of Police resigns or is disqualified from his position and the remainder of the term is over 6 months, the City must hold a special election to fill the vacancy pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.23.html#t23c15s23-15-857" target="_blank">23-15-857</a></cite>. Elliott, March 23, 2007, A.G. Op. #07-00137, 2007 Miss. AG LEXIS 116.

   The Chief of Police must be included in the civil service system of the city of Ocean Springs because the more specific provisions of Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t21c31s21-31-13" target="_self">21-31-13</a></cite>, concerning civil service systems in a handful of described municipalities, control over the more general provisions of Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t21c03s21-3-3" target="_self">21-3-3</a></cite>, which applies to all code charter municipalities in Mississippi. Edwards, March 30, 2007, A.G. Op. #07-00152, 2007 Miss. AG LEXIS 134.
      </p>
      <p>
       Authority to hire, fire, set compensation, and define duties of municipal employees rests solely with the board of aldermen, subject to mayoral veto power. Whether a part-time police chief is sufficient to satisfy the municipality’s statutory duty to provide police protection is a factual determination to be made by the governing authority. If a municipality does not have a police chief, the board of aldermen must appoint one. An untrained part-time police officer is a law enforcement trainee who must be supervised by a certified officer and has two years from hiring to become certified. McLain, March 2, 2007, A.G. Op. #07-00069, 2007 Miss. AG LEXIS 82.
      </p>
      <p>
       Authority to hire and fire municipal employees rests solely with the Board of Aldermen, subject to mayoral veto power. The mayor may not instruct employees to disregard the official actions of the Board, and may not hire or fire municipal employees. A Board of Aldermen may adopt uniformly applied work schedule policies providing for overtime pay and such pay may only be made when there is a policy authorizing it. Reynolds, March 30, 2007, A.G. Op. #07-00155, 2007 Miss. AG LEXIS 68.

     <p>
      From and after the expiration of the terms of office of present municipal officers, the mayor and board of aldermen of all municipalities operating under this chapter shall have the power and authority to appoint a street commissioner, and such other officers and employees as may be necessary, and to prescribe the duties and fix the compensation of all such officers and employees. All officers and employees so appointed shall hold office at the pleasure of the governing authorities and may be discharged by such governing authorities at any time, either with or without cause. The governing authorities of municipalities shall have the power and authority, in their discretion, to appoint the same person to any two (2) or more of the appointive offices, and in a municipality having a population of less than fifteen thousand (15,000), according to the latest available federal census, a member of the board of aldermen may be appointed to the office of street commissioner. In municipalities not having depositories, the clerk shall serve as ex officio treasurer. The municipal governing authorities shall require all officers and employees handling or having the custody of any public funds of such city to give bond, with sufficient surety, to be payable, conditioned and approved as provided by law, in an amount to be determined by the governing authority (which shall be not less than Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000.00)), the premium on same to be paid from the municipal treasury. The terms of office or employment of all officers and employees so appointed shall expire at the expiration of the term of office of the governing authorities making the appointment, unless such officers or employees shall have been sooner discharged as herein provided. All officers and employees so appointed are authorized to serve until the appointment and qualification of their successors not exceeding the limitation period provided in Section 21-15-41.

   Grant of defendants’ summary judgment in an action for, inter alia, wrongful termination/suspension and intentional infliction of emotional distress by an individual was affirmed, as the individual was an at-will employee under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t21c03s21-3-5" target="_self">21-3-5</a></cite>, the employee manual did not create an exception to his at-will employment, and his termination was not so outrageous in character and so extreme in degree as to go beyond all possible bounds of decency.

       <p>
   In civil rights action filed by plaintiff as a class action on behalf of all municipal employees subjected to summary dismissal and alleging a property interest in continued employment, city was not liable for the summary termination of officer in violation of his due process rights, notwithstanding city ordinance which established certain rules of conduct for police officers and, providing in part, that “any member of the department guilty of violating these rules and regulations will be subject to reprimand, suspension or dismissal”; such ordinance did not give city police employees protected property interest in their employment by limiting right of the city to discharge for violations of such rules and regulations, nor did the rules and regulations dealing with police conduct create a mutually explicit understanding, independent of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t21c03s21-3-5" target="_self">21-3-5</a></cite>, which provides that employees of municipalities serve at the pleasure of governing authorities and could be terminated with or without cause.

      <p>
       If the governing authorities of a municipality operating under code charter have acted in bad faith, or if the salary increase had been an arbitrary or unreasonable one in relation to the resources of the town and duties of the officers, then the court would exercise supervisory power to correct such abuse.

       Mayor of a city was entitled to terminate a former municipal judge, with or without cause at any time, because the judge, who was an appointed municipal judge, was an at-will employee. Moreover, an employee handbook which stated in its introduction that nothing in the handbook implied or assured employment or created an employment contract did not alter the at-will status of the employment relationship.

      <p>
       A Board of Aldermen is the legislative body of the city and may adopt personnel policies and procedures which govern departmental employees and equipment, including limits on the number of hours worked in a week, so long as they are applied uniformly. The Mayor is the chief executive officer of the municipality and has superintending control of the officers and affairs of the municipality as well as the responsibility of enforcing the laws and ordinances of the municipality. Taylor, February 23, 2007, A.G. Op. #07-00078, 2007 Miss. AG LEXIS 31.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both the mayor and the aldermen have the authority to place items on the agenda, but only the board of aldermen may remove matters from the agenda, establish the order of the agenda, control the manner in which the agenda is developed, and determine who is allowed to be present during an executive session.

      </p>
      <p>
       Neither the mayor nor the board of aldermen may become involved in the daily operations of the police department, supervise officers, or direct the police chief’s supervision of law enforcement. The board of aldermen has authority to appoint, hire, and fire municipal officers and employees, fix their compensation, prescribe their duties, and adopt personnel policies and procedures, subject to the mayor’s veto. Sullivan, March 16, 2007, A.G. Op. #07-00115, 2007 Miss. AG LEXIS 111.
      </p>
      <p>
       Authority to hire, fire, set compensation, and define duties of municipal employees rests solely with the board of aldermen, subject to mayoral veto power. Whether a part-time police chief is sufficient to satisfy the municipality’s statutory duty to provide police protection is a factual determination to be made by the governing authority. If a municipality does not have a police chief, the board of aldermen must appoint one. An untrained part-time police officer is a law enforcement trainee who must be supervised by a certified officer and has two years from hiring to become certified. McLain, March 2, 2007, A.G. Op. #07-00069, 2007 Miss. AG LEXIS 82.
      </p>
      <p>
       Authority to hire and fire municipal employees rests solely with the Board of Aldermen, subject to mayoral veto power. The mayor may not instruct employees to disregard the official actions of the Board, and may not hire or fire municipal employees. A Board of Aldermen may adopt uniformly applied work schedule policies providing for overtime pay and such pay may only be made when there is a policy authorizing it. Reynolds, March 30, 2007, A.G. Op. #07-00155, 2007 Miss. AG LEXIS 68.

       This section, as enacted by Section 1 of Chapter 537, Laws of 1962, was held unconstitutional in Stewart v. Waller, 404 F. Supp. 206 (N.D. Miss. 1975), and a prior version of the section, enacted by Section 36 of Chapter 491, Laws of 1950 and codified as § 3374-36, Mississippi Code of 1942, was given full force and effect by the court. The section as adopted in 1962 is published here as there has been no legislative action taken to change the law since the court’s decision.

   A change by the City of Canton, Mississippi from ward to at-large elections of city aldermen constituted a change in a voting standard, practice, or procedure after November 1, 1964, within the federal approval requirement of § 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (42 USC § 1973c), notwithstanding that the 1962 state statute, Code 1942, § 3374-36, required such at-large elections, where the city had ignored the state statute by electing aldermen by wards in 1965 elections, and where there was no change between November 1, 1964 and the 1965 elections to suggest that a different procedure would have been in effect on the earlier date, thus establishing that the procedure in fact “in force or effect” in the city on November 1, 1964, was to elect aldermen by wards.

      <p>
       When mayor pro tempore is presiding at meeting of municipal governing authorities in temporary absence of mayor, mayor pro tempore is acting as mayor with duties and powers of code charter mayor and not as alderman; when alderman is serving as mayor pro tempore, he has only voting powers of mayor set forth in statute and may not vote as alderman; two-thirds vote of five member board of aldermen necessary to override code charter mayor’s veto requires votes of four aldermen voting as aldermen, exclusive of one alderman serving as mayor pro tempore. Bailey, Sept. 26, 1990, A.G. Op. #90-0728.
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
       Generally, statutes governing Mayor/Aldermen or “code charter” form of government, empower board of aldermen to set policy through enactment of ordinances, orders and resolutions, all subject to Mayor’s veto; mayor, as chief executive officer, oversees daily operation of municipal government and makes recommendations to board.

      <p>
       A mayor did not have authority to veto a decision of the board to reinstate a fireman who the mayor had demoted without a change in compensation; “superintending control” in subsection (1) means that the mayor, as the chief executive officer, has general supervisory oversight of municipal government, but department heads, such as the police and fire chief, have authority and responsibility to make decisions concerning the daily operations of their departments. Fernald, February 19, 1999, A.G. Op. #99-0085.

       The mayor may request attendance but may not force attendance at a weekly staff meeting of an elected police chief. Lee, Jan. 3, 2003, A.G. Op. #02-0749.
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
       Residents of a municipality may meet with the mayor to discuss any matter pertaining to the operation of the municipality, including police protection, and the mayor may meet with the police chief or police officers to gather information concerning operation of the police department and may also direct residents to communicate with the police chief concerning police protection generally or specific ongoing situations in law enforcement.

      </p>
      <p>
       If the board of aldermen adopts an ordinance at a meeting with the mayor pro tempore presiding and if the mayor pro tempore does not either veto or approve the ordinance, then the mayor may veto the ordinance upon his or her return within the statutory period.

      </p>
      <p>
       Where a mayor’s handwritten veto message containing the reasons for a veto was delivered within the ten day deadline for doing so, the lack of a signature on a subsequently filed typed veto message was not fatal to the validity of the veto. Hudson, Aug. 29, 2003, A.G. Op. 03-0465.

      </p>
      <p>
       To override a mayor’s veto in a code charter municipality having a seven member board, five of the seven members must vote to override. When one of those seven members is serving as mayor pro tempore, the five votes needed must come from the remaining six voting members of the board. Rutledge, Jan. 6, 2004, A.G. Op. 03-0690.
      </p>
      <p>
       A mayor can cast the deciding vote in a tie, but he can also veto an ordinance, order or resolution regardless of how many aldermen initially vote in favor. In the case of a five member board of aldermen, in order to override the mayor’s veto, four aldermen must vote in favor of overriding the mayor in order for the ordinance, order or resolution to take effect. Edwards, Apr. 16, 2004, A.G. Op. 04-0154.
      </p>
      <p>
       The mayor of a code-charter municipality would have the authority to veto an order of the board of aldermen to enter into a contract or to terminate a contract. The mayor would not have the authority to veto the decision of the board not to enter into a contract. Further, if a contract is due to expire on its own terms, and the board decides not to renew that contract, that decision is not appropriate for mayoral veto. A municipal board of aldermen can override the mayor’s veto with a 2/3 vote of all members (4 out of 5). Brown, July 1, 2004, A.G. Op. 04-0280.
      </p>
      <p>
       A resolution of the board of aldermen to conduct a referendum on the question of naming the city hall is an affirmative action of the board, and thus is subject to veto by the mayor. McLaurin, July 16 2004, A.G. Op. 04-0356.
      </p>
      <p>
       The mayor does not have the sole right to remove matters from the agenda, or to establish the order of the agenda, or to control the manner in which the agenda is developed, in that a majority of the board of aldermen control the agenda. Young, Aug. 6, 2004, A.G. Op. 04-0390.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a department head, the city clerk is subject to the supervision of the mayor. If the clerk refuses to provide to the mayor information related to the agenda, after being asked to do so, the clerk may be disciplined in accordance with policies adopted by the governing authorities. Young, Aug. 6, 2004, A.G. Op. 04-0390.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless the charter of a special charter municipality provides otherwise, both the mayor and aldermen are entitled to place matters on the agenda for meetings. Cook, Oct. 29, 2004, A.G. Op. 04-0526.
      </p>
      <p>
       A mayor in a municipality operating under a mayor/alderman form of government has 10 days after receiving any ordinance in which to exercise his or her right to veto. The fifteen 15 day period referenced in the statute only comes into play where a mayor has not exercised his or her veto power within the ten day period, and also fails to sign the ordinance and return it to the board within that time period. In that instance, the ordinance may become effective without the mayor’s signature. Young, Feb. 14, 2005, A.G. Op. 05-0051.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pursuant to Section 21-3-15, action to override a veto cannot occur sooner than three days after the delivery of the veto message to the board by the mayor. It is suggested that override of a mayoral veto is a proper subject for a special meeting to avoid undue delay in finalizing any ordinances, orders or resolutions which may have been the subject of the veto. Wiggins, July 29, 2005, A.G. Op. 05-0385.
      </p>
      <p>
       In municipalities in which the mayor has been given no role in the approval of the minutes of the governing authority, “receipt” for purposes of Section 21-3-15 is the meeting in which the minutes are presented for approval by the board of aldermen. The 10 days would begin to run from the date of the meeting at which the minutes are approved. In municipalities in which the authority to approve the minutes has been delegated to the mayor, the 10-day period begins to run at the time the clerk presents the minutes to the mayor. Wiggins, July 29, 2005, A.G. Op. 05-0385.
      </p>
      <p>
       The authority of the mayor of a code charter municipality to veto ordinances, resolutions and orders includes the appointment of municipal officials. Cole, July 29, 2005, A.G. Op. 05-0374.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a code charter municipality with five aldermen, four aldermen may hold a meeting and may take official action without the presence of the mayor or the mayor pro tempore. Four aldermen may meet and may take official action with three aldermen constituting a quorum and one aldermen serving as mayor pro tempore for the meeting. Brown,
   Aug. 11, 2005, A.G. Op. 05-0399.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the statute prescribes no time frame in which the board of aldermen is to act to override a veto, a board must act to override not later than the next lawfully convened regular or special meeting of the governing authority. Brown, Aug. 11, 2005,
   A.G. Op. 05-0400.
      </p>
      <p>
       The person appointed by the board of aldermen is not entitled to continue to serve after a mayoral veto of that appointment. If the veto is overridden, the appointment is valid. Brown, Aug. 11, 2005,
   A.G. Op. 05-0400.
      </p>
      <p>
       The municipal clerk has no authority to preside over a meeting of the governing authorities. Brown,
   Aug. 11, 2005,
   A.G. Op. 05-0400.
      </p>
      <p>
       When acting as mayor pro tem, an alderman in a code-charter municipality may only exercise the authority of the mayor to vote, that is, in the case of a tie. Brooks, Feb. 3, 2006, A.G. Op. 06-0029.
      </p>
      <p>
       A mayor has the authority to enact policies related to the overall supervision of employees and department heads and to give directives to the employees or department heads regarding their duties. To the extent, however, that a policy or directive adversely impacts the ability of the legislative branch to obtain information necessary to make decisions and to carry out the business of the city, such policies would be contrary to the statutory scheme set out for the mayor/alderman form of government. Goddard, June 16, 2006, A.G. Op. 06-0248.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless of whether the city board is or is not in official session, individual members of a board of aldermen have no authority to direct the daily activities of municipal employees. Hurt, Oct. 13, 2006, A.G. Op. 06-0499.
      </p>
      <p>
       A Board of Aldermen is the legislative body of the city and may adopt personnel policies and procedures which govern departmental employees and equipment, including limits on the number of hours worked in a week, so long as they are applied uniformly. The Mayor is the chief executive officer of the municipality and has superintending control of the officers and affairs of the municipality as well as the responsibility of enforcing the laws and ordinances of the municipality. Taylor, February 23, 2007, A.G. Op. #07-00078, 2007 Miss. AG LEXIS 31.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both the mayor and the aldermen have the authority to place items on the agenda, but only the board of aldermen may remove matters from the agenda, establish the order of the agenda, control the manner in which the agenda is developed, and determine who is allowed to be present during an executive session. Sullivan, March 16, 2007, A.G. Op. #07-00115, 2007 Miss. AG LEXIS 111.
      </p>
      <p>
       Neither the mayor nor the board of aldermen may become involved in the daily operations of the police department, supervise officers, or direct the police chief’s supervision of law enforcement. The board of aldermen has authority to appoint, hire, and fire municipal officers and employees, fix their compensation, prescribe their duties, and adopt personnel policies and procedures, subject to the mayor’s veto. Sullivan, March 16, 2007, A.G. Op. #07-00115, 2007 Miss. AG LEXIS 111.
      </p>
      <p>
       Authority to hire and fire municipal employees rests solely with the Board of Aldermen, subject to mayoral veto power. The mayor may not instruct employees to disregard the official actions of the Board, and may not hire or fire municipal employees. A Board of Aldermen may adopt uniformly applied work schedule policies providing for overtime pay and such pay may only be made when there is a policy authorizing it. Reynolds, March 30, 2007, A.G. Op. #07-00155, 2007 Miss. AG LEXIS 68.

    Adoption of commission form of government.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Any city may at any time, upon an election held as hereinafter provided, change the form of government of such city and adopt a commission form of government. It shall be the duty of the governing authorities of any such city to call a special election on the question of the adoption of the commission form of government upon receipt of a petition signed by at least ten per cent of the qualified electors of such city, praying that an election be held to determine whether or not such city shall abandon its existing form of government and adopt the commission form. Such special election shall be held in such city not less than thirty days, nor more than sixty days, from the date of making such order, but if a general election is to be held in such city within sixty days from the making of such order, then the question of the adoption of the commission form of government shall be submitted at such general election, rather than at a special election. Notice of such election shall be given as required by law, and the same shall be held and conducted as other elections in such city. At such election the propositions to be voted on shall be “FOR THE PRESENT FORM OF GOVERNMENT,” and “FOR THE COMMISSION FORM OF GOVERNMENT.” Such propositions shall be printed on the ballot and the elector shall vote by placing a cross (X) or check mark (Π) opposite his choice on the proposition. The results of such election shall be certified to the governing authorities of the city by the persons holding such election, and at their next regular meeting the governing authorities shall adjudicate on the minutes of the city whether or not the majority of the votes cast at such election were cast in favor of the commission form of government. If a majority of the votes were so cast in favor of the commission form of government, then an order shall be entered providing for the election of officers provided for by this chapter at an election to be held on the first Tuesday after the first Monday of June next thereafter. The mayor or chief executive officer of the city shall immediately certify to the secretary of state that such city has by election adopted the commission form of government, and such certificate shall be recorded in a book kept for that purpose by the secretary of state. If a majority of the votes cast at such election be in favor of the existing form of government, the governing authorities shall so adjudicate by an order upon their minutes, and another election submitting the question of the adoption of the commission form of government shall not be held for a period of at least four years thereafter.

       The City of Greenwood’s commission form of government with three council members elected at large violates Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, as amended in 1982, 42 U.S.C.S.
   § 1973 (Supp. 1983); evidence establishes almost every element of proof delineated by Congress as probative of a Section 2 violation, and from a totality of the circumstances, it is inescapably clear that the black voters of Greenwood have less opportunity than whites to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice; the court therefore must require the establishment of single-member districts for the City of Greenwood.

    Operation of government under commission form.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Every city operating under the commission form of government shall be governed by a council, consisting of the mayor and two (2) councilmen (or commissioners), each of whom shall have the right to vote on all questions coming before the council. The terms of office of the governing authorities in every such city, in office at the beginning of the term of office of the mayor and councilmen first elected under the provisions of this chapter shall then immediately cease and terminate. The terms of office of all other officers then in force in such city, whether elected or appointed, shall cease and terminate as soon as the council shall, by resolution, so declare.
     </p>
     <p>
      The corporate name of every such city shall be “The City of (name of city),” under which name the council shall exercise and perform all the corporate powers, duties and obligations conferred or imposed on it or the members thereof.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any city having a population of one hundred thousand (100,000) inhabitants according to the last decennial census and at that time governed by the commission form of government, may at any time, upon an election held as hereinafter provided, increase by two (2) the number of councilmen governing such city; provided that in no event shall the number of councilmen (not including the mayor) be increased to exceed ten (10) members. It shall be the duty of the council to call a special election on the question of the increase in the number of councilmen and upon receipt of a petition signed by at least ten percent (10%) of the qualified electors of such city, praying that an election be held to determine whether or not such city should increase by two (2) the number of councilmen under the commission form, and such special election shall be held in such city not less than thirty (30) days, nor more than sixty (60) days, from the date of making such order; but if a general election is to be held in such city within sixty (60) days from the making of such order, then the question of the increase in number of councilmen shall be submitted at such general election, rather than at a special election. Notice of such election shall be given as required by law, and the same shall be held and conducted as other elections in such city. At such election the propositions to be voted on shall be “FOR THE PRESENT NUMBER OF COUNCILMEN” and “FOR AN INCREASE BY TWO (2) IN THE NUMBER OF COUNCILMEN,” and such propositions shall be printed on the ballot and the elector shall vote by placing a cross (X) or check mark (Π) opposite his choice on the proposition. The results of such election shall be certified to the governing authorities of the city by the persons holding such election, and at their next regular meeting the governing authorities shall adjudicate on the minutes of the city whether or not the majority of the votes cast at such election were cast in favor of increasing by two (2) the number of councilmen. If a majority of the votes were so cast in favor of increasing by two (2) the number of councilmen in the commission form of government, then an order shall be entered providing for the election of the two (2) additional councilmen at an election to be held on the first Tuesday after the first Monday of June next thereafter. The mayor of the city shall immediately certify to the secretary of state that such city has by election determined to be governed by two (2) additional councilmen in the commission form of government and such certificate shall be recorded in a book kept for that purpose by the secretary of state. If a majority of the votes cast at such election be in favor of retaining the existing number of councilmen, the council shall so adjudicate by an order upon their minutes, and another election submitting the question of the increasing by two (2) the number of councilmen in the commission form of government shall not be held for a period of at least four (4) years thereafter.

     <p>
      The mayor and councilmen (or commissioners) of all cities operated under the commission form of government shall be elected from the city at large, but the municipal authorities may establish as many wards and as many voting precincts in each ward as may be necessary or desirable. No person shall be eligible to the office of mayor or councilman unless he is a qualified elector of such city and shall have been a bona fide resident thereof for a period of at least one year next preceding the date of the commencement of his term of office.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the event the council should ordain that the councilmen posts shall be separated, as provided in Section 21-5-11, such post shall be so separated for election purposes and persons seeking the office of councilman shall qualify and seek election for a specific post, as designated by ordinance, and each post shall be voted on separately by the qualified electors of the municipality voting in said election.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the event there should be but one candidate for one of such election posts, or only one candidate for each of such posts, then such candidate or candidates shall be declared to be elected.

       § 21-5-15.
    Fixing of salaries.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      At the first regular meeting of the council that is first elected, or as soon thereafter as practicable, the council shall, by ordinance, fix the salary of the mayor and each of the councilmen (or commissioners), which ordinance shall not become operative until the same shall have been approved by a majority of the qualified electors voting at an election to be held for that purpose, as provided by this section. Said ordinance shall be published in a newspaper published in said city, and having a general circulation therein, for at least ten days before such election, and notice of the date of such election shall be given by the council for ten days by publication in a newspaper published in such city, and having general circulation therein. In case such ordinance shall be rejected by the electors at such election, then a new ordinance, or ordinances, may be passed by the council and submitted to the electors in like manner, until the same shall have been ratified by the electors. When an ordinance so fixing the salaries shall have been finally adopted and approved, the salaries so fixed shall remain in effect until altered or changed in the manner hereinafter provided.
     </p>
     <p>
      To reduce the salary so fixed it shall be sufficient that the council adopt an ordinance to that effect, which ordinance shall become effective upon adoption without the necessity of publication or of an election. To increase the salary so fixed, an ordinance shall be duly adopted, by the council, which ordinance shall be published for ten days in a newspaper published or having a general circulation in such city, and the ordinance shall not become effective until it shall have been approved by a majority of the qualified electors of such city voting at an election to be held for that purpose after notice of such election shall have been given by the council for ten days by publication in a newspaper published in such city or having a general circulation therein, the last notice to appear not more than one week next prior to the date of the election.
     </p>
     <p>
      Every officer or assistant, other than the mayor and councilmen, shall receive such salary or compensation as the council shall by ordinance provide. The salary or compensation of all other employees of such city shall be fixed by the council from time to time, as occasion may demand.

       The action of the mayor and councilmen of a municipality in placing the order on the minutes of the city council, signifying their desire and purpose to exercise the power conferred by statute of reducing their salaries to a certain sum per month, and in their answer evidencing such intention by accepting a warrant each month for such reduced amount over a considerable period of time, constituted a substantial compliance with the provisions of the statute and was sufficient to effectuate the reduction of their salaries. Chinn v. Biloxi, 183 Miss. 27, 183 So. 375, 1938 Miss. LEXIS 213 (Miss. 1938).
      </p>
      <p>
       The word “ordinance” as used in the statute does not contemplate an ordinance to be published and then enrolled in the ordinance book, and the act of recording a reduction in salary of the mayor and councilmen of a municipality on the minutes of the civic council was a sufficient “ordinance” within the meaning of the statute. Chinn v. Biloxi, 183 Miss. 27, 183 So. 375, 1938 Miss. LEXIS 213 (Miss. 1938).
      </p>
      <p>
       It is the duty of the commissioners to fix the salary of the mayor and councilmen permanently and they have no power to bind the salary to one year, and the ordinance fixing salaries shall not be altered or repealed unless approved by the qualified electors of the city. Lewis v. Jane, 129 Miss. 475, 92 So. 625, 1922 Miss. LEXIS 67 (Miss. 1922).

       § 21-7-5.
    Procedure for adoption or abandonment of plan.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The manner in which any municipality, within the class provided in Section 21-7-1 may change its form of government to the plan authorized herein, shall be as follows:
     </p>
     <p>
      One or more petitions, similar in form and substance, addressed to the mayor praying that an election be held to determine whether or not such city shall abandon its existing form of government and become organized under a council form of government, signed by at least twenty per centum of the qualified electors of such city, shall be filed with the city clerk, who shall deal with the same as required with reference to other petitions.
     </p>
     <p>
      If on the delivery of such petition to the mayor, it shall appear that such petition or petitions have not been signed by the required number of qualified electors of such city, the mayor shall at once certify such fact and immediately return such petition or petitions to the person or persons presenting the same, who may thereafter procure additional signers thereto and again file such petition or petitions with the city clerk, as above provided, as an original petition.
     </p>
     <p>
      If it shall appear at any time from the certificate of the city clerk that said petition or petitions have been signed by the requisite number of qualified electors of said city, the mayor shall immediately refer the same to the board of aldermen. If it shall appear that said petition or petitions are in proper form and have been sufficiently signed by the qualified electors of such city, they shall, within thirty days, order, and provide, for the holding of a special election in such city, to be held, not less than thirty, nor more than sixty days, from the date of making such order, notice of which election shall be given, and the same shall be held and conducted as other elections in such city. At such special election the propositions to be voted for shall be: “FOR THE COUNCIL FORM OF GOVERNMENT” and “FOR THE PRESENT FORM OF GOVERNMENT,” which propositions shall be printed on the official ballot at such election. As soon as the return of such election shall have been certified by the persons holding the same, the board of aldermen shall at their next regular meeting, consider the same, and if a majority of the votes cast at such election, are in favor of the council form of government, then they shall enter an order providing for the election of a mayor, a vice-mayor and five other councilmen provided for under Section 21-7-7, at an election to be held on the second Tuesday in December next before the expiration of the terms of the municipal officers then holding office. Thereupon the said petition or petitions, and all proceedings had thereon, including an order of the mayor and board of aldermen that the form of government will be changed on the first Monday of January following the expiration of their term of office, shall be recorded in the ordinance book of such city, which record shall be evidence of all the matters and things therein contained. The mayor of such city shall immediately certify to the secretary of state that such city by special election has adopted the system of government provided for herein, which certificate shall be recorded in a book kept for that purpose by the secretary of state. In case it shall appear by said election returns that a majority of the votes cast at such election were in favor of the existing form of government, then the board of aldermen shall dismiss the petition, in which case no similar petition shall be filed for a period of one year from the date of such order, but nothing short of such election shall preclude the filing of the petition at any time.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any city which shall have operated for more than two years under the council form of government may abandon such form of government and return to the code charter form of government by substantially the same procedure through petitions and elections as herein provided for change to the council form of government. Such change, however, shall take effect on the first Monday of January following the expiration of the term of office of the members of the council then holding office.

    Members of the council; their election and compensation.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The governing body of any such municipality shall be a council, known and designated as such, consisting of seven members. One of the members shall be the mayor, having the qualifications as prescribed by Section 21-3-9, who shall have full rights, powers and privileges of other councilmen. The mayor shall be nominated and elected at large; the remaining councilmen shall be nominated and elected one from each ward into which the city shall be divided. However, if the city be divided into less than six wards, the remaining councilmen shall be nominated and elected at large. The councilmen, including the mayor, shall be elected for a term of four years to serve until their successors are elected and qualified in accordance with the provisions of Section 21-11-7, said term commencing on the first Monday of January after the municipal election first following the adoption of the form of government as provided by this chapter.
     </p>
     <p>
      The compensation for the members of the council shall, for the first four years of operation, under this chapter, be fixed by the board of mayor and aldermen holding office prior to the change in form of government. Thereafter the amount of compensation for each such member may be increased or decreased by the council, by council action taken prior to the election of members thereof for the ensuing term, such action to become effective with the ensuing terms.

      The full and complete executive and legislative powers of the municipality as vested by law, or inherent, shall be vested in such council. The council, however, may delegate such of its administrative functions as it deems proper and necessary to such officials so elected by it as provided in Section 21-7-15, and in addition may delegate administrative powers and functions to such other person or persons as may be selected by said council in order to carry out its functions, whether municipal or proprietary, which would permit the efficient administration of its municipal affairs. Said council has the right to select, appoint or designate departmental heads, such as but not limited to superintendent of utilities, superintendent of public health and sanitation, superintendent of fire and safety, superintendent of parks and recreation, superintendent of public buildings and grounds, and such other departmental heads as the council may deem best and proper. Said council has the power to fix the compensation of all such persons so selected and to define their duties, obligations and responsibilities. The council shall also require all officers and employees handling or having the custody of any public funds of such city to give bond, with sufficient surety, to be payable, conditioned and approved as provided by law, in an amount to be determined by the council (which shall not be less than Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000.00)). Any and all such persons so selected shall be accountable to the council and shall make report, or reports, to the council so often as is required of them respectively, and may be removed at any time for cause after first having been given an opportunity for a hearing on the reasons for removal. No member of the council shall be eligible for selection to any such office or position.

      The powers and duties heretofore conferred upon the mayor of municipalities by law are hereby conferred upon and charged to the council. The mayor, or in his absence the vice-mayor, shall (a) as chairman preside at all meetings of the council, and shall have veto power, in writing, giving his reasons therefor, of any measure passed by the council, although a measure vetoed may be adopted notwithstanding, if two-thirds of the council vote therefor; (b) represent the municipality in all functions political, social or economic, but he shall in no wise bind the municipality, other than as he may be specifically authorized or delegated to do by the council, as reflected by its orders, resolutions or ordinances; (c) execute for and on behalf of the council, all documents or instruments of writing, of whatever kind and character, under the seal of the municipality, when necessary or required; and (d) act for the municipality as directed by the council, in any manner and for any purpose which by any statute or law, because of its particular wording or meaning, provides for individual action of the mayor rather than body action of the council, wherein and whereby such right of action could not be properly or consistently exercised by the latter, all to the end that any such municipality coming under the provisions of this chapter shall not be denied any of the rights and privileges which any such municipality would enjoy except for the provisions of this chapter. The council shall fix the amount of compensation of the mayor and vice-mayor, for their additional duties as such, which compensation shall be in addition to their compensation as councilmen.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The manner of effecting the change in the government of any such municipality from the form of government under which it is operating to the mayor-council form of government shall be as follows:
     </p>
     <p>
      One (1) or more petitions, similar in form and substance, addressed to the mayor, praying that an election be held to determine whether or not such city shall abandon its existing form of government and become organized under the mayor-council form of government, signed by at least ten percent (10%) of the qualified electors of such municipality, provided, however, that any municipality with population of less than forty thousand (40,000) shall be required to be signed by twenty percent (20%), shall be filed with the municipal clerk who shall, within ten (10) days thereafter, check the signatures thereto with the registration books of the municipality and attach thereto his certificate showing the total number of qualified electors in said municipality and the total number of signatures to said petitions and deliver the same to the mayor. Such petition or petitions shall specify the number of councilmen to be on the council and the number of councilmen to be elected from wards and the number at large, if any.
     </p>
     <p>
      If on the delivery of such petition to the mayor it shall appear that such petition or petitions have not been signed by the required number of qualified electors of such municipality the mayor shall at once certify such fact and immediately return such petition or petitions to the person or persons presenting the same, who may thereafter procure additional signers thereto and again file such petition or petitions with the municipality clerk, as above provided, as an original petition.
     </p>
     <p>
      If it shall at any time appear from the certificate of the municipality clerk that said petition or petitions have been signed by the required number of qualified electors of said municipality, the mayor shall immediately refer the same to the municipality council or board and, if it shall appear that said petition or petitions are in proper form and have been sufficiently signed by the qualified electors of such municipality, the council or board shall within ten (10) days order and provide for the holding of a special election in such municipality not less than twenty (20) days nor more than sixty (60) days from the date of making such order, notice of which shall be given, and the same shall be held and conducted as other elections in such municipality. At such special election the propositions to be voted for shall be: (a) “For the present form of government” and (b) “For the mayor-council form of government.”
     </p>
     <p>
      No petition requesting that an election be held pursuant to the provisions of this chapter shall be presented to the municipality clerk within two (2) years after the date of the last election held pursuant to provisions of this chapter, provided that there is no waiting period for the presentation of a petition for a form of government other than the mayor-council form except that it shall not be presented to the municipality clerk until after the date of an election held pursuant to a previously filed petition.

Code Section<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t21c08s21-8-7ol14d" target="_self">21-8-7(4)(d)</a></cite> are controlling; under this section, where annexation occurs within such time frame, redistricting required by Miss.

       Mere budget resolution does not authorize Mayor to raise employee salaries or, in fact, to expend any municipal funds, without more explicit authorization from Council; governing authority of municipality under Mayor-Council form of government, at least with regards to establishing budget and authorizing expenditure of municipal funds, is City Council.

       Council in mayor/council municipality did not have authority to direct mayor to allocate $100,000 to unspecified streets and capital projects in each ward or to direct mayor to allocate $200,000 for improvements to city buildings and recreational facilities; council could revise budget to increase appropriations for specific projects but council must make appropriations and cannot delegate that authority to mayor because power to appropriate funds through budget is fundamental legislative power.

       Circuit court properly concluded that a city council’s vote did not constitute a majority of the quorum under Miss. Code Ann. 21-8-11, where only two of the four members present at the city council meeting voted to adopt the rezoning ordinance on the property. City of Jackson v. Allen, 242 So.3d 8, 2018 Miss.

       City council members did not have the authority to pursue an appeal from an order of the circuit court which limited the appointment powers of the council and held certain actions taken by the council to be void, and the council members were without standing to maintain the appeal on behalf of the council, where the council did not authorize the appeal by the council members in their official capacity and the record showed that the council was affirmatively against any such action.

       In the continuing absence of an elected council president, the vice-president is the “acting president” of the council. Evans, May 7, 1999, A.G. Op. #99-0507.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether an election will be held to fill the position of president a city council vacated because he was called to active duty in the Mississippi National Guard is a matter which must be determined by the council. The council may choose to do nothing, and thereby allow the vice-president to continue to serve as “acting president.” Alternatively, the council may choose to elect a new president by majority vote. Neville, Dec. 30, 2003, A.G. Op. 03-0702.

       The notice requirements of this section are not binding upon a city is governed by a special charter, and failure to comply with the provisions of this section has no affect on the conduct of a special meeting in the city or the validity of any actions taken at such a meeting.

      <p>
       Council in mayor/council municipality did not have authority to direct mayor to allocate $100,000 to unspecified streets and capital projects in each ward or to direct mayor to allocate $200,000 for improvements to city buildings and recreational facilities; council could revise budget to increase appropriations for specific projects but council must make appropriations and cannot delegate that authority to mayor.

       There is no authority for the city council to appoint or employ a council attorney or attorneys to advise or render legal assistance to the city council.

       Reading Sections 21-8-13(4) and 21-8-27 in pari materia, individual city council members can legally request information and advice from any municipal employee, and if such employee refuses to voluntarily supply the requested information, the council as a whole can compel a response.

       There is no conflict between Sections 21-8-13 and 21-8-27 since the two statutes address different types of communications by the city council with municipal employees. Magee, June 30, 2006, A.G. Op. 06-0274.

       In an election contest filed by a mayor’s opponent, the mayor’s appeal did not have to be dismissed for the city council’s failure to authorize an appeal because (1) no statute required such authorization, and (2) it was not shown that the city council expressly prohibited the appeal.

   Even if the mayor could direct the executive director of the Joint Redevelopment Authority (JRA), it was the JRA commissioners, not its executive director, who made the actual decisions regarding which projects to support; the mayor’s statutory authority to influence the JRA was constrained, and because the city council had policymaking authority over funding, the city was not liable for the mayor’s actions.

       In certain circumstances, such as a vacancy, the mayor may designate an individual to perform the core duties of department director on a temporary basis to ensure that the functions of that department are maintained in the interest of the health and welfare of the citizens; however, as there is no distinction in the statutes between temporary and permanent directors, all appointments to the position of department director whether interim or permanent must receive council approval pursuant to Section 21-8-23(2).

Such acting mayor shall serve until the mayor returns to office or until a new mayor has been elected to fill the unexpired term of the original mayor. A new mayor shall be elected at a special election to be called and held as provided by law for the holding of municipal elections; provided that the acting mayor shall complete the term of the original mayor if a general municipal election is to be held within six (6) months of the determination of the council hereinafter provided for in this section. Prior to the calling of a special election pursuant to this section, the council, by a two-thirds (2/3) vote of all members of the council, shall make a determination that the mayor is incapable of completing his term of office. In the event of the death of the mayor the council shall appoint an acting mayor as provided in this section to serve until a successor is elected. Within thirty (30) days of the mayor’s death the council shall call a special election as provided in this section to elect his successor; provided that the acting mayor shall complete the term of the original mayor if a general municipal election is to be held within six (6) months of the death of the original mayor.

       While there is no specific statutory procedure for reconsideration of matter previously voted on by city council, nothing would prohibit mayor from appointing qualified individual second time after council failed to confirm that individual following his first appointment. Jones, Feb. 21, 1990, A.G. Op. #90-0118.
      </p>
      <p>
       Refusal of city council to confirm Mayor’s appointee is not subject to Mayor’s veto; to say otherwise would have effect of allowing Mayor to use his veto power to obtain confirmation without affirmative vote of majority of council as required by statute. Jones, Feb. 28, 1990, A.G. Op. #90-0156.
      </p>
      <p>
       Statute requires city council confirmation of appointment of Acting Departmental Director whether it is expected to be temporary appointment or otherwise; such appointment which is made and confirmed would then be subject to removal in accordance to statute. Jones, March 16, 1990, A.G. Op. #90-0202.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under Miss. Code Section 21-8-23, city council may establish municipal departments and mayor may appoint director of such departments, subject to confirmation by council; subsection (3) provides that such directors of departments shall be excluded from coverage of any civil service system; there is no requirement that Chief City Attorney be department director appointed by mayor; attorney could simply be staff member of particular department appointed by director of that department under Miss. Code Section 21-8-23(4); as such, attorney could be covered by civil service. Hewes, Mar. 29, 1993, A.G. Op. #92-0952.
      </p>
      <p>
       When mayor of mayor-council city is re-elected to office, mayor should submit his appointments for department directors to city council for confirmation each term, even if those named are current directors. Lawrence, March 9, 1994, A.G. Op. #94-0046.
      </p>
      <p>
       After a majority of the city council members present and voting at a meeting have confirmed an appointment to a board, authority or commission authorized by general legislation, the council members are not empowered to withdraw that confirmation.
   Doty, May 1, 1998, A.G. Op. #98-0228.
      </p>
      <p>
       The city council may amend the ordinance establishing the salary for every municipal employee from time to time as, in the council’s discretion, occasion may demand; further, the salary of every municipal employee must be fixed by such ordinance.
   Wansley, July 10, 1998, A. G. Op. #98-0283.
      </p>
      <p>
       In certain circumstances, such as a vacancy, the mayor may designate an individual to perform the core duties of department director on a temporary basis to ensure that the functions of that department are maintained in the interest of the health and welfare of the citizens; however, as there is no distinction in the statutes between temporary and permanent directors, all appointments to the position of department director whether interim or permanent must receive council approval pursuant to Section 21-8-23(2).
   Doty, Feb. 4, 2000, A.G. Op. #2000-0014.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a mayor does not fulfill his term and resigns or leaves for some other reason and a new mayor comes in to fill the unexpired term of the former mayor, the new mayor must resubmit names of the department heads to the city council for reconfirmation.
   Doty, Feb. 18, 2000, A.G. Op. #2000-0070.
      </p>
      <p>
       The statute requires the mayor to present appointments to the city council for confirmation, but does not specifically state what alternatives the city council may pursue if the mayor does not present appointments to the city council for confirmation. McLemore, Jan. 25, 2002, A.G. Op. #02-0004.
      </p>
      <p>
       As there is no distinction in the statutes between temporary and permanent directors, all appointments to the position of department director, whether interim or permanent, must receive city council approval pursuant to subsection (2). McLemore, Jan. 25, 2002, A.G. Op. #02-0004.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seminar or conference registration fees may be paid for members of appointed boards and commissions, provided those expenses are found to be necessary for the members’ board or commission responsibilities. Myers, Feb. 21, 2003, A.G. Op. #03-0078.
      </p>
      <p>
       A city may pay travel expenses in connection with the attendance at a necessary seminar, conference or workshop. Myers, Feb. 21, 2003, A.G. Op. #03-0078.
      </p>
      <p>
       A city may pay membership dues or fees for an appointed board or commission member to become a member of an organization which provides information, training, etc. for the board or commission on which they serve. Myers, Feb. 21, 2003, A.G. Op. #03-0078.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the expense of a publication is found to be reasonable and necessary to the performance of an officer’s duties, and the benefits thereof will inure to the benefit of the municipality with any personal benefit being incidental, the municipality may pay for subscriptions. Myers, Feb. 21, 2003, A.G. Op. #03-0078.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a city with a Mayor-Council form of government, the Mayor does not have the discretion to approve expenditures for travel, membership dues, seminar fees or professional publications or professional publications; they must be approved by the City Council. Myers, Feb. 21, 2003, A.G. Op. #03-0078.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the a city has a duly enacted ordinance establishing the fire department as a municipal department and the fire chief as the director of that department, then only the mayor has the authority to remove that individual from the position. Bailey, Feb. 2, 2004, A.G. Op. 04-0017.
      </p>
      <p>
       An “acting” or interim director must meet the same qualifications and be confirmed in the same manner as a permanent director. Campbell,
   Oct. 17, 2005,
   A.G. Op. 05-0467.
      </p>
      <p>
       The intent of Section 21-8-23 is that a mayor shall
   appoint department directors within a reasonable time after taking office. Carroll, Feb. 24, 2006, A.G. Op. 06-0013.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a mayor/council form of municipal government, a mayor, including one who is re-elected to a new four-year term of office, must submit his appointees to director positions to the city council for confirmation, even if the appointees are the same individuals who served as department directors during the prior term. DuPree, Feb. 24, 2006, A.G. Op. 06-0058.

       Individual council members can legally request information and advice from any municipal employee, and if such employee refuses to voluntarily supply requested information, council as whole can compel response; council as whole may decide to limit inquiry in some fashion, but no other entity of municipal government has any authority to limit or circumscribe council member’s inquiry. Halat, May 18, 1990, A.G. Op. #90-0352.

       A city council member in a mayor-council municipality may inquire and receive information and advice directly from department heads and employees without dealing with the mayor. Jones,

       There are no deadlines for architects and engineers who provide professional services to municipalities to respond to requests for information from the governing authorities or individual council members apart from any contractual duties that exist. However, architects and engineers should comply in a timely manner with reasonable requests for information from council members or the council as a whole. Jones,

      </p>
      <p>
       Reading Sections 21-8-13(4) and 21-8-27 in pari materia, individual city council members can legally request information and advice from any municipal employee, and if such employee refuses to voluntarily supply the requested information, the council as a whole can compel a response.

     <p>
      The manner of effecting the change in the government of any such city from the form of government under which it is operating to the council-manager plan of government shall be as follows:
     </p>
     <p>
      One or more petitions, similar in form and substance, addressed to the mayor, praying that an election be held to determine whether or not such city shall abandon its existing form of government and become organized under a council-manager plan of government, signed by at least ten percent (10%) of the qualified electors of such city, shall be filed with the city clerk, who shall within ten (10) days thereafter check the signatures thereto with the registration books of the city and attach thereto his certificate showing the total number of qualified electors in said city, and the total number of signatures to said petitions and deliver the same to the mayor.
     </p>
     <p>
      If, on the delivery of such petition to the mayor, it shall appear that such petition or petitions have not been signed by the required number of qualified electors of such city, the mayor shall at once certify such fact and immediately return such petition or petitions to the person or persons presenting the same, who may thereafter procure additional signers thereto and again file such petition or petitions with the city clerk, as above provided, as an original petition.
     </p>
     <p>
      If it shall at any time appear from the certificate of the city clerk that said petition or petitions have been signed by the required number of qualified electors of said city, the mayor shall immediately refer the same to the city council or board and if it shall appear that said petition or petitions are in proper form and have been sufficiently signed by the qualified electors of such city, the council or board shall within five (5) days order and provide for the holding of a special election in such city not less than twenty (20) days nor more than sixty (60) days from the date of making such order, notice of which shall be given, and the same shall be held and conducted as other elections in such city. At such special election the propositions to be voted for shall be: (1) “FOR THE PRESENT FORM OF GOVERNMENT” and “FOR THE COUNCIL-MANAGER PLAN OF GOVERNMENT,” and (2) “FOR COUNCILMEN ELECTED AT LARGE” and “FOR COUNCILMEN ELECTED BY WARDS,” which propositions shall be printed on the official ballot at such election.

      As soon as the returns of any election held hereunder for the adoption of the council-manager plan have been certified, and if a majority of the votes cast at such election were in favor of the council-manager form of government, the mayor of such city shall immediately certify to the secretary of state that such city, by special election, has adopted the council-manager form of government provided for herein, which certificate shall be recorded in a book kept for that purpose by the secretary of state.

    Transition from council-manager plan.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      In case the council-manager plan of government is discontinued or repealed by a majority vote of the qualified electors of such city, voting in an election for that purpose, as provided in Section 21-9-9, the next municipal election thereafter shall be conducted for such officials as are provided by law for such city under and according to that form of government under which it operated prior to the time that it adopted the council-manager plan of government. The elected officials then holding office under the council-manager plan shall continue in office until their duly elected successors under said form of government under which the municipality operated prior to the adoption of the council-manager plan shall take office. On the date on which such newly elected officials shall take office, as provided by law, the employment of such manager as shall have theretofore been employed by the council under the council-manager plan shall terminate, and all offices created under the provisions of this chapter shall terminate. Thereafter the municipality shall be governed by the general law applicable according to the form of government under which it had operated prior to adoption of the council-manager plan. The council or board shall have power by ordinance not inconsistent herewith to provide for the orderly transition from the one form of government to the other, in the same manner as is provided in Section 21-9-7. A city which has adopted the council-manager plan and subsequently discontinues it, as herein provided, may readopt it by following the same procedure as that herein set forth for its original adoption, and it may likewise thereafter so discontinue the same.

         The council of any municipality having a population exceeding forty-five thousand (45,000) inhabitants according to the 1970 decennial census which is situated in a Class 1 county bordering on the State of Alabama and which is governed by a council-manager plan of government on January 1, 1977, may, in its discretion, adopt an ordinance to require the election of four (4) of the five (5) council members from wards and not from the city at large. The four (4) council members shall be elected one (1) each from the wards in which they reside in the municipality, and shall be elected only by the registered voters residing within the ward in which the council member resides. The mayor and fifth council member may continue to be elected from the city at large. Any council member who shall remove his residence from the ward from which he was elected shall, by operation of law, vacate his seat on the council.

          After publication of the population of the municipality according to the 1980 decennial census, the governing authorities of the municipality shall designate the geographical boundaries of new wards as provided in this subparagraph. Each ward shall contain as nearly as possible the population factor obtained by dividing by four (4) the city’s population as shown by the 1980 and each most recent decennial census thereafter. It shall be the mandatory duty of the council to redistrict the city by ordinance, which ordinance may not be vetoed by the mayor, within six (6) months after the official publication by the United States of the population of the city as enumerated in each decennial census, and within six (6) months after the effective date of any expansion of municipal boundaries; provided, however, if the publication of the most recent decennial census or effective date of an expansion of the municipal boundaries occurs six (6) months or more prior to the first primary of a general municipal election, then the council shall redistrict the city by ordinance within at least sixty (60) days of such first primary. If the publication of the most recent decennial census occurs less than six (6) months prior to the first primary of a general municipal election, the election shall be held with regard to currently defined wards; and reapportioned wards based on the census shall not serve as the basis for representation until the next regularly scheduled election in which council members shall be elected.

Any subsequent redistricting of the city by ordinance as required by this section shall not serve as the basis for representation until the next regularly scheduled election for city councilmen.

In the next regular municipal election in such municipality, the mayor shall be elected at large by the voters of the entire municipality. Also, the councilmen shall be elected at large by the voters of the entire municipality to represent a municipality-wide district, or each of five (5) councilmen may be elected from one (1) of five (5) wards to represent said ward and one (1) councilman shall be elected to represent a municipality-wide district.

       Under Miss. Code Section 21-9-29, city manager has general oversight responsibility as to police department, but does not have responsibility for daily operations of department. Ramsay, Mar. 10, 1993, A.G. Op. #93-0155.

      <p>
       <p>
   A city manager may reorganize city government and realign job responsibilities of the employment positions and offices reporting to him, except that in those cases where the city council creates an office or department, and assigns those offices or departments specific powers and duties in accordance with
   §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t21c09s21-9-45" target="_self">21-9-45</a></cite>, the city manager is bound by the provisions of that ordinance. Ramsey, Nov. 30, 2004, A.G. Op. 04-0583.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the council-manager form of government neither the city attorney nor the municipal judge are administrative positions, therefore they are not subject to the administrative control of the city manager. Ramsey, Nov. 30, 2004, A.G. Op. 04-0583.
      </p>
      <p>
       For those appointments made by the city council under subsection (d) of this section, the city council has the authority to determine to whom those appointees report; however, the city attorney and municipal judge, as non-administrative positions, must be assigned to the city council.

       The Mississippi Coast Coliseum, controlled by a legislatively created political subdivision of the state, which is within the corporate limits of the City of Biloxi, and the promoter which would be using the Coliseum’s premises during the Easter Arts and Crafts Fair and Show, is not subject to the City of Biloxi’s Ordinance banning baby chick giveaways.

       Leasing or permitting space on municipal light poles for the location of transmitters for wireless internet service is not the granting of a franchise within the meaning of Sections 21-27-1 et seq. or Section 21-13-1(3). A municipality leasing that space would still be required to receive fair value for the lease to ensure it did not result in an unlawful donation, but upon a finding by the governing authorities that it would be in the best interests of the municipality, would not be required to advertise and solicit bids.

       An ordinance under which licenses were granted to operate 10 additional taxicabs was improperly adopted as an emergency measure and declared to be immediately effective where, contrary to statutory requirements, there was no indication of how the immediate preservation of the public health, safety and general welfare of the city’s citizens required the ordinance to take effect immediately and where no other good cause was set forth; nor was there compliance with the statute requiring that ordinances granting any right to use the streets remain on file with the municipal clerk for two weeks before passage. Thus, the licenses at issue were a nullity. Yellow Cab Co. v. Biloxi, 372 So. 2d 1274, 1979 Miss. LEXIS 2270 (Miss. 1979).

       Where the board of aldermen passed an ordinance granting a power company a franchise, the board acted in its governmental capacity and within the powers conferred by the statute, and the ordinance is therefore not vulnerable to the objection that it is ultra vires, that it was irregularly enacted, or that it is invalid as a usurpation of the prerogatives of successor boards. City of Picayune v. Mississippi Power Co., 197 F.2d 444, 1952 U.S. App. LEXIS 4001 (5th Cir. Miss. 1952).

       A zoning ordinance which established six use classifications and placed various areas within the city in one or the other of these classifications, and, at the same time, rezoned a particular area into a new classification was not void under the provisions of this section [Code 1942, § 3374-74], for containing two subject matters; for the proper method of enacting a zoning ordinance not only requires the municipal authorities to designate the classifications felt to be necessary, but the area affected by the classification should also be described in the ordinance.

       Notwithstanding the mandatory requirement of this section [Code 1942, § 3374-74] that an ordinance shall not contain more than one subject, a city seeking to alter its boundaries by adding certain adjacent territory and excluding certain territory already included within the existing limits is not required to adopt two different ordinances, and thus initiate at the same time two different proceedings in a chancery court.

      Every ordinance passed by the governing body of a municipality, except as is otherwise provided by law, shall be certified by a municipal clerk, signed by the mayor or a majority of all the members of the governing body, recorded in the ordinance book, and published at least one (1) time in some newspaper published in such municipality, or, if there be no such newspaper, then in a newspaper within the county having general circulation in said municipality, or, if there be no newspaper published in or having general circulation in same, then in any newspaper published in the State of Mississippi having general circulation in said county; and all of same shall be done before such ordinance shall be effective. The publication of the ordinance may be made as provided in Section 21-17-19. No ordinance shall be in force for one (1) month after its passage; however, any ordinance for the immediate and temporary preservation of the public peace, health or safety or for other good cause, which is adopted by unanimous vote of all members of the governing body, may be made effective from and after its passage by a unanimous vote of all members of the governing body. However, in such cases, such ordinance shall contain a statement of reason why it is necessary that same become immediately effective. All such ordinances shall be published and recorded in the ordinance book in the same manner as other ordinances, but shall become effective immediately upon the adoption thereof, and prior to being so recorded and published. Nothing in this section shall apply to ordinances appropriating money for the payment of the current expenses of the municipality or the payment of sums due on any contract previously made.

       A bill of exceptions filed on June 13, 1980, to challenge a rezoning of certain property was not untimely where, although the Mayor and Board of Aldermen voted on May 6, 1980, to reclassify the property, the rezoning ordinance did not become effective until written, signed and formally adopted on June 3, 1980, at which time the ten-day appeal period commenced to run.

       In an action by a city to permanently enjoin a landowner from operating a motor repair business in an area zoned as a single-family residential district, the trial court properly denied the requested relief, even though the zoning ordinance was adopted almost one year before defendant moved his business to the location at issue, where the ordinance did not take effect until its publication more than six years later; nor did the ordinance take effect immediately as an emergency measure where it merely contained a general statement that its immediate implementation was necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety, without stating the facts constituting the emergency that was declared to exist. Thus, at the time the ordinance took effect, defendant’s business was a preexisting nonconforming use not prohibited thereby. City of Carthage v. Walters, 375 So. 2d 228, 1979 Miss. LEXIS 2426 (Miss. 1979).

       Prior to July 1950, city operating under the aldermanic form of government was not subject to statutory requirements which provided that ordinances be unanimously passed, that they remain on file for public inspection prior to passage or that they be ratified by popular vote. City of Picayune v. Mississippi Power Co., 197 F.2d 444, 1952 U.S. App. LEXIS 4001 (5th Cir. Miss. 1952).
      </p>
      <p>
       When an ordinance granting power company 25-year franchise was enacted on May 13, 1947, and reciting that it should take effect immediately because public interests so demanded, it became effective immediately on May 13, 1947, and under the then applicable statutes it would have been effective within thirty days after its enactment. City of Picayune v. Mississippi Power Co., 197 F.2d 444, 1952 U.S. App. LEXIS 4001 (5th Cir. Miss. 1952).
      </p>
      <p>
       As used in this statute, the word “resolution” takes on the nature of an “ordinance” which is enacted to regulate continuing conditions and constitutes a permanent rule of government, as distinct from an “order” which deals with temporary powers and ceases to have further potentiality after accomplishment of its purpose. Evans v. Jackson, 202 Miss. 9, 30 So. 2d 315, 1947 Miss. LEXIS 234 (Miss. 1947).
      </p>
      <p>
       Publication of a “resolution or ordinance,” as required by this section, does not apply to an “order or resolution” adopted for the sale of unredeemed tax forfeited lands. Evans v. Jackson, 202 Miss. 9, 30 So. 2d 315, 1947 Miss. LEXIS 234 (Miss. 1947).

       Attempt to make ordinance effective prior to its passage did not render ordinance void, but merely rendered it unenforceable until lapse of one month after its passage. Streckfus Steamers, Inc. v. Kiersky, 174 Miss. 125, 163 So. 830, 1935 Miss. LEXIS 46 (Miss. 1935).

       Failure of ordinance to assign cause for immediate enforcement thereof caused it to become effective not earlier than one month after its passage. Streckfus Steamers, Inc. v. Kiersky, 174 Miss. 125, 163 So. 830, 1935 Miss. LEXIS 46 (Miss. 1935).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where city charter made specific provision for adoption of ordinance without formal approval of mayor, mayor’s formal approval of ordinance held unnecessary, since statute providing for adoption of ordinances by municipalities under common statutory charter was inapplicable.

       A person employed by the Department of Corrections may continue to serve in elected office as a city alderman as long as he waives all salary and compensation for office and elects to receive a retirement allowance in lieu thereof; such a person may also continue to serve as a city alderman, retire from the Department of Corrections, and begin to receive a retirement allowance without the required forty-five day separation period as long as he elects and waives as required.

      <p>
       A municipality may publish the substance of a zoning ordinance, i.e., an explanatory statement summarizing the full text of the ordinance, in which the chief purpose is explained in clear and unambiguous language; in such case, the clerk must post a copy of the full text of the zoning ordinance, along with the maps, charts, diagrams and sketches, at the city hall, main public library or courthouse, and at another public place in the municipality; further, the publication should also specify when and where the full text of the ordinance and any maps are available for review.
   Donald, August 5, 1999, A.G. Op. #99-0390.
      </p>
      <p>
       Governing authorities should publish an amended zoning ordinance in accordance with statutory procedures, since any zoning ordinance will not be legally effective until it is published; if the governing authorities decide to consider amending an ordinance legally adopted to change a zoning classification, they must follow the statutory procedures to amend the ordinance.

      <p>
       Where a county is amending its zoning ordinance, but the proposed amendments do not change any actual existing zoning of property in the county, the portions that are being amended and
   the proposed amendments may be published in lieu of publishing the entire ordinance, and the publication should refer to the full text of the proposed amendments on file in the city clerk’s office.

       Where there is no newspaper located in or published in a town, a newspaper within the county having general circulation

       The requirement hereunder that the municipal clerk append to the ordinance “a note stating the date of its passage, and cite therein the book and page of the minutes containing the record of its passage,” is merely directory and for convenience in finding the ordinance in the minutes of the city’s governing body, and a failure to comply therewith has no effect on the ordinance or on the copy thereof in the ordinance book.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The municipality may from time to time authorize the revision and codification of the ordinances, and their publication in pamphlet or book form. When so revised, arranged, classified and codified, said book or pamphlet may be adopted by ordinance as the official code of ordinances of the municipality without compliance with the requirements pertaining to the passage of ordinances. Such official code of ordinances may be amended by section or sections in the manner provided in this chapter. The municipality may cause to be published in connection therewith the laws relating to municipalities, with such annotations of supreme court decisions thereon as may be proper, and such forms and instructions as it shall deem advisable. The whole may be preceded by a historical sketch of the municipality.

     </h3>
     <p>
      All offenses under the penal laws of this state which are misdemeanors, together with the penalty provided for violation thereof, are hereby made, without further action of the municipal authorities, criminal offenses against the municipality in whose corporate limits the offenses may have been committed to the same effect as though such offenses were made offenses against the municipality by separate ordinance in each case. However, for such misdemeanor, any penalty of incarceration is hereby limited to no more than six (6) months in jail, and any fine is hereby limited to a maximum of One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00) for each such violation in any case tried without a jury. Judgments for fines, costs, forfeitures and other penalties imposed by municipal courts may be enrolled by filing a certified copy of the record with the clerk of any circuit court and execution may be had thereon as provided by law for other judgments.

       Statute stating that the maximum penalty for each violation in any case tried without a jury was incarceration limited to no more than six months in jail, and any fine also imposed was limited to a certain amount, was not relevant to the municipal court’s jurisdiction, and thus, defendant was not entitled to reversal of his simple domestic violence conviction.

       The city of Pascagoula operates under the code chapter on municipalities, and it has a general ordinance making all misdemeanors, which are such under state statutes, offenses also against the city. City of Pascagoula v. Nolan, 183 Miss. 164, 184 So. 165, 1938 Miss. LEXIS 229 (Miss. 1938).

       All ordinances under this section must be restricted to misdemeanors as defined by the state laws and if made to embrace felonies will be void. City of Oxford v. Buford, 134 Miss. 635, 99 So. 498, 1924 Miss. LEXIS 313 (Miss. 1924).
      </p>
      <p>
       Such an ordinance must be restricted in its application to misdemeanors against the state, for an ordinance which provides that all crimes under the chapter on crimes and misdemeanors, which embraces felonies as well as misdemeanors is void. Dismukes v. Louisville, 101 Miss. 104, 57 So. 547, 1911 Miss. LEXIS 110 (Miss. 1911).

       But notwithstanding the title of the ordinance appears to embrace all violations of the penal laws of the state of Mississippi, the ordinance itself is not invalid where it deals only with offenses amounting to misdemeanors. Richards v. Magnolia, 100 Miss. 249, 56 So. 386 (Miss. 1911).

       Ordinance seeking to make all misdemeanors against State offenses against town in whose corporate limits offenses “may have been committed” held not void as to one subsequently arrested on theory that it referred only to past acts, since language of ordinance follows language of statute authorizing municipalities to adopt misdemeanors under State law as offenses against municipalities.

      <p>
       An ordinance providing that all offenses constituting misdemeanors against the state shall be violations of the ordinance would not only make all acts that are misdemeanors under the law then existing violations of the ordinance but would apply to all laws thereafter passed by the state defining misdemeanors.

   The Mississippi Municipal Liability Plan does not fit within the definition of insurance under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.83.html#t83c05s83-5-5" target="_blank">83-5-5</a></cite>, which is general liability insurance sufficient to waive sovereign immunity pursuant to §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t21c15s21-15-6" target="_self">21-15-6</a></cite>, but instead is self-insurance insufficient to waive sovereign immunity. Morgan v. City of Ruleville, 627 So. 2d 275, 1993 Miss. LEXIS 372 (Miss. 1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       City’s membership in Mississippi Municipal Liabilities Plan was not equivalent to purchase by city of general liability insurance and thus did not waive city’s sovereign immunity, in action brought by person alleging he was beaten by city police officer in course of arrest. McGee v. Parker, 772 F. Supp. 308, 1991 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12657 (S.D. Miss. 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       Court concluded that Mississippi Supreme Court would probably conclude that city’s membership in Mississippi Municipal Liability Plan did not waive city’s sovereign immunity as to plaintiffs’ state law claims, inasmuch as reserves were not premium payments and were not intended to cover claims such as plaintiffs’ claim. Therefore, city was not liable for alleged state law violations. White v. Taylor, 775 F. Supp. 962, 1990 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19346 (S.D. Miss. 1990), rev'd, 959 F.2d 539, 1992 U.S. App. LEXIS 8466 (5th Cir. Miss. 1992); C-1 v. Horn Lake, 775 F. Supp. 940 (N.D. Miss. 1990).

       Homeowner’s complaint seeking damages from city as result of negligence by city fire department should not have been dismissed where homeowner charged that city maintained general liability insurance which covered loss caused by negligence of fire department employees; court should have permitted development of allegation that city maintained general liability insurance, though not in presence of jury. Davis v. Lexington, 509 So. 2d 1049, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2625 (Miss. 1987).

       Injury resulting from failure of municipality to properly instruct and train police officers in practice of high speed chase is not covered by liability insurance provision providing coverage for damages caused by accident and resulting from ownership, maintenance, or use of insured automobile where injury results when automobile driven by misdemeanant fleeing from police strikes house; however provision does cover damage resulting from police officer’s negligence during high speed chase which results in misdemeanant striking house.

       § 21-15-25.
    Municipal attorney; appointment and compensation.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The governing authorities may annually appoint an attorney-at-law for the municipality, prescribe his duties and fix his compensation, and/or they may employ counsel to represent the interest of the municipality, should the occasion require. For services and duties which the regular city attorney is not required to perform as a result of his employment as such, and which are not covered by the regular compensation paid him, such municipal attorney may be employed and compensated additionally. In cases where an attorney, whether same be the regular municipal attorney or another, shall be employed in the matter of issuing or refunding of bonds and the drafting of all orders and resolutions in connection therewith, the governing authorities shall have the power to pay reasonable compensation to such attorney, but in no instance shall such compensation so paid exceed one per cent (1%) of the bonds issued or refunded; however, where the regular contract of employment and compensation paid to the municipal attorney covers and includes services in connection with the issuing or refunding of bonds, then such regular municipal attorney shall not be paid additional compensation for such services.
     </p>
     <p>
      Should the services and duties required of a regular municipal attorney at any time during his term of office become greater than that anticipated by the governing authorities at the time of his appointment, the governing authorities, by unanimous vote, and on proper finding, may increase the compensation of such attorney for the remaining portion of his term in such amount as the governing board may find and adjudge to be fair and reasonable to compensate said attorney for his excessive and unanticipated services and duties.

       Since city charter was silent on method for selecting a city attorney, statutory law applied and permitted the “governing authorities” to appoint an attorney for the municipality, which meant the mayor and board of alderman; however, since the city’s charter expressly stated that the mayor could only vote in the event of a tie and the city council’s vote in favor of appointing the particular person did not end in a tie, the mayor was not authorized to vote on that matter. Tisdale v. City Council of Aberdeen, 856 So. 2d 323, 2003 Miss. LEXIS 489 (Miss. 2003).
      </p>

       § 21-15-35.
    Preservation of essential public records of municipal governments.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The Legislature declares that records containing information essential to the operation of government and to the protection of the rights and interests of persons should be protected against the destructive effect of all forms of disaster, whether fire, flood, storm, earthquake, explosion or other, and whether such occurrence is caused by an act of nature or man, including an enemy of the United States. It is, therefore, necessary to adopt special provisions for the preservation of essential records of municipalities, and this section shall be liberally construed to effect its purposes. However, it is the express intention of this section that the provisions herein contained are not mandatory but are permissive only and shall authorize preservation of records as herein contemplated within the discretion of the governing authorities of the municipalities of the state and in accordance with a records control schedule approved by the Local Government Records Committee as provided in Section 25-60-1.
     </p>
     <p>
      The governing authorities of any municipality within the state, regardless of the form of government under which they operate, are each hereby authorized and empowered in their discretion to make or cause to be made a copy or copies of the records of such municipality, or any portion thereof, deemed by such governing authority to be an essential record necessary to the operation of government in an emergency created by disaster or containing information necessary to protect the rights and interests of persons or to establish and affirm the powers and duties of government in the resumption of operations after the destruction or damage of the original records. Such copies shall be made in accordance with standards established by the Department of Archives and History.
     </p>
     <p>
      The governing authorities of such municipalities are authorized and empowered in their discretion to make and enter into contracts and agreements with any person, firm or corporation to make and prepare such copy or copies of records, and to provide for and enter into contracts concerning the safekeeping and preservation of such copy or copies at points of storage approved by the Local Government Records Committee as required in Section 25-60-1, at a location other than the legally designated or customary location and deposit of the original of such records.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the event that the original record or records shall have been destroyed, any such photographic or photostatic copy or reproduction shall be deemed to be an original record for all purposes and shall be treated as an original record in all courts or administrative agencies for the purpose of its admissibility in evidence. An enlargement or facsimile of such reproduction is likewise admissible in evidence if the original reproduction is in existence and available for inspection under direction of court.
     </p>
     <p>
      The governing authorities of any municipality within the state, regardless of the form of government under which they operate, are authorized and empowered, in their discretion, to appropriate and expend monies out of the available funds of such municipality for the purposes of this section.

       Since city charter was silent on method for selecting a city attorney, statutory law applied and permitted the “governing authorities” to appoint an attorney for the municipality, which meant the mayor and board of alderman; however, since the city’s charter expressly stated that the mayor could only vote in the event of a tie and the city council’s vote in favor of appointing the particular person did not end in a tie, the mayor was not authorized to vote on that matter.

   H.B. 1671, Reg. Sess. (Miss. 2006), was a private law which enabled the city to obtain municipal parking facilities in exchange for the conveyance of air and development rights; the last sentences of sections 3 and 4 were unconstitutional under Miss. Const. Art. IV, § 87, as exempting the bill from compliance with Miss. Code Ann. §§<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t21c17s21-17-1" target="_self">21-17-1</a></cite> and<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.31.html#t31c07s31-7-13" target="_blank">31-7-13</a></cite> and were not merely procedural and minor.

       City could convey to developer land which it had reserved for drainage, and since the transaction in which the conveyance had been made was entered into the city’s minute book, the conveyance was valid. Modling v. Bailey Homes & Ins., 490 So. 2d 887, 1986 Miss. LEXIS 2495 (Miss. 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       The governing body of a municipality possesses only such authority as is conferred upon it by its charter or by general statutes, together with such powers as are necessary to give effect to the powers granted. Mayor & Bd. of Aldermen v. Engle, 211 Miss. 380, 51 So. 2d 564 (1951).

      </p>
      <p>
       Powers delegated by the Legislature to municipalities are intended to be exercised in conformity to, and consistent with the general laws of the State, and are to be construed most strongly against a power or right claimed but not clearly given. King v. Louisville, 207 Miss. 612, 42 So. 2d 813, 1949 Miss. LEXIS 374 (Miss. 1949).
      </p>
      <p>
       Municipal powers are only those expressly conferred by statute, and necessarily implied. Such powers belong to the municipality and not to its officers. Tullos v. Magee, 181 Miss. 288, 179 So. 557, 1938 Miss. LEXIS 70 (Miss. 1938).

       In a suit by taxpayers and landowners against the city to enjoin construction of a municipal building on property theretofore purchased by the city, proof that the property was a public park by common-law dedication was not clear, satisfactory and unequivocal where the city had used parts of the tract for purposes inconsistent with park purposes, leased parts of the property to private interests, sold one of the lots, and only a fraction of the original tract was still in use as a park; rather, it was as reasonable to infer that the city intended to use the tract for park purposes only for so long as it was not needed for other municipal purposes or only for so long as the land was suitable for park purposes.

      <li id="t21c17s21-17-5ol11">
       The governing authorities of every municipality of this state shall have the care, management and control of the municipal affairs and its property and finances. In addition to those powers granted by specific provisions of general law, the governing authorities of municipalities shall have the power to adopt any orders, resolutions or ordinances with respect to such municipal affairs, property and finances which are not inconsistent with the Mississippi Constitution of 1890, the Mississippi Code of 1972, or any other statute or law of the State of Mississippi, and shall likewise have the power to alter, modify and repeal such orders, resolutions or ordinances. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (2) of this section, the powers granted to governing authorities of municipalities in this section are complete without the existence of or reference to any specific authority granted in any other statute or law of the State of Mississippi. Unless otherwise provided by law, before entering upon the duties of their respective offices, the aldermen or councilmen of every municipality of this state shall give bond, with sufficient surety, to be payable, conditioned and approved as provided by law, in a penalty equal to five percent (5%) of the sum of all the municipal taxes shown by the assessment rolls and the levies to have been collectible in the municipality for the year immediately preceding the commencement of the term of office of said alderman or councilman; however, such bond shall not exceed One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000.00). For all municipalities with a population more than two thousand (2,000) according to the latest federal decennial census, the amount of the bond shall not be less than Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000.00). Any taxpayer of the municipality may sue on such bond for the use of the municipality, and such taxpayer shall be liable for all costs in case his suit shall fail. No member of the city council or board of aldermen shall be surety for any other such member.
      </li>
      <li id="t21c17s21-17-5ol12">
       Unless such actions are specifically authorized by another statute or law of the State of Mississippi, this section shall not authorize the governing authorities of municipalities to (a) levy taxes of any kind or increase the levy of any authorized tax, (b) issue bonds of any kind, (c) change the requirements, practices or procedures for municipal elections or establish any new elective office, (d) change the procedure for annexation of additional territory into the municipal boundaries, (e) change the structure or form of the municipal government, (f) permit the sale, manufacture, distribution, possession or transportation of alcoholic beverages, (g) grant any donation, or (h) without prior legislative approval, regulate, directly or indirectly, the amount of rent charged for leasing private residential property in which the municipality does not have a property interest.
      </li>
      <li id="t21c17s21-17-5ol13">
       Nothing in this or any other section shall be construed so as to prevent any municipal governing authority from paying any municipal employee not to exceed double his ordinary rate of pay or awarding any municipal employee not to exceed double his ordinary rate of compensatory time for work performed in his capacity as a municipal employee on legal holidays. The governing authority of any municipality shall enact leave policies to ensure that a public safety employee is paid or granted compensatory time for the same number of holidays for which any other municipal employee is paid.

      <li id="t21c17s21-17-5ol14">
       The governing authority of any municipality, in its discretion, may expend funds to provide for training and education of newly elected or appointed municipal officials before the beginning of the term of office or employment of such officials. Any expenses incurred for such purposes may be allowed only upon prior approval of the governing authority. Any payments or reimbursements made under the provisions of this subsection may be paid only after presentation to and approval by the governing authority of the municipality.

      <p>
       The 2007 amendment, in (3), substituted the present last sentence for the former last sentence, which read: “The governing authority of any municipality, in its discretion, may enact leave policies to ensure that public safety employees receive the same holiday benefits as other municipal employees when the public safety employee’s regular day off occurs on a legal holiday.”
      </p>

       Employees who work on a Saturday or Sunday may not receive compensatory time or compensatory pay regardless of the fact that the day is an “actual holiday.” These employees should receive ordinary pay for work performed on an “actual holiday.” Compensatory time or compensatory pay may be given for work performed on a “legal holiday,” as long as there exists a policy providing for such at the time the work was performed.

       § 21-17-9.
    Amendment of municipal charter at behest of governing authority.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      When a municipality now existing, which has not adopted the code charter or commission form of government, but is governed by another charter, shall desire to amend its charter, the same may be done in this way: the mayor and board of aldermen, city council, or municipal authority, by whatever name known, may prepare, in writing, the desired amendment or amendments and have the same published for three (3) weeks in a legal newspaper published in the municipality, if there be one, and, if none, then by posting for said time in at least three (3) public places therein, after which the proposed amendment or amendments shall be submitted to the Governor, who shall submit the same to the Attorney General for his opinion. The publication of the amendment or amendments may be made as provided in Section 21-17-19. If the Attorney General is of the opinion that the proposed amendment or amendments are consistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States and the Constitution of this state, the Governor shall approve the proposed amendment or amendments. If, after publication is made, one-tenth (1/10) of the qualified electors of the municipality shall protest against the proposed amendments, or any of them, the Governor shall not approve the ones protested against until they shall be submitted to and ratified by a majority of the electors of the municipality voting in a special election. Amendments, when approved by the Governor, shall be recorded, at the expense of the municipality, in the office of the Secretary of State and upon the records of the mayor and board of aldermen, or other governing authorities of the municipality, and when so recorded shall have the force and effect of law. No amendment to the private or special charter of any municipality shall be adopted or approved when such amendment is in conflict with any of the provisions of this title expressly made applicable to municipalities operating under a private or special charter, or is in conflict with the provisions of any other legislation expressly made applicable to any such municipality.

       The Election Commission had an official duty to see to it that the elections in a city were carried out in compliance with state law and, as such, the circuit court had the power and jurisdiction to enjoin the elections until the city could amend its charter in compliance with the statute. City of Grenada v. Harrelson, 725 So. 2d 770, 1998 Miss. LEXIS 187 (Miss. 1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       The legislature has granted each municipality power to amend its special charter, but when municipality undertakes to make this amendment whether as to substance or form, it must follow the statute as to manner and method by which such amendment may be made. Bishop v. City of Meridian, 223 Miss. 703, 79 So. 2d 815, 1955 Miss. LEXIS 427 (Miss. 1955).
      </p>
      <p>
       The legislature, by granting municipalities the power to amend a private or special charter, did not give a municipality authority to declare that all functions exercised by the city are public governmental functions. Bishop v. City of Meridian, 223 Miss. 703, 79 So. 2d 815, 1955 Miss. LEXIS 427 (Miss. 1955).
      </p>
      <p>
       The mere power to amend a private or special charter does not have the effect of vesting in the city authorities the power to abolish all actions for damages based upon the negligent failure of the city authorities to maintain the street in a proper and safe condition. Bishop v. City of Meridian, 223 Miss. 703, 79 So. 2d 815, 1955 Miss. LEXIS 427 (Miss. 1955).
      </p>
      <p>
       The recording of amendments to municipal charters is necessary to give the amendments any effect. Williams v. Vicksburg, 116 Miss. 79, 76 So. 838, 1917 Miss. LEXIS 300 (Miss. 1917).

       Where a city has first adopted an amendment to its charter it need not be readopted after its publication and approval by the governor and attorney-general. Sick v. Bay St. Louis, 113 Miss. 175, 74 So. 272, 1916 Miss. LEXIS 45 (Miss. 1916).
      </p>
      <p>
       The legislature is prohibited by § 88 Const. 1890 to pass a special act amending the charter of a city. Monette v. State, 91 Miss. 662, 44 So. 989 (Miss. 1907), overruled in part, Glover v. Columbus, 197 Miss. 467, 19 So. 2d 756, 1944 Miss. LEXIS 313 (Miss. 1944).
      </p>
      <p>
       An amendment to the charter of a city which created the office of police justice did not create a new court, but merely provided a different presiding officer for the court already in existence. Ex parte Dickson, 89 Miss. 778, 42 So. 233, 1906 Miss. LEXIS 20 (Miss. 1906).

       This section as amended, Laws 1905 p. 79, authorizing the amendment of the charters of the municipalities which have not adopted the Code Chapter on “municipalities,” and allowing amendments inconsistent with said Code Chapter, is not violative of Const. 1890, § 88.

       Since city is governed by its own private charter which prescribes length of terms that its elected officials serve, and since Miss. Code Section 21-17-9 prescribes procedure whereby municipal charters may be amended, section of charter that prescribes length of terms of elected municipal official could be amended to include provision to limit terms of said officials, provided said amendment is adopted in accordance with Miss. Code Section 21-17-9. Hicks, Jan. 5, 1993, A.G. Op. #92-0980.
      </p>
      <p>
       The governing authorities of a City may change the form of government to a mayor council form of government by amending the special charter in accordance with Section 21-17-9 and create a mayor council municipality similar to the mayor council form of government set forth in Section 21-8-1 et seq. Hutcherson, October 11, 1996, A.G. Op. #96-0651.
      </p>
      <p>
       If an amendment is submitted, after proper notification, and no protests are filed at the time of submission to the Governor’s Office, but less that 1/10th of the protests are filed at the time of the Governor’s signing of the amendment, the protestors do not have more time to secure signatures.

       As between qualified newspapers, a newspaper with a known office of publication within the municipality must be selected to publish the legal notices of that municipality.

       The City of McComb could not pass an ordinance to institute changes to the required qualifications of candidates to municipal elective office; instead, the city was required to amend its Special Charter. White, July 3, 2002, A.G. Op. #02-0134.
      </p>
      <p>
       In addition to approval by the Attorney General, a proposed amendment to the Special Charter of the City of Greenville also requires approval of the U.S. Department of Justice because it changes voting districts within the municipality. Prospere, Feb. 5, 2003, A.G. Op. #03-0050.
      </p>
      <p>
       Proposed amendments to the special charter of a city to alter the corporate limits to reflect boundaries approved in a prior annexation, and change the organization of municipal government to provide for an additional alderman to be elected at large should be approved. The municipality must submit any changes which may affect voting to the U.S. Department of Justice pursuant to Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 for preclearance prior to enforcing any such changes.

       No municipal board has right to create a condition which imperils health and welfare of public and create public nuisance, and when it does so, equity court has power to issue injunction directing board to relieve situation, leaving board free to adopt such methods as economy and good engineering may determine. City of Jackson v. Robertson, 208 Miss. 422, 44 So. 2d 523, 1950 Miss. LEXIS 258 (Miss. 1950).
      </p>
      <p>
       In determining validity of ordinance enacted under statute authorizing municipality to make regulations to secure general health, and prevent spread of contagious diseases, court will not consider wisdom of ordinance but merely whether it constitutes reasonable exercise of power granted. Hartman v. May, 168 Miss. 477, 151 So. 737, 1934 Miss. LEXIS 349 (Miss. 1934).
      </p>

       The power of the municipality to prohibit and abolish nuisances and cognate matters is limited and the attempted exercise of any excess authority is void. Desporte v. Biloxi, 136 Miss. 542, 100 So. 387, 1924 Miss. LEXIS 191 (Miss. 1924).

       A municipality was negligent in building a hog pond twelve feet from plaintiff’s residence and against her protest upon property of the city; it was also actionable negligence to fail to remove a dead hog from such pond after notice. Crawford v. D'Lo, 119 Miss. 28, 80 So. 377, 1918 Miss. LEXIS 5 (Miss. 1918).

       A municipal ordinance, declaring it to be a nuisance to erect hog pens within any inclosure in the city limits, or to permit hogs to run at large within any lot or inclosure, except at certain designated places, and providing for their abatement, was held invalid as being too broad.

       An ordinance making in unlawful for business places to keep open after 11 P.M., and prescribing a penalty for its violation, as applied to a grocery store, constituted a deprivation of property without due process of law and an unreasonable restraint of trade not per se or per accidens a nuisance.

       Where a city charter empowered the city authorities to regulate and prevent the carrying on of manufactories dangerous in causing or promoting fires and to prevent and remove all nuisances, an ordinance, enacted pursuant thereto, declaring certain manufactories, which because of their dilapidated and defective condition should have become dangerous to persons and property in their vicinity, to be nuisances and subject to prosecution, was valid. Green v. Lake, 60 Miss. 451, 1882 Miss. LEXIS 80 (Miss. 1882).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the charter of a municipality empowered the municipal authorities to prevent nuisances and dangerous manufactories and to regulate the latter, the authorities cannot, on petition of citizens, deal thus with a flour mill unless it should be shown to fall within some law or ordinance previously enacted.

       The legislative intent is to authorize municipalities to prevent public health hazards and, therefore, the governing authorities of municipalities may go onto private property to eliminate pigeons or to perform minor carpentry work to prevent pigeons from roosting where they have grown to constitute a health problem.

       It is legal for the municipal governing authorities to permit city personnel to enter onto private property such as backyards and other spaces, with the owner’s permission, to spray for mosquitoes, where the governing authorities have found and determined that to do so will protect the public health and safety or will abate a public nuisance.

       It is legal for a city to pass an ordinance which allows entry onto private property for the purpose of spraying for mosquitoes; however, to enter onto private property to spray for mosquitoes against the wishes of the landowner would require due process, either pursuant to 21-19-11 or otherwise.

       Section 21-19-9, authorizing municipalities to regulate the running at large of animals of all kinds, authorized a municipality to impound dogs even though those dogs had been vaccinated and registered. The destruction of a dog after five days’ posted notice, pursuant to an ordinance enacted under the authority of this section, did not amount to a taking of private property without due process of law. City of Water Valley v. Trusty, 343 So. 2d 471, 1977 Miss. LEXIS 2377 (Miss. 1977).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section [Code 1942, § 3374-153] does not make city pound keepers members of the police force, but implies the contrary. City of Hattiesburg v. Jackson, 235 Miss. 109, 108 So. 2d 596, 1959 Miss. LEXIS 409 (Miss. 1959).
      </p>
      <p>
       A dog found on the street and unaccompanied by its owner or master will be deemed to be running at large within the meaning of such ordinance. Julienne v. Mayor, etc., of Jackson, 69 Miss. 34, 10 So. 43, 1891 Miss. LEXIS 60 (Miss. 1891).
      </p>
      <p>
       A municipality may, in the exercise of its police power conferred by charter, provide by ordinance that unmuzzled dogs running at large shall be killed. Such ordinance violates no constitutional right of the owner although his property be destroyed without notice to him. Julienne v. Mayor, etc., of Jackson, 69 Miss. 34, 10 So. 43, 1891 Miss.

       To determine whether property or parcel of land located within a municipality is in such a state of uncleanliness as to be a menace to the public health, safety and welfare of the community, a governing authority of any municipality shall conduct a hearing, on its own motion, or upon the receipt of a petition signed by a majority of the residents residing within four hundred (400) feet of any property or parcel of land alleged to be in need of the cleaning. Notice shall be provided to the property owner by:
       <ol type="a">
        <li id="t21c19s21-19-11ol11a">
         United States mail two (2) weeks before the date of the hearing mailed to the address of the subject property and to the address where the ad valorem tax notice for such property is sent by the office charged with collecting ad valorem tax; and
        </li>
        <li id="t21c19s21-19-11ol11b">
         Posting notice for at least two (2) weeks before the date of a hearing on the property or parcel of land alleged to be in need of cleaning and at city hall or another place in the municipality where such notices are posted.
         <p>
          Any notice required by this section shall include language that informs the property owner that an adjudication at the hearing that the property or parcel of land is in need of cleaning will authorize the municipality to reenter the property or parcel of land for a period of one (1) year after final adjudication without any further hearing if notice is posted on the property or parcel of land and at city hall or another place in the municipality where such notices are generally posted at least seven (7) days before the property or parcel of land is reentered for cleaning. A copy of the required notice mailed and posted as required by this section shall be recorded in the minutes of the governing authority in conjunction with the hearing required by this section.
         </p>
         <p>
          If, at such hearing, the governing authority shall adjudicate the property or parcel of land in its then condition to be a menace to the public health, safety and welfare of the community, the governing authority, if the owner does not do so himself, shall proceed to clean the land, by the use of municipal employees or by contract, by cutting grass and weeds; filling cisterns; removing rubbish, abandoned or dilapidated fences, outside toilets, abandoned or dilapidated buildings, slabs, personal property, which removal of personal property shall not be subject to the provisions of Section 21-39-21, and other debris; and draining cesspools and standing water therefrom. The governing authority may by resolution adjudicate the actual cost of cleaning the property and may also impose a penalty not to exceed One Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($1,500.00) or fifty percent (50%) of the actual cost, whichever is more. The cost and any penalty may become a civil debt against the property owner, and/or, at the option of the governing authority, an assessment against the property. The “cost assessed against the property” means either the cost to the municipality of using its own employees to do the work or the cost to the municipality of any contract executed by the municipality to have the work done, and administrative costs and legal costs of the municipality. For subsequent cleaning within the one-year period after the date of the hearing at which the property or parcel of land was adjudicated in need of cleaning, upon seven (7) days’ notice posted both on the property or parcel of land adjudicated in need of cleaning and at city hall or another place in the municipality where such notices are generally posted, and consistent with the municipality’s adjudication as authorized in this subsection (1), a municipality may reenter the property or parcel of land to maintain cleanliness without further notice or hearing no more than six (6) times in any twelve-month period with respect to removing abandoned or dilapidated buildings, slabs, dilapidated fences and outside toilets, and no more than twelve (12) times in any twenty-four-month period with respect to cutting grass and weeds and removing rubbish, personal property and other debris on the land, and the expense of cleaning of the property, except as otherwise provided in this section for removal of hazardous substances, shall not exceed an aggregate amount of Twenty Thousand Dollars ($20,000.00) per year, or the fair market value of the property subsequent to cleaning, whichever is more. The aggregate cost of removing hazardous substances will be the actual cost of such removal to the municipality and shall not be subject to the Twenty Thousand Dollar ($20,000.00) limitation provided in this subsection. The governing authority may assess the same penalty for each time the property or land is cleaned as otherwise provided in this section. The penalty provided herein shall not be assessed against the State of Mississippi upon request for reimbursement under Section 29-1-145, nor shall a municipality clean a parcel owned by the State of Mississippi without first giving notice.

       When the fee or cost to clean property or a parcel of land that is one (1) acre or less does not exceed Two Hundred Fifty Dollars ($250.00), excluding administrative costs, and the property or parcel is located within a municipality having a population over twenty-five thousand (25,000), the governing authority of the municipality may authorize one or more of its employees to determine whether the property or parcel of land is in such a state of uncleanliness as to be a menace to the public health, safety and welfare of the community and the determination made by the authorized municipal employee shall be set forth and recorded in the minutes of the governing authority. Notice of this determination shall be provided to the property owner by:

          Any notice required by this subsection shall include language that informs the property owner that the appropriate municipal official has determined that the property or parcel of land is a menace to the public health, safety and welfare of the community and in need of cleaning and the municipality is authorized to enter the property for cleaning and that the municipality is further authorized to reenter the property or parcel of land for a period of one (1) year after this cleaning without any further hearing or action if notice is posted on the property or parcel of land and at city hall or another place in the municipality where such notices are generally posted at least seven (7) days before the property or parcel of land is reentered for cleaning. A copy of the required notice mailed and posted as required by this subsection shall be recorded in the minutes of the governing authority in conjunction with the determination made by the municipal employee in this subsection (2).

         <p>
          If an authorized municipal employee determines that the condition of property or parcel of land is a menace to the public health, safety and welfare of the community, the governing authority, if the owner does not do so himself, shall proceed to clean the land, by the use of municipal employees or by contract, by cutting grass and weeds; filling cisterns; removing rubbish, abandoned or dilapidated fences, outside toilets, abandoned or dilapidated buildings, slabs, personal property, which removal of personal property shall not be subject to the provisions of Section 21-39-21, and other debris; and draining cesspools and standing water therefrom. The governing authority shall by resolution adjudicate the actual cost of cleaning the property under this provision, provided the same does not exceed Two Hundred Fifty Dollars ($250.00). The cost may become a civil debt against the property owner, and/or, at the option of the governing authority, an assessment against the property. The “cost assessed against the property” means either the cost to the municipality of using its own employees to do the work or the cost to the municipality of any contract executed by the municipality to have the work done, and additionally may include administrative costs of the municipality not to exceed Fifty Dollars ($50.00). For subsequent cleaning within the one-year period set forth in this subsection (2), upon seven (7) days’ notice posted both on the property or parcel of land adjudicated in need of cleaning and at city hall or another place in the municipality where such notices are generally posted, and consistent with the municipal official’s determination as authorized in this subsection (2), a municipality may reenter the property or parcel of land to maintain cleanliness without further notice or hearing under this subsection (2) no more than six (6) times in any twelve-month period with respect to removing abandoned or dilapidated buildings, slabs, dilapidated fences and outside toilets, and no more than twelve (12) times in any twenty-four-month period with respect to cutting grass and weeds and removing rubbish, personal property and other debris on the land, and the expense of cleaning of the property shall not exceed an aggregate amount of One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00) per year under this subsection (2). The governing authority may assess the same penalty for each time the property or land is cleaned as otherwise provided in this subsection (2). The penalty provided herein shall not be assessed against the State of Mississippi upon request for reimbursement under Section 29-1-145, nor shall a municipality clean a parcel owned by the State of Mississippi without first giving notice. A determination made by an appropriate municipal employee under this subsection (2) that the state or condition of property or a parcel of land is a menace to the public health, safety and welfare of the community shall not subsequently be used to replace a hearing if subsection (1) of this section is later utilized by a municipality when the prerequisites of this subsection (2) are not satisfied.

   Plaintiff property owner testified that despite a mistaken property description in the notices he received, he knew which property the defendant city was referring to and did not realize the legal description was not for that property until after the property had already been torn down by the city and he was provided two weeks notice and a chance to be heard pursuant to Miss.

       Pursuant to this section, and after the notice and hearing required thereby, the governing authority of a municipality may find, consistent with fact, and encompass such findings in an order spread upon its minutes, that a parcel of land is in such a state of uncleanliness as to be a menace to the public health and safety of a community.

       A city has no obligation to remove debris located in a stream or drainage way to assist an industry in performing testing and remediation; however, should the municipal governing authorities make the factual determination that such work is necessary for the promotion of the health, comfort, or convenience of inhabitants of the municipality, they may authorize the expenditure of municipal funds on drainage work on a natural water course, which may include the removal of impediments to the natural flow of water through the water course.

       Generally, municipalities may not use public funds and equipment on private property except when such use is incidental to a proper municipal purpose, such as cleaning property pursuant to this section. No authority can be found for a municipality to clean ditches and mow grass in the ditches on private property or to mow grass adjacent to but not on the rights-of-way of city streets with the permission of the landowners.

       Any parcel of property located within a municipality may be cleaned by the municipality, upon a factual determination by the governing authorities the property is in a state of uncleanliness so as to constitute a menace to the public health and safety of the community. The fact that there is a lien on the property does not interfere with the municipality’s authority to clean the property upon the failure of the owner to do and there is no requirement that a lienholder receive any notice of the action.

       Section 21-19-11 does not authorize the sale of personal property removed from a parcel for the purpose of mitigating or offsetting the expenses of cleaning the property. This does not mean that a municipality may not dispose of abandoned personal property acquired by virtue of cleaning private property. In such case, the municipality may utilize the mechanism provided by Section 21-39-21 for disposal of lost, stolen or abandoned personal property. Maxey,

Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t21c19s21-19-11" target="_self">21-19-11</a></cite>. Legal fees, surveys, and other administrative expenses do not qualify as actual costs of clean-up and may not be recovered in the manner prescribed by the statute. The municipality could, however, adopt a criminal ordinance as contemplated in the statute, and could assess a criminal penalty against the property owner in an effort to recoup its expenses.

   A town may treat expenses for cleaning property either as a civil debt or as a lien on the property. A lien is to be treated exactly as a lien for delinquent taxes and thus remains viable through any foreclosure proceedings. In a sale to recover the lien amount, a town must follow the procedures for notice, time of sale, and the like pursuant to Miss.

       The governing authority of any municipality may forgive liens imposed on real property for the costs, fines, penalties and other assessments associated with the municipality’s cleaning of real property pursuant to Section 21-19-11, Mississippi Code of 1972, subject to the following:
       <ol type="a">
        <li id="t21c19s21-19-12ol11a">
         The real property must be in a blighted condition if it has been vacant and in a deteriorated condition which necessitated the municipality’s imposition of a lien in order to correct specific code violations.

         The real property must be purchased by a nonprofit entity or for-profit developer and converted from its blighted condition. For purposes of this section, “nonprofit” entity means an association, organization, or corporation which is a nonprofit organization in accordance with Section 501(c) (3) of the Internal Revenue Code and provides proof of its tax exempt status. “For-profit developer” means an individual partnership or corporation other than the real property’s owner who purchases property considered to be in blighted condition and converts it to productive use.
        </li>
        <li id="t21c19s21-19-12ol11d">
         The nonprofit entity or for-profit developer must have obtained the blighted estate for a sum not exceeding seventy percent (70%) of the real estate’s appraised value.

       The for-profit developer or nonprofit entity may be granted conditional lien amnesty and allowed eighteen (18) months to develop the blighted real property. For good cause shown, the municipality may allow the for profit developer or nonprofit entity an additional six (6) to twelve (12) months to develop the blighted property.
      </li>

      </li>
      <li id="t21c19s21-19-12ol11d2c5">
       If the nonprofit entity or for-profit developer desires to sell or dispose of the real property prior to its development, the nonprofit entity or for-profit developer must first obtain the municipality’s approval. If the municipality approves the sale or disposal of the real estate prior to development, the nonprofit entity or for-profit developer shall pay the principal amount of the lien on or before the closing date of the sale unless a subsequent purchaser of the blighted real property has applied for and been granted conditional lien amnesty.
      </li>
      <li id="t21c19s21-19-12ol11d2c6">
       If a for-profit developer or nonprofit entity sells or disposes of the real property prior to development from its blighted condition without the municipality’s approval, then the for-profit developer or nonprofit entity shall be liable to the city for the principal amount of the lien plus interest at the rate of eight percent (8%), and a penalty of One Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($1,500.00) will also be assessed against the developer.
      </li>

       Although municipalities may not generally provide drainage or flood control services for private individuals, they may perform work on private property for the purpose of controlling flooding on city streets, and, with the permission of the private property owner, they may perform drainage work on private property for the purpose of mitigating damage and unsafe conditions caused by the municipality in draining city streets.

       The governing authorities of a town have the authority to perform work on a natural water course on private property in order to alleviate erosion on private property; the authorities would have to find, consistent with fact, and spread upon the minutes, that the damage was caused by the way in which the public street was drained. Brown, Dec. 20, 2002, A.G. Op. #02-0721.
      </p>
      <p>

       Municipal corporation is not responsible for destruction of property within its limits by fire which it did not set out, merely because, through negligence or other default of corporation or its employees, members of fire department failed to extinguish fire, though this failure is due to negligence in permitting fire hydrants to become defective; and it makes no difference that municipality uses same reservoirs and pipes for its fire service that it employs for distribution of public supply for domestic purposes, from which it derives profit, since the two functions are distinguishable.

       A municipality, after first finding what remains of the building is dangerous and insecure as a result of fire damage, enter upon the property and demolish the same and remove the debris therefrom. Baker, Nov. 21, 2003, A.G. Op. 03-0615.
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>

      </p>
      <p>
       A municipality may not assess the cost of removal as a lien against the property; however, nothing would prevent a municipality from pursuing a civil action against the property owner for recovery of the actual expenses of the removal of the structure should it become necessary for it to do so.

The ordinance adopting the code shall not set out the code in full, but shall merely identify the same. The vote on passage of the ordinance shall be the same as on any other ordinances. After its adoption, the code shall be certified to by the mayor and clerk of the municipality, and shall be filed as a permanent record in the office of the clerk, who shall not be required to transcribe and record the same in the ordinance book as other ordinances. It shall not be necessary that the ordinance adopting the code or the code itself be published in full, but notice of the adoption of the code shall be given by publication in some newspaper of the municipality for one (1) time, or if there be no such newspaper, by posting at three (3) or more public places within the corporate limits, a notice in substantially the following form:
     </p>

      Notice is given that the city (or town or village) of_______________ , on the (give date of ordinance adopting code), adopted (state type of code and other information serving to identify the same) code.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the governing authority of any municipality adopts or has adopted construction codes which do not have proper provisions to maintain up-to-date amendments, specifications in such codes for cements used in portland cement concrete shall be superseded by nationally recognized specifications referenced in any code adopted by the Mississippi Building Code Council.
     </p>
     <p>
      All the provisions of this section shall apply to amendments and revisions of the code mentioned in this section. Any code adopted in accordance with this section shall not be in force for one (1) month after its passage, unless the municipal authorities in the ordinance authorize to the contrary. The provisions of this section shall be in addition and supplemental to any existing laws authorizing the adoption, amendment or revision of municipal ordinances or codes.
     </p>
     <p>
      Notwithstanding any provision of this section to the contrary, any code adopted by a municipality before or after April 12, 2001, is subject to the provisions of Section 41-26-14(10).
     </p>
     <p>
      Notwithstanding any provision of this section to the contrary, the governing authorities of each municipality in Jackson, Harrison, Hancock, Stone and Pearl River Counties shall enforce the requirements imposed under Section 17-2-1 as provided in such section.

       While local governing authorities cannot enact ordinances which have the purpose or effect of prohibiting bingo halls, they may enact reasonable ordinances governing operation of halls, including zoning restrictions or restrictions on hours of operation; restrictions on hours must not conflict with provisions of Section 97-33-67. Peeples, Dec. 18, 1992, A.G. Op. #92-0816.
      </p>
      <p>
       Municipalities are empowered to regulate and also to prohibit the operation of pool halls. Because a person who has been convicted of any felony is not eligible to obtain a permit for the retail sale of beer or light wines, he would be prevented from obtaining a permit to operate a pool hall where beer would likely be sold. Mclaurin, Aug. 6, 2004, A.G. Op. 04-0389.

     <p>
      The governing authorities of municipalities shall have the power to adopt reasonable ordinances for the regulation of transient vendors not inconsistent with the provisions of Sections 75-85-1 through 75-85-19. However, said authorities shall not have the power to declare residential solicitations by transient vendors who are citizens of the State of Mississippi, or who are agents of corporations domiciled in the State of Mississippi, or who are agents of foreign corporations qualified to do business in the State of Mississippi, to be a public nuisance or a misdemeanor, unless said transient vendors are not in compliance with Sections 75-85-1 through 75-85-19 or local regulations. Before transacting any business, all transient vendors shall furnish to the municipality wherein said business is to be transacted, a good and sufficient penal bond in an amount not to exceed Two Thousand Dollars ($2,000.00) conditioned that if said transient vendor shall comply with all of the provisions of the municipal ordinances relating to transient vendors said obligation shall be void, otherwise, to remain in full force and effect. Any ordinance adopted by the governing authority of a municipality under the provisions of this section shall control as to the area within such municipality, regardless of the existence of a county ordinance.

       The bond required by Section 75-85-13 is separate and distinct from the bond which may be imposed by either municipalities and/or counties under Sections 21-19-35 and 19-3-83, respectively; i.e., transient vendors must comply with any and all applicable statutes.

      The governing authorities of any municipality within this state are hereby authorized and empowered to adopt ordinances in the manner now provided by law to regulate the sale of goods, wares, or merchandise within the corporate limits of such municipality, subject to the provisions hereinafter named.
     </p>
     <p>
      Such governing body is hereby authorized and empowered to enact an ordinance requiring any person, firm, or corporation desiring to conduct a sale commonly known as bankruptcy, insolvent, liquidation, assignee’s, receiver’s, trustee’s, adjuster’s, wholesale, manufacturer’s, or closing-out sale, or a sale of goods damaged by fire, smoke, or water, or otherwise, to file with such governing authorities a petition for the privilege of conducting such sale, showing:
     </p>
     <p>
      the nature of the sale and the length of time required by the petitioner for conducting said sale;
     </p>
     <p>
      whether or not it is the purpose of said petitioner to replenish his stock of goods, wares, and merchandise during the course of the sale, and to what extent it is proposed to replenish said stock;
     </p>
     <p>
      the place of sale and approximate value of goods to be sold.
     </p>

      Such governing authorities may provide for a privilege tax in any sum not in excess of One Hundred Dollars ($100.00) for the privilege of conducting such sale, and may provide that such privilege tax shall be good and valid only for the conduct of a sale of goods in the manner and at the time and place set forth and prescribed in the application for the privilege of conducting such sale.
     </p>
     <p>
      Nothing in this section, however, shall be construed to authorize and empower municipal governing authorities to enact any ordinances to prevent or to interfere with any sale made by a trustee under a deed of trust or an assignment, or by sheriffs, constables, or other public or court officials, or by any other person or persons acting under the authority and/or direction of any court in the course of official duty, or by any duly licensed bona fide merchant of such municipality conducting a seasonal or special sale ordinarily conducted by merchants, or by any bona fide merchant who is closing out his stock of goods and advertises such sale to that effect, or by a bona fide merchant whose own stock of goods has been damaged by fire, smoke, water, or otherwise, and who advertises as such.
     </p>
     <p>
      Such municipal governing authorities may, by ordinance, prescribe penalties for the violation of such ordinance and may make such violation of said ordinances punishable in the manner provided by law for the punishment of misdemeanors.
     </p>
     <p>
      The provisions of this section shall apply to all municipalities of this state, whether operating under the code charter, a special charter, commission form, or other form of government.

       The governing body of a municipality possesses only such authority as is conferred upon it by its charter or by general statutes, together with such powers as are necessary to give effect to the powers granted. Mayor & Bd. of Aldermen v. Engle, 211 Miss. 380, 51 So. 2d 564 (1951).
      </p>
      <p>
       A city can do and perform all acts for which it has authority under its charter from the State from which it derives its existence, except such as may be in conflict with the Constitution. City of Indianola v. Sunflower County, 209 Miss. 116, 46 So. 2d 81, 1950 Miss. LEXIS 367 (Miss. 1950).
      </p>
      <p>
       Municipal powers are only those expressly conferred by statute, and necessarily implied; Such powers belong to the municipality and not to its officers. Tullos v. Magee, 181 Miss. 288, 179 So. 557, 1938 Miss. LEXIS 70 (Miss. 1938).
      </p>
      <p>
       Municipalities can exercise no powers except such as are delegated to them by the state expressly or by necessary implication. Steitenroth v. Jackson, 99 Miss. 354, 54 So. 955, 1911 Miss. LEXIS 212 (Miss. 1911).
      </p>
      <p>
       A municipality cannot be allowed to exercise powers not clearly given it by its charter. Crittenden v. Booneville, 92 Miss. 277, 45 So. 723, 1908 Miss. LEXIS 177 (Miss. 1908).

      <p>
       Where a purported lease contract giving to a college an option to purchase the leased property was ultra vires in that the special act under which the municipal authorities acted did not authorize the giving of an option, the option provision could not be upheld under the authority of this section. Whitworth College, Inc. v. Brooklhaven, 161 F. Supp. 775, 1958 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2424 (D. Miss.), aff'd, 261 F.2d 868, 1958 U.S. App. LEXIS 3368 (5th Cir. Miss. 1958).
      </p>
      <p>
       The power of a municipality to contract with reference to any subject matter must either be expressly covered by its charter or by general statute, or necessarily implied therefrom. Mayor & Bd. of Aldermen v. Engle, 211 Miss. 380, 51 So. 2d 564 (1951).

       It is not necessary that the claim should first be presented to a municipality for allowance or rejection before suit may be instituted thereon. Pylant v. Purvis, 87 Miss. 433, 40 So. 7, 1905 Miss. LEXIS 165 (Miss. 1905).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a claim against a municipality is barred by limitation it ceases to be a debt and it is the duty of the municipality to plead the statute of limitations. Trowbridge v. Schmidt, 82 Miss. 475, 34 So. 84, 1903 Miss. LEXIS 137 (Miss. 1903).
      </p>
      <p>
       An allowance by municipal authorities of a demand barred by limitation is without consideration and ultra vires, and mandamus will not lie to compel the issuance of a warrant or to complete an imperfect one made on such an allowance. Trowbridge v. Schmidt, 82 Miss. 475, 34 So. 84, 1903 Miss. LEXIS 137 (Miss. 1903).

     <p>
      The governing authorities of municipalities may provide that any person desiring to subdivide a tract of land within the corporate limits shall submit a map and plat of such subdivision, and a correct abstract of title of the land platted, to said governing authorities, to be approved by them before the same shall be filed for record in the land records of the county. Where the municipality has adopted an ordinance so providing, no such map or plat of any such subdivision shall be recorded by the chancery clerk unless same has been approved by said governing authorities. In all cases where a map or plat of the subdivision is submitted to the governing authorities of a municipality, and is by them approved, all streets, roads, alleys and other public ways set forth and shown on said map or plat shall be thereby dedicated to the public use, and shall not be used otherwise unless and until said map or plat is vacated in the manner provided by law, notwithstanding that said streets, roads, alleys or other public ways have not been actually opened for the use of the public. If any easement dedicated pursuant to the provisions of this section for a street, road, alley or other public purpose is determined to be not needed for the public purpose, the easement may be declared abandoned, and ownership of the fee underlying the easement shall revert, regardless of the date of dedication, to the adjoining property owner or owners at the time of abandonment. Ownership of the easement shall extend to the centerline of said abandoned street, road or public way. Such abandonment and reversion shall not affect any private easements which might exist.

       Square piece of property in middle of subdivided lots was public way, for purposes of rule that public ways on subdivision map or plat are dedicated to public use by submission of map or plat to and acceptance of map or plat by municipality’s governing authorities.

       Where the plat of a subdivision established beyond the limits of a city contained the certificate of the owners and the engineers saying that the designated streets were private ways and not dedicated to the public, and restrictive covenants were placed upon the property to the same effect, there was no implied dedication of a strip of land subsequently used for drains and a dam, and the only part of the strip that could be used as a public street was the part actually improved and maintained by the city after the city limits were extended to encompass this subdivision.

       Without specific authority city may not contribute funds to private nonprofit corporation; municipalities may expend municipal general fund monies as matching funds for certain types of social and community service programs, however programs offered by South Mississippi Aids Task Force do not appear to fit within framework of social and community programs set out in Section 21-19-65.

      <p>
       A city may make an in-kind donation of buses to a city boys and girls club, after determining the fair market value of the buses in question, by either a lease or transfer of title; however, this donation would be conditioned upon the board of aldermen of the city making the factual determination that this program is of a type that is envisioned in the statute, and upon the program providing documentation of funds or other property which the city’s donation would be the dollar-for-dollar (or value-for-value) match. Chrestman, Mar. 8, 2002, A.G. Op. #02-0077.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a city finds that programs are of the type addressed in the statute, then it may expend funds to match other funds for the programs; with regard to a program which is an umbrella organization, the city must decide which of its programs fall within the statute and earmark matching funds to such specific program(s).

       Whether a particular organization is one entitled to a donation is a fact determination which must be made by the governing authorities; the mayor alone does not have the authority to make this determination. Brewer, May 30, 2003, A.G. Op. 03-0275.
      </p>
      <p>
       Municipal governing authorities have the authority to make donations (in either cash or in-kind services) to certain nonprofit social and community service programs, provided matching funds exist from other sources. Thus, at the appropriate time, upon appropriate findings by the municipal governing authorities that educational programs proposed by a non-profit organization satisfy the requirements of this section, a donation could be authorized. Whites, July 23, 2004, A.G. Op. 04-0264.
      </p>
      <p>
       A municipality may donate funds or in-kind services, and the factual determination of whether a program qualifies to receive donations is left to the municipal governing authorities.
   Provided the proper factual findings are made by the governing authorities, the payment of phone service and utilities would also qualify as an in-kind donation. Bogen, Nov. 15, 2004, A.G. Op. 04-0557.
      </p>
      <p>
       A policy of a municipality establishing a lower fee for use of municipal facilities for charitable benefits than charged for other private uses would be impermissible. As an alternative, however, certain statutes authorize municipal donations to certain types of qualified organizations. Baum, Feb. 17, 2006, A.G. Op. 06-0048.

   Police chief’s speech in reporting the Mayor of the city to outside law enforcement agencies for misuse of the city gasoline card was not constitutionally protected because, in light of his statutory duties, communicating with outside law enforcement agencies was part of the police chief’s job responsibilities. Gibson v. Kilpatrick, 773 F.3d 661, 2014 U.S. App. LEXIS 23330 (5th Cir. Miss. 2014), cert. denied, — U.S. —, <cite class="s_court">135 S. Ct. 2318</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">191 L.

       <p>
   Under
   42 USCS § 1983, a municipality may be held liable only if its “policy” caused deprivation of a right protected by constitution or federal laws; one definition of “policy” being a persistent, widespread practice of city officials or employees which, although not authorized by officially adopted and promulgated policy, is so common and well settled as to constitute a custom that fairly represents municipal policy, actual or constructive knowledge of such customs being attributable to municipality’s governing body or to an official to whom body had designated “policy making authority,” a “policy maker” is a person who has final authority to make choice as between several alternatives, and marshal or chief of police, being chief law enforcement officer of a municipality under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t21c21s21-21-1" target="_self">21-21-1</a></cite>, is “policy maker” with regard to specific decision to use chemical mace in courtroom, in what manner, and for how long.
   Lester v. Rosedale, 757 F. Supp. 741, 1991 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2376 (N.D. Miss. 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       In reference to instant section, since it was undisputed that defendant police chief had policy making authority in city, and since pursuant to such authority he adopted course of action with respect to training of officers under his supervision, including defendant police officer who allegedly had detained plaintiff for 8 hours without informing him of charges against him, city was equally responsible with chief of police for any liability chief might incur in regard to decision to allow defendant officer to continue in his police responsibilities despite fact he had not received proper training. Accordingly city’s motion for summary judgment should be denied. White v. Taylor, 775 F. Supp. 962, 1990 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19346 (S.D. Miss. 1990), rev'd, 959 F.2d 539, 1992 U.S. App. LEXIS 8466 (5th Cir. Miss. 1992).

   Hiring of city administrator by municipality operating under Private Charter does not imply that administrator, to whom chief of police is to report, is municipality’s de facto chief law enforcement officer, and therefore does not violate provisions of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t21c21s21-21-1" target="_self">21-21-1</a></cite>.

       A seizure and sale by a town marshal acting as a constable, without the limits of the town and supervisor’s district in which the town is situated, under a distress warrant issued by the mayor of such town, are invalid, and confer no title upon a purchaser at the sale.

       Const. 1890, §§ 80, 88, among other things providing for general laws to create and govern municipal corporations are prospective in operation and do not repeal existing municipal charters.

      <p>
       Because legislature has not delegated exclusive police power specifically over state fairgrounds property to particular entity, nor has it specifically taken away such power from City of Jackson by necessary implication, City of Jackson retains jurisdiction over violations of state statutes at fairgrounds (modifying conflicting prior opinions to conform with this opinion). Ross, August 26, 1992, A.G. Op. #92-0675.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although nothing appears to prohibit constable from also serving as police chief of municipality within county, one of duties of police chief is to act as constable ex-officio within municipality; for those duties, within municipality, he or she must serve as police chief, and be compensated accordingly, and outside of municipality he or she may serve as Constable and be compensated accordingly. Mayo, Oct. 28, 1992, A.G. Op. #92-0745.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under Miss. Code Section 21-21-1, Chief of Police exercises day-to-day supervision and control over police officers, making daily decisions as to what law enforcement duties to assign individual police officers, what positions to put officers in, and how investigations will proceed. Ramsay, Mar. 10, 1993, A.G. Op. #93-0155.
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
       An elected chief of police may not suspend a police officer without pay or terminate a police officer. Davis, July 19, 2002, A.G. Op. #02-0396.
      </p>
      <p>
       The mayor may request attendance but may not force attendance at a weekly staff meeting of an elected police chief. Lee, Jan. 3, 2003, A.G. Op. #02-0749.
      </p>
      <p>
       A weekly staff meeting of the mayor and departments heads, including the police chief, does not conflict with the doctrine of separation of powers set forth in Article 1 and 2 of the Mississippi Constitution. Lee, Jan. 3, 2003, A.G. Op. #02-0749.
      </p>
      <p>
       Residents of a municipality may meet with the mayor to discuss any matter pertaining to the operation of the municipality, including police protection, and the mayor may meet with the police chief or police officers to gather information concerning operation of the police department and may also direct residents to communicate with the police chief concerning police protection generally or specific ongoing situations in law enforcement. Lee, Jan. 3, 2003, A.G. Op. #02-0749.
      </p>
      <p>
       The mayor may meet with police officers to obtain information concerning the operation of the police department, but the mayor does not have authority to become involved in the day to day operation of the police department or to make law enforcement decisions. Lee, Jan. 3, 2003, A.G. Op. #02-0749.
      </p>
      <p>
       The board of aldermen may reprimand a police officer over the objection of the chief of police after seeking information from the chief of police. Lee, Jan. 3, 2003, A.G. Op. #02-0749.
      </p>
      <p>
       The board of aldermen does not have authority to make daily decisions which arise in the management of the police department, such as decisions concerning an individual officer’s shift, duties or assignments. Lee, Jan. 3, 2003, A.G. Op. #02-0749.

       All school district employees, both instructional and noninstructional, are entitled to elect to receive equal monthly payments for a twelve-month period. Adams, Jan. 17, 2003, A.G. Op. #02-0750.
      </p>
      <p>
       A municipality is without the power to abolish the position of marshal or chief of police, as Section 21-21-1 mandates that such a position exist in all municipalities. Hatcher, Feb. 14, 2003, A.G. Op. #03-0075.
      </p>
      <p>
       A town may appoint an individual as its Chief of Police or Town Marshal to work for free until the next fiscal year, primarily for administrative purposes in securing funds for hiring of police officers and securing equipment with the police department to go into effect upon adoption of the next budget at the commencement of the next fiscal year. Hatcher, Feb. 14, 2003, A.G. Op. #03-0075.
      </p>
      <p>
       The city manager, not the city council, appoints police officers. The police chief may but need not recommend that the city manager hire a certain police officer. Walker,
   Aug. 1, 2003, A.G. Op. 03-0285.
      </p>
      <p>
       All code charter municipalities with the mayor-aldermen form of government are required to have a chief of police or marshal. Davis, Oct. 29, 2004, A.G. Op. 04-0522.
      </p>
      <p>
       The police chief serves at the will and pleasure of the city manager and is subject to his direction and control. Johnson, Nov. 5, 2004, A.G. Op. 04-0547.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the mayor-alderman form of municipal government the board of aldermen has no authority to interfere in the day-do-day operations of a municipal department, including the police department. The responsibility to assign individual work duties and shifts within the police department lies with the police chief. Reynolds,
   Sept. 23, 2005,
   A.G. Op. 05-0480.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both the municipal police and the county sheriff have the authority and duty to keep the peace within municipal limits. Webster,
   Oct. 21, 2005,
   A.G. Op. 05-0485.
      </p>
      <p>
       Authority to hire, fire, set compensation, and define duties of municipal employees rests solely with the board of aldermen, subject to mayoral veto power. Whether a part-time police chief is sufficient to satisfy the municipality’s statutory duty to provide police protection is a factual determination to be made by the governing authority. If a municipality does not have a police chief, the board of aldermen must appoint one. An untrained part-time police officer is a law enforcement trainee who must be supervised by a certified officer and has two years from hiring to become certified. McLain, March 2, 2007, A.G. Op. #07-00069, 2007 Miss. AG LEXIS 82.

   A municipality has a statutory duty under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t21c21s21-21-3" target="_self">21-21-3</a></cite> to provide sufficient police protection. The manner in which a municipality complies with that duty, and whether it can close its Police Department for a 24-hour period to give its officers leave, are determinations to be made by the municipality.

       § 21-23-3.
    Appointment of municipal judge and prosecuting attorney in certain municipalities.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      In all municipalities having a population of ten thousand (10,000) or more, according to the latest available federal census, there shall be a municipal judge and a prosecuting attorney, who shall be appointed by the governing authorities of the municipality at the time provided for the appointment of other officers. The municipal governing authorities may appoint one (1) additional municipal judge, who shall exercise the same authority and prerogatives of the office, regardless of the presence or absence of the other municipal judge. Except as otherwise provided in Section 21-23-5, a municipal judge shall be a qualified elector of the county in which the municipality is located and shall be an attorney at law. Such municipal judges and prosecuting attorney shall receive a salary, to be paid by the municipality, and to be fixed by the governing authorities of the municipality.
     </p>
     <p>
      In any proceeding in which a conflict of interest arises for the prosecuting attorney, or any other reason dictates that he recuse himself, the mayor of the municipality may appoint a special prosecuting attorney for that particular proceeding. Such special prosecuting attorney shall be compensated for his services in the same manner and amount as allowed under Section 21-23-7 for appointed counsel for indigent persons.
     </p>
     <p>
      Provided, however, the governing authorities of any municipality having a population in excess of ten thousand (10,000) persons according to the latest available federal census and situated in a county having an area in excess of nine hundred thirty-five (935) square miles and having a county court may, in their discretion, follow the provisions as set out in Section 21-23-5 for municipalities having a population of less than ten thousand (10,000).
     </p>
     <p>
      Provided, further, the governing authorities of any municipality having a population in excess of fifty thousand (50,000) according to the latest federal decennial census may, in their discretion, provide for the appointment of not more than ten (10) municipal judges for said municipality, each of whom shall exercise the same authority and prerogatives of their office, regardless of the presence or absence of the other municipal judges.

       The fact that a search warrant, directed to any lawful officer of the town of Louin, was delivered by the marshal to, and served by, the sheriff, did not make the service of the warrant upon defendant in a prosecution for unlawful possession of intoxicating liquor illegal, where the marshal was present when the sheriff delivered a copy of the search warrant to the defendant, and the marshal had a right to summon such aid as in his judgment was needed to execute the search warrant both by the terms of the statute and the warrant itself, and either of the officers could have made a valid return on the warrant.

       An affidavit filed before a police justice charging wilful and unlawful possession of intoxicating beer contrary to the laws and ordinances of the city was insufficient to charge an offense since the state law permitted possession of beer for personal consumption. City of Amory v. Yielding, 203 Miss. 265, 34 So. 2d 726, 1948 Miss. LEXIS 261 (Miss. 1948).
      </p>
      <p>
       When a town is located partly in two counties, the county line running through the municipality, the mayor is nevertheless the mayor of the entire town and in consequence is an ex officio justice of the peace throughout the entire limits of the municipality, including that part in one county as well as the other; and being so, he is a justice of the peace ex officio of both counties and has authority, while acting within the municipality, to issue a search warrant authorizing a search for unlawful possession of intoxicating liquors to be executed in any part of either one of the two counties. Hathaway v. State, 188 Miss. 403, 195 So. 323, 1940 Miss. LEXIS 46 (Miss. 1940).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the record in a criminal proceeding charging the defendant with the unlawful sale of intoxicating liquors showed a confusion of jurisdiction as to whether the trial magistrate acted as a police justice or as an ex officio justice of the peace, the conviction could not be sustained since because of such confusion the defendant would not be in a position to make a plea of former conviction or former acquittal against a further prosecution for violation either of the city ordinance or of the state laws. Wright v. Belzoni, 188 Miss. 334, 194 So. 919, 1940 Miss. LEXIS 33 (Miss. 1940).
      </p>
      <p>
       Mayor of city having police justice has no function as ex-officio justice of peace, and affidavit taken and search warrant issued by him are void, and evidence obtained thereunder inadmissible. Palmer v. Lumberton, 153 Miss. 886, 122 So. 199, 1929 Miss. LEXIS 103 (Miss. 1929).
      </p>
      <p>
       The record of a proceeding on appeal from a judgment of a police court is not required to say affirmatively that the mayor was absent or disqualified to act. City of Pascagoula v. Sharp, 136 Miss. 756, 101 So. 683, 1924 Miss. LEXIS 163 (Miss. 1924).

       A case in which it is held that the City of Laurel had no authority to elect a police justice pro tempore. City of Laurel v. Turner, 96 Miss. 631, 51 So. 403, 1910 Miss. LEXIS 173 (Miss. 1910).
      </p>
      <p>
       A case in which the matter of jurisdiction as to whether the proceeding was before a mayor or before a justice of the peace, appearing so conflicting and confused that the defendant is discharged. Washington v. State, 93 Miss. 270, 46 So. 539, 1908 Miss. LEXIS 95 (Miss. 1908).

       A justice of the peace accepting the office of mayor vacates the office of justice of the peace. State ex rel. Attorney Gen. v. Armstrong, 91 Miss. 513, 44 So. 809, 1907 Miss. LEXIS 144 (Miss. 1907).
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that the duties of a police justice happen to be in part those which a justice of the peace might exercise does not affect his title to the office. Rich v. McLauren, 83 Miss. 95, 35 So. 337, 1903 Miss. LEXIS 14 (Miss. 1903) but see Edwards v. Weeks, 633 So. 2d 1035, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 125 (Miss. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       The mayor has no authority to vote in the election of a police justice except where there is a tie vote by the aldermen. Rich v. McLauren, 83 Miss. 95, 35 So. 337, 1903 Miss. LEXIS 14 (Miss. 1903) but see Edwards v. Weeks, 633 So. 2d 1035, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 125 (Miss. 1994).

       Officers are created for the public welfare and not for the benefit of officers, and justices of the peace cannot complain that a police justice is given jurisdiction with themselves. Hughes v. State, 79 Miss. 77, 29 So. 786, 1901 Miss. LEXIS 7 (Miss. 1901).

   Although §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t21c23s21-23-5" target="_self">21-23-5</a></cite>, which allows a mayor or mayor pro tempore of a small municipality to serve as municipal judge, is not unconstitutional under the sections of the state constitution dealing with separation of powers, there is an unavoidable conflict of interest in the holding of the dual offices of mayor and municipal judge, and thus the statute will have no future application as it is contrary to the proper functioning of the judiciary. In re Inquiry Concerning Mun. Judges, 631 So. 2d 758, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 34 (Miss. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   For purposes of the Mississippi Code of Judicial Conduct, any officer performing judicial functions is a judge. Thus, a mayor who served as a municipal judge pursuant to §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t21c23s21-23-5" target="_self">21-23-5</a></cite> was a “judge” within the contemplation of both the Rules of the Mississippi Commission on Judicial Performance and the Code of Judicial Conduct by virtue of his role as judge pro tempore of the municipal court. Mississippi Judicial Performance Com. v. Thomas, 549 So. 2d 962, 1989 Miss. LEXIS 451 (Miss. 1989).
      </p>
      <p>
       The failure of a mayor to keep separate criminal dockets, as required by this section [Code 1942, § 3374-103] for his proceedings in criminal matters as mayor and for his proceedings as an ex officio justice of the peace can result in a confusion of jurisdiction sufficient to invalidate a conviction against a defendant appearing before him. Suggs v. State, 250 Miss. 730, 168 So. 2d 514, 1964 Miss. LEXIS 494 (Miss. 1964).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a proceeding on a petition for writ of prohibition against a municipality to prohibit further prosecution of a manager of a theater under a void ordinance pertaining to Sunday shows, the mayor was mandatorily the police justice of the city and was party to the suit. City of New Albany v. Benya, 228 Miss. 419, 87 So. 2d 889, 1956 Miss. LEXIS 529 (Miss. 1956).

       The mayor of the town of Louin by virtue of his office as police justice and as ex officio justice of the peace, had the power as an ex officio justice of the peace to issue the search warrant and it was not necessary in order to give validity to his act in issuing the search warrant that he add the title ex officio justice of peace to his official signature as mayor.

       An affidavit filed before a police justice charging wilful and unlawful possession of intoxicating beer contrary to the laws and ordinances of the city was insufficient to charge an offense since the state law permitted possession of beer for personal consumption.

      <p>
       When a town is located partly in two counties, the county line running through the municipality, the mayor is nevertheless the mayor of the entire town and in consequence is an ex officio justice of the peace throughout the entire limits of the municipality, including that part in one county as well as the other; and being so, he is a justice of the peace ex officio of both counties and has authority, while acting within the municipality, to issue a search warrant authorizing a search for unlawful possession of intoxicating liquors to be executed in any part of either one of the two counties. Hathaway v. State, 188 Miss. 403, 195 So. 323, 1940 Miss. LEXIS 46 (Miss. 1940).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section making the mayor of a town an ex officio justice of the peace therein derives its authority from § 172, Constitution 1890, which allows the establishment of inferior courts, and not from § 175 thereof which deals exclusively with district justices of the peace.

       The record of a proceeding on appeal from a judgment of a police court is not required to say affirmatively that the mayor was absent or disqualified to act. City of Pascagoula v. Sharp, 136 Miss. 756, 101 So. 683, 1924 Miss. LEXIS 163 (Miss. 1924).

       A justice of the peace accepting the office of mayor vacates the office of justice of the peace. State ex rel. Attorney Gen. v. Armstrong, 91 Miss. 513, 44 So. 809, 1907 Miss. LEXIS 144 (Miss. 1907).
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that the duties of a police justice happen to be in part those which a justice of the peace might exercise does not affect his title to the office. Rich v. McLauren, 83 Miss. 95, 35 So. 337, 1903 Miss. LEXIS 14 (Miss. 1903) but see Edwards v. Weeks, 633 So. 2d 1035, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 125 (Miss. 1994).

       Officers are created for the public welfare and not for the benefit of officers, and justices of the peace cannot complain that a police justice is given jurisdiction with themselves. Hughes v. State, 79 Miss. 77, 29 So. 786, 1901 Miss. LEXIS 7 (Miss. 1901).

The municipal judge may hold court outside the boundaries of the municipality but not more than within a one-mile radius of the municipality for any purpose. The municipal judge shall have the jurisdiction to hear and determine, without a jury and without a record of the testimony, all cases charging violations of the municipal ordinances and state misdemeanor laws made offenses against the municipality and to punish offenders therefor as may be prescribed by law. Except as otherwise provided by law, criminal proceedings shall be brought by sworn complaint filed in the municipal court. Such complaint shall state the essential elements of the offense charged and the statute or ordinance relied upon. Such complaint shall not be required to conclude with a general averment that the offense is against the peace and dignity of the state or in violation of the ordinances of the municipality. He may sit as a committing court in all felonies committed within the municipality, and he shall have the power to bind over the accused to the grand jury or to appear before the proper court having jurisdiction to try the same, and to set the amount of bail or refuse bail and commit the accused to jail in cases not bailable. The municipal judge is a conservator of the peace within his municipality. He may conduct preliminary hearings in all violations of the criminal laws of this state occurring within the municipality, and any person arrested for a violation of law within the municipality may be brought before him for initial appearance.

Such programs shall provide for reasonable supervision of the offender and the work shall be commensurate with the fine and/or incarceration that would have ordinarily been imposed. Such program of public service may be utilized in the implementation of the provisions of Section 99-19-20, and public service work thereunder may be supervised by persons other than the sheriff.

Any such program shall be established by the court with written policies and procedures filed with the clerk of the court for public record. Subsequent to original sentencing, the municipal judge, in misdemeanor cases, is hereby authorized to suspend sentence and to suspend the execution of a sentence, or any part thereof, on such terms as may be imposed by the municipal judge, if (a) the judge or his or her predecessor was authorized to order such suspension when the sentence was originally imposed; and (b) such conviction (i) has not been appealed; or (ii) has been appealed and the appeal has been voluntarily dismissed.

       Section 2 of ch. 374 Laws of 2009, effective from and after its passage (approved March 17, 2009), amended this section. Section 8 of ch. 545, Laws of
   2009, effective July 1, 2009 (approved April 15, 2009), also amended this section. As set out above, this section reflects the language of Section 8 of ch. 545, Laws of 2009, pursuant to
   Section 1-3-79 which provides that whenever the same section of law is amended by different bills during the same legislative session, the amendment with the latest effective date shall supersede all other amendments to the same section taking effect on an earlier date.

       Pursuant to
   Section 1-1-109, the Joint Legislative Committee on Compilation, Revision and Publication of Legislation corrected a typographical error in subsection (11) by deleting the dots between “not to exceed” and “$35.00.” The Joint Committee ratified the correction at its August 1, 2013, meeting.

       Officer was sworn in by a justice court judge to fulfill the duties of a justice court deputy clerk in June 2015, and he was acting as a de facto officer and possessed the requisite authority to administer the oath and swear to the charging affidavit; therefore, any defects that may have existed in the appointment of the officer did not negate that he was acting under the color of appointment at the time he issued defendant’s affidavit.

       Citation issued to defendant was a valid affidavit, and therefore its filing in the justice court gave the circuit court jurisdiction over defendant’s case. Oliver v. State, — So.3d —, 2019 Miss. App. LEXIS 18 (Miss. Ct. App. Jan. 15, 2019).

       Defendant was charged with refusing a breath test; the municipal court that tried defendant in absentia had the authority to hear defendant’s case, and testimony that defendant argued should have been heard was beyond the scope of a hearing on certiorari before the circuit court.

       Municipal court did not err in sentencing defendant after it had previously suspended his sentence for one year for him to receive counseling, as it was within the municipal court’s discretion to suspend defendant’s sentence and the court had jurisdiction to revoke that suspension if defendant committed another offense within two years of the time the sentence was originally suspended. Murrell v. City of Indianola, 858 So. 2d 183, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 1005 (Miss. Ct. App. 2003).

       Section 21-23-7, which grants a municipal judge the authority to hear cases charging violations of municipal ordinances and state misdemeanor laws made offenses against the municipality, does not deprive a county court of jurisdiction over misdemeanors committed within a municipality that lies within the county; while a municipal court has jurisdiction when a municipality charges a defendant either under an explicit municipal ordinance or an ordinance by incorporation from state misdemeanor law, an act is considered an offense against the municipality only if the municipality brings the action.

However, the petitioner pleaded guilty to burglary on October 9, 1979, 3 years prior to October 1, 1982, and admitted that he did not fall within the criterion in any of the statutes authorizing expunction, and thus the trial court did not err in denying his petition for expunction.

       The fact that a search warrant, directed to any lawful officer of the town of Louin, was delivered by the marshal to, and served by, the sheriff, did not make the service of the warrant upon defendant in a prosecution for unlawful possession of intoxicating liquor illegal, where the marshal was present when the sheriff delivered a copy of the search warrant to the defendant, and the marshal had a right to summon such aid as in his judgment was needed to execute the search warrant both by the terms of the statute and the warrant itself, and either of the officers could have made a valid return on the warrant.

VI, § 177A in failing to properly adjudicate criminal matters, and engaging in ticket-fixing, in exchange for simultaneous payments to a “drug fund” established and maintained by the town police chief, which violated Miss. Code Jud. Conduct Canons 1, 2A, 3B(1), 3B(2), 3B(8); the judge admitted that his decision to accept the lesser pleas contingent on payments into the drug fund was at least partially motivated by his desire to collect fees for the town, and this was not a mistake of the law, but a clear disregard of it, and was sanctionable. After considering the Gibson factors, the commission’s recommendation was adopted. Miss. Comm'n on Judicial Performance v. Smith, 109 So.3d 95, 2013 Miss. LEXIS 64 (Miss. 2013).

       An affidavit filed before a police justice charging wilful and unlawful possession of intoxicating beer contrary to the laws and ordinances of the city was insufficient to charge an offense since the state law permitted possession of beer for personal consumption. City of Amory v. Yielding, 203 Miss. 265, 34 So. 2d 726, 1948 Miss. LEXIS 261 (Miss. 1948).

       When a town is located partly in two counties, the county line running through the municipality, the mayor is nevertheless the mayor of the entire town and in consequence is an ex officio justice of the peace throughout the entire limits of the municipality, including that part in one county as well as the other; and being so, he is a justice of the peace ex officio of both counties and has authority, while acting within the municipality, to issue a search warrant authorizing a search for unlawful possession of intoxicating liquors to be executed in any part of either one of the two counties.

      <p>
       This section making the mayor of a town an ex officio justice of the peace therein derives its authority from § 172, Constitution 1890, which allows the establishment of inferior courts, and not from § 175 thereof which deals exclusively with district justices of the peace. Hathaway v. State, 188 Miss. 403, 195 So. 323, 1940 Miss. LEXIS 46 (Miss. 1940).

      <p>
       Where the record in a criminal proceeding charging the defendant with the unlawful sale of intoxicating liquors showed a confusion of jurisdiction as to whether the trial magistrate acted as a police justice or as an ex officio justice of the peace, the conviction could not be sustained since because of such confusion the defendant would not be in a position to make a plea of former conviction or former acquittal against a further prosecution for violation either of the city ordinance or of the state laws.

       The fact that the duties of a police justice happen to be in part those which a justice of the peace might exercise does not affect his title to the office. Rich v.

       Since Miss. Code Section 21-23-7 provides that municipal judge has jurisdiction “to hear and determine, without a jury and without a record of testimony, all cases charging violations of the municipal ordinances and state misdemeanor laws”, municipal court judge may hear false pretense or bad check cases.

       Only clerk of municipal court, not deputy clerks, are required to complete training and education course. Coates, Nov. 3, 1993, A.G. Op. #93-0683.
      </p>
      <p>
       The intent of the Legislature is that a municipal court clerk is required to receive at least 12 hours of training and education each year; the clerk must receive 12 hours of training within the first year of being appointed as clerk and then receive an additional 12 hours of training on an annual basis; if a clerk receives more than the required 12 hours of training in one year, up to six of those hours may be carried forward to be applied to the next year’s requirement. Kossman, Mar. 9, 2001, A.G. Op. #01-0133.
      </p>
      <p>
       Failure of a municipal court clerk to receive required training prohibits the clerk from performing any of the duties of the job and from receiving any compensation until training is completed; upon finding that the statute has not been complied with, the governing authorities should suspend the clerk without pay until the clerk complies with the requirements, and continued payments to an unqualified clerk should be reported to the State Auditor.

      In enforcing the penalty prescribed for violation of all laws and ordinances in regard to parking of vehicles, it shall not be necessary to name any person in a traffic ticket issued for such violation.

In cases where the name of the operator of an unlawfully parked vehicle is unknown, the owner of record of the unlawfully parked vehicle shall, as a matter of law, be presumed to be the operator of such vehicle and may be charged with such violation. No arrest shall be made for failure of the operator or owner to appear in response to said traffic ticket, except on affidavit and issuance of an arrest warrant. Except in cases where an arrest warrant is issued, it shall not be necessary to enter such cases on the municipal court docket nor to enter final judgment thereon in the minute book of said court. Except as otherwise provided in Section 27-19-56, Mississippi Code of 1972, in enforcing the penalty prescribed for violation of all laws and ordinances in regard to parking of vehicles, no person’s driver’s license shall be suspended or revoked.

The department shall promulgate rules and procedures to ensure that the municipal court system of a participating municipality practices proper and effective collection procedures for the collection of fines and other assessments. If a municipality uses its own employees to collect delinquent fines and other assessments owed to the municipality, then it may use monies from the fund to defray the costs associated with these collection actions. In addition, the governing authority of a participating municipality shall contract with a private attorney or private collection agent or agency to collect delinquent criminal fines and other assessments as provided in Section 21-17-1(6) in order to qualify.

      <p>
       The 2017 amendment, effective June 23, 2017, rewrote the section by deleting all references to “Municipal Court Collections Fund” and “fund,” the source of monies in the fund, and the maximum amount municipalities could receive from the fund, and by adding all references to the “Municipal Court Collections Payment Program” and “program,” and providing that monies “appropriated by the Legislature to the Department of Revenue for the purposes of funding the Municipal Court Collections Payment Program shall be expended by the department to each participating municipality based upon that municipality’s deposits in the Treasury of the monies received under the provisions of Section 99-19-73.”

      The governing authorities of municipalities shall have the power to appoint a fire marshal, who may be the mayor, or any member of the governing authority of the municipality, or the city or town marshal. The fire marshal shall have the power to remove and keep away from the vicinity of any fire all idle and suspicious persons lurking near the same. He shall have the power to compel any person present to aid in the extinguishment of such fire or the preservation of property exposed to the danger of such fire and to aid in preventing goods from being purloined thereat. He shall also have such powers and duties as may be prescribed by ordinance.

       In extinguishing fires, municipality is acting in governmental capacity, but in operation of its water works its actions are of proprietary nature. City of Columbus v. McIlwain, 205 Miss. 473, 38 So. 2d 921, 1949 Miss. LEXIS 444 (Miss. 1949).
      </p>
      <p>
       Municipal corporation is not responsible for destruction of property within its limits by fire which it did not set out, merely because, through negligence or other default of corporation or its employees, members of fire department failed to extinguish fire, though this failure is due to negligence in permitting fire hydrants to become defective; and it makes no difference that municipality uses same reservoirs and pipes for its fire service that it employs for distribution of public supply for domestic purposes, from which it derives profit, since the two functions are distinguishable. City of Columbus v. McIlwain, 205 Miss. 473, 38 So. 2d 921, 1949 Miss. LEXIS 444 (Miss. 1949).
      </p>
      <p>
       Laws of 1944, Chap. 208 (§§ 3825-01 to 3825-17, inclusive, Supp. to 1942 Code), did not withdraw from municipalities any of the powers conferred by this section, but, where a fireman’s position has been abolished, determine only his rights. City of Laurel v. Reddoch, 200 Miss. 259, 26 So. 2d 465, 1946 Miss. LEXIS 289 (Miss. 1946).
      </p>
      <p>
       It was error to grant the remedy of mandamus against the mayor and board of aldermen of a municipality to compel them to enforce a fire prevention ordinance enacted under this section, where the ordinance was wholly incomplete with respect to the means of enforcement of its provisions. Garraway v. State, 184 Miss. 466, 184 So. 628, 185 So. 803, 1938 Miss. LEXIS 312 (Miss. 1938).
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless the statute contains some express or implied restraint, a municipality has a reasonable discretion in the choice of the means or methods for exercising the powers given it for a public purpose. American-Lafrance, Inc. v. Philadelphia, 183 Miss. 207, 184 So. 620, 1938 Miss. LEXIS 234 (Miss. 1938).
      </p>
      <p>
       The language of this section is broad and comprehensive and does not justify a holding that the only power of performance is by outright purchase, and that leases are excluded. American-Lafrance, Inc. v. Philadelphia, 183 Miss. 207, 184 So. 620, 1938 Miss. LEXIS 234 (Miss. 1938).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the seller of a fire engine sought to hold a municipality liable for reasonable compensation for the use of the property because the contract of sale was invalid for failure to follow the statutory requirements in such cases, the municipality may be liable as a lessee, being entitled to credit, upon lease compensation, for all sums which it had theretofore paid, even though paid as purchase money. American-Lafrance, Inc. v. Philadelphia, 183 Miss. 207, 184 So. 620, 1938 Miss. LEXIS 234 (Miss. 1938).

     </h3>
     <p>
      The governing authorities of any two or more municipalities may, in their discretion, contract to create a consolidated fire district, which shall consist of the whole, or a part, of the territory of such municipalities joining therein. Such contract entered into by the governing authorities of such municipalities shall embrace all of the essential terms, and shall state the amount to be contributed by each participating municipality, and the control and operation of same. An ordinance containing the contract as to control of equipment, supervision of the district, and the amount of money to be contributed by each municipality, shall be passed by the governing authorities of all participating municipalities in the same form and substance. Such ordinance shall be duly published as now required by law, and shall go into effect unless twenty per cent of the qualified electors of one of the participating municipalities shall petition against same and file said petition with the proper clerk on or before the next regular meeting of said governing authorities, to be held not less than fifteen days thereafter. If such petition be duly filed, said governing authorities may either cancel said prior ordinance or order an election on said question. Said ordinance shall go into effect immediately if a majority of the qualified electors voting in said election vote therefor; otherwise, said ordinance shall remain void and of no effect, and no like ordinance shall be passed within four years thereafter.
     </p>
     <p>
      Such consolidated fire district shall be given a name, and the supervision of protecting said district shall be vested in the governing authorities of the municipality decided upon and stated in the ordinance creating the consolidated fire district. The governing authorities of the municipalities in a consolidated fire district created under the provisions of this section shall have the same powers and duties as the governing authorities in any other fire district.

The price of such newly constructed or upgraded water system shall be reduced by an amount equal to the costs paid by the municipality to the rural water system for such construction or upgrading of the water system.

      <p>
       The permission of the municipal authorities to a telephone company to cut trees on the line between the sidewalks and the street in the municipality does not empower the company to disregard the rights of an abutting owner. Cumberland Tel. & Tel. Co. v. Cassedy, 78 Miss. 666, 29 So. 762, 1900 Miss. LEXIS 173 (Miss. 1900).
      </p>
      <p>
       That such act was done in the absence of the plaintiff, permission having been previously asked and refused, is a fraud on the plaintiff and entitles him to punitive damages as if done in his presence.

       The power of a municipality over its streets, under an ordinary charter, is subject to legislative control, and hence an ordinance exacting rents from a telegraph company for the use of streets for its poles is void.

      <p>
       Municipal “franchise” authority to grant permission and to regulate erection of telegraph, electric light, or telephone poles, posts and wires along public rights-of-way is regulated by Miss. Code Section 21-27-3. Mitchell, Apr. 23, 1993, A.G. Op. #93-0007.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subject to any contractual agreements that may exist between a municipality and a public utility, the municipality has the power to grant the right to erect poles and string wires on public rights-of-way and is empowered to govern and regulate the manner of such use, including, without limitation, requiring that all such lines be placed underground.
   Fortier, Jan. 25, 2000, A.G. Op. #99-0725.
      </p>
      <p>
       A municipality may install water meters which are owned by the municipality on private property or on municipal rights-of-way, and the municipality may require consumers of the water services to give their consent to have their meters read as a condition of receiving water services; a municipality may also require consumers of water services to grant to the municipality an easement for ingress and egress for the purpose of reading water meters. Jalanivich, Mar. 15, 2002, A.G. Op. #02-0113.
      </p>
      <p>
       A municipality may require that electric light poles be constructed of steel as opposed to wood. No provision in state law is found which would require, or which authorizes, a municipality to pay for any additional costs incurred by a utility to accommodate such requirements. Sorrell, Mar. 9, 2004, A.G. Op. 04-0099.
      </p>
      <p>
       Requiring “enhancements” to electric service provided by public utilities, such as steel versus wood poles and underground versus above-ground lines, constitutes a form of ratemaking which is regulated by the Mississippi Public Service Commission. Although a municipality may require lines to be located underground or to be constructed with certain materials, same is subject to the rate schedules approved by MPSC. Sorrell, Mar. 9, 2004, A.G. Op. 04-0099 modified.
      </p>
      <p>
       If municipal governing authorities determine that a utility is an “entire waterworks system”, then its acquisition by eminent domain would be a “purchase” requiring an election by the voters under Section 21-27-3 (1972). Helmert,

     <p>
      The governing authorities of municipalities shall have the power to erect, purchase, maintain and operate waterworks, and to regulate the same, to prescribe the rates at which water shall be supplied to the inhabitants, and to acquire by purchase, donation or condemnation, in the name of the municipality, suitable grounds, within or without the corporate limits, upon which to erect waterworks, and also the right-of-way to and from such works and the right-of-way for laying water pipes within the corporate limits, and from such waterworks to the municipality, and to extend such right-of-way from time to time. The governing authorities shall have the power to contract with any person for the maintenance and operation of waterworks. Said authorities shall have the power to contract with any person for the erection and maintenance of waterworks for a term not exceeding twenty-five (25) years, fixing water rates in the contract subject to municipal regulations. A contract for the erection or purchase of waterworks shall not, however, be entered into until submitted to a vote of the qualified electors and approved by a majority of those voting. A contract for maintenance under which the person who will perform such maintenance is wholly or partially responsible for fixing water rates shall not be entered into until submitted to a vote of the qualified electors and approved by a majority of those voting. It shall be unlawful for any municipally owned waterworks to supply water free of charge, or in any amount less than the fixed charges, to any person, firm or corporation, except as is expressly authorized by law.

       In the exercise of the powers granted by statute with respect to constructing and maintaining waterworks and sewerage systems, the municipality may employ civil engineers to make the necessary surveys and prepare the necessary plans and specifications, and to supervise the work after the awarding of contracts; it may employ attorneys to prepare the necessary orders and resolutions, to supervise the enactment of other necessary legal proceedings for the issuance and sale of bonds, and to give legal opinions as to the validity of the bonds; and it may pay for such engineering and legal services and other incidental expenses connected with the issuance and sale of the bonds and the construction of such public works out of the proceeds of the sale of the bonds, or perhaps out of the general fund of the municipality.

       Municipal corporation is not responsible for destruction of property within its limits by fire which it did not set out, merely because, through negligence or other default of corporation or its employees, members or fire department failed to extinguish fire, though this failure is due to negligence in permitting fire hydrants to become defective; and it makes no difference that municipality uses same reservoirs and pipes for its fire service that it employs for distribution of public supply for domestic purposes, from which it derives profit, since the two functions are distinguishable.

       A city operating waterworks plant and furnishing water to its citizens and controlling the cock at the junction of service pipe and the main pipe which let the water on and off is required to remove an obstruction therein within a reasonable time, and if it fails to do so it will be liable for injuries sustained by reason of insufficient water supply.

       It is not actionable negligence for a water company obligated to keep hydrants in repair, with the right to cut off the water flow to make repairs, and which cut off the water supply for thirty minutes to repair a hydrant, without notifying a patron using a gas heater which was highly dangerous if left burning after the water supply ceased and damage was caused by fire caused by patron lighting the gas while the water was cut off.

Town of Indianola v. Woods, 118 Miss. 738, 80 So. 7, 1918 Miss. LEXIS 130 (Miss. 1918).
      </p>

       It was error for the court to give a peremptory instruction for the city where the proof showed that the city’s collector of water rental exceeded the scope of his authority in cutting off the water where the suit was for damages for cutting off the water. Woods v. Indianola, 114 Miss. 722, 75 So. 549, 1917 Miss. LEXIS 85 (Miss. 1917).

       A municipality owning and operating a waterworks plant cannot withhold from a tenant who tenders payment therefor merely for the reason that the tenant who previously occupied the premises had failed to pay for water furnished him thereat; A rule or regulation authorizing such conduct is unreasonable and void.

       A city does not abuse its discretion by preparing the construction of a waterworks plant four years before the expiration of the franchise of a water company and a court of equity will not enjoin the issuance of bonds authorized for the purpose. Griffith v. Mayor & Board of Aldermen, 102 Miss. 1, 58 So. 781, 1912 Miss. LEXIS 33 (Miss. 1912).

   The granting to a waterworks company the exclusive right to conduct a waterworks plant in the city does not preclude the city from permitting a railroad to lay pipes in the streets so as to obtain water for its own consumption from another source. Vicksburg Waterworks Co. v. Yazoo &amp; M. V. R. Co., 96 Miss. 807, 51 So. 915, 1910 Miss. LEXIS 206 (Miss. 1910), writ of error dismissed,

       The exclusive privilege granted by a city to construct a waterworks plant in the city and to use the streets for that purpose is the granting of a franchise. Adams v. Samuel R. Bullock & Co., 94 Miss. 27, 47 So. 527, 1908 Miss. LEXIS 15 (Miss. 1908).

       A contract made by the authorities of a municipality with the water company for supplying the city with water for a period of twenty years, is within the powers conferred on them by an act of the legislature authorizing them to contract with a reliable corporation for supplying the city with water from year to year. Light, Heat & Water Co. v. Jackson, 73 Miss. 598, 19 So. 771, 1895 Miss. LEXIS 173 (Miss. 1895).

      <p>
       While equity will not rescind a continuing contract for an occasional and immaterial breach not going to the substance of the contract, yet where a water company has failed to comply with its contract to supply a city with water in such force and quantity as to afford first-class protection against fire, the remedy of rescission is peculiarly appropriate on occasions of this character. Light, Heat & Water Co. v. Jackson, 73 Miss. 598, 19 So. 771, 1895 Miss. LEXIS 173 (Miss. 1895).

       Municipalities are clearly authorized to enter into contracts with private companies to provide services relating to operation and maintenance of waterworks systems owned by municipality; there also appears to be no prohibition to concept of contracting with private firm to provide professional services associated with operation and management of wastewater system. Jones, Feb. 22, 1990, A.G. Op. #90-0116.
      </p>
      <p>
       Municipality may fix water rates as flat monthly rates for all consumers residing in the municipality and service area or municipality may charge all consumers a certain amount per gallon of water used, but a public utility cannot discriminate in setting its rates among similarly situated users for the same type of service.

      <p>
       While municipality is prohibited from providing free water service to an individual, municipal governing authorities, upon a proper finding of fact that citizen was overcharged for his water service, would be authorized to allow appropriate credit toward the payment of future water bills. Baker, March 17, 1994, A.G. Op. #94-0111.
      </p>
      <p>
       The statute mandates an election when a municipality contracts for the erection and purchase of an entire waterworks system to initially provide water service in the municipality and does not mandate an election when a municipality contracts to acquire an adjoining rural water association to extend the area where the city provides water service.

       If municipal governing authorities determine that a utility is an “entire waterworks system”, then its acquisition by eminent domain would be a “purchase” requiring an election by the voters under Section 21-27-3 (1972). Helmert,

      If, upon complaint of any citizen or citizens interested, the governing authorities of any municipality find that there is reasonable ground for believing that any meter or meters intended to measure or register the quantity of water, electric light or power, or gas supplied or furnished by any individual, company or corporation to the municipality or its inhabitants is or are measuring or registering incorrectly or excessively or is or are of a less candle power or degree of brilliancy than required by contract, such governing authorities may employ an expert, who shall examine and test said meter or meters, or said light or lights, as the case may be, and report back to said governing authorities, notice of the time and place of the proposed test or tests being first given to all parties interested. If such examination or test shall show the fact that said meter or meters measure or register incorrectly or excessively, or that said light or lights are of a less candle power or brilliancy than required by contract, then all expenses of such examination and test incurred by said municipal governing authorities shall be charged against and collected back from said individual, company or corporation supplying or furnishing such water, electric light or power, or gas, as the case may be, and such penalties may be imposed as the municipal ordinances may provide.

     <p>
      The governing authorities of any municipality which now owns and operates, or hereafter shall own and operate, any system or systems shall have the power and authority to create a commission to control, manage and operate such systems, or any one or more of them, which said commission shall consist of not less than three (3) nor more than five (5) commissioners, to be elected by the governing authorities of such municipality. In any municipality operating under the council-manager plan of government, such commissioners shall be selected by, and shall be under the control of, the mayor and councilmen of the municipality, and not the city or town manager. Such commissioners shall have the power, authority and duty to manage and control said system or systems and the supply of the facilities and services thereof, both within and without the limits of the municipality. Such commissioners shall be qualified electors of the municipality and shall not hold any other municipal office for honor or profit. Such commissioners shall receive such compensation as may be specified and provided by the governing authorities of said municipality; provided, however, that any commission formed for the purpose of establishing a motor vehicle transportation system for the transportation of passengers within the boundaries of the governmental unit or units concerned, and within three (3) miles thereof, may pay its commissioners from the operating budget of such commission per diem compensation in the amount provided by Section 25-3-69 for each day or fraction of a day engaged in attendance of meetings of the commission or engaged in other official duties of the commission, not to exceed forty-five (45) days in any one (1) year. The governing authorities of the municipality are hereby authorized and empowered to require such commissioners to furnish bonds for the faithful performance of their duties, in the amount as may be deemed proper, and to pay the premiums thereon from the municipal treasury or the available funds of the said system or systems. Where there are three (3) members of such commission, the term of office shall be for a period of three (3) years, and where there are four (4) members the term of office shall be for a period of four (4) years, and where there are five (5) members the term of office shall be for a period of five (5) years. However, in making the first appointment of commissioners, one (1) shall be appointed for a term of one (1) year, one (1) for a term of two (2) years, one (1) for a term of three (3) years and, where necessary, one (1) for a term of four (4) years, and one (1) for a term of five (5) years, so that thereafter the term of office of one (1) commissioner shall expire each year. Where the governing authorities of the municipality do not elect to create a commission as herein provided, then any system or systems owned and operated by the municipality shall be controlled and managed by the governing authorities of the municipality, who shall have all the power and authority conferred upon such commission.

       In a pedestrian’s action to recover for injuries she sustained from a fall after she stepped into a sunken utility box set into a sidewalk, the trial court properly granted a utilities commission summary judgment because the pedestrian released it when she executed a settlement agreement with the city; the pedestrian knew when she filed her complaint, and even before then, the commission was a municipal commission.

       The town has the authority to procure and pay for necessary legal services and to sell its bonds after the same have been authorized by the qualified electors and election called for such purpose, and to enter into a contract with the purchaser of such bonds upon such terms as the town and the purchaser may have agreed upon.

       Where mayor and aldermen of the Town of Heidelberg made a contract with individuals for rendering of services at a certain commission for establishing the natural gas system for the town, and the contract was invalid, the general validating statute of 1952 did not validate the contract because it was clearly outside of authority of mayor and aldermen.

       There is nothing in the statute which authorizes a municipality to employ an agent to sell bonds, or to enter into a pre-election contract for the sale of such bonds, or to delegate to a group of investment bankers or a group experienced in the securities business generally and in the field of revenue bonds especially, the power and authority to procure for the municipality necessary legal and engineering services required in connection with the construction of public utility improvements and to pay a fee therefor.

       There is nothing in a statute that the power to issue bonds, for the purpose of acquiring or improving any revenue producing public utility system and to issue revenue bonds for purpose of acquisition and improvement of such system, is in any way contingent upon the creation of a commission to manage and control the system, and the municipal bond issue was not dependent upon validity of creation of public service commission.

    Powers and duties of commission.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The commission provided for by Section 21-27-13 is authorized to make such bylaws for the holding and conduct of its meetings and such other regulations as it may deem necessary for the safe, economic and efficient management and protection of the system or systems, and such bylaws and regulations shall have the same validity as an ordinance duly passed by the governing authorities of any municipality.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is authorized to elect such officers and appoint such employees as may be necessary to operate the system or systems efficiently, and it shall have the entire control and management of such system or systems, together with all property connected or appertaining in any manner to such system or systems. The commission shall have the authority to employ a superintendent or manager of the systems, who shall have actual charge of the management and operation thereof and of the enforcement and execution of all the rules, regulations, programs, plans and decisions made and adopted by the commission in making purchases for materials and supplies to be used in the operation of the systems. In addition to any other purchasing authority granted by law, the commission may purchase electric transmission line materials, electric distribution system substation equipment, transformer equipment, and all other appliances, apparatus, machinery, equipment and appurtenances necessary for the sale of electricity, such as utility vehicles and fencing, from the surplus inventory of the Tennessee Valley Authority or any other similar agency of the federal government and electric power associations. These purchases shall be exempt from the public bid requirements prescribed in Sections 31-7-12 and 31-7-13. However, for all other purchases, the commission shall advertise for competitive bids in the manner and form as is required in accordance with Section 31-7-13. The superintendent or manager shall make and keep full and proper books and records of all purchases and shall submit them to the commission for its approval and ratification before payment thereof is authorized to be made. The commission may authorize the superintendent or manager to immediately refund to a customer of the municipally owned utility his or her deposit for municipal utility services after the superintendent or manager has determined that payment for all services and any other obligations which the customer may have incurred in regard to the municipal utility has been made. It shall have the right to fix the salaries and term of office of all employees and to direct them in the discharge of their duties. It shall have the right to require good and sufficient bonds from all officers and employees in such amounts as it may deem proper. It shall have the right to discharge employees when found inefficient or for other good cause. It shall have the power to make and collect rates for services and facilities, and appropriate funds for the maintenance and improvements of such systems. It is authorized to borrow from the Mississippi Development Bank in order to fund advance purchases of energy for gas producing, generating, transmission or distribution system or its electric generating, transmission or distribution system. It is authorized to insure all property used in the operation of such systems, including buildings, furniture, books and records, against loss by fire and tornado, and to carry sufficient amount of employers liability, steam boiler, plate glass and other miscellaneous casualty insurance, as in the discretion of the commission may be deemed proper, and to pay premiums therefor out of the funds derived from the operation of the systems. It shall report quarterly to the governing authorities of the municipality of all its doings and transactions of every kind whatsoever and shall make a complete statement of the financial condition of the systems at the end of each quarter, and shall annually make a detailed statement covering the entire management and operation of the systems, with any recommendations which it may have for the further development of the systems. At any time, the commission, by order or resolution, may authorize the expansion of activities of any component facility to include processing of materials on a custom basis or the processing and marketing of materials acquired to fully and efficiently utilize existing plant capacity. It shall also provide copies of all such quarterly and annual reports and statements to the Public Service Commission when so directed under Section 77-3-6.
     </p>
     <p>
      The commission provided for by Section 21-27-13 is also authorized to allow a municipally owned utility to prepay the utility’s bills to those electricity suppliers which offer early payment discounts to the municipally owned utility.

       Provision of statute that the commission may discharge employees found inefficient or for other good cause creates a property interest in those employees in their employment and such interest is protected by procedural due process, which prevents their discharge without prior notice and an opportunity to be heard; In light of the fact that the commission is wholly engaged in the exercise of proprietary rather than governmental functions, and in light of the grant of extensive powers to the commission by this section it may be inferred that the commission may sue and be sued, and, in particular, that it is not immune from suit in an action arising under the United States Constitution.

       When a developer sued a city, the city’s public utilities commission, and a utilities department (department) for damage to the developer’s property in installing utility lines, the department was a “political subdivision” because (1) the department was an arm of the public utilities commission, (2) the department was responsible for governmental activities, and (3) whether the department was engaged in proprietary activities was irrelevant.

    General powers of municipality as to creation, maintenance, and operation of public utility systems.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Any municipality may:
     </p>
     <p>
      Borrow money and issue revenue bonds therefor solely for the purposes specified in this section and by the procedure provided in Sections 21-27-41 through 21-27-69.
     </p>
     <p>
      Money may be borrowed and bonds issued by any municipality of the State of Mississippi, as defined in Section 21-27-11, to acquire or improve any waterworks system, water supply system, sewerage system, sewage disposal system, garbage disposal system, rubbish disposal system or incinerators, gas producing system, gas generating system, gas transmission system, or gas distribution system, electric generating, transmission or distribution system, railroad transportation system for passengers and freight, or motor vehicle transportation system, including any combination of any or all of those systems into one (1) system, within or without the corporate limits thereof, for the purpose of supplying the municipality and the persons and corporations, both public and private, whether within or without its corporate limits, with the services and facilities afforded by the system, provided that water, electric energy, or gas afforded by any system or systems may be supplied to such ultimate consumers thereof by sale thereof to the owners or operators of a distribution system for resale to the public. Any municipality which shall borrow money and issue revenue bonds to provide funds with which to acquire a gas transmission system, if necessary in order to reach and obtain a source of supply of gas for the municipality, may extend or construct its gas transmission line into an adjoining state, and may use and expend part of the proceeds of such issue of revenue bonds for the purpose.
     </p>
     <p>
      To assume all indebtedness for any system or systems which may be acquired under the provisions of this section as all or part of the consideration for the acquisition of such system or systems and to issue its revenue bonds in exchange for the bonds or notes evidencing the indebtedness.
     </p>
     <p>
      To acquire or improve any system which it is authorized to borrow money and issue revenue bonds under subsection (a) of this section to acquire or improve; and to make contracts in furtherance thereof or in connection therewith.
     </p>
     <p>
      To own, operate and maintain any such system or combination of any and all of said systems into one (1) system.
     </p>
     <p>
      To establish, maintain and collect rates for the facilities and services offered by any such system; provided that if there is a combination of systems into one or more systems, the municipality establishing the same shall be and is empowered to establish, maintain and collect rates for any and all of the services or for any combination thereof, and the municipality may discontinue any or all of the services upon any failure to promptly pay the charges fixed for the services. The rates so fixed for services rendered by any system or combination thereof may be charged for all services rendered thereby, regardless of whether the services may have been previously rendered without rates or charges therefor by the previously existing waterworks system, water supply system, sewerage system, sewage disposal system, garbage disposal system, rubbish disposal system or incinerators, gas producing system, gas generating system, gas transmission system, or gas distribution system, electric generating, transmission or distribution system, which shall have been merged into the combined system. Any such municipality may pledge for the payment of any bonds issued to acquire or improve any such combined system, or to refund any bonds previously issued to acquire or improve any such combined system or to acquire or improve any system merged with such combined system, the revenues to be derived from the operation of such combined system, including the charges authorized to be imposed by this section.
     </p>
     <p>
      A municipality may authorize a municipally owned utility to make early payment of the utility’s bills to its electricity suppliers which offer early payment discounts to the municipally owned utility. The municipality may immediately refund to a customer of the municipally owned utility his or her deposit for municipal utility services after the municipal utility has determined that payment for all services and any other obligations which the customer may have incurred in regard to the municipal utility has been made.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the revenues of any previously existing system being merged into a combined system are subject to a prior lien, the revenues and the expenses of any previously existing system shall be accounted for separately to the extent necessary to satisfy the covenants relating to the prior lien for so long as the indebtedness secured by the revenues shall remain outstanding. Only surplus revenues remaining after the satisfaction of all covenants relating to the outstanding indebtedness may be pledged to the retirement of any indebtedness to be secured by the revenues of a combined system. The existence of the outstanding indebtedness shall not, in and of itself, prevent the combining of systems as herein provided, so long as the prior lien on the revenues of any previously existing system is fully satisfied from the revenues of the previously existing system.
     </p>
     <p>
      To acquire property, real or personal, which may be necessary to effectuate the powers conferred by this section. The municipality may purchase electric transmission line materials, electric distribution system substation equipment, transformer equipment, and all other appliances, apparatus, machinery, equipment and appurtenances necessary for the sale of electricity, such as utility vehicles and fencing, from the surplus inventory of the Tennessee Valley Authority or any other similar agency of the federal government and electric power associations. These purchases by the municipality shall be exempt from the public bid requirements prescribed in Sections 31-7-12 and 31-7-13. If the power of eminent domain is exercised, it shall be exercised in the manner provided by Sections 11-27-1 through 11-27-51.

     </p>
     <p>

     </p>
     <p>

Hewes, July 15, 1992, A.G. Op. #92-0509.
      </p>

       A municipality may bill water and gas customers each month a set amount which is calculated so that the amount the customer pays for the entire fiscal year is the same that the customer would pay if he or she were billed for the exact amount of water and gas used each month. However, the governing authorities must reevaluate the amounts charged to customers at least once a year so that the amount each customer pays over the course of a year reflects the amount of water and gas actually used for the year. In addition, this billing plan may only be implemented for customers who elect the plan. See Section 21-27-23(e). Harlow, December 13, 1996, A.G. Op. #96-0809.

      </p>
      <p>
       If a water department maintenance employee is paid wages or salary from utility system funds, then his services must be used exclusively for the operation of the water system; if the governing authority assigns the employee duties other than duties for the water department, then he must be paid from the appropriate fund, i.e., general funds, department fund or utility system fund, for the department or utility system for which he is rendering services.

      <p>
       A municipality may acquire a water system from a water association within the corporate limits and may switch the customers of the water association from a flat rate to a metered rate; it may phase in a metered rate structure in an area with a flat rate, charging customers without meters the flat rate and customers with meters according to the new rate in the transition period, or, alternatively, it may charge a flat rate for all customers in the area until such time as all or substantially all of the meters are installed and operating.

      <p>
       A municipality may terminate utility services for nonpayment of a bill after giving notice and an opportunity to be heard in a meaningful time and manner to the utility customer. However, a municipality may not require a landlord to pay a tenant’s water bill if the tenant is the customer of the utility system, and cannot refuse to provide water services to a
   tenant because a landlord or prior tenant has not paid a water bill. Accordingly, a municipality may not include a provision that precludes reinstatement of water/sewer services to said rental unit until the account applicable thereto is brought current. Povall, July 28, 2006, A.G. Op. 06-0315.

       § 21-27-33.
    Municipality may dispose of public utility systems.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      All municipalities of the state are hereby empowered and authorized, if they so desire, to sell, lease, or otherwise dispose of any or all electric, water, gas or other municipally-owned public utility systems or properties on such terms and conditions, and with such safeguards as will best promote and protect the public interest. Said municipal corporations are empowered and authorized to transfer title to said public utility properties by warranty deed, bill of sale, contract, or lease, in the manner provided by law. However, notice of intention to make such sale, lease, or disposition of any such system, setting out the price and other general terms and conditions of such proposed sale, lease, or disposition shall be given by publication, once a week for three consecutive weeks in a legal newspaper published in such municipality, and if no such newspaper be published in said municipality, then in some newspaper having a general circulation in such municipality. After ten days from the last publication of such notice, the system may be disposed of, unless within ten days after the last publication of such notice a petition signed by not less than twenty per centum of the qualified voters of such municipality be filed, objecting to and protesting against such sale, lease, or disposition, in which event the same shall not be made unless submitted to a special election ordered for the purpose of determining whether a majority of those voting in such election shall vote for or against such sale, lease, or other disposition. Such election shall be ordered to be held not less than forty days after the date of the last notice of the proposed sale, lease or disposition. Notice of such election, stating the purpose of election, shall be published once each week for three consecutive weeks next preceding the time set for holding said election in such newspaper as herein provided. The laws governing special municipal elections shall govern the ordering and conduct of said election.
     </p>
     <p>
      The ballots provided shall have plainly written or printed thereon the words “shall the waterworks, electric, or gas (as the case may be) system be sold, leased, or disposed of (as the case may be)” and below said words shall be suitably placed on separate lines, the words “yes” and “no,” so that the voter may indicate the way he desires to vote on the question submitted.
     </p>
     <p>
      If a majority of those voting in said election shall vote in favor of such sale, lease, or disposition, then the proper officer of the municipality may proceed to sell, lease or dispose of such system in accordance with the terms and conditions set out in the notice of proposed intention to sell, lease or dispose of such system, as herein provided. If such election is determined against such sale, lease or disposition of such system, then such system shall not be sold, leased or disposed of, but shall remain the property of the municipality.

     </h3>
     <p>
      All municipalities owning or operating any system or systems may supply consumers residing outside of and within five (5) miles of the corporate limits of the municipality. In any county traversed by two (2) or more natural gas transmission lines and having therein two (2) or more natural gas compressor stations engaged in rendering service in interstate commerce, and wherein a natural gas transmission line of a municipality can be laid wholly in alluvial soil, where it is necessary for any municipality having a population of less than one thousand (1,000), according to the federal census of 1950, to construct a gas transmission line for a distance of more than five (5) miles but not more than eleven (11) miles from its corporate limits to the nearest point at which an adequate supply of natural gas can be obtained, and where there are not less than two hundred (200) prospective gas customers residing outside the corporate limits of such municipality but along and within one-half (1/2) mile of the gas transmission line so constructed by the municipality, then and in that event, the municipality may supply natural gas to such customers. Any municipality having its own natural gas transmission system in any county bordering the State of Alabama, in which U.S. Highway No. 78 and State Highway No. 25 intersect, and in which there is a publicly supported junior college, may extend its transmission lines and supply customers within the county for a distance of fifteen (15) miles from the corporate limits. Any municipality having a population of less than one thousand (1,000) people, according to the federal census of 1960, and being located in the county in which U.S. Highway 51 and U.S. Highway 82 intersect, and in the county where the main line of Illinois Central Railroad and Columbus and Greenville Railroad intersect, may construct a gas transmission line and supply customers within a four-county area for a distance of forty-five (45) miles from the corporate limits of the municipality. Any municipality having its own water distribution system, the construction or expansion of which has been financed in whole or in part by an agency of the United States government, and having a population of less than five hundred (500) persons, and located in a county in which Mississippi State Highways Number 12 and Number 429 intersect, may construct, expand and operate its water distribution system within the county or adjoining counties for a distance of fifteen (15) miles from the corporate limits. Any municipality having its own water distribution system, the construction or expansion of which has been financed in whole or in part by an agency of the United States government, and having a population of less than fifteen hundred (1500) persons, and located in a county in which Highway 15 and Highway 32 intersect and has a national forest, may construct, expand and operate its water distribution system within the county or adjoining counties for a distance of fifteen (15) miles from the corporate limits.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any municipality having its own water distribution system and located in a county having two (2) judicial districts, and in which Mississippi Highways 17 and 35 intersect, may construct, expand and operate its water distribution system within the county or adjoining counties for a distance of fifteen (15) miles from the corporate limits. Any municipality having its own water distribution system, wherein U.S. Highway 51 and Mississippi Highway 35 intersect, and located in a county in which U.S. Highway 82 and Mississippi Highway 17 intersect, may construct, expand and operate its water distribution system within the county or adjoining counties for a distance of fifteen (15) miles from the corporate limits. Whenever such service shall be furnished to any consumer residing outside the corporate limits thereof, such consumer may not be charged at a rate greater than twice the rate charged for such services within the municipality.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any municipality located within a county bordering the Mississippi River and in which Highways 49 and 61 intersect may acquire, construct, expand and operate its railroad transportation system for the transportation of passengers and freight for more than five (5) miles outside its corporate limits and outside the boundaries of the county in which it is located. Any municipality having a population of more than forty-five thousand (45,000) but less than forty-five thousand one hundred (45,100) according to the 1970 federal decennial census, may expand its motor vehicle transportation system for the transportation of passengers for more than five (5) miles outside its corporate limits.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any municipality having a population of less than five hundred (500) according to the 1980 federal decennial census, being located north of U.S. Highway 82 in a county in which is located a United States Air Force base and a state-supported institution of higher learning established primarily for women, which criteria the Legislature finds to be conducive to the expansion of natural gas service to support contiguous areas of such Air Force base, may construct, own and/or operate a public utility or natural gas system and supply customers within the county for a distance of eleven (11) miles from the corporate limits.

       Act was intended to exempt from regulation municipal utility systems which municipalities were authorized by law to operate on the effective date of the act and it also was intended to subject to regulation extensions of utilities more than one mile beyond the corporate boundaries when such extensions were made after the act’s effective date; the commission thus had authority to regulate water rates for a newly-purchased water utility beyond one mile from the city’s corporate limits, though the initial rate order was void on due process grounds for failure to give notice to the city prior to its issuance.

       Town may extend water service to customers in county within five miles of corporate limits through main water line which is privately owned and may collect fees for this water service; municipality does not have duty to maintain water pressure in water lines which are privately owned and are not a part of municipal water system. Jones, Nov. 25, 1992, A.G. Op. #92-0850.

       A municipality may acquire a water supply system that extends to an area within five miles of its corporate limits and may charge customers residing outside of the corporate limits rates up to twice that charged for residents inside the municipality so long as similarly situated persons are not discriminated against, but it may not acquire an entire system when part of that system extends more than five miles beyond the boundaries of the municipality. Tutor, Aug. 29, 1997, A.G. Op. #97-0400.

      <p>
       Although the statute authorizes utility services to be extended beyond the municipal corporate limits, it has no application beyond the boundaries of the State of Mississippi; there is no authority which would permit a municipality to furnish utility services to out-of-state consumers residing within five miles of the municipal corporate limits.

       The present board of aldermen of a town could raise the rates of the former consumers of a water system association, even though the prior board of aldermen might have entered into a contract, by acceptance of a deed of conveyance of the assets of the water system association, to the contrary.

       Municipal governing authorities may establish different classifications of users of municipal systems, and may establish different rates for those different classifications. Such classifications may be based on various factors, which may include extra expense related to providing service to customers residing outside the corporate boundaries of the municipality.

       A town is entitled to terminate or disconnect the sewer service to customers of the sewer system who are not paying their bills for such service. There must be some process by which customers may dispute questionable charges. Richardson, Feb. 2, 2004, A.G. Op. 04-0011.

       § 21-27-43.
    Electorate to vote on issuance of bonds.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Except as hereinafter provided, no bonds shall be issued pursuant to the authority granted in Section 21-27-23 until and unless a majority of those qualified electors of the municipality, voting on a proposition stating in general terms the maximum amount and purposes of the bonds, have approved the issuance at a special election called thereon according to law.
     </p>
     <p>
      However, the requirement for an election to be held before the issuance of the bonds shall not apply to the issuance of the revenue bonds for the purpose of improving, repairing or extending any waterworks system, water supply system, sewage system, sewage disposal system (or the addition of a sewage disposal system to a sewage system), gas producing system, gas generating, transmission, or distribution system, electric generating, transmission, or distribution system, garbage disposal system, rubbish disposal or incinerator system, or motor vehicle transportation system, which is now, or hereafter, owned or operated by any municipality, or railroad transportation system owned or operated by any municipality located in a county bordering the Mississippi River and in which Highways 49 and 61 intersect. The revenue bonds may be issued for such purposes in the following manner: notice of intention to issue the revenue bonds, setting out the amount and other terms or conditions of the proposed issue, shall be given by publication once a week for three (3) consecutive weeks in a local newspaper published in the municipality, and if a newspaper is not published in the municipality, then in some newspaper having a general circulation in the municipality. After ten (10) days from the last publication of the notice, the bonds may be sold under the regular procedure for selling the bonds unless, within ten (10) days after the last publication of the notice, a petition signed by not less than twenty percent (20%) of the qualified voters of such municipality be filed objecting to and protesting against such revenue bond issue, in which event the same shall not be made unless submitted to a special election ordered for the purpose of determining whether or not a majority of those voting in the election shall vote for or against the revenue bond issue. The election shall be ordered to be held not later than forty (40) days after the date of the last notice of the proposed revenue bond issue. Notice of the election, stating the purpose of the election, shall be published once each week for three (3) consecutive weeks next preceding the time set for holding the election in the newspaper, provided in this section. The laws governing municipal elections shall govern the order and conduct of the election. However, nothing in this section shall prevent the governing authorities from calling an election, whether required by petition of twenty percent (20%) of the qualified voters or not. This section shall not have application to and it shall not affect the authority granted public utilities commissions under Section 21-27-25.

       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       Where in a statute, which, after authorization by voters in special election, permits municipalities to issue public utility improvement revenue bonds, there is a provision which states that no bond issue pursuant to acts should constitute an indebtedness within the meaning of any statutory or charter limitation, this was not unconstitutional. Spencer v. Mayor & Board of Aldermen, 215 Miss. 160, 60 So. 2d 562, 1952 Miss. LEXIS 548 (Miss. 1952).
      </p>
      <p>
       There is nothing in a statute that the power to issue bonds for the purpose of acquiring or improving any revenue producing public utility system and to issue revenue bonds for purpose of acquisition and improvement of such system is in any way contingent upon the creation of a commission to manage and control the system, and the municipal bond issue was not dependent upon validity of creation of public service commission. Spencer v. Mayor & Board of Aldermen, 215 Miss. 160, 60 So. 2d 562, 1952 Miss. LEXIS 548 (Miss. 1952).
      </p>
      <p>
       Notice of election on question of public utility improvement bonds should be sufficiently definite to apprise the voters with substantial accuracy of what they are called upon to approve and be submitted in such way as to obtain a full and fair expression of the will of the voters on its merits, and the duty of determining the particular phraseology in which the question shall be submitted is cast upon municipal authorities. Spencer v. Mayor & Board of Aldermen, 215 Miss. 160, 60 So. 2d 562, 1952 Miss. LEXIS 548 (Miss. 1952).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section [Code 1942, § 3519-13] by which public utility improvement bonds are to be issued requires only a majority of qualified electors voting on the proposition to vote in favor of the issuance of bonds. Spencer v. Mayor & Board of Aldermen, 215 Miss. 160, 60 So. 2d 562, 1952 Miss. LEXIS 548 (Miss. 1952).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a constitutional provision requires ways to be made by general laws to prevent abuse by municipal corporations of powers of taxation contracting debts, and it is not self-executing, and it requires legislation to put into effect, it is the duty of the legislature to say what constitutes abuse of such powers of municipality, and to provide checks thereon. Spencer v. Mayor & Board of Aldermen, 215 Miss. 160, 60 So. 2d 562, 1952 Miss. LEXIS 548 (Miss. 1952).

      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Such bonds as may be issued pursuant to the authority granted in Section 21-27-23 may be serial or term; redeemable, with or without premium, or nonredeemable; registered or coupon bonds with registration privileges as to either principal and interest, principal only or both. They shall bear interest at a rate to be determined pursuant to the sale of the bonds, and shall be payable at such time or times as shall be prescribed in the ordinance authorizing them. They shall mature at such time or times, not exceeding the said estimated life of the contemplated system or improvement, and in no event longer than thirty (30) years from their date, and at such place or places as shall be prescribed in the ordinance authorizing their issuance. Any provisions of the general laws to the contrary notwithstanding, any bonds and interest coupons issued pursuant to the authority granted in Section 21-27-23 shall possess all the qualities of negotiable instruments. The bonds and the interest coupons shall be executed in such manner and shall be substantially in the form prescribed in the authorizing ordinance. In case any of the officers whose signatures or countersignatures appear on the bonds or interest coupons shall cease to be such officers before delivery of such bonds, such signatures or countersignatures shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes the same as if they had remained in office until such delivery. No bond shall bear more than one (1) rate of interest. Each bond shall bear interest from its date to its stated maturity date at the interest rate specified in the bid. All bonds of the same maturity shall bear the same rate of interest from date to maturity. All interest accruing on such bonds so issued shall be payable semiannually or annually, except that the first interest coupon attached to any such bond may be for any period not exceeding one (1) year.
     </p>
     <p>
      No interest payment shall be evidenced by more than one (1) coupon and neither cancelled nor supplemental coupons shall be permitted. The lowest interest rate specified for any bonds issued shall not be less than seventy percent (70%) of the highest interest rate specified for the same bond issue. Such bonds shall be sold in such manner and upon such terms as the governing authorities of the municipality shall determine, provided that such bonds shall not bear a greater overall maximum interest rate to maturity than that allowed in Section 75-17-103, Mississippi Code of 1972, and the interest rate on any one (1) interest maturity shall not exceed the maximum interest rate allowed on such bonds. Each interest rate specified in any bid must be in multiples of one-eighth of one percent (1/8 of 1%) or in multiples of one-tenth of one percent (1/10 of 1%). If serial bonds, such bonds shall mature annually, and the first maturity date thereof shall not be more than five (5) years from the date of such bonds. Such bonds shall be legal investments for trustees and other fiduciaries, and for savings banks, trust companies and insurance companies organized under the laws of the state of Mississippi. The bonds and interest coupons shall be exempt from all state, county, municipal and other taxation under the laws of the state of Mississippi. The principal of and interest upon such bonds shall be payable solely for the revenues derived from the operation of the system acquired or improved with proceeds of the sale of such bonds. No bond issued pursuant to the authority granted in Section 21-27-23 shall constitute an indebtedness of a municipality within the meaning of any statutory or charter restriction, limitation or provision. It shall be plainly stated on the face of each such bond in substance that the same has been issued pursuant to the authority granted in Section 21-27-23 and that the taxing power of the municipality issuing the same is not pledged to the payment of such bond or interest thereon, and that such bond and the interest thereon are payable solely from the revenues of the system to acquire or improve which such bond is issued.
     </p>
     <p>
      Such bonds shall be sold on sealed bids at public sale in the manner provided by Section 31-19-25. In the event the issuing municipality shall have received a commitment from any agency of the United States of America for the purchase of all or any portion of an issue of such bonds prior to the sale thereof or for financial assistance in providing debt service on such bonds, then, and in such event, said issue or any part thereof may be sold to the United States of America or any agency thereof at private sale. Provided, however, no bonds issued under the authority of Section 21-27-23 shall bear an overall maximum interest rate greater than that allowed in Section 75-17-103, Mississippi Code of 1972.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is specifically provided that any bond issue to be awarded and sold to the United States of America or any agency thereof shall mature at such time or times, not to exceed thirty-five (35) years, as shall be prescribed in the ordinance of the municipality authorizing their issuance.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is specifically provided that any bond issue to be awarded and sold to the United States of America or any agency thereof may be issued as one or more amortized bonds without coupons, may be dated the date of delivery thereof, and the purchase price for such bond or bonds may be delivered in multiple advances, with interest to accrue on the principal advanced form the date of each such advance. The amount of each such advance and the date thereof shall be registered on the reverse of each such bond and attested by the manual signature of the clerk of the municipality.
     </p>
     <p>
      On issues of Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000.00) or more, the governing authorities of a municipality may retain the services of a fiscal advisor to assist in the sale of bonds hereunder and pay to such fiscal advisor a fee not to exceed the following amount: Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars ($25,000.00) plus one-quarter of one percent (1/4 of 1%) of the amount of the issue in excess of Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000.00). No such fiscal advisor shall be eligible to bid for or participate in the underwriting of the bonds for which he acted as advisor.
     </p>
     <p>
      Before a person can qualify as a fiscal advisor under the terms of this section, he shall have been actively engaged in the business of fiscal counseling for municipalities, or the underwriting of municipal bonds, for a period of five (5) years prior to qualifying under this section. A partnership or corporation may become a fiscal advisor hereunder with the same qualifications. Such person, corporation, or partnership shall have had prior experience as a fiscal advisor or been involved in the underwriting or investing in bonds of the state of Mississippi, or one or more of the subdivisions thereof, and such person, partnership or corporation shall be recognized in the fiscal community as a reputable and qualified fiscal advisor.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Any municipality having outstanding bonds issued pursuant to the authority granted in Section 21-27-23 shall maintain rates for all the services and facilities afforded by any system, the revenues of which are pledged to the payment of such bonds, which rates shall be sufficient at all times to maintain an interest and bond redemption fund sufficient to pay the interest on and principal of such bonds as and when the same become due and payable and, if so provided in the ordinance authorizing such bonds, to accumulate a reserve in such fund, and to provide for the payment of such cost of operation and maintenance as may be necessary to keep such system at all times in good repair and working order. Such rates shall be fixed by separate ordinance precedent to or at the time of the issuance of such bonds and shall be revised from time to time so as to produce the amounts necessary to provide for the foregoing. Bonds issued pursuant to the authority granted in Section 21-27-23 to acquire or improve a system shall be secured by a pledge of an amount of the gross revenues of such system sufficient to maintain such an interest and bond redemption fund. However, if there are then outstanding bonds to the payment of which the revenues of a system have been previously pledged, then, until said outstanding bonds have been retired, bonds issued to improve such system shall be secured by a pledge of the revenues of the system in such an amount only after deductions have been made for servicing the said outstanding bonds and for maintaining and operating the system. Notwithstanding the above provisions, all revenue bonds issued for a specific utility may be issued on an equivalent basis, provided that each and every ordinance authorizing each and every bond issued shall clearly state the basis on which future revenue bond issues shall be provided for in order to place them on an equivalent basis with prior issues.

    Refunding bonds; consolidated bonds.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Any municipality which shall have issued bonds pursuant to the authority granted in Section 21-27-23, all or any portion of which shall at any time hereafter remain outstanding and unpaid, is hereby authorized, in connection with the issuance of additional bonds hereunder, to issue refunding bonds for the purpose of taking up, paying and redeeming all such outstanding and unpaid bonds. Such refunding bonds and such additional bonds may be authorized and issued separately or may be consolidated into one issue. Such outstanding and unpaid bonds may be refunded without notice and without an election thereon, and such additional bonds may be refunded without notice and without an election except as provided in Section 21-27-43. The proceeds of any such consolidated bonds shall be used to take up, pay and redeem all of such outstanding and unpaid bonds, at their redemption price, and the balance of such proceeds shall be used and expended for the purposes for which the additional bonds were authorized to be issued. In the event any such outstanding bonds, by the terms thereof, shall be redeemable prior to maturity at the option of such municipality, then such option of redemption shall be exercised in the manner provided in such bonds, and the refunding bonds shall not be issued or delivered more than two calendar months in advance of the date upon which such outstanding bonds shall have been called for redemption. In the event that such outstanding bonds, by the terms thereof, be not so redeemable prior to maturity, then the refunding bonds shall not be issued, except concurrently with the surrender and cancellation of a like amount of the bonds to be refunded thereby. All bonds issued under the provisions of this section shall have like incidents and shall be payable from the same source or sources and the payment thereof shall be secured in like manner as are bonds issued pursuant to the authority granted in Section 21-27-23. In lieu of selling such portion of such consolidated bonds, as may be required to provide for the redemption of such outstanding bonds, such consolidated bonds may be issued and delivered in exchange for and upon surrender and cancellation of a like amount of the bonds to be refunded thereby.

      In the authorizing order or ordinance, the governing authorities of the municipality shall set aside monthly and shall pledge the revenues of the system or combined system, in separate and special funds as follows: (1) operation and maintenance fund; (2) depreciation fund; (3) bond and interest fund; (4) contingent fund. A sufficient amount shall be set aside each year for the retirement of the bonds and interest. Any surplus revenue remaining shall be disposed of by the governing authorities of the municipality as they may determine from time to time for the best interest of the municipality. However, in the segregation into the several funds the governing authorities may prescribe a reasonable excess amount to be placed in the revenue bond and interest fund from time to time during the earlier years of maturity of such bonds so as to thereby provide and produce a cushion fund to meet any possible deficiencies therein in future years. In the event such excess amounts are provided in the earlier years, the same would be available for such purposes. Bonds pursuant to the authority granted in Sections 21-27-23 and 21-27-51, shall be payable solely from revenues of said project and out of the bond and interest fund.

       § 21-27-71.
    Issuance of bonds in municipalities of more than one hundred thousand population.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Whenever the governing authorities of any municipality of more than One Hundred Thousand (100,000) population shall determine to issue bonds under the provisions of Sections 21-27-11 through 21-27-69, to acquire or improve a system, it shall cause an estimate to be made of the cost of such system or improvement, and the fact that such estimate has been made shall appear in the ordinance authorizing the issuance of such bonds, which ordinance shall set forth a brief description in general terms of the contemplated system or improvement, the estimated life thereof, the said estimated cost thereof, the amount, date, denominations, rate of interest, times and places of payment and other details in connection with the issuance of the bonds, and such covenants and restrictions as may be necessary or desirable to safeguard the interest of the holders of the bonds. Such bonds may be serial or term; redeemable, with or without premium, or nonredeemable; registered or coupon bonds with registration privileges as to either principal and interest, principal only or both. They shall bear interest at a rate to be determined pursuant to the sale of the bonds, and shall be payable at such time or times as shall be prescribed in the ordinance authorizing them. They shall mature at such time or times, not exceeding the said estimated life of the contemplated system or improvement, and in no event exceeding thirty (30) years from their date, and at such place or places as shall be prescribed in the ordinance authorizing their issuance; provided, however, that any bond issue to be awarded and sold to the United States of America or any agency thereof shall mature at such time or times, not to exceed thirty-five (35) years, as shall be prescribed in the ordinance authorizing their issuance. Any provisions of the general laws to the contrary notwithstanding, any bonds and interest coupons issued pursuant to the authority of this section shall possess all the qualities of negotiable instruments. The bonds and the interest coupons shall be executed in such manner and shall be substantially in the form prescribed in the authorizing ordinance. In case any of the officers whose signatures or countersignatures appear on the bonds or interest coupons shall cease to be such officers before delivery of such bonds, such signatures or countersignatures shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes the same as if they had remained in office until such delivery. No bond shall bear more than one (1) rate of interest. Each bond shall bear interest from its date to its stated maturity date at the interest rate specified in the bid. All bonds of the same maturity shall bear the same rate of interest from date to maturity. All interest accruing on such bonds so issued shall be payable semiannually or annually, except that the first interest coupon attached to any such bond may be for any period not exceeding one (1) year.
     </p>
     <p>
      No interest payment shall be evidenced by more than one (1) coupon and neither cancelled nor supplemental coupons shall be permitted. The lowest interest rate specified for any bonds issued shall not be less than seventy percent (70%) of the highest interest rate specified for the same bond issue. Such bonds shall be sold in such manner and upon such terms as the governing authorities of the municipality shall determine, provided that such bonds shall not bear a greater overall maximum interest rate to maturity than that allowed in Section 75-17-103, Mississippi Code of 1972, and the interest rate on any one (1) interest maturity shall not exceed the maximum interest rate allowed on such bonds. If serial bonds, such bonds shall mature annually, and the first maturity date thereof shall not be more than five (5) years from the date of such bonds. Such bonds shall be legal investments for trustees and other fiduciaries, and for savings banks, trust companies and insurance companies organized under the laws of the state of Mississippi. The bonds and interest coupons shall be exempt from all state, county, municipal and other taxation under the laws of the state of Mississippi. The principal of and interest upon such bonds shall be payable solely from the revenues derived from the operation of the system acquired or improved with proceeds of the sale of such bonds. No bond issued pursuant to this section shall constitute an indebtedness of a municipality within the meaning of any statutory or charter restriction, limitation or provision. It shall be plainly stated on the face of each such bond in substance that the same bond has been issued under the provisions of this section and that the taxing power of the municipality issuing the same is not pledged to the payment of such bond or interest thereon, and that such bond and interest thereon are payable solely from the revenues of the system to acquire or improve which such bond is issued.
     </p>
     <p>
      Such bonds shall be sold on sealed bids at public sale in the manner provided by Section 31-19-25. In the event the issuing municipality shall have received a commitment from any agency of the United States of America for the purchase of all or any portion of an issue of such bonds prior to the sale thereof or for financial assistance in providing debt service on such bonds, then, and in such event, said issue or any part thereof may be sold to the United States of America or any agency thereof at private sale. Bonds in the aggregate amount of Two Hundred Thousand Dollars ($200,000.00) for any project may be sold at private sale either to underwriters or investors.
     </p>
     <p>
      On issues of Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000.00) or more, the governing authorities of a municipality may retain the services of a fiscal advisor to assist in the sale of the bonds hereunder and pay to such fiscal advisor a fee not to exceed the following amount: Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars ($25,000.00) plus one-quarter of one percent (1/4 of 1%) of the amount of the issue in excess of Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000.00). No such fiscal advisor shall be eligible to bid for or participate in the underwriting of the bonds for which he acted as advisor.
     </p>
     <p>
      Before a person can qualify as a fiscal advisor under the terms of this section, he shall have been actively engaged in the banking business, or the business of fiscal counseling for municipalities, or the underwriting of municipal bonds, for a period of five (5) years prior to qualifying under this section. A partnership or corporation may become a fiscal advisor hereunder with the same qualifications. Such person, corporation, or partnership shall have had prior experience as a fiscal advisor or been involved in the underwriting or investing in bonds of the state of Mississippi, or one or more of the subdivisions thereof, and such person, partnership or corporation shall be recognized in the fiscal community as a reputable and qualified fiscal advisor.

      No person may drive or operate motor vehicles for hire in any city or town in this state unless he shall first have been licensed so to do as follows: he shall make application to the mayor of such municipality in writing, accompanied by a statement of some reputable citizen thereof, that the applicant is over the age of eighteen (18) years, an experienced driver, of good moral character, and physically and mentally capacitated to drive and operate such motor vehicle. The mayor shall place such application before the board of aldermen, or other governing authorities, whereupon inquiry may be made by such governing authorities into the moral character and mental and physical fitness of the applicant. If the permit shall be granted the applicant shall receive a certificate of such permit, signed by the mayor, together with an identification badge, and the name of the municipality thereon, and which shall be worn so that the same will be displayed while engaged in or about such occupation. The governing authorities of the municipality may require the applicant to give a reasonable bond, of not more than Five Hundred Dollars ($500.00), to guarantee the faithful observance of the law as well as the rules and regulations which may be prescribed by the said municipality, and they may also require a reasonable fee, for such permit and badge. In the event the governing authority of such municipality refuse to grant such permit to an applicant, an appeal may be taken to the circuit court, in the manner provided by law for appealing from other orders of the governing authorities of municipalities, and the questions to be tried upon appeal will be as to the age and experience and the moral, mental and physical fitness of the said applicant to pursue such vocation in such municipality.

       Permit to operate taxicabs in city constitutes a permit to do that which would otherwise be unlawful; and, being a mere personal privilege, it is revocable for due cause and is not a vested or property right in a constitutional sense. Allen v. Kosciusko, 207 Miss. 343, 42 So. 2d 388, 1949 Miss. LEXIS 346 (Miss. 1949).
      </p>
      <p>
       City has the right, and it is its duty, when, by reason of changed circumstances and conditions, the public safety reasonably requires it to amend its ordinances regulating the operations of taxicabs within the city, so long as, and to the extent that, said amended ordinance remains within the limits of the powers conferred on the municipality by the legislature. Allen v. Kosciusko, 207 Miss. 343, 42 So. 2d 388, 1949 Miss. LEXIS 346 (Miss. 1949).
      </p>
      <p>
       Validity of order revoking plaintiff’s license to operate fleet of taxicabs in city without notice and hearing, became moot question and would not be determined where city subsequently enacted new ordinance revoking all permits and prescribing new requirements. Allen v. Kosciusko, 207 Miss. 343, 42 So. 2d 388, 1949 Miss. LEXIS 346 (Miss. 1949).
      </p>
      <p>
       Operator of fleet of taxicabs could not challenge constitutionality of ordinance revoking all taxicab permits and establishing new permit requirements, passed subsequent to revocation of his license without notice and hearing, where he did not apply for a permit under the new ordinance, and, therefore, he was unaffected thereby. Allen v. Kosciusko, 207 Miss. 343, 42 So. 2d 388, 1949 Miss. LEXIS 346 (Miss. 1949).
      </p>
      <p>
       This statute [Code 1942, § 3495] and an ordinance passed thereunder providing for a permit fee and licensing of motor vehicles for hire in a municipality to apply to drivers of taxicabs doing an interurban business, were not unconstitutional and void, such legislation being reasonable and valid in the exercise of the police power of the state for the public safety. Lowe v. Simmons, 185 Miss. 88, 187 So. 214, 1939 Miss. LEXIS 127 (Miss. 1939).
      </p>
      <p>
       Statutes authorizing municipalities to regulate the operation of motor vehicles for hire and ordinances thereunder requiring a license for such operation were applicable to drivers of taxicabs engaged in an interurban business. Lowe v. Simmons, 185 Miss. 88, 187 So. 214, 1939 Miss. LEXIS 127 (Miss. 1939).
      </p>
      <p>
       These statutes and the ordinances enacted thereunder regulating the operation of motor vehicles for hire in the municipality and providing for a charge of one dollar for a permit therefor were not revenue measures, but were the exercise of the police power in order to protect the public safety of people traveling upon the streets of the municipality. Lowe v. Simmons, 185 Miss. 88, 187 So. 214, 1939 Miss. LEXIS 127 (Miss. 1939).

       Statute empowering municipalities to require operators of motor vehicles for hire to give reasonable bond of not more than $500 to guarantee faithful observance of the law and municipal rules and regulations held not to exclude power of municipalities to require such operators to carry liability insurance.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Payments by a public agency to the municipality for waste collection, transportation, treatment and sewage disposal services and facilities may be made from the income of the public agency’s waterworks system or water supply system or its sewerage system, treatment facilities or sewage disposal system or of both such systems or of its combined waterworks, water supply, treatment facilities, sewerage and sewage disposal systems, as may be prescribed in the contract between the municipality and the public agency, or as otherwise authorized by law. Such payments shall constitute an operating expense of the system or systems whose revenues are thus to be applied. Payments to be made under the contract by the public agency from the income of its waterworks system, water supply system, treatment facility, sewerage system or sewage disposal system or both such systems or its combined waterworks, water supply, treatment facility, sewerage and sewage disposal systems shall be subordinate to amounts required to be paid from the net revenues of such systems for principal of and interest on bonds of the public agency which are outstanding at the time of the making of the contract and which are payable solely from such net revenues unless the ordinance or resolution authorizing such outstanding bonds of the public agency expressly reserves the right to accord such contract payments a priority over such public agency’s bond requirements. No provision of Sections 21-27-161 through 21-27-191 shall be construed to prohibit any public agency, otherwise permitted by law to issue bonds, from issuing bonds in the manner provided by law for the construction, renovation, repair or development of waste disposal facilities within the jurisdictional limits of the public agency. Except to the extent provided in Section 21-27-175, neither the municipality nor the holder of any bonds of the municipality shall have the right to demand payment of the public agency’s obligation out of any funds raised or to be raised by taxation, but such contracts shall constitute an obligation of the public agency and shall be binding upon such public agency according to its terms and shall continue in effect until all bonds specified therein and refunding bonds issued in lieu of such bonds and all other obligations thereunder shall have been paid. Payments made or to be made to a municipality by a public agency or other person pursuant to a contract for waste collection, transportation, treatment and sewage disposal services and facilities shall be determined by the method specified in the contract and shall not be subject to approval or review by the public service commission.

     <p>
      Any public agency having taxing powers, other than a county or a municipality as herein defined, is authorized to levy a special ad valorem tax not to exceed four (4) mills upon all taxable property within its geographical limits to pay all or a portion of the payments to be made by that public agency under a contract between the public agency and a municipality and if the contract as authorized by the governing body of the public agency so provides, then the contract shall constitute an obligation against the taxing power of the public agency to the extent therein provided. The special ad valorem tax millage authorized by Sections 21-27-161 through 21-27-191 shall not be reimbursable by the state under the provisions otherwise made for reimbursements under the homestead exemption laws.

     <p>
      The proceeds derived from two (2) mills of the levy authorized herein shall be included in the ten percent (10%) increase limitation under Section 27-39-321, and the proceeds derived from any additional millage levied hereunder in excess of two (2) mills shall be excluded from such limitation for the first year of such additional levy and shall be included within such limitation in any year thereafter.

       § 21-27-179.
    Issuance of bonds by municipality.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      For the purpose of acquiring, constructing, improving, enlarging, extending and repairing a sewage disposal system or sewage disposal systems, a municipality is authorized to issue bonds payable from and secured by a pledge of all or any part of revenues under any contract or contracts it enters into under Sections 21-27-161 through 21-27-191 and from all or any part of any revenues derived from the operation of the waterworks system, water supply system, treatment facility, sewerage system or sewage disposal system and pledged for such purpose by the municipality. Said bonds shall be in such form and denomination as prescribed by the governing body of the municipality. Such bonds may be serial or term; redeemable, with or without premium, or nonredeemable; registered or coupon bonds with registration privileges as to either principal and interest; principal only or both; shall bear interest at a rate or rates to be determined pursuant to the sale of the bonds; and shall be payable at such time or times and shall mature at such time or times not exceeding the said estimated life of the contemplated system or improvement, but in no event exceeding thirty (30) years from their date, and at such place or places as shall be prescribed in the bond resolution authorizing their issuance; provided, however, that any bond issue to be awarded and sold to the United States of America or any agency thereof shall mature at such time or times, not to exceed thirty-five (35) years, as shall be prescribed in the ordinance authorizing their issuance. Any provisions of the general laws to the contrary notwithstanding, any bonds and interest coupons issued pursuant to the authority of Sections 21-27-161 through 21-27-191 shall possess all the qualities of negotiable instruments. The bonds and the interest coupons shall be executed in such manner and shall be substantially in the form prescribed in the authorizing resolution. In case any of the officers whose signatures or countersignatures appear on the bonds or interest coupons shall cease to be such officers before delivery of such bonds, such signatures or countersignatures shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes the same as if they had remained in office until such delivery. No bond shall bear more than one (1) rate of interest; each bond shall bear interest from its date to its stated maturity date at the interest rate specified in the bid; all bonds of the same maturity shall bear the same rate of interest from date to maturity; all interest accruing on such bonds so issued shall be payable semiannually or annually, except that the first interest coupon attached to any such bond may be for any period not exceeding one (1) year.
     </p>
     <p>
      No interest payment shall be evidenced by more than one (1) coupon and neither cancelled nor supplemental coupons shall be permitted; the lowest interest rate specified for any bonds issued shall not be less than seventy percent (70%) of the highest rate specified for the same bond issue. Such bonds shall not bear a greater overall maximum interest rate to maturity than that allowed in Section 75-17-103, Mississippi Code of 1972. Each interest rate specified in any bid must be in multiples of one-eighth of one percent (1/8 of 1%) or in multiples of one-tenth of one percent (1/10 of 1%). If serial bonds, such bonds shall mature annually, and the first maturity date thereof shall not be more than five (5) years from the date of such bonds. Such bonds shall be legal investments for trustees and other fiduciaries, and for savings banks, trust companies and insurance companies organized under the laws of the state of Mississippi. The bonds and interest coupons shall be exempt from all state, county, municipal and other taxation under the laws of the state of Mississippi. No bond issued pursuant to Sections 21-27-161 through 21-27-191 shall constitute an indebtedness of a municipality within the meaning of any statutory or charter restriction or limitation upon indebtedness. Such bonds shall be sold on sealed bids at public sale in the manner provided by Section 31-19-25, as now or hereafter amended, upon such terms as the governing authorities of the municipality may determine, not inconsistent with the provisions of Sections 21-27-161 through 21-27-191, but no sale shall be made at a price so low as to require the payment of interest on the money received therefor at more than that allowed in Section 75-17-103, Mississippi Code of 1972, computed with relation to the absolute maturity of the bonds, in accordance with standard tables of bond values, excluding from such computation the amount of any premium to be paid on redemption of any bonds prior to maturity. Sections 21-27-161 through 21-27-191 shall be full and complete authority for the issuance of the bonds provided for herein, and no restriction or limitation otherwise prescribed by law shall apply herein, nor shall such bonds constitute an indebtedness of the municipality within the meaning of any constitutional or statutory limitation.

      While any such bonds are outstanding, it shall be the duty of the governing body of the municipality to fix, maintain and collect rates and charges for services furnished or made available by the sewage disposal system, adequate to pay maintenance and operation costs of the expenses allocable to the sewage disposal system, payment of principal of and interest on such bonds, and to provide and maintain the funds created by the resolution authorizing the bonds. Interest to accrue on the bonds and administrative expenses to estimated date when the sewage disposal system will become revenue producing and reserve funds created by the resolution authorizing the bonds may be set aside out of bond proceeds.

      A municipality, as defined in Section 21-27-163, is authorized and empowered, in the discretion of its governmental authorities, to exercise the following powers and authority within the area and territories comprising the metropolitan area of which it is a part:
     </p>
     <p>
      To operate and manage sewerage systems, sewage treatment facilities and sewage disposal systems and related facilities serving the metropolitan area in conformance with the metropolitan area plan.
     </p>
     <p>
      To construct, operate and maintain sewerage systems, sewage treatment facilities and sewage disposal systems in the manner and to the extent required by the metropolitan area plan.
     </p>
     <p>
      To accept and utilize grants and other funds from any source for waste treatment management purposes.
     </p>
     <p>
      To establish and maintain rates and charges for the use of the services of such sewerage systems, sewage treatment facilities and sewage disposal systems within the metropolitan area, and from time to time to adjust such rates, to the end that the revenues therefrom will be sufficient at all times to pay the expenses of operating and maintaining such works, facilities and systems and all of the municipality’s obligations under any contract or bond resolution with respect thereto.
     </p>
     <p>
      To incur short and long-term indebtedness under the provisions of Sections 21-27-161 through 21-27-191 or other applicable statutes.
     </p>
     <p>
      To adopt rules and regulations necessary to carry out the implementation of the metropolitan area plan and to assure the payment of each participating person or public agency of its proportionate share of treatment costs.
     </p>
     <p>
      To refuse to receive any waste from any public agency or subdivision thereof or any other person which does not comply with the provisions of the metropolitan area plan applicable to the particular area within which such public agency or subdivision thereof or any other person is located.
     </p>
     <p>
      To accept industrial waste for treatment and to require the pretreatment of same when within the opinion of the municipality such pretreatment is necessary.

       Duty to maintain a sewage system is not imposed by law upon municipalities; the language of the statute explicitly leaves it to the discretion of municipalities whether and how to maintain their sewage systems, if any, and accordingly, sewage maintenance, as a general function, is discretionary. Boroujerdi v. City of Starkville, 158 So.3d 1106, 2015 Miss. LEXIS 84 (Miss. 2015).
      </p>
      <p>
       It would be patently unfair to affirm summary judgment in the city’s favor without the property owner having an opportunity to attempt to conform his complaint and proof to the current approach to discretionary function immunity; municipal sewage maintenance generally is a discretionary function, but several narrower functions and duties associated with sewage maintenance are mandated by statute or regulation and thus are ministerial and removed from discretionary function immunity. Boroujerdi v. City of Starkville, 158 So.3d 1106, 2015 Miss. LEXIS 84 (Miss. 2015).
      </p>

       City was immune from homeowners’ claims arising from sewer back-ups as a result of a city ordinance requiring larger sewer lines than were present on the homeowners’ property because Jackson, Miss., Ordinances art. II, § 205(4) exempted the homeowners’ subdivision from the ordinance, so the ordinance did not cause the city’s maintenance of the city’s sewage system to be a ministerial function. Fortenberry v.

   Circuit court erred in granting a city summary judgment in landowners’ action to recover for the damages they sustained when raw sewage flooded their homes due to blockage in the city’s sewage lines because a genuine issue of material fact existed as to whether the city violated a ministerial duty that it articulated and imposed on itself in a subdivision ordinance as to minimum-design standards and sewage pipe size, and the record reflected evidence that the city breached a ministerial duty set forth in its own ordinance that contained no element of choice; the circuit court erred in its interpretation and application of only a portion of the Metropolitan Area Waste Disposal Act, Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t21c27s21-27-189" target="_self">21-27-189</a></cite>, in failing to apply the related statutes referred to in the text of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t21c27s21-27-189" target="_self">21-27-189</a></cite>, and in ignoring the city’s requirement to abide by the Act because the plain language of the grant of authority in § 21-27-189 entailed compliance with the metropolitan-area plan, federal law, and city rules and regulations enacted to ensure compliance with the plan, and in the exercise of that statutory authority to adopt rules and regulations locally, the city adopted its own minimum standards as provided in a subdivision ordinance that set forth no discretion or choice as to minimum-design standards, stating that the sewerage system pipes had to conform to a minimum pipe size of eight inches.

       Several functions and duties involved in sewage maintenance and operation are ministerial, and if a plaintiff can show that his or her injuries were caused by the government’s act or failure to act in furtherance of one or more of such ministerial functions, that plaintiff can proceed with his or her claim.

    Creation of City Employees Retirement Fund; election to come under provisions of article.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      In every municipality of the State of Mississippi, operating under a commission form of government as of March 31, 1948, and having a population of twenty-one thousand or more, according to the 1940 federal census, and in every municipality bordering on tide water and having a population of more than fifteen thousand, it shall be the duty of the governing body of said municipality to create and maintain a fund known as the “City Employees Retirement Fund,” which shall be maintained for the benefits of certain city employees hereinafter named and which shall be derived, raised and administered in the manner hereinafter provided.
     </p>
     <p>
      In any municipality coming under the provisions of this article, upon a petition signed by twenty per cent of the qualified electors of such municipality, protesting against the operation of this article and petitioning for an election thereon to determine whether a majority of the qualified electors of such municipality desire for such municipality to come from under the terms of this article, providing such petition is filed with the governing body of such municipality by July 29, 1948, the municipal authorities of such municipality shall call an election by August 28, 1948, after giving notice for three consecutive weeks, as to whether the municipality desires to come from under the provisions of this article. At said election, the ballots used by the qualified electors shall read: “For the Retirement Fund for the City Employees,” “Against the Retirement Fund for the City Employees.” Said election shall be held as such other elections of like nature, and if at such election a majority of those participating thereat shall vote against the retirement fund for the city employees, then this article shall not apply to such municipality. If no petition is filed as above provided, the governing body of said municipality shall by August 28, 1948, pass the required ordinance to begin the operation of said retirement system in accordance with the provisions hereof.

     </p>
     <p>
      All persons who become employees after the date fixed in the ordinance of the governing body for the retirement system to go into effect shall become members of the retirement system on the expiration of two (2) months from date of employment; however, persons who have reached the age of forty (40) years who have not had prior service or membership service which may be reinstated as hereinafter provided shall not be members of the retirement system.

      All persons who are employees of the municipality, and who are members of the general municipal employees’ retirement system shall come under the provisions and benefits of this article and shall receive all benefits provided for in this article. The municipality shall each month deduct from the total compensation of each member not less than seven percent (7%) nor more than ten percent (10%) of the amount thereof, and put the amounts deducted in the employees’ savings fund. Any increase to an amount in excess of seven percent (7%) shall be in increments of not more than one percent (1%) per annum.

      No new member may be joined after July 1, 1987, and all new employees of the municipality who are employed after July 1, 1987, shall be covered by the Public Employees’ Retirement System of Mississippi.

    Cessation of membership.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Except as otherwise provided in this article, should a member separate from the service of an employer or should he become a beneficiary or die, he shall thereupon cease to be a member and any prior service and membership service which may be credited to his service account at the time of his separation from the service of the employer shall be forfeited by him. Should such person again become an employee of the same employer within a period of five (5) years following the date of his last separation from the service of such employer, he shall again become a member of the retirement system, if not otherwise by this article prevented, conditioned on his redepositing at time of reemployment, and not afterwards, any part of his accumulated contributions theretofore withdrawn from the employees’ savings fund, and any prior service and membership service which may have been credited to him at the time of his separation from service shall be restored to him. However, that in the case of the reemployment of a duty disability retirant neither the limitation of five (5) years nor the redepositing of any sum withdrawn from the employees’ savings fund shall apply.
     </p>
     <p>
      The provisions of subsection (a) shall not apply to any employees of a municipality who are employed after adoption of a resolution in accordance with the provisions of subsection (c) of Section 21-29-17. However, under the provisions of the agreement between the municipality and the public employees’ retirement system, after the employee has been actively employed for a period of four (4) years and reported as a member of the public employees’ retirement system of Mississippi, he may pay the employee contributions, the employer contributions and interest as determined by the public employees’ retirement system of Mississippi based on the earnings during the previous period of service with the municipality and receive creditable service for such prior service in the public employees’ retirement system of Mississippi.

       If the Board of General Retirement System had intended to make the contention that the allegations of the employee’s petition for duty disability in respect to his having been totally and permanently disabled to work were not correct, the board should have raised the question at a hearing on the employee’s application.

       Under the General Municipal Employees’ Retirement Act, a municipal employee became a member of retirement system upon the approval by the board of his instalment-payment plan of making the contributions to the retirement fund, and he would remain a member of the system until he became a beneficiary or died, since he did not separate himself from the service within the meaning of the statute relating to circumstances under which membership ceases.

      Should any member cease to be an employee before becoming eligible to receive either a service or disability retirement allowance as provided by this article, for reasons other than becoming a beneficiary or his death, he thereafter, at any time while not a member of the system, may request in writing, of the board a refund to him of his accumulated contributions, whereupon one hundred percent (100%) of his accumulated contributions then credited to his individual account in the employees’ savings fund, less and except all interest credited to his individual account, shall be refunded to him within one (1) year from the filing of the request. However, from the date of separation of any employee, no further interest shall be credited to his individual account in said fund by the board unless and until such employee again becomes a member of the retirement system.
     </p>
     <p>
      Should any former member, who has accumulated contributions remaining in the employees’ savings fund, die, or any member die before his retirement becomes effective, one hundred percent (100%) of the amount of his accumulated contributions standing to his credit in the employees’ savings fund, including the accumulated interest therein at the rate of one percent (1%) per annum, at the time of his death shall be paid to such person or persons as shall have been nominated by written designation duly executed and filed with the board. If there be no such designated person or persons, then one hundred percent (100%) of the amount of his accumulated contributions shall be paid to his legal representative. However, such payments shall be postponed, at the discretion of the board, for not more than eighteen (18) months.

    Funds.

     </h3>
     <p>
      All funds provided for herein shall be part of the public funds of the Public Employees’ Retirement System and shall be kept in such way as it is required by law to keep its funds. All allowances or withdrawals from such funds shall be drawn against such funds by the rules and regulations of the Public Employees’ Retirement System. All securities purchased with money of the various funds under this article shall be purchased in the name of the Public Employees’ Retirement System and held as are other securities of the Public Employees’ Retirement System. The Public Employees’ Retirement System shall maintain separate municipal accounts for each fund. The following funds shall be set up by any municipality operating under the provisions of this article:
     </p>
     <p>
      Employees’ saving fund.— The employees’ saving fund shall be the fund in which shall be accumulated the contribution from the compensation of the members and the contributions of members who have prior service to provide for the maintenance, by the clerk of the employer, of an individual account with each member showing the amount of the member’s contributions credited to his account and showing interest credited to his account as by the board directed. The portion of the accumulated contributions of a member returned to him upon his withdrawing from service, or paid to his designated beneficiary or legal representative in event of his death, as provided in Sections 21-29-19 and 21-29-21, shall be paid from the employees’ saving fund and charged against his individual account therein and the balance then standing in his name in his individual account in said fund shall be transferred to the retirement reserve fund and his individual account closed. The contribution of each member to the employees’ saving fund, beginning with the effective date of the retirement system as fixed by ordinance of the governing body, shall be four percent (4%) of his compensation. The employer shall cause the said contribution to be deducted from the cash compensation of each member on each and every payroll period, so long as he remains a member of the retirement system. Every member shall be deemed to consent and agree to the deductions made and provided for herein, and his receipt for his full compensation and payment less said deduction shall be a full and complete discharge and acquittance of all claims and demands whatsoever for the services rendered by such member during the period covered by such payment, except as to benefits provided under this article. The employer shall, within five (5) days following the end of each calendar month, forward the member contributions deducted from the compensation of each member during the preceding calendar month to the Public Employees’ Retirement System, to be placed in the employees’ saving fund.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retirement reserve fund.— The Public Employees’ Retirement System shall place in the retirement reserve fund all taxes levied and collected pursuant to the provisions of Section 21-29-27. All retirement and disability allowances shall be paid from this fund.
     </p>
     <p>
      Income Fund.— All interest and other income derived from the deposits and investments authorized by this article shall be paid into the income fund.
     </p>
     <p>
      The board shall annually allow interest for the preceding year to the individual accounts of members of the employees’ savings fund based on the average interest and income received from the investment and deposit of the moneys of the employees’ savings fund and the retirement reserve fund, provided that the allowed interest on contributions made by members within any one (1) year shall be computed, beginning on the first day of the fiscal year next following, and shall be computed at the end of the fiscal year. Within thirty (30) days after the end of each fiscal year the allowed interest on the accounts in the employees’ savings fund shall be credited to the individual accounts of the members and the total thereof placed in the employees’ savings fund and any balance of such interest and income shall be placed in the retirement reserve fund. All costs incidental to the investment of funds shall be paid out of this fund.

       Except as otherwise provided in subsection (2) of this section, the governing body of a municipality, after the passage of the ordinance provided for in Section 21-29-5, shall annually levy a tax as certified by the Public Employees’ Retirement System on the taxable property within the municipality or use other funds available, to enable it to meet the requirements of the retirement system. The levy made, or other funds made available, for the municipality’s contribution to the system shall be in an amount sufficient to make the system actuarially sound. The tax herein authorized is in addition to all other taxes authorized by law, and may be increased by no more than one-half (1/2) mill per year as certified by the Public Employees’ Retirement System; however, if any levy to pay debt service on bonds issued under Section 31-25-21 as described in subsection (2) of this section is reduced for any year as a result of payment of the bonds or otherwise, the levy under this subsection (1) for such year may be increased by an amount, in addition to the one-half (1/2) mill otherwise authorized, not to exceed the reduction for such year in the millage levied to pay debt service on the bonds.

       In addition to, or in lieu of, the method of funding provided for in subsection (1) of this section, the municipality may fund or assist in funding the retirement system through the use of revenue bonds issued pursuant to Section 31-25-21. Any tax levied to service the debt on such bonds shall not be included in the ten percent (10%) limitation on increases under Section 27-39-321.
      </li>
      <li id="t21c29s21-29-27ol13">
       Each municipality with a general municipal employees’ retirement fund shall be provided an actuarial study of the fund at least every four (4) years by the Public Employees’ Retirement System, which shall report the findings to the Legislature of the State of Mississippi. The first such study shall be filed with the Legislature in January 1980.

       § 21-29-33.
    Service retirement allowance.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Upon retirement from service as provided in Section 21-29-31 a member shall receive a service retirement allowance for the remainder of his life, payable monthly, which allowance shall be a sum equal to fifty percent (50%) of his average monthly salary for the last four (4) years of service immediately prior to retirement; provided, however, that upon retirement from service in any municipality having a commission form of government on March 31, 1948, as provided in Section 21-29-5 and having a separate firemen and policemen retirement system and having a population not in excess of 48,000 according to the 1980 decennial census, which municipality has established a retirement system according to the provisions of this chapter, the service retirement allowance shall be based upon the average monthly salary for the last two (2) years of service immediately prior to retirement. Any member who has been in paid service for longer than twenty (20) years shall be entitled to receive additional payments for life in a sum equal to one and seven-tenths percent (1.7%) of the average monthly salary received by such member in the two-year period next preceding the filing of said application for each full year of service in excess of twenty (20) years’ service. However, no retired payment to any member shall exceed sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66-2/3%) of the average monthly salary received by a member for the four-year or two-year period, as the case may be, next preceding the filing of said application. Periods of time in which a member may have been inactive on account of physical or mental disability shall not be excluded in computing the twenty-year period and the seven-year period hereinbefore mentioned, provided the employee continues to contribute his share to the program based on the average of his last two (2) months’ compensation. This contribution shall continue during the total time the employee shall be inactive.

       “Upon retirement from service” as found in Section 21-29-33, means termination of employment as employee of municipality in position that would have been covered by General Municipal Employees’ Retirement System or by Public Employees’ Retirement System after closure of General Municipal Employees’ Retirement System to new members. Snowden Aug. 26, 1993, A.G. Op. #93-0538.

       Nothing prohibits retired Employee from being reemployed by City; however, since employee would no longer be retired, benefits from General Municipal Employees’ Retirement System would be suspended during such period of reemployment; further, if so reemployed, Employee would be covered by Public Employees’ Retirement System on same terms and conditions as all other municipal employees.

    Duty disability retirement.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Upon application of a member in service of the employer, any member who has become totally and permanently incapacitated for duty as the natural and proximate result of the actual performance of duty of the employer, without wilful negligence on his part, may be retired by the board on a duty disability retirement allowance effective thirty days after the filing of an application in writing with the board. However, the physician or physicians selected by the board to examine the member shall certify that such member is presumably permanently and totally disabled from engaging in any gainful occupation for compensation or profit, that under the facts as to the cause of disability, as certified by the board, the member’s disability could have with reasonable probability resulted, in such physician’s opinion, and that such member should be retired.

       Where a municipal employee became permanently disabled to perform the duties of his employment and he has not paid all his required instalments, based upon an instalment payment plan which has been approved by the board, but he did make a tender of amount of instalments due with his application for disability, the employee’s application should have been granted and he was entitled to disability. Smith v. Board of General Retirement System, 224 Miss. 13, 79 So. 2d 447, 1955 Miss. LEXIS 455 (Miss. 1955).
      </p>
      <p>
       General Municipal Employees’ Retirement Act does not require the filing of an application for duty disability before his service as an employee has terminated. Smith v. Board of General Retirement System, 224 Miss. 13, 79 So. 2d 447, 1955 Miss. LEXIS 455 (Miss. 1955).
      </p>
      <p>
       If the Board of General Retirement System had intended to make the contention that the allegations of the employee’s petition for duty disability in respect to his having been totally and permanently disabled to work were not correct, the board should have raised the question at a hearing on the employee’s application. Smith v. Board of General Retirement System, 224 Miss. 13, 79 So. 2d 447, 1955 Miss. LEXIS 455 (Miss. 1955).
      </p>
      <p>
       Under the General Municipal Employees’ Retirement Act, a municipal employee became a member of retirement system upon the approval by the board of his instalment payment plan of making the contributions to the retirement fund, and he would remain a member of the system until he became a beneficiary or died, since he did not separate himself from the service within the meaning of the statute relating to circumstances under which membership ceases. Smith v. Board of General Retirement System, 224 Miss. 13, 79 So. 2d 447, 1955 Miss. LEXIS 455 (Miss. 1955).

       § 21-29-45.
    Death of member.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      [For any municipality that has not elected to authorize the continuation of or reinstatement of spouse retirement benefits under the provisions of Section 21-29-329, this section shall read as follows:]
     </p>
     <p>
      Upon proper application to the general retirement board, the benefits to dependents of deceased members and retirants shall be paid as follows:
     </p>
     <p>
      If any member dies for causes other than the performance of duty in the service of the municipality before completing five (5) years’ service, there shall be paid to his or her designated beneficiary or his or her legal representative, if no beneficiary has been designated, from the employees’ savings fund the sum equal to the amount accumulated in his or her individual account.
     </p>
     <p>
      If any member dies who has not had less than five (5) and not more than twenty (20) years’ service with the municipality, there shall be paid to the spouse, from the retirement reserve fund, for each year’s active service, not to exceed a period of twenty (20) years, one-fortieth (1/40) of the average monthly salary or compensation received by the member in the four-year or two-year period, as the case may be, next preceding the death, for the use of the spouse and the child or children of the deceased member under the age of eighteen (18) years, so long as the spouse remains unmarried. If, after the marriage of the spouse, there remains a child or children of the deceased member under the age of eighteen (18) years, the payments shall continue to be made to a parent or lawful custodian of the child or children without the necessity of appointment as guardian for the benefit of the child or children, so long as the child or children are under the age of eighteen (18) years. After the death or marriage of the spouse, all payments to the spouse shall cease, and after the death or attainment of eighteen (18) years of any child or children of the deceased, all payments to the child or children over eighteen (18) years of age shall cease. If the deceased member is not survived by a spouse or child or children under the age of eighteen (18) years, but is survived by a father or a mother dependent upon him or her, the payments shall continue to be made to the dependent father or mother, or both, so long as each lives. The word “dependent,” as used in this section, shall mean “wholly dependent,” as determined by the retirement board.
     </p>
     <p>
      If any member dies after having completed twenty (20) years’ service as required by Section 21-29-31, or if any retirant dies, there shall be paid from the retirement reserve fund to the spouse or the dependents designated in paragraph (b) of this section, the amount of benefits or retirement pay equal to the sum being paid to the deceased member or retirant, or which would have been paid to the deceased member or retirant if he or she had applied for benefits under this section, on the date of his or her death.
     </p>
     <p>
      If any member dies before becoming eligible to receive benefits under this article as a result of the performance of duty to the municipality, there shall be paid to the spouse or dependents designated in paragraph (b) of this section from the retirement reserve fund, an amount equal to fifty percent (50%) of the monthly salary of the deceased member on the date of his or her death. This amount shall be paid to the same beneficiaries and for the same period of time as those beneficiaries and periods of time set forth in paragraph (b) of this section.

       Retirement benefits under this Act [Laws 1940, ch 287] are not gratuities, nor for a private purpose, nor the lending of credit, nor are they extra compensation within the prohibitions of the Constitution. Mayor & Aldermen of Vicksburg v. Crichlow, 196 Miss. 259, 16 So. 2d 749, 1944 Miss. LEXIS 185 (Miss. 1944).
      </p>
      <p>
       Nor does this act [Laws 1940, ch 287] constitute class legislation, or a violation of the constitutional prohibition against maintaining the salary of an officer after his duties have been taken away, or allowing an officer to hold office or employment without personally devoting his time thereto; nor does it run counter to the requirement that no person shall be elected or appointed to office for life or during good behavior and that the term of all offices shall be for some specified period. Mayor & Aldermen of Vicksburg v. Crichlow, 196 Miss. 259, 16 So. 2d 749, 1944 Miss. LEXIS 185 (Miss. 1944).

      <p>
       Where demurrer of city to petition for writ of mandamus to compel the city officials to comply with the provision of the act providing for retirement benefits for firemen and policemen, was overruled, city was entitled to plead further upon filing affidavit of merits. Mayor & Aldermen of Vicksburg v. Crichlow, 196 Miss. 259, 16 So. 2d 749, 1944 Miss. LEXIS 185 (Miss. 1944).
      </p>
      <p>
       In mandamus action to compel city to comply with statute providing for retirement benefits for firemen and policemen, affidavit of merits, filed after overruling of demurrer to petition, alleging that petitioner was not of the class of persons entitled to benefits under the act, that city had not complied with the act, and that petitioner had been discharged as a fireman, did not disclose a good and substantial defense, and trial court did not err in striking city’s affidavit and plea. Mayor & Aldermen of Vicksburg v. Crichlow, 196 Miss. 259, 16 So. 2d 749, 1944 Miss. LEXIS 185 (Miss. 1944).

      <p>
       Judgment in mandamus action to compel cities to comply with statute providing for retirement benefits for firemen and policemen, that petitioner was entitled to the relief prayed for and to a peremptory writ of mandamus and that he have of the defendants the relief prayed for in his petition, was too broad as assuming to decide the merits of the case, constituting a prejudgment of matters within the discretion of the board, created by the act, and as applying to duties imposed upon the city which could not be enforced by mandamus.

     <p>
      When the amount of funds derived from the tax levied pursuant to Section 21-29-117 is sufficient to care for the requirements and necessities as determined by an actuarial study, the governing authorities of said municipality shall discontinue entirely or reduce the tax rate provided in Section 21-29-117 until such time as financial necessity creates a demand for the reassessment of said tax. It is understood, however, in this connection, that when and if the tax collections as herein provided are discontinued, that said tax shall be reassessed when necessity requires, without the necessity of an election. Each municipality with a disability and relief fund for firemen and policemen shall have prepared an actuarial study of the fund at least every four (4) years and report the findings to the legislature of the State of Mississippi. The first such study shall be filed with the legislature in January, 1980.

       The total disability for which benefits are allowed firemen is related solely to disability to discharge the duties of a member of the fire department. Board of Disability & Relief v. Hudson, 229 Miss. 631, 91 So. 2d 718, 1957 Miss. LEXIS 306 (Miss. 1957).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the total disability exists the only restriction upon claimant’s rights to benefits is in a case where the city is paying a salary to the claimant while disabled in an amount equal to the disability relief allowed, and in a case where the claimant has attached himself to a paid fire department in another city. Board of Disability & Relief v. Hudson, 229 Miss. 631, 91 So. 2d 718, 1957 Miss. LEXIS 306 (Miss. 1957).
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that a fireman obtained other employment which he was able to perform, notwithstanding his admitted total disability to discharge the duties of a fireman, would not deprive the former fireman of his right to the disability benefits provided by statute. Board of Disability & Relief v. Hudson, 229 Miss. 631, 91 So. 2d 718, 1957 Miss. LEXIS 306 (Miss. 1957).
      </p>
      <p>
       Contention of Board of Disability & Relief that claimant was not a fireman at the time he sought disability payments was not sustained by evidence that claimant remained in the employment of the city as a member of the fire department from the day of his injury, April 17, 1952, to July 1953, and on June 30, 1953, gave notice not of his intention to resign but of his desire to retire and claim retirement benefits, which the board treated as an application for retirement and/or disability benefits and granted disability benefits and paid them until such payments were terminated by a letter of the city attorney more than a year later.

      Should any member of a fire or police department become or be found to be permanently and totally disabled for the discharge of his duties as a member of said fire department or police department, mentally or physically, by reason of sickness or injury, and who has had not less than five years’ service with such department, there shall be paid to said fireman or policeman from the firemen’s and policemen’s disability and relief fund, provided the municipality has such a fund, for each year’s active service, not to exceed a period of twenty years, one-fortieth of the monthly salary of such policeman or fireman at the time such disability is incurred, to be paid throughout such permanent and total disability. In passing upon the question of disability said board shall require an examination of the applicant by the city physician or other physician or physicians as it may deem proper, and may require like examinations from time to time throughout the period of disability claimed by said fireman or policeman. If said city pays a salary to its firemen or policemen while disabled in an amount equal to the disability relief allowed under this section, said firemen or policemen shall not be entitled to any disability relief under this section.

     <p>
      If any member of said fire and/or police department who has been in paid fire and/or police department service for as long as twenty (20) years before making application hereinafter mentioned, the last ten (10) years of which shall have been continuous in the city in which the application is made, shall make written application for retirement and relief, the board of disability and relief shall, without medical examination of disability, retire him from active service in said fire and/or police department. Upon such retirement from active service, said board of disability and relief shall order the payment to such retired member monthly from said fund a sum equal to fifty percent (50%) of the average monthly base salary and longevity pay received as salary by such member in the six-month period next before the filing of such application in said fire and/or police department. Such payments shall thereafter be made to said retired member for life, such payment to be known as “retired relief.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Any member of the fire and/or police department who has been in paid fire and/or police department service for longer than twenty (20) years in a municipality shall be entitled and shall receive additional retired relief payment for life in a sum equal to one and seven-tenths percent (1-7/10%) of the same average monthly base salary and longevity pay received by such member in the six-month period next preceding the filing of said application, for each full year of service in excess of twenty (20) years’ service. However, no retired relief payment to any member shall exceed sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66-2/3%) of the average monthly base salary and longevity pay received by a member for the six-month period next preceding the filing of said application.
     </p>
     <p>
      The said board shall, when a member of the fire and/or police department reaches the age of sixty-five (65), retire him from active service in said fire and/or police department and order the payment of such funds as the member is entitled to hereunder.
     </p>
     <p>
      Periods of time in which a member may have been inactive on account of physical or mental disability shall not be excluded in computing the twenty-year period and the ten-year period hereinbefore mentioned. Periods of time within which a member may have been absent from his employment while in active service of the Army or Navy of the United States, United States Marine Corps or the United States Coast Guard between September 16, 1940, and July 25, 1947, or while as a civil employee engaged by the Army and Navy while serving outside the continental United States shall not be excluded in computing the twenty-year period and the ten-year period hereinbefore mentioned, provided that the discharge or release of such member from the armed forces was under conditions other than dishonorable. Any member who has been retired or is voluntarily retired hereunder, or who has received relief or disability benefits hereunder, shall be required to perform such duties as then may be required of him.
     </p>
     <p>
      Provided, however, in any city having a population of nineteen thousand (19,000) but less than twenty thousand (20,000), according to the 1970 census, the periods of time not exceeding four (4) years within which a member of the fire or police departments may have been absent from his employment while in active service in the Armed Forces of the United States, shall not be excluded in computing the twenty-year period and the ten-year period mentioned in this section.

       Retirement benefits under this Act [Laws 1940, ch 287] are not gratuities, nor for a private purpose, nor the lending of credit, nor are they extra compensation within the prohibitions of the Constitution.

       Nor does this act [Laws 1940, ch 287] constitute class legislation, or a violation of the constitutional prohibition against maintaining the salary of an officer after his duties have been taken away, or allowing an officer to hold office or employment without personally devoting his time thereto; nor does it run counter to the requirement that no person shall be elected or appointed to office for life or during good behavior and that the term of all offices shall be for some specified period.

       Judgment in mandamus action to compel cities to comply with statute providing for retirement benefits for firemen and policemen, that petitioner was entitled to the relief prayed for and to a peremptory writ of mandamus and that he have of the defendants the relief prayed for in his petition, was too broad as assuming to decide the merits of the case, constituting a prejudgment of matters within the discretion of the board, created by the act, and as applying to duties imposed upon the city which could not be enforced by mandamus.

     <p>
      Whenever the said fund shall be created, and a system of disability and relief for firemen and/or policemen inaugurated in any municipality, at any time upon the petition of not less than twenty percent (20%) of the qualified electors of said municipality addressed to the said officers composing the governing board of said municipality, requesting an election to determine whether said municipality shall continue to operate under the provisions of this article, the said governing board of said municipality shall order an election to determine said question. Notice of the election shall be given and conduct of the election shall be had as is provided in Section 21-29-203. If at said election a majority of the qualified electors of said municipality shall vote against the continuance of operation of said municipality under the provisions of this article, the said governing board of said municipality shall at the next regular meeting thereof held after said election order the abolition and discontinuance of said system. The said fund and the said system, however, shall continue as to members of the paid fire department and/or police department of said municipality already in service and entitled to participation in said fund. The said system shall be worked out in said municipality to its end as to said members of the paid fire department and/or police department, but no new members entering the service of the fire and/or police department of said municipality shall be taken into or embraced within said system. If at said election a majority of the qualified electors of said municipality shall not vote for a discontinuance of said system in said municipality, no other election in said regard shall be held therein within a period of one (1) year thereafter. No new members may be joined by the fund after July 1, 1987, and all new employees of the police department and/or fire department of any municipality having such funds shall become members of the Public Employees’ Retirement System of Mississippi after July 1, 1987.

     <p>
      If any member of said fire and/or police department who has been in paid fire and/or police department service for as long as twenty (20) years before making application hereinafter mentioned, the last ten (10) years of which shall have been continuous in the city in which the application is made, shall make written application for retirement and relief, the board of disability and relief shall without medical examinations of disability, retire him from active service in said fire and/or police department. Upon such retirement from active service said disability and relief board shall order the payment to such retired member monthly from said fund a sum equal to fifty percent (50%) of the average monthly base salary and longevity pay received as salary by such member in the six-month period next before the filing of such application in said fire and/or police department. Such payments shall thereafter be made to said retired member for life, such payments to be known as “retired relief.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Any member of the fire and/or police department who has been in paid fire and/or police department service for longer than twenty (20) years shall be entitled to and shall receive additional retired relief payment for life in a sum equal to one and seven-tenths percent (1.7%) of the same monthly base salary and longevity pay received by such member in the six-month period next preceding the filing of said application for each full year of service in excess of twenty (20) years’ service. However, such additional retired relief payment shall be paid only for each year served after July 1, 1966. No retired relief payment to any member shall exceed sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66-2/3%) of the average monthly base salary and longevity pay received by a member for the six-month period next preceding the filing of said application, except such other additional benefits as may be hereinafter provided.
     </p>
     <p>
      The board of disability and relief shall, when a member of the fire and/or police department completes thirty-five (35) years of paid employment, or attains the age of sixty (60), whichever occurs first, retire him from active service in said fire and/or police department and order the payment of such funds as the member is entitled to under this article.
     </p>
     <p>
      Periods of time in which a member may have been inactive on account of physical or mental disability shall not be excluded in computing the twenty-year period and the ten-year period hereinabove mentioned. Neither shall there be excluded therefrom periods of time within which a member may have been absent from his employment while serving in the Armed Forces of the United States, or any civil employee engaged by the Armed Forces of the United States while serving outside the continental United States, in time of war during World War I, World War II, the Korean Conflict, Cuban Crisis, Berlin Crisis, Vietnam Conflict, or when involuntarily called on active duty, provided that the maximum period for such creditable service shall be four (4) years unless positive proof can be furnished by such person that he was retained in the Armed Forces by cause beyond his control, and without opportunity of discharge, and provided that the discharge or release of such member from the Armed Forces was under conditions other than dishonorable. Any member who has been retired or is voluntarily retired hereunder, or who has received relief or disability benefits hereunder, shall be required to report such duties as then may be required of them.

Thereafter, such payment, to be known as “retirement relief,” shall be made to such retired member for the remainder of his life.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any member of said fire and/or police department who has been in, and has received compensation for, fire and/or police department service for more than twenty years shall be entitled to, and shall receive, additional retirement relief for the remainder of his life of an amount equal to one and seven-tenths percent of the same average monthly base salary and longevity pay received by such member as salary in the six-month period preceding the filing of such application for each full year of service in excess of twenty years. However, such retired member shall receive the additional retirement relief provided in this paragraph only for each full year of service in excess of twenty years completed after July 1, 1966. No such retired member shall receive such additional retirement relief in excess of sixty-six and two-thirds percent of the same average monthly base salary and longevity pay received as salary by him in the six-month period preceding the filing of such application, excluding such other benefits as may be hereinafter provided.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any member of said fire and/or police department who (1) has been in, and has received compensation for, fire and/or police department service for a period equal to or greater than five years and less than twenty years, and (2) has been forced to retirement on account of age may file a written application for pro rata retirement relief. Thereupon, said disability and relief board shall retire such member from active service without a medical examination for disability and shall order the monthly payment to him from said fund of an amount equal to two and one-half percent of the average monthly base salary and longevity pay received as salary by him in the six-month period preceding the filing of such application for each full year of active service.
     </p>
     <p>
      Periods of time in which a member may have been inactive on account of physical or mental disability shall not be excluded in computing the hereinbefore-mentioned time periods, except that such periods of inactivity shall be excluded in computing the aforementioned five-year pro rata eligibility period. Periods of time in which a member may have been absent from such employment on account of active service in the Army or Navy of the United States, the United States Marine Corps or the United States Coast Guard between September 16, 1940, and July 25, 1947, or while as a civil employee engaged by the Army or Navy while serving outside the continental United States shall not be excluded in computing the hereinbefore-mentioned time period except that such periods of inactivity shall be excluded in computing the aforementioned five-year pro rata eligibility period. The discharge or release of such member from such armed forces shall have been under conditions other than dishonorable. Any member who has been retired or is voluntarily retired under this section, or who has received relief or disability benefits under this section, shall be required to report such duties as required by said disability and relief board.
     </p>
     <p>
      The disability and relief board shall, when a member of the fire and/or police department completes thirty-five years of paid employment or attains the age of sixty, whichever occurs first, retire him from active service and order the payment of such funds as the member is entitled to under the provisions of this section. However, the continued employment of any member who has not completed twenty years of service may be authorized by the governing authority of the municipality on a year-to-year basis until the employee completes twenty years of active service or reaches the age of seventy, whichever occurs first.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any person receiving retirement relief under the provisions of this section shall no longer be entitled to said relief upon attachment with a paid fire department or police department in another city having a paid retirement relief program for policemen or firemen.
     </p>
     <p>
      The entitlement, under the particular retirement program in operation prior to the adoption of the alternative retirement program established in this section, of a policeman or fireman thereunder to any benefits or rights thereof shall not be diminished on account of the transition by such municipalities to the alternative retirement program established by this section.

       Pursuant to the Unemployment Compensation Amendments of 1992 (Public Law 102-318 (UCA)), a member or the spouse of a member who is an eligible beneficiary entitled to a refund under Article 1, 3 or 5 of this chapter may elect on a form prescribed by the board under rules and regulations established by the board, to have an eligible rollover distribution of accumulated contributions payable under this section paid directly to an eligible retirement plan, as defined under applicable federal law, or an individual retirement account. If the member or the spouse of a member who is an eligible beneficiary makes that election and specifies the eligible retirement plan or individual retirement account to which the distribution is to be paid, the distribution will be made in the form of a direct trustee-to-trustee transfer to the specified eligible retirement plan. A non-spouse beneficiary may elect to have an eligible rollover distribution paid in the form of a direct trustee-to-trustee transfer to an individual retirement account established to receive the distribution on behalf of the non-spouse beneficiary. Flexible rollovers under this subsection shall not be considered assignments under Section 21-29-307.

The plans may only accept rollover payments in an amount equal to or less than the balance due for reinstatement of service credit. The rules adopted by the board of trustees shall condition the acceptance of a rollover or transfer from another eligible retirement plan on the receipt of information necessary to enable the system to determine the eligibility of any transferred funds for tax-free rollover treatment or other treatment under federal income tax law.

       Because a city did not have a civil service commission, it did not fall within the purview of the civil service laws. Collins v. City of Newton, 240 So.3d 1211, 2018 Miss. LEXIS 123 (Miss. 2018).

      <p>
       Ordinance requiring all municipal employees qualified under the rules and regulations of the civil service commission to maintain their domicil and principal place of business within the corporate limits of the city during the period of their employment did not infringe their constitutional right to intrastate travel, and the city was not required to justify the ordinance under the compelling interest standard which must be met upon interference with a right to travel interstate; dismissal of the action affirmed.

       Where a captain of a fire department brought suit against the city to enjoin the city officials from transferring him to another fire station, the fire captain’s remedy was under the Civil Service Act which provides a plain, speedy, adequate and complete remedy by appeal and the fire captain was not entitled to relief in equity.

       The Civil Service Act created new rights, which were unknown to the common law and it prescribed an exclusive remedy to persons asserting a civil service status. Scott v. Lowe, 223 Miss. 312, 78 So. 2d 452, 1955 Miss. LEXIS 382 (Miss. 1955).

      <p>
       All full paid employees of the fire and/or police departments of each municipality are afforded civil service coverage, and “all full paid employees” means that coverage is only extended to employees who are paid a weekly, monthly, or yearly salary and does not include persons working for the municipality who are paid by the hour. Brown, June 26, 1992, A.G. Op. #92-0456.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since civil service commission was established by the Legislature, only act by that body can authorize dissolution of commission, even if provisions of paragraph (2)(e) no longer accurately describe city. Brown, Oct. 21, 1992, A.G. Op. #92-0754.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for Miss. Code Sections 21-31-1 et seq., there are no provisions that grant civil service commission autonomous power to appoint or employ civil service employees independently of mayor and board of aldermen. Seibert, Jan. 20, 1993, A.G. Op. #92-1012.
      </p>
      <p>
       Firemen for city are covered by Civil Service System established pursuant to Miss. Code Sections 21-31-1 et seq. Schissel, Feb. 25, 1993, A.G. Op. #93-0089.
      </p>
      <p>
       Only full paid employees of the fire and police departments are mandatorily included within civil service coverage, but other full time employees may be extended coverage in the discretion of the governing authorities with the approval of the Civil Service Commission upon adoption of a proper ordinance. Stafford, March 27, 1998, A.G. Op. #98-0160.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no authority for the civil service commission to conduct an investigation on its own motion which may result in the termination, demotion, or similar adverse effect on an employee absent any written complaint filed with the commission; it would appear contrary to the aim of the civil service statutes and to the functions and purposes of the commission for the commission itself to initiate investigations of employment decisions which could ultimately result in terminations or demotions of employees currently holding positions which are afforded the protections of the civil service system.
   Perkins, June 26, 1998, A.G. Op. #98-0274.
      </p>
      <p>
       A municipal civil service commission would have no authority with regard to benefits to be provided to municipal employees by the governing authority. Bowman, Feb. 7, 2003, A.G. Op. #03-0771.
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   The Chief of Police must be included in the civil service system of the city of Ocean Springs because the more specific provisions of Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t21c31s21-31-13" target="_self">21-31-13</a></cite>, concerning civil service systems in a handful of described municipalities, control over the more general provisions of Miss.

       There are two separate civil service systems: one system applies only to full paid employees of fire and police departments, and other system applies only to administrative and other municipal employees on monthly salary.

       City’s fire chief could appoint supervisory personnel above district fire chief level under civil service statute without open and competitive examination and impartial investigation, where city’s civil service commission and mayor would still have to approve appointees, and commission would have option of opening noncompetitive appointment to include other eligible candidates.

       Civil service statutes were enacted to afford state and municipal employees with reasonable job security by protecting them from political considerations and partisanship. Chandler v. City of Jackson Civil Serv. Comm'n, 687 So. 2d 142, 1997 Miss. LEXIS 1 (Miss. 1997).

       A 16-year veteran police officer, who had vested permanent employment rights under the civil service laws, resigned on his own volition and was not “constructively discharged” where he obtained legal counsel when he became aware that he was the object of an investigation and resigned his job on his attorney’s advice. Thus, he could not thereafter pursue an untimely claim that he was denied procedural due process. In order to ensure that a civil service employee preserves his or her procedural due process guarantees, he or she should “stay the course” and remain with the job until relieved from the assignment by an official with statutory authority to fire. While the work environment could become the source of some irritation or embarrassment, such embarrassment will usually afford the civil servant nothing in the way of a procedural due process claim after a voluntary resignation. The instances will be few when a claim of constructive discharge will preserve procedural guarantees that the employee has waived by resigning. The wisdom of “staying the course” is especially crucial in light of state law which deems civil service administrative remedies as the exclusive remedy before relief can be sought in state court. Bulloch v. Pascagoula, 574 So. 2d 637, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 798 (Miss. 1990).

       Civil Service System established by Section 21-31-1 et seq. is mandatory only for fire and police departments of municipalities designated in statute; however, municipalities have option of extending civil service coverage to all full time employees; if city extends civil service protection to all full time employees municipal personnel matters fall squarely under provisions of statutes and cases governing civil service coverage and protection and employee who has coverage under civil service laws is limited to exclusive remedy provided by civil service laws.

      </p>
      <p>
       Only full paid employees of the fire and police departments are mandatorily included within civil service coverage, but other full time employees may be extended coverage in the discretion of the governing authorities with the approval of the Civil Service Commission upon adoption of a proper ordinance. Stafford, March 27, 1998, A.G. Op. #98-0160.
      </p>

       <p>
   Where the governing authorities and the civil service commission cannot agree on the scope of coverage for full-time positions (other than those mandated by statute), the initial determination of which full-time positions should be included or excluded from civil service coverage is within the discretionary authority of the municipal governing authorities, consistent with the provisions of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t21c31s21-31-1" target="_self">21-31-1</a></cite> et seq. and the statutes governing code-charter municipalities; thus, the governing authorities of a city as a matter of policy may determine that certain full-time positions within the municipal government should fall within coverage of the civil service system, and may also determine that other positions are best left subject to the general statutory provisions governing appointed employees in code-charter municipalities.

       A city ordinance which required members of fire and police departments and other civil service employees to maintain their domicile and place of residence within the corporate limits of the city, was not in conflict with a state statute requiring civil service applicants to be citizens of the United States and electors of the county in which they reside, with 3 years’ residence, but was instead an additional regulation within the power of municipalities operating under the commission form of government by virtue of statutes authorizing such municipalities to make necessary rules and regulations for the government of the officers and employees of the city and for the efficient and economical conduct of the city’s business.

   Statutory pretermination procedures for nonprobationary municipal civil service employees do not contain adequate due process safeguards to be followed when discharging, suspending, or demoting covered municipal employees, whose right of continued employment is a property right. Thus, risk reducing procedures must be accorded such employees, including pretermination written notice of the reasons for termination and an effective opportunity to rebut such reasons, the right to respond in writing to the charges made and to respond orally before the official charged with the responsibility of making the termination decision, a written decision on the response of the employee at the earliest practicable date, and, although not required, examination of witnesses, trial or hearing, in the discretion of the responsible official.

       Police chief had substantial evidence to be concerned that a police officer had been conducting quasi-police investigations while off-duty and intoxicated. Although the officer was correct that there was no evidence that he was intoxicated on the night in question, the lack of evidence was based almost entirely on the fact that the officer avoided all of the police chief’s attempts to resolve the question. Renfro v. City of Moss Point, 156 So.3d 913, 2014 Miss. App. LEXIS 432 (Miss. Ct. App. 2014), cert. denied, 154 So.3d 33, 2015 Miss. LEXIS 61 (Miss. 2015).

      <p>
       In a case in which a police officer appealed his termination for insubordination, the police chief had substantial reason to suspect that the officer had been conducting quasi-police surveillance while off-duty and intoxicated. There was evidence that the officer avoided the chief’s attempts to confirm his suspicion, as well as evidence that the officer was insubordinate in that the officer was argumentative, adversarial, and combative regarding another officer’s attempts to administer a portable breath test and ask questions on the chief’s behalf. Renfro v. City of Moss Point, 156 So.3d 913, 2014 Miss. App. LEXIS 432 (Miss. Ct. App. 2014), cert. denied, 154 So.3d 33, 2015 Miss. LEXIS 61 (Miss. 2015).

       Although a trial court had not erred when it held that a city was not liable for the acts of two police officers during and after an arrest of an African American male because the officers had acted beyond the scope of their employment, the court erred when it found the city liable because it had negligently supervised the officers. There was not a scintilla of evidence presented to indicate that the city had any policy which encouraged the type of activity that the officers engaged in and there was no factual support for the factual holding that the city was deliberately indifferent to the rights of African Americans.

       § 21-31-23.
    Removal, suspension, demotion, and discharge.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      No person in the classified civil service who shall have been permanently appointed or inducted into civil service under the provisions of Sections 21-31-1 through 21-31-27, except for such persons as may be employed to fill a vacancy caused by the absence of a fireman or policeman while in service as a member of the armed forces of the United States, shall be removed, suspended, demoted or discharged, or any combination thereof, except for cause, and only upon the written accusation of the appointing power or any citizen or taxpayer, a written statement of which accusation, in general terms, shall be served upon the accused, and a duplicate filed with the commission. The chiefs of the fire and/or police department may suspend a member pending the confirmation of the suspension by the regular appointing power, which shall be within three (3) days.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the absence of extraordinary circumstances or situations, before any such employee may be removed or discharged, he shall be given written notice of the intended termination, which notice shall state the reasons for termination and inform the employee that he has the right to respond in writing to the reasons given for termination within a reasonable time and respond orally before the official charged with the responsibility of making the termination decision. Such official may, in his discretion, provide for a pretermination hearing and examination of witnesses, and if a hearing is to be held, the notice to the employee shall also set the time and place of such hearing. A duplicate of such notice shall be filed with the commission. After the employee has responded or has failed to respond within a reasonable time, the official charged with the responsibility of making the termination decision shall determine the appropriate disciplinary action, and shall notify the employee of his decision in writing at the earliest practicable date.
     </p>
     <p>
      Where there are extraordinary circumstances or situations which require the immediate discharge or removal of an employee, such employee may be terminated without a pretermination hearing as required by this section, but such employee shall be given written notice of the specific reasons for termination within twenty-four (24) hours after the termination, and shall be given an opportunity for a hearing similar to the pretermination hearing provided in this section within twenty (20) days after the date of termination. For the purposes of this section, extraordinary situations or circumstances include, but are not limited to, circumstances where retention of the employee would result in damage to municipal property, would be detrimental to the interest of municipal government or would result in injury to the employee, to a fellow employee or to the general public.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any person so removed, suspended, demoted, discharged or combination thereof may, within ten (10) days from the time of such disciplinary action, file with the commission a written demand for an investigation, whereupon the commission shall conduct such investigation. The investigation shall be confined to the determination of the question of whether such disciplinary action was or was not made for political or religious reasons and was or was not made in good faith for cause. After such investigation the commission may, if in its estimation the evidence is conclusive, affirm the disciplinary action, or if it shall find that the disciplinary action was made for political or religious reasons, or was not made in good faith for cause, shall order the immediate reinstatement or reemployment of such person in the office, place, position, or employment from which such person was removed, suspended, demoted, discharged or combination thereof, which reinstatement shall, if the commission so provides in its discretion, be retroactive, and entitle such person to pay or compensation from the time of such disciplinary action. The commission upon such investigation may, in lieu of affirming the disciplinary action, modify the order of removal, suspension, demotion, discharge or combination thereof by directing a suspension, without pay, for a given period and subsequent restoration of duty, or by directing a demotion in classification, grade or pay, or by any combination thereof. The findings of the commission shall be certified in writing to the appointing power, and shall be forthwith enforced by such officer.
     </p>
     <p>
      All investigations made by the commission pursuant to the provisions of this section shall be by public hearing, after reasonable written notice to the accused of the time and place of such hearing, at which hearing the accused shall be afforded an opportunity of appearing in person and by counsel, and presenting his defense. The findings of the commission shall be conclusive and binding unless either the accused or the municipality shall, within thirty (30) days from the date of the entry of such judgment or order on the minutes of the commission and notification to the accused and the municipality, appeal to the circuit court of the county within which the municipality is located. Any appeal of the judgment or order of the commission shall not act as a supersedeas of such judgment or order, but the judgment or order shall remain in effect pending a final determination of the matter on appeal. Such appeal shall be taken by serving the commission and the appellee, within thirty (30) days after the entry of such judgment or order, a written notice of appeal, stating the grounds thereof, and demanding that a certified transcript of the record and of all papers on file in the office of the commission affecting or relating to such judgment or order, be filed by the commission with such court. The commission shall, within thirty (30) days after the filing of such notice, make, certify and file such transcript with such court. The said circuit court shall thereupon proceed to hear and determine such appeal. However, such hearing shall be confined to the determination of whether the judgment or order of removal, discharge, demotion, suspension or combination thereof made by the commission, was or was not made in good faith for cause, and no appeal to such court shall be taken except upon such ground or grounds.

       Sheriff’s department claimed that the officer violated policy by being off-duty, having his minor child in his vehicle, and interacting with a citizen based on a minor traffic violation; while the officer was not the exact officer who arrested the citizen, he pursued her, flashed his badge at her, and directed her, and this evidence supported the decision to find the department terminated the officer in good faith. Chavis v. Jackson Cty. Sheriff's Dep't, — So.3d —, 2019 Miss. App. LEXIS 207 (Miss. Ct. App. May 14, 2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       Officer was not denied proper due process, as he was afforded the opportunity to appeal his termination to the civil service commission for a full hearing, which he exercised and received, and at the hearing, he put on evidence and was able to rebut the charges against him. Chavis v. Jackson Cty. Sheriff's Dep't, — So.3d —, 2019 Miss. App. LEXIS 207 (Miss. Ct. App. May 14, 2019).

      <p>
       Officer was terminated without a pretermination hearing, but he was given a written notice of the specific reasons for his termination within 24 hours and was given instructions on how to receive a post-termination hearing, which he exercised; thus, his claim that the circuit court erred in finding that the sheriff department’s failure to provide him with a pre-termination hearing did not violate his rights had no merit.

      <p>
       Termination of deputy sheriff and the denial of the deputy sheriff’s request for reinstatement was not arbitrary or capricious and was supported by substantial evidence because there was credible evidence that the deputy sheriff left the State of Mississippi in the midst of an emergency situation after a hurricane made landfall without first obtaining permission from an appropriate person in the sheriff’s department. This offense subjected the deputy sheriff to termination under the rules of the sheriff’s department. Phillips v. Hancock County Sheriff's Dep't, 203 So.3d 622, 2016 Miss. App. LEXIS 585 (Miss. Ct.

   Because the employee did not request a hearing on his demotion and termination, making his transfer an issue, until March 15, 2000, more than 10 days after the transfer, the Hancock County Sheriff’s Department’s Civil Service Commission did not have to consider the issue.

      <p>
       A 16-year veteran police officer, who had vested permanent employment rights under the civil service laws, resigned on his own volition and was not “constructively discharged” where he obtained legal counsel when he became aware that he was the object of an investigation and resigned his job on his attorney’s advice. Thus, he could not thereafter pursue an untimely claim that he was denied procedural due process. In order to ensure that a civil service employee preserves his or her procedural due process guarantees, he or she should “stay the course” and remain with the job until relieved from the assignment by an official with statutory authority to fire. While the work environment could become the source of some irritation or embarrassment, such embarrassment will usually afford the civil servant nothing in the way of a procedural due process claim after a voluntary resignation. The instances will be few when a claim of constructive discharge will preserve procedural guarantees that the employee has waived by resigning. The wisdom of “staying the course” is especially crucial in light of state law which deems civil service administrative remedies as the exclusive remedy before relief can be sought in state court. Bulloch v. Pascagoula, 574 So. 2d 637, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 798 (Miss. 1990).

      <p>
       Where an employee had turned in his fireman’s cap upon being suspended for misconduct and was leaving the premises when a controversy arose between him and his superior, his acts and conduct in such controversy subsequent to his suspension by the fire chief were properly made a basis of a verdict against the employee, in view of the fact that he was not discharged by the city manager until two days thereafter.

       Evidence, including a showing that city pound keeper did not take orders from the police chief or anyone else in the police department, did not make a policeman’s bond, was not a member of the Disability and Relief Fund for firemen and policemen, but on the contrary, was a member of the Mississippi Public Employees’ Retirement System, amply supported Civil Service Commission’s finding that pound keeper was not a member of the police department, and, therefore, was not entitled to other employment in the police department upon abolition of the office of pound keeper.

       Abolition of the position of assistant fire chief, while within the power of the mayor and commissioners, does not automatically remove the holder of that position from service in the city’s fire department and, where his services have been satisfactory over a period of years, he is entitled to hold a newly created captaincy which includes the duties of assistant fire chief, and, if he does not desire that position, he can apply for another, his right to such other position to be determined by the mayor and commissioners giving due consideration to his and other municipal employees’ seniority rights and length of service, which determination is subject to review by the Civil Service Commission.

       Where the civil service commission ordered a city to reinstate a police officer immediately but not retroactively, the commission’s denial of the officer’s request for back pay was not an abuse of discretion because the delay in the adjudication of the civil service hearing was caused by the employee’s actions and the employee had engaged in misconduct that was not serious enough to warrant termination.

       Police officer, who was terminated from the officer’s position with a city’s police department upon a finding of good cause, was not denied due process in the disciplinary process because the officer was given written notice of the intended termination, reasons for the termination, and an opportunity to respond. Moreover, the officer was allowed to file an appeal with the city’s civil service commission after the disciplinary action was taken. Weeks v. City of Biloxi, 220 So.3d 266, 2017 Miss.

       In a case in which a city employee appealed the affirmation of a decision by a city civil service commission to suspend him for three days without pay for using profanity on a city radio, sufficient evidence was presented for the commission to find that it was the employee’s inappropriate comment over a city radio, and not other factors such as disagreements with his supervisor, or his religious or political beliefs, that led to the suspension.

       Trial court erred in finding that a police officer’s suspension was “implicitly affirmed” by a civil service commission because the suspension was not appealed to the commission as required by law; because the only disciplinary action that the officer appealed was the officer’s termination, the trial court was strictly confined to a determination of whether the termination was made in good faith for cause.

       Where a city discharged an employee for directing a police dog towards a suspect who was resisting arrest, the civil service commission properly reinstated the employee because the testimony of the arresting officer and the police department’s policies substantially supported the commission’s finding that the use of the dog was not excessive force.

       Police officer was not denied his procedural due process rights in regard to his suspension or termination; the officer was given the proper notice of the charges against him, the Civil Service Commission’s finding that the officer’s termination was for good cause was made in good faith and was supported by substantial evidence, and the Commission used the correct standard of review in deciding to affirm the officer’s termination.

The police officers should have sought an order compelling the Commission to file the record or to otherwise show cause for its continued procrastination, and the officers, rather than the police department, would be held ultimately responsible for the filing of the transcript with the circuit court.

       The trial court erred in setting aside an order of the Civil Service Commission that a former fireman who had transferred to another position following a back injury was a “fire alarm operator” rather than a “firefighter,” and further erred in ordering a new classification of the employee as a “fireman,” where the Commission’s action was taken in good faith for cause, was supported by substantial evidence, and was not arbitrary, unreasonable, confiscatory, or capricious.

   Although a discharged police officer was denied due process in that the dismissal decision was made one day before the time for his response to the charges expired, the dismissed police officer waived this issue by not raising it before the Civil Service Commission prior to his full evidentiary hearing and he was thus precluded from challenging the pretermination procedure on appeal.

   Statutory pretermination procedures for nonprobationary municipal civil service employees do not contain adequate due process safeguards to be followed when discharging, suspending, or demoting covered municipal employees, whose right of continued employment is a property right. Thus, risk reducing procedures must be accorded such employees, including pretermination written notice of the reasons for termination and an effective opportunity to rebut such reasons, the right to respond in writing to the charges made and to respond orally before the official charged with the responsibility of making the termination decision, a written decision on the response of the employee at the earliest practicable date, and, although not required, examination of witnesses, trial or hearing, in the discretion of the responsible official.

       The dismissal of a police officer for withholding specific items of evidence on three different occasions would be upheld where the record reflected that the police officer had been given a full, fair and impartial hearing before the civil service commission and a careful appellate review by the circuit court, all in accord with the provisions of this section.

       Upon an appeal from an action of the Board of Civil Service Commission, which in a two to one vote, had upheld the dismissal of a policeman by the city manager as being in good faith for cause and not for political or religious reasons, the circuit judge did not err in refusing the patrolman a jury trial to impeach the commission’s verdict, since the proposed testimony as to the alleged admission of the two commissioners who had voted to affirm the city manager’s action would have been incompetent for that purpose.

       Substantial evidence supported a civil service commission’s decision to suspend and demote a police officer because the evidence showed the officer (1) violated city policies on the personal use of city assets and use of city vehicles, and (2) created an atmosphere of distrust among fellow officers and damaged department morale.

       Order demoting a police officer from captain to lieutenant after the officer failed to comply with a readiness inspection was upheld where substantial evidence existed to support the finding that the demotion was made in good faith for cause and was not based on political or religious reasons; there was no evidence that the demotion was retaliatory.

       <p>
   Even if the fired police officer had properly raised the recusal issue of a decision of the municipality’s civil service commission to the circuit court sitting as an appellate court, that issue would probably still have been procedurally improper pursuant to the limited scope of review established under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t21c31s21-31-23" target="_self">21-31-23</a></cite>. City of Vicksburg v. Cooper, 909 So. 2d 126, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 550 (Miss. Ct. App. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Terminated police officer had requested the civil service commissioner’s recusal because she served as a pastor or evangelist at the church attended by the city police chief. Even though the appellate court tended to agree with the circuit court’s conclusion, it held the issue was procedurally barred since the officer had failed to raise the issue on appeal to the circuit court; moreover, since the circuit court based its judgment solely on the issue of the commissioner’s recusal (she did not recuse herself), the other issues raised by the city, primarily the grounds for termination of the officer, were not ripe for consideration and a remand was required.

      </p>
      <p>
       The scope of review of the circuit court and of the Supreme Court as to the removal of a civil service employee is limited. It is not what the court, had it been a member of the governing authority, might have done in a particular instance, or whether or not the court thinks a mistake may have been made, but instead the criterion is whether or not from an examination of the record there exists credible evidence substantiating the action taken by the governing authority. It is upon this basis that the court determines whether or not the decision was in “good faith for cause.” Courts are not empowered to supervise the intelligence, wisdom or fairness of the governing authorities, and no resources are available to a court to exercise such a function even if granted, in the extremely difficult task of determining the fitness of a particular person for a particular job. It is only when the record makes it clear the there is no “substantial evidence” supporting the governing authorities’ determination that a court can and must act. City of Jackson v. Froshour, 530 So. 2d 1348, 1988 Miss. LEXIS 417 (Miss. 1988).

      <p>
       On appeal to the circuit court from the findings of Civil Service Commission that city pound keeper was not a member of the police department and that his job had not been abolished for political or religious reasons, but was done in good faith, the scope of the review by the circuit court was to determine whether the order of the Civil Service Commission was supported by substantial evidence. City of Hattiesburg v. Jackson, 235 Miss. 109, 108 So. 2d 596, 1959 Miss. LEXIS 409 (Miss. 1959).
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the governing bodies of municipalities have power under the code to organize, operate, maintain and regulate fire departments, and have wide discretion in exercising their administrative and executive duties, including the transferring of employees of the fire department from one post to another, the Civil Service Act properly limits the review of such actions by the commission and the courts to whether they are taken in good faith for cause. Accordingly, a fire captain, transferred to another fire station, was not entitled to injunctive relief against the city in view of his plain, adequate and complete remedy by appeal under the Civil Service Act. Scott v. Lowe, 223 Miss. 312, 78 So. 2d 452, 1955 Miss. LEXIS 382 (Miss. 1955).

      </p>
      <p>
       This statute [Code 1942, § 3825-11] is not unconstitutional in providing for a trial de novo on appeal from the determination of the commission in the circuit court by permitting the court or jury to substitute their own judgment for that of the commission when the latter has exercised purely an executive function, since the statute expressly limits the hearing in the circuit court to the determination of whether the judgment or order of the commission was made in good faith for cause and provides that no appeal to the circuit court shall be taken except upon such ground or grounds. City of Meridian v. Davidson, 211 Miss. 683, 53 So. 2d 48, 1951 Miss. LEXIS 399 (Miss. 1951).
      </p>
      <p>
       On appeal to the circuit court when the case is reviewed solely on the transcript of the record made before the commission, the question whether there is a basis in substantial evidence as to whether the judgment rendered by the commission was or was not made in good faith for cause is solely one of law and there is no function for a jury to perform.

       While the rule is that the legislature in re-enacting § 10 of ch 208 of Laws of 1944 (Code 1942, § 3825-11) in ch 503 of Laws of 1950 (Code 1942, § 3825.5-17) is presumed to have approved the interpretation which the supreme court had already given the former section with respect to the right to jury trial on appeal to the circuit court, the question is not, however, what the legislature intended to do but rather whether it had the constitutional power to confer upon the circuit court the exercise of the nonjudicial function of permitting a jury to substitute its judgment for that of an executive agency on the question presented by the appeal to the circuit court as to whether or not the finding of the executive agency had a basis in substantial evidence such as to prevent it from being one not rendered in good faith for cause.

       Where, on appeal to circuit court from an order of a city’s civil service commission fixing the rights of a fireman whose position had been abolished, no question of fact arises for the decision of a jury, the action of the court, without objection, in withdrawing the case from the jury, while perhaps irregular, is not ground for reversal and no harm resulted since the question for decision was one of law and not of fact.

   On appeal from an action of the civil service commission of a city in sustaining the dismissal of a policeman after a full hearing for statutory cause, the question to be considered by the circuit court and a jury under its direction is whether the action taken by the civil service commission was in good faith, honestly done, and upon a cause which reasonable men, acting as such a commission would reasonably say was an adequate cause.

       Municipal civil service employee could run for county office without having to resign or take leave of absence; leave of absence without pay could be granted by governing authorities provided it is done in accordance with existing municipal leave policies; if municipal employee chooses to run for office while remaining on municipal payroll, he must not engage in any campaigning during hours for which he is being paid to work for municipality.

       Under state law, a municipal civil service employee may be a candidate for political office in a municipality where he is not employed, provided he meets all qualifications to hold the office he seeks and does not campaign during hours he is being paid to perform his duties as a municipal employee; furthermore, an employee may serve in such dual capacity should he win the election, provided he continues to work the required hours exclusively for the municipality.

       A civil service commission has the discretion, through the adoption of suitable rules and regulations, to determine which positions will be subject to civil service coverage. Reynolds, May 13, 1992, A.G. Op. #92-0328.
      </p>
      <p>
       A civil service commission, pursuant to its rule making authority, may adopt a procedure whereby covered positions may be changed to non-covered positions, provided such procedure is reasonable and is consistent with pertinent statutory provisions relating to civil service coverage. Reynolds, May 13, 1992, A.G. Op. #92-0328.
      </p>
      <p>
       The power of the Civil Service Commission to enact rules under Section 21-31-9 is not expressly subject to the same restrictive language found in Section 21-31-57, requiring that all rules of the Civil Service Commission be consistent with personnel rules adopted by the governing authorities of the municipality; however, the 1994 Amendment to Section 21-31-57 merely made explicit what was already implicit in municipal law, and the detailed rules of any civil service commission may not be inconsistent with the general rules and regulations adopted by the governing authorities.

       There are two separate civil service systems: one system applies only to full paid employees of fire and police departments, and other system applies only to administrative and other municipal employees on monthly salary.

       An elected official is not covered by civil service, but unless there is a specific private charter provision or a specific statutory provision that exempts department heads from coverage, such appointed positions are covered by civil service. Reynolds, May 13, 1992, A.G. Op. #92-0328.

      <p>
       For the purposes of Section 21-31-61, administrative employees would be those who execute the orders and ordinances of the policy-making body of the municipality, which is the city council. No authority can be found for a municipal governing authority to create a “public office” that is not otherwise provided for by law. Kohnke, Feb. 24, 2006, A.G. Op. 06-0045.

       § 21-31-71.
    Removal, suspension, demotion, and discharge.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      No person in the classified civil service who shall have been permanently appointed or inducted into civil service under the provisions of Sections 21-31-51 through 21-31-75 shall be removed, suspended, demoted or discharged, or any combination thereof, except for cause, and only upon the written accusation of the appointing power or any citizen or taxpayer, a written statement of which accusation, in general terms, shall be served upon the accused, and a duplicate filed with the commission. The mayor may suspend a member pending the confirmation of the suspension by the regular appointing power, which shall be within three (3) days.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the absence of extraordinary circumstances or situations, before any such employee may be removed or discharged, he shall be given written notice of the intended termination, which notice shall state the reasons for termination and inform the employee that he has the right to respond in writing to the reasons given for termination within a reasonable time and respond orally before the official charged with the responsibility of making the termination decision. Such official may, in his discretion, provide for a pretermination hearing and examination of witnesses, and if a hearing is to be held, the notice to the employee shall also set the time and place of such hearing. A duplicate of such notice shall be filed with the commission. After the employee has responded or has failed to respond within a reasonable time, the official charged with the responsibility of making the termination decision shall determine the appropriate disciplinary action, and shall notify the employee of his decision in writing at the earliest practicable date.
     </p>
     <p>
      Where there are extraordinary circumstances or situations which require the immediate discharge or removal of an employee, such employee may be terminated without a pretermination hearing as required by this section, but such employee shall be given written notice of the specific reasons for termination within twenty-four (24) hours after the termination, and shall be given an opportunity for a hearing similar to the pretermination hearing provided in this section within twenty (20) days after the date of termination. For the purposes of this section, extraordinary situations or circumstances include, but are not limited to, circumstances where retention of the employee would result in damage to municipal property, would be detrimental to the interest of municipal government or would result in injury to the employee, to a fellow employee or to the general public.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any person so removed, suspended, demoted, discharged or combination thereof may, within ten (10) days from the time of such disciplinary action, file with the commission a written demand for an investigation, whereupon the commission shall conduct such investigation. The investigation shall be confined to the determination of the question of whether such disciplinary action was or was not made for political or religious reasons and was or was not made in good faith for cause. After such investigation the commission may, if in its estimation the evidence is conclusive, affirm the disciplinary action, or if it shall find that the disciplinary action was made for political or religious reasons, or was not made in good faith for cause, shall order the immediate reinstatement or reemployment of such person in the office, place, position or employment from which such person was removed, suspended, demoted, discharged or combination thereof, which reinstatement shall, if the commission so provides in its discretion, be retroactive, and entitle such person to pay or compensation from the time of such disciplinary action. The commission upon such investigation may, in lieu of affirming the disciplinary action, modify the order of removal, suspension, demotion, discharge or combination thereof by directing a suspension, without pay, for a given period and subsequent restoration of duty, or by directing a demotion in classification, grade or pay, or by any combination thereof. The findings of the commission shall be certified in writing to the appointing power, and shall be forthwith enforced by such officer.
     </p>
     <p>
      All investigations made by the commission pursuant to the provisions of this section shall be by public hearing, after reasonable written notice to the accused of the time and place of such hearing, at which hearing the accused shall be afforded an opportunity of appearing in person and by counsel, and presenting his defense. The findings of the commission shall be conclusive and binding unless either the accused or the municipality shall, within thirty (30) days from the date of the entry of such judgment or order on the minutes of the commission and notification to the accused and the municipality, appeal to the circuit court of the county within which the municipality is located. Any appeal of the judgment or order of the commission shall not act as a supersedeas of such judgment or order, but the judgment or order shall remain in effect pending a final determination of the matter on appeal. Such appeal shall be taken by serving the commission and the appellee, within thirty (30) days after the entry of such judgment or order, a written notice of appeal, stating the grounds thereof, and demanding that a certified transcript of the record and of all papers on file in the office of the commission affecting or relating to such judgment or order, be filed by the commission with such court. The commission shall, within thirty (30) days after the filing of such notice, make, certify and file such transcript with such court. The said circuit court shall thereupon proceed to hear and determine such appeal. However, such hearing shall be confined to the determination of whether the judgment or order of removal, discharge, demotion, suspension or combination thereof made by the commission, was or was not made in good faith for cause, and no appeal to such court shall be taken except upon such ground or grounds.

       The scope of review of the circuit court and of the Supreme Court as to the removal of a civil service employee is limited. It is not what the court, had it been a member of the governing authority, might have done in a particular instance, or whether or not the court thinks a mistake may have been made, but instead the criterion is whether or not from an examination of the record there exists credible evidence substantiating the action taken by the governing authority. It is upon this basis that the court determines whether or not the decision was in “good faith for cause.” Courts are not empowered to supervise the intelligence, wisdom or fairness of the governing authorities, and no resources are available to a court to exercise such a function even if granted, in the extremely difficult task of determining the fitness of a particular person for a particular job. It is only when the record makes it clear the there is no “substantial evidence” supporting the governing authorities’ determination that a court can and must act. Mississippi State Highway Com. v. Robertson, 350 So. 2d 1348, 1977 Miss. LEXIS 2247 (Miss. 1977).

      <p>
       As far as the municipality is concerned, the municipal civil service commission’s decision is final and not subject to appeal, so that a city, mayor, and chief of police could not appeal from a civil service commission order directing the reinstatement of a policeman determined to have been discharged without cause. City of Jackson v. Little, 245 So. 2d 204, 1971 Miss. LEXIS 1364 (Miss. 1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a clerk typist employed by a city police department allegedly stated in the presence of two city police officers that “Captain 724’s wife was a whore prior to the time she married Captain 724.” and had made a similar statement to another police officer on the same force, there was substantial evidence to support her discharge by the chief of police and the commission’s order affirming that action, and the fact that the city civil service commission’s order affirming the discharge did not specifically state that the discharge was “in good faith for cause” did not render the order insufficient. City of Jackson Police Dep't v. Ruddick, 243 So. 2d 566, 1971 Miss. LEXIS 1521 (Miss. 1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that a police captain’s wife’s complaint about alleged statements made about her by a police department clerk typist was not in writing was insignificant, where written complaint about the clerk typist’s conduct was made by the chief of police who was the appointing authority and the one who subsequently discharged the typist under the Municipal Civil Service Act. City of Jackson Police Dep't v. Ruddick, 243 So. 2d 566, 1971 Miss. LEXIS 1521 (Miss. 1971).

       Where a policeman was removed from his job for taking money from parking meter on the city streets and where he did not within ten days make a written demand from the Civil Service Board for an investigation and a hearing, the policeman could not later obtain a review of legality of his removal by bill in chancery court, since he did not bring himself within the exclusive procedure for review. Tennant v. Finane, 227 Miss. 410, 86 So. 2d 453, 1956 Miss. LEXIS 704 (Miss. 1956).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a policeman was seeking review of removal from city employment, although the demurrer admitted that the policeman had not received a written accusation of the reasons for his removal, the policeman’s exclusive remedy was still statutory. Tennant v. Finane, 227 Miss. 410, 86 So. 2d 453, 1956 Miss. LEXIS 704 (Miss. 1956).

       Phrase “represent candidate” necessarily precludes civil servant from becoming candidate, as he would then be representing himself, for purposes of statute prohibiting civil service employee from engaging in any political campaign as representative of any candidate. Bullock v. Mississippi Empl. Sec. Comm'n, 697 So. 2d 1147, 1997 Miss. LEXIS 167 (Miss. 1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       Preclearance provisions of Voting Rights Act, requiring preclearance before enforcement of any rules affecting voting rights of citizens, were not applicable to state statutes which were enacted prior to Act; preclearance provisions were not to be applied retroactively. Bullock v. Mississippi Empl. Sec. Comm'n, 697 So. 2d 1147, 1997 Miss. LEXIS 167 (Miss. 1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       Statute prohibiting civil service employee from engaging in any political campaign as representative of any candidate authorized mayor to fire city administrative employee once he qualified as candidate for municipal elective office. Bullock v. Mississippi Empl. Sec. Comm'n, 697 So. 2d 1147, 1997 Miss. LEXIS 167 (Miss. 1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       Legislature’s intent throughout statute governing political services and contributions is to protect civil service employees, who by nature of their employment are subordinates to elected officials, from being pressured to contribute to any political campaign; reasonable interpretation of this legislative intent prohibits employee from running for office, as well as representing political candidate. Bullock v. Mississippi Empl. Sec. Comm'n, 697 So. 2d 1147, 1997 Miss. LEXIS 167 (Miss. 1997).

       City administrative employee who was discharged, pursuant to statute, after having qualified as candidate for municipal elective office was not entitled to unemployment benefits. Bullock v. Mississippi Empl. Sec. Comm'n, 697 So. 2d 1147, 1997 Miss. LEXIS 167 (Miss. 1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       City employee who was discharged after he qualified as candidate for municipal elective office did not have standing to raise claim that statute prohibiting civil service employee from engaging in political campaign as representative of candidate was unconstitutionally over broad since it encompassed candidates in any city, county, state, or federal election; employee did not argue that statute was unconstitutional as applied to him, but that it might be unconstitutional in other circumstances not involving municipal election. Bullock v. Mississippi Empl. Sec. Comm'n, 697 So. 2d 1147, 1997 Miss. LEXIS 167 (Miss. 1997).

     </h3>
     <p>
      The state tax commission shall annually prepare forms for the personal property assessment rolls, and each two years, or annually as required, prepare forms for the real property assessment rolls. The forms so prescribed shall be printed, ruled, and headed as to be suitable for their respective purposes and to enable the municipal officers to comply with the tax laws of this state applicable to municipalities. A sample of the forms for the real and personal assessment rolls shall be sent by mail to the mayor and to the clerk of every municipality not later than the first day of October of each year.
     </p>
     <p>
      The forms shall be so made that the respective municipalities may require such additional information, make such additions and add such further details as permitted by Sections 21-33-1 through 21-33-85, but the general and basic arrangement of such forms shall not be changed.
     </p>
     <p>
      The municipal authorities shall furnish their respective officers with a sufficient quantity of each of said forms, and may purchase the same or have them printed, as provided by law.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is the purpose of this section that municipal forms relating to assessment and taxes be generally uniform throughout the state.

    Form of land assessment roll.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The governing authorities of each municipality shall prescribe by order the form of the land assessment roll, adhering to the basic form prescribed by the state tax commission which shall be similar to the form prescribed for and used by county tax assessors for the assessment of municipal lands. When a municipality has added territory, the roll used for the assessment of lands in such added territory shall be generally in the form of the roll used in the assessment of such lands by the county, and be on sheets of the same size.
     </p>
     <p>
      The land roll shall contain space or columns for the name of the owner, for the name of the subdivision, survey or addition, for block and lot numbers and, if required, for the section, township and range. It shall contain a column to show the value of any buildings, structures or improvements, and separately a column to show the value of the lands, and the total value.
     </p>
     <p>
      In addition to the columns above specified, the governing authorities may provide columns to show the number of the tax receipt, the amount of ad valorem taxes collected, and the amounts collected for any special improvement or improvements.
     </p>
     <p>
      Municipalities using accounting machines equipment may adopt such forms as may be required for the use of such equipment, provided that the information required herein is substantially set forth on said forms.

       § 21-33-9.
    Manner of municipal assessment.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The assessment of all real and personal property in any municipality subject to taxation, except such property as is required by law to be assessed by the state railroad assessors, shall be made by the municipal assessor, by one (1) of the following methods:
     </p>
     <p>
      The governing authorities of any municipality may provide that the assessor shall copy from the county assessment rolls of real and personal property, that portion of the assessment rolls which embraces property, or persons, within the municipality. The copy may be made at any time after the county assessment rolls are filed with the clerk of the board of supervisors, by the county tax assessor.
     </p>
     <p>
      The governing authorities of any municipality may provide for a separate assessment to be made each year, by its assessor, of all taxable personal property, and each year, or each two (2) years, of all taxable real property, including buildings, improvements, structures or other interests therein.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the governing authorities provide for a separate assessment by the assessor, as provided by paragraph (b) above, the assessor shall use tax lists for both real and personal property generally the same as the tax lists prescribed for county assessors.
     </p>
     <p>
      Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) to the contrary, the governing authorities of any municipality which is located within a county having completed a countywide reappraisal approved by the state tax commission and which has been furnished a true copy of that part of the county assessment roll containing the property located within the municipality as provided in Section 27-35-167 shall adopt such assessment roll for its assessment purposes.

He shall copy the assessed value per mile of each company over any railroad or railroads, operating through such municipality and separate, adjacent, annexed territory, and shall determine the assessment of each company by multiplying the valuation of each company apportioned to each mile of railroad by the number of miles of railroad over which the cars of any such company have traveled lying in such municipality or separate, adjacent, annexed territory. The assessment so determined, plus the value of any other property assessed, shall constitute the assessment of the property of the respective companies within the municipality and in the separate, adjacent, annexed territory constituting a separate school district.

       § 21-33-45.
    Levy of municipal ad valorem taxes.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The governing authorities of each municipality of this state shall, either at their regular meeting in September of each year or not later than ten (10) days after the final approval of the assessment rolls, levy the municipal ad valorem taxes for the fiscal year next succeeding, and shall, by resolution, fix the tax rate or levy for the municipality and for any other taxing districts of which the municipality may be a part. The rates or levies for the municipality or for any such taxing district shall be expressed in mills or a decimal fraction of a mill, which tax rates, or levies, shall determine the ad valorem taxes to be collected upon each dollar of valuation upon the assessment rolls of the municipality for municipal taxes, and to be collected upon each dollar of valuation as shown upon the assessment rolls of the municipality for each such taxing district, except as to such values as may be exempt, in whole or in part, from certain tax rates or levies. If the rates or levies for the municipality or taxing district are an increase from the previous fiscal year, then the proposed rate or levy increase shall be advertised in accordance with Section 27-39-203.
     </p>
     <p>
      In making the levy of taxes, the governing authorities shall specify in such resolution the levy for each purpose as follows:
     </p>
     <p>
      For general revenue purposes and for general improvements, as authorized by Section 27-39-307.
     </p>
     <p>
      For school purposes, including all maintenance levies, whether made against the property within such municipality, or within any taxing district embraced in such municipality, as authorized by Section 27-39-307 and Section 37-57-3 et seq.
     </p>
     <p>
      For municipal bonds and interest thereon, for school bonds and interest thereon, separately for municipal-wide bonds and for the bonds of each school district.
     </p>
     <p>
      For municipal-wide bonds and interest thereon, other than for school bonds.
     </p>
     <p>
      For loans, notes or any other obligation, and the interest thereon, if permitted by law.
     </p>
     <p>
      For special improvement or special benefit levies, as now authorized by law.
     </p>
     <p>
      For any other purpose for which a levy is lawfully made. If any municipal-wide levy is made for any general or special purpose under the provisions of any law other than Section 27-39-307 each such levy shall be separately stated in the resolution, and the law authorizing same shall be expressly stated therein.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the governing authorities of any municipality shall not levy the municipal taxes and the district taxes at its regular September meeting, such governing authorities shall levy the same at an adjourned or special meeting not later than ten (10) days after the final approval of the assessment rolls. However, that if such levy be not made on or before September 15 then road and bridge privilege tax license plates may be issued by the tax collector or Department of Revenue, as the case may be, for motor vehicles as defined in the Motor Vehicle Ad Valorem Tax Law of 1958 (Section 27-51-1 et seq.), without collecting or requiring proof of payment of municipal ad valorem taxes until such levy is duly certified to him, and for twenty-four (24) hours thereafter.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the case of a municipality operating under a special or private charter providing for or authorizing the assessment, levying and collection of ad valorem taxes prior to October in each year, ad valorem taxes for such municipality shall be levied at the time prescribed or authorized by such special or private charter, unless the governing authority of such municipality by resolution adopted and spread of record in its minutes elect to levy ad valorem taxes at the time prescribed hereinbefore in this section. In any event, however, all ad valorem taxes levied by any municipality in this state, shall be levied in the manner required herein regardless of the time when such taxes are levied.

        Such tax receipts shall be prepared and printed so as to show the total assessment of the property on which the taxes are collected, together with a description of the property, the line and page of the assessment roll where the assessment is listed, and the amount, if any, shown as a home exemption, if the property be an exempt home. They shall show the rate of levy, separately for general current expenses and maintenance taxes, for school maintenance taxes, for bonds, interest, notes or other obligations, and the total tax levy, and the total amount of all taxes received.

       A municipal tax collector collects the taxes in the same manner and under the same penalties as state and county taxes are collected. Vanzandt v. Braxton, 194 Miss. 863, 14 So. 2d 222, 1943 Miss. LEXIS 114 (Miss. 1943).
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that this section [Code 1942, § 3742-31], when construed with § 3232, Code of 1930, requires the collector to receive payment of taxes in currency or state warrants, does not forbid his taking tentatively checks, and it cannot, therefore, be presumed that the collector paid into an insolvent depository bank only cash so as to establish a preference against the assets of the bank.
      </p>
      <p>
       A municipal tax collector is required to collect municipal taxes at the time and in the manner and under the penalties that the state or county collector is required to act; when suit is brought for delinquent taxes ten per cent damages are collectible when prayed for in the bill. State ex rel. Roberson v. Columbus & G. R. Co., 129 Miss. 882, 93 So. 362, 1922 Miss. LEXIS 98 (Miss. 1922).

      <p>
       Where a town marshal is also tax collector and is allowed a monthly salary as marshal and a per centum to be retained out of taxes collected and for a series of months receives his salary and pays over all taxes, this will be deemed a voluntary payment, and he cannot afterwards recover commissions.

      <p>
       A city tax collector under legal duty to pay over taxes to the treasurer is not relieved of liability on his bond for funds lost due to failure of the bank in which he has deposited them, although he had been notified by the mayor and finance committee of the city council being a majority of the council, to deposit it at the city’s risk.

       A case where it is held the tax collector is not relieved from paying taxes collected by him to the treasurer although he has lost such money by virtue of the failure of a bank in which he deposited said collections under the direction of the mayor and finance committee of the city council, which constituted a majority of the council.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The governing authorities of all municipalities in this state, including private charter municipalities, are hereby authorized and empowered to cause all taxable property, whether real or personal, within the corporate limits, and liable to taxation, which from any cause has escaped taxation within the past seven (7) years, to be assessed for taxes for each year in which such property has escaped taxation. In all cases of the assessment of property under this section, the governing authorities of any municipality ordering such assessment shall fix a day for the hearing of objections to such assessment, and shall cause the municipal clerk to give to the property owner ten (10) days’ written notice, by mail, if the post office address of the owner be known; if the post office address of the owner be unknown, notice shall be given by posting notice for at least ten (10) days in five (5) public places in the municipality, of the time and place for the hearing of objections to such assessment.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the event it be discovered that the property of any railroad, or other public service corporation required by law to be assessed by the state railroad assessors, has escaped assessment and taxation for any reason, the assessor, upon his own motion, or upon request of the governing authorities of the municipality, shall notify the state railroad assessors of such fact, and state the name of the owner and the kind of property escaping assessment and taxation. The state railroad assessors shall proceed to assess such property as provided by Section 27-35-325, Mississippi Code of 1972.
     </p>
     <p>
      No leasehold interest in any property, real or personal, belonging to the state of Mississippi, counties, districts, municipalities or any political subdivisions, shall be subjected to ad valorem taxation for any past year on the basis of it having been omitted from the ad valorem tax rolls.

     <p>
      In all cases where property situated within a municipality has been sold for delinquent taxes, if it shall afterward appear to the governing authorities of such municipality that such sale was void on account of an insufficient or erroneous description, or for other cause, the governing authorities of such municipality may, by resolution entered upon their minutes, declare such sale to be void and thereby relinquish the title or claim of the municipality acquired under or by virtue of such void sale. In such event the governing authorities of such municipality shall be authorized and empowered to cause such property to be properly and legally assessed for each of the years for which such taxes have not been paid, and shall be authorized and empowered to change, revise, correct and revalue such property for each of the years for which such taxes have not been paid, and shall be authorized and empowered to enter a proper order directing that such assessments be changed, revised and corrected, and to cause such changed, revised and corrected assessments to be entered upon the assessment roll in force for the year in which such order is entered. In all such cases notice of such change and correction in the assessment, or of such new assessment, shall be given to the property owner in the manner provided by law, and in such notice a date shall be fixed for hearing objections to such assessment. Such notice may be waived, however, by the property owner. All objections to such changes or new assessments shall be heard at the time designated therefor in such notice, and the governing authorities of such municipality shall then be authorized to enter an order approving such assessments and making the same final, and such property may be sold for such taxes, if necessary, in accordance with law.
     </p>
     <p>
      This section and Section 21-33-57 shall also apply to all cases of void sales of property for taxes, and the governing authorities, in all cases where a tax sale is void from any cause, may proceed to cause a legal sale to be made, and to cause property to be assessed in all cases after a void sale where assessment may have become necessary, and to cause sale to be made, if necessary, by complying with Sections 21-33-55 and 21-33-57.

      The owner, or any person for him with his consent, or any person interested in the land sold for taxes, shall have two years from the date of sale in which to redeem such real property from such sale, redemption to be made by paying the taxes, damages and costs, as provided by law for the redemption of land from tax sales, saving, however, to infants and persons of unsound mind, whose real property may be sold for taxes, the right to redeem the same within two years after attaining full age or being restored to sanity, from the municipality or any purchaser thereof, on the basis herein prescribed, and on their paying the value of any permanent improvements on the land made after the expiration of two years from the date of sale of the real property for taxes. Upon such payment to the clerk of the municipality, he shall execute to the person redeeming the real property a release of all claim or title of the municipality or purchaser to such real property, which said release shall be attested by the seal of the municipality, and shall be entitled to be recorded without acknowledgment, as deeds are recorded. Said release when so executed and attested shall operate as a quitclaim on the part of the municipality or purchaser of any right or title under said tax sale.

       A redeeming landowner is required to pay not only the taxes for which the land was sold but also any taxes due after the sale. Equity Services Co. v. Hamilton, 257 So. 2d 201, 1972 Miss. LEXIS 1447 (Miss. 1972).
      </p>
      <p>
       The purchaser at a municipal tax sale properly protected its interest by paying taxes as they became due, and the city tax collector was under a duty to require repayment of the money advanced by the purchaser together with statutory interest and damages from the redeeming landowner. Equity Services Co. v. Hamilton, 257 So. 2d 201, 1972 Miss. LEXIS 1447 (Miss. 1972).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a notice to owners to redeem property sold for taxes directed that redemption be made at the tax collector’s office, the property was redeemed by such payment to the city tax collector, even though this section [Code 1942, § 3742-29] requires that taxes due be paid to the city clerk. Equity Services Co. v. Hamilton, 257 So. 2d 201, 1972 Miss. LEXIS 1447 (Miss. 1972).
      </p>
      <p>
       In an action by the purchaser at a municipal tax sale to confirm tax title, where the tax sale purchaser paid taxes on the land prior to redemption, the city was not required to repay the owners taxes they paid, nor were the owners required to pay an additional sum, and the money paid by the owners for redemption belonged to the purchaser. Equity Services Co. v. Hamilton, 257 So. 2d 201, 1972 Miss. LEXIS 1447 (Miss. 1972).

       Statutes allowing land to be redeemed from tax sales are to be liberally construed in favor of the person seeking to redeem, and an owner’s offer to redeem from any and all tax sales within the redemption period, with sufficient money upon his person with which to effect such redemption, includes every form of taxes and takes away from the taxing authorities the power to convey title to anyone else pursuant to tax sales from which no redemption had actually been accomplished by reason of neglect or otherwise of the custodian of the tax sale records. James v. Tax Inv. Co., 206 Miss. 605, 40 So. 2d 539, 1949 Miss. LEXIS 287 (Miss. 1949).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where an uneducated and illiterate Negro woman appeared at the office of the chancery clerk to pay the back taxes on her property and she was informed only of the most recent tax sale and not of a previous sale for delinquent tax in a prior year, her efforts to pay all back taxes, having the money on her person with which to do so, was sufficient to effect redemption and took away from the taxing authorities the power to convey the title to her property under the first tax sale. James v. Tax Inv. Co., 206 Miss. 605, 40 So. 2d 539, 1949 Miss. LEXIS 287 (Miss. 1949).

     </h3>
     <p>
      Sales for the nonpayment of municipal taxes, both ad valorem and for special improvements, shall be made by the tax collector at such place, within the corporate limits, as the governing authorities may direct. The sale of real estate for ad valorem taxes and special improvement assessments and sale of personal property shall be made upon the same notice, at the same time, and in the same manner as provided by law for sales of like property for unpaid state and county taxes.
     </p>
     <p>
      The lists of lands sold for taxes by the municipality shall be made as required to be made by the state and county collector, and shall be filed with the municipal clerk within twenty days after the tax sale, and shall there remain, subject to redemption for the same length of time and in the same manner as prescribed for the redemption of lands sold for state and county taxes, with the same saving to infants and persons of unsound mind. Said lists shall have the same force and effect, and confer the same right and entitle the purchasers to the same remedies, as lists made for delinquent taxes by the state and county tax collector. Such title shall be subservient, however, to a title acquired under a sale for state and county taxes.
     </p>
     <p>
      One copy of the list of land so sold shall be filed within thirty days of such sale with the chancery clerk of the county in which said municipality is located, and the chancery clerk shall file and index said list among the land records of his county, as other tax sales are listed. However, the failure of the clerk so to file such list as herein prescribed shall not affect the validity of such tax sale.

      </p>
      <p>
       A city granted a charter prior to the effective date of a general statute that tax conveyances to a municipality be made by list, and whose charter provides no method by which the city should authenticate such sales, was competent to choose conveyance to the city by tax deed with the same effect as tax deeds to individuals. Hawkins v. West Point, 200 Miss. 616, 27 So. 2d 549, 1946 Miss. LEXIS 332 (Miss. 1946).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section was inapplicable to a tax sale made under a special municipal charter provision which set a different time for tax sales than that provided by § 3249, Code 1930, since under § 2623 of the Code, the ordinance controlled and not the Code section.

      </p>
      <p>
       Tax sale for delinquent municipal taxes under which municipality acquired the land in question was not void because the city tax collector did not immediately after the sale convey it to the city and deposit the deed with the city clerk to remain for two years as provided by municipal ordinance, where by statute, the list of tax sales conveyed the title to the city.

      <p>
       Under statutes making title acquired under municipal tax sale subservient to that acquired under sale for State and county taxes and giving municipality which purchased at its own sale right to redeem from State and county taxes, city could not acquire title by tax sale while property was charged with State and county taxes, and hence could not claim title as against purchaser from State because city purchased at sale for city taxes one day before State purchased at sale for State and county taxes.

      <p>
       Where land was sold to city for city taxes, including special municipal benefit assessment, and, one day later, to State for State and county taxes, and redemption period expired, city’s claim was inchoate, under statutes, and became worthless, and hence city’s foreclosure of assessment lien did not extinguish lien, but, under other statutes, lien was effective on resale by State.

       Municipality’s sale, to third person, of land which town had purchased for municipal taxes at sale held at time provided by statute, would be set aside on owner’s payment of municipal taxes, expense incurred by municipality in making sale, and money paid by municipality in redeeming property from sale to State for unpaid county and State taxes, notwithstanding that sale to third person was made on date fixed by order of mayor and board of aldermen, since municipality was without power to fix another day for sale of land not sold at time fixed by statute.

       If a city has acquired 16th Section property for the non-payment of municipal taxes, one the sale has matured, the city is the owner of the leasehold and, at that point, may pay the lease for the balance of the term of the lease, convey the leasehold to a third party, or relinquish the lease to the school board by way of settling the claim against the city for lease payments and avoiding liability therefore. Myers, January 16, 1997, A.G. Op. #97-0837.
      </p>

       Since property should not be sold again once it has been struck to the state at a tax sale, a subsequent municipal tax sale would be void and the purchase would be entitled to a refund of the purchase price paid at the sale, but would not be entitled to payment of interest, except that portion of the purchase price representing the interest due on the taxes. Myers, January 15, 1998, A.G. Op. #97-0836.

       Failing to demand a tax deed does not relieve a tax purchaser of any of the obligations of ownership, including the responsibility to ensure the property is maintained in a proper state of habitability or cleanliness so as not to constitute a threat to the health, safety and welfare of the surrounding community. White, Apr. 8, 2005, A.G. Op. 05-0142.

      If, from any cause, a sale of any land for municipal taxes, both ad valorem and for special improvements, or any installment thereof, that may be delinquent, which is liable to such sale shall not be made at the time appointed by law for such sale, it may be sold thereafter, in the same or a subsequent year, at any time designated therefor by order of the governing authorities of the municipality in which such land may be situated. Notice of a sale so ordered shall be given by advertising it in the manner prescribed by law for the sale of land for state and county taxes, and the sale shall be made at the same place and be subject to all the provisions of law applicable to such sales made at the time appointed by law. Lists of lands sold to the municipality and to individuals shall be filed in the office of the clerk of the municipality within the same relative period of time after the sale as is allowed by law for filing such lists after tax sales made at the regular time, and the clerk shall at once record them. Such lists shall be as valid and have the same effect and be subject to all the provisions of the law applicable to such lists made of lands sold at the regular sale for taxes.

     <p>
      Except as otherwise provided in Section 27-41-2, where lands are offered for sale for unpaid municipal taxes or special improvement taxes or municipal separate school district taxes, and a person will not bid therefor the amount of taxes, damages, and costs due, the same shall be struck off to the municipality and otherwise, where applicable, dealt with as lands are which are sold to the state for delinquent state and county taxes. The governing authorities shall be authorized to pay the state and county taxes on lands thus acquired by the municipality, and to collect the money thus paid, with the same damages and interest allowed individuals in similar cases under the general revenue laws of the state thereon from the date of such payment, upon the redemption of the lands from the municipal sale.
     </p>
     <p>
      Where lands have heretofore been, or may hereafter be struck off to a municipality for unpaid municipal taxes or special improvement taxes or municipal separate school districts taxes, and such lands have also been sold or struck off to an individual or to the state for unpaid state, county, or taxing district taxes, the governing authorities of such municipality are hereby authorized to redeem such lands from the sale for delinquent state, county, or taxing district taxes by paying to the chancery clerk of the county where such lands are situated the amount necessary to redeem same and to collect the money thus paid, together with interest thereon at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum from the date of such payment, upon the redemption of such lands from the municipal sale. Such lands may be redeemed from the municipal sale for unpaid municipal taxes or special improvement taxes by the owner or other person interested in such lands, including the person to whom such lands were struck off or sold at the sale for state, county, or taxing district taxes.
     </p>
     <p>
      When lands have heretofore or may hereafter be struck off to a municipality for unpaid municipal taxes or special improvement taxes or municipal separate school district taxes, and the title to such lands has matured or may hereafter mature in the state by virtue of a sale for unpaid state, county, or taxing district taxes, the governing authorities of such municipality may purchase said lands from the state at a price to be agreed upon by the Secretary of State, Governor, or other lawful authority. Upon payment of such amounts into the State Treasury, the state’s title to said lands shall be conveyed to the said municipality by a patent, or patents, executed and delivered as provided by law in cases of sales of state lands to individuals.

       Under statutes making title acquired under municipal tax sale subservient to that acquired under sale for State and county taxes and giving municipality which purchased at its own sale right to redeem from State and county taxes, city could not acquire title by tax sale while property was charged with State and county taxes, and hence could not claim title as against purchaser from State because city purchased at sale for city taxes one day before State purchased at sale for State and county taxes.

       Where land was sold to city for city taxes, including special municipal benefit assessment, and, one day later, to State for State and county taxes, and redemption period expired, city’s claim was inchoate, under statutes, and became worthless, and hence city’s foreclosure of assessment lien did not extinguish lien, but, under other statutes, lien was effective on resale by State.

       Corporation sought a refund for property it bid on erroneously at a tax sale, but the appellate court determined that the trial court properly instructed the jury before the jury returned a verdict in favor of the tax collector; the corporation was required to establish that the tax collector somehow mistakenly assigned the corporation as the purchaser of the property, and the jury determined that the evidence did not support such a finding.

       In a taxpayer’s suit attacking the validity of a contract between the city and company for professional services by the company in making a detailed appraisal and valuation study of all properties in the city including its replacement, physical and other values, if the taxpayers were aggrieved by tax assessments affecting their property which was based upon valuations made by the city assessor under the contract, they should have sought relief by filing objections with the mayor and the board of aldermen and by appealing from such assessments in the manner provided by the statute.

       The word “work,” used by city in requiring that all work for city to cost over a certain sum, must be done by contract and let to the lowest and best bidder, does not apply to professional services requiring special training and skill of the type contemplated by a contract between the city and company for professional services by the company in making a detailed appraisal and valuation study of all properties in the city, including its replacement, physical and other values.

      In addition to the taxes now or hereafter provided by law, there is hereby levied upon, assessed to and shall be collected from all telephone or communication utilities as defined by Section 77-3-1, Mississippi Code of 1972 and regulated under said Section 77-3-1, an additional tax of two per cent of the gross amount of revenue made and collected on local business from customers within the corporate limits of any municipality of the State of Mississippi, which qualifies as provided by the City Utility Tax Law. Such public utility shall add to the sales price of its service the amount of any tax due under the provisions of the City Utility Tax Law to the extent that such tax was not included as a part of the cost of furnishing services in the fixing of the rates and charges for such service by the Mississippi Public Service Commission. The tax levied herein shall not apply to the cash receipts collected through coin boxes or other mechanical devices where it is impracticable to render periodic statements and thereby add the tax to the sales price of its service.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any such public utility which pays any municipality of the State of Mississippi the compensation provided for in municipal franchises or levied and provided for by Section 77-3-17, Mississippi Code of 1972, shall be exempt from the tax herein imposed and from the provisions of the City Utility Tax Law. In addition, any such public utility which makes payment of the tax imposed herein shall not be required to make payments, if any, which may be required under the terms of said Section 77-3-17.

      The mayor and board of aldermen or other governing authority of any municipality desiring to avail itself of the provisions of the City Utility Tax Law shall adopt an ordinance declaring its intention to have the utility tax imposed at the specified rate for the benefit of such municipality effective on and after a date fixed in the ordinance which must be at least thirty (30) days later and on the first day of a month. A certified copy of this ordinance shall be immediately forwarded to the Chairman of the State Tax Commission. The municipal authorities shall have a copy of the ordinance published once a week for three (3) consecutive weeks in at least one (1) newspaper published in the municipality and having a general circulation therein. The first publication shall be not less than twenty-eight (28) days prior to the levying date fixed in such ordinance, and the last publication shall be made not less than seven (7) days prior to such date. If no newspaper is published in the municipality, then notice shall be given by publishing the ordinance for the required time in some newspaper published in the same or an adjoining county having a general circulation in the municipality. A copy of the ordinance shall also be posted at three (3) public places in the municipality for a period of at least twenty-one (21) days during the time of its publication in a newspaper.

       The issuance of such bonds was not objectionable on the ground that the board sought to issue county-wide bonds for obligations which appeared on the face of the order to be, in large part, the debts of several, separate road districts, where there was nothing in the record to show that during the time such obligations were incurred the public roads in the county were being maintained under any separate district system. In re Validation of Lincoln County Funding Bonds, 187 Miss. 392, 193 So. 26, 1940 Miss. LEXIS 221 (Miss. 1940).
      </p>
      <p>
       The issuance of such bonds not objectionable on the ground that the debts were invalid based on a presumption that in view of such order the county budget was exceeded, since the condition might have been brought about by this appointment in the collection of expected amounts of taxes and there was no showing in the record as to how the condition was brought about. In re Validation of Lincoln County Funding Bonds, 187 Miss. 392, 193 So. 26, 1940 Miss. LEXIS 221 (Miss. 1940).
      </p>
      <p>
       The issuance of county funding bonds for the payment of outstanding and unpaid obligations of the county could not be attacked on the ground that some of the obligations were not incurred in the manner provided by law, where the order of the board of supervisors for the issuance of such bonds in reciting its investigation and findings as to the validity of the items as obligations of the county was sufficient to give such obligations the dignity required by this section, without reciting the antecedent and evidentiary facts. In re Validation of Lincoln County Funding Bonds, 187 Miss. 392, 193 So. 26, 1940 Miss. LEXIS 221 (Miss. 1940).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a majority of the qualified electors residing in a consolidated school district, by petition, request issuance of bonds for certain school purposes, it is not necessary to call for an election on the question, in the absence of a request in the petition itself calling for such an election, and the requirement that the bond shall be issued “in the manner provided for by law,” in such case, has no reference to the provisions of this section but refers to the details of the issuance. In re Validation Bonds of Orange Grove Consol. School Dist., 187 Miss. 373, 193 So. 6, 1940 Miss. LEXIS 218 (Miss. 1940).

      <p>
       A course of conduct pursued by a County Board of Supervisors in incurring debts for county road work when there were insufficient funds in the road fund at the time for the payment of such debts, and in ordering warrants for their payment without funds on hand to be paid out of such moneys as should thereafter come into the road funds, was within the express prohibition of this section, and such debts so incurred could not be the foundation for any action in mandamus for their payment. Edmondson v. Board of Sup'rs, 185 Miss. 645, 187 So. 538, 1939 Miss. LEXIS 143 (Miss. 1939).

       Bank, which advanced funds with which school district purchased land for teachers’ home, took trust deed to secure loan, and collected interest thereon without petition or election by qualified voters as required by statute, held accountable in representative suit by taxpayers for interest collected and without any rights against school district since loan was void.

      <p>
       The failure of this statute to make reference to any statute of limitations did not have the effect of waiving, as to all obligations of a county incurred after its enactment, a statute providing that statutes of limitations should begin to run in favor of the state, counties and municipal corporations at the time when the plaintiff had the first right to demand payment. Fuqua v. Board of Supervisors, 192 Miss. 6, 4 So. 2d 350, 1941 Miss. LEXIS 7 (Miss. 1941).
      </p>
      <p>
       The six-year statute of limitations was applicable to the right of a teacher in an agricultural high school to demand payment of salary from the proceeds of bonds to be issued by the county and to compel issuance of such bonds by mandamus upon failure of the board of supervisors (which was not shown to have ever been advised of the existence of the obligation until suit was filed), otherwise to do so.

      <p>
       In the issuance of funding bonds for the payment of claims against a supervisor’s district, county boards of supervisors must find as a jurisdictional fact that the proposed funding bonds, when added to a county’s outstanding bonded indebtedness, shall not exceed 10 per cent of the assessed valuation of taxable property within the county, and set forth such fact in its order before the bonds can validly be issued or validated. Brown v. Board of Sup'rs, 185 Miss. 216, 187 So. 738, 1939 Miss. LEXIS 145 (Miss. 1939).
      </p>
      <p>
       The failure of the county board of supervisors to affirmatively adjudicate in an order providing for the issuance of funding bonds to pay certain claims or debts incurred by a supervisor’s district that the debt incurred, when added to all of the then outstanding indebtedness of the supervisor’s district, both bonded and floating, did not result in the imposition upon any of the property in such district of an indebtedness for road purposes of more than 10 per cent of the assessed value of such property, as ascertained by the last completed assessment for taxation, constituted fatal error and rendered such order of the board null and void, on its face, and subject to attack in a proceeding for validation of such bonds. Brown v. Board of Sup'rs, 185 Miss. 216, 187 So. 738, 1939 Miss. LEXIS 145 (Miss. 1939).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the chancellor was in error in rendering a decree of validation as to issuance of certain funding bonds in payment of claims against a supervisor’s district because the order of the board for such issuance was void because of the violation of § 4321, a decree would be reversed without prejudice to the right of the county to provide for the payment of such indebtedness by the legal issuance of other bonds under this section, or in such other manner as might be authorized by law. Brown v. Board of Sup'rs, 185 Miss. 216, 187 So. 738, 1939 Miss. LEXIS 145 (Miss. 1939).
      </p>
      <p>
       Proposed county bonds to take up outstanding county obligations were “funding” and not “refunding” bonds, and therefore limited to ten per cent of assessed value of taxable property of county. Lee v. Hancock County, 181 Miss. 847, 178 So. 790, 1938 Miss. LEXIS 124 (Miss. 1938).
      </p>
      <p>
       “Refunding bond” is a bond issued to pay off an older issue; to “refund a debt” meaning to fund it again or anew; the word “fund” in this connection meaning to convert into a more or less permanent debt bearing regular interest.

       An appeal by taxpayers to the circuit court from orders and allowances made by the board of supervisors with respect to the issuance of county funding bonds was improper, where the bill of exceptions failed to set forth the facts in full and was not signed by the president of the board as the law required, and items which should have been entered and a statement as to their correctness was left to the clerk. In re Validation of $50,000 Serial Funding Bonds, 187 Miss. 512, 193 So. 449, 1940 Miss. LEXIS 231 (Miss. 1940).
      </p>
      <p>
       An appeal to the circuit court by taxpayers from orders and allowances made by the county board of supervisors with respect to the issuance of county funding bonds was ineffective, where the chancery court had acquired jurisdiction of the whole matter in a validation proceeding. In re Validation of $50,000 Serial Funding Bonds, 187 Miss. 512, 193 So. 449, 1940 Miss. LEXIS 231 (Miss. 1940).
      </p>
      <p>
       With respect to an appeal to the circuit court by taxpayers from orders and allowances of a board of supervisors with respect to issuance of county funding bonds, a party having a claim to be allowed or having been allowed by the board is an interested party on an appeal to the circuit court, and separate appeals from all orders must be prosecuted where an appeal has been taken, and the bill of exceptions must either be filed during the court term or meeting of the board of supervisors or within such time as the law or the board might allow for filing such bill and appeal. In re Validation of $50,000 Serial Funding Bonds, 187 Miss. 512, 193 So. 449, 1940 Miss. LEXIS 231 (Miss. 1940).
      </p>
      <p>
       The right of a taxpayer to prosecute appeals from orders and allowances by a board of supervisors in connection with the issuance of funding bonds to matters in which he has no pecuniary or property interest is limited. In re Validation of $50,000 Serial Funding Bonds, 187 Miss. 512, 193 So. 449, 1940 Miss. LEXIS 231 (Miss. 1940).
      </p>
      <p>
       The chancery court, having acquired jurisdiction of a proceeding on validation of county funding bonds, erred in dismissing the proceedings, in view of the fact that it had the power to pass upon the legality of the bond issue in all respects, including the various claims constituting the alleged indebtednesses, and an appeal by the taxpayers to the circuit court during the pendency of such proceeding in the chancery court was improper. In re Validation of $50,000 Serial Funding Bonds, 187 Miss. 512, 193 So. 449, 1940 Miss. LEXIS 231 (Miss. 1940).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a petition for a writ of certiorari, filed in the circuit court, after a decree in chancery court validating the issuance of county funding bonds, was confined in the same record, made by the board of supervisors, which the chancery court had before it in the validation proceedings, disposition of an appeal from the chancery court would not be stayed. In re Validation of Lincoln County Funding Bonds, 187 Miss. 392, 193 So. 26, 1940 Miss. LEXIS 221 (Miss. 1940).
      </p>
      <p>
       In the absence of an appeal from an order of the board of county supervisors adjudicating the validity of certain claims, for the payment of which an order for the issuance of funding bonds was made, no objections could be taken on appeal from a decree validating such bonds based on the ground that the indebtednesses for the payment of which the bonds were to be issued did not constitute valid, legal and undisputed outstanding obligations of a supervisor’s district for the reason that such indebtednesses were incurred in violation of § 4321 prohibiting the incurring of an indebtedness unless there is sufficient money at the time in the particular fund from which allowance for the payment thereof is to be made, since the chancellor had no jurisdiction to pass on the validity of such claim and such objection constituted a collateral attack on the orders and judgments of the board of supervisors.

     <p>
      No municipality shall hereafter issue bonds secured by a pledge of its full faith and credit for the purposes authorized by law in an amount which, when added to the then outstanding bonded indebtedness of such municipality, shall exceed either (a) fifteen percent (15%) of the assessed value of the taxable property within such municipality, according to the last completed assessment for taxation, or (b) ten percent (10%) of the assessment upon which taxes were levied for its fiscal year ending September 30, 1984, whichever is greater. In computing such indebtedness, there may be deducted all bonds or other evidences of indebtedness, heretofore or hereafter issued, for school, water, sewerage systems, gas, and light and power purposes and for the construction of special improvements primarily chargeable to the property benefited, or for the purpose of paying the municipality’s proportion of any betterment program, a portion of which is primarily chargeable to the property benefited. However, in no case shall any municipality contract any indebtedness which, when added to all of the outstanding general obligation indebtedness, both bonded and floating, shall exceed either (a) twenty percent (20%) of the assessed value of all taxable property within such municipality according to the last completed assessment for taxation or (b) fifteen percent (15%) of the assessment upon which taxes were levied for its fiscal year ending September 30, 1984, whichever is greater. Nothing herein contained shall be construed to apply to contract obligations in any form heretofore or hereafter incurred by any municipality which are subject to annual appropriations therefor, or to bonds heretofore issued by any municipality for school purposes, or to contract obligations in any form heretofore or hereafter incurred by any municipality which are payable exclusively from the revenues of any municipally-owned utility, or to bonds issued by any municipality under the provisions of Sections 57-1-1 through 57-1-51, or to any special assessment improvement bonds issued by any municipality under the provisions of Sections 21-41-1 through 21-41-53, or to any indebtedness incurred under Section 55-23-8.

       The preamble to Laws of 1989, ch. 499, effective from and after October 1, 1989, provides as follows:
      </p>
      <p>
       “WHEREAS, the Mississippi Department of Natural Resources (DNR), pursuant to the requirements of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act and amendments thereto, has placed numerous municipalities within the state under administrative orders to construct, replace, renovate or improve wastewater treatment and collection facilities which shall comply with the minimum standards under the federal law; and
      </p>
      <p>
       “WHEREAS, many municipalities have initiated projects funded through a combination of federal, state and local funds made available through a revolving loan fund administered by the Department of Natural Resources; and
      </p>
      <p>
       “WHEREAS, the refunds in the revolving loan fund have either been exhausted or encumbered and no such funds are currently available to the numerous municipalities that have not initiated projects to comply with the federal law; and
      </p>
      <p>
       “WHEREAS, failure to comply with the deadlines mandated by the DNR administrative orders, which deadlines are generally in 1991, could result in severe monetary fines and penalties imposed under the federal law; and
      </p>
      <p>
       “WHEREAS, the Legislature feels that this specific situation is of an emergency nature and that an immediate, viable and economical funding mechanism is necessary to allow affected municipalities to issue bonds without regard to the statutory debt limitation for compliance purposes;”
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 49-2-7 provides that wherever the term “Mississippi Department of Natural Resources” appears in any law the same shall mean the Department of Environmental Quality.

       Chapter 104, Laws of 1932, limiting the power of counties to impose taxes, and Chapter 235, Laws of 1932 (§ 4324, Code 1942), restricting the power of counties and municipalities to borrow money and to levy taxes for the payment thereof, are part of the same legislative plan, without either of which that plan would be incomplete, and therefore must be construed together.

      </p>
      <p>
       With respect to an election for issuing bonds for water and light purposes a majority of the electors voting in the election was sufficient to authorize issuance of the bonds since those who were indifferent to the election to the extent that they did not go and vote were not entitled to control the result of those who voted in the election.

      <p>
       The provision “or for the construction of special improvements primarily chargeable to the property benefited,” etc., does not make it a necessary part of the requirement as to water and land that there should be a charge primarily made against the improvement or the plant or equipment or the proceeds thereof, and it would be possible to issue bonds for water and light purposes without making the proceeds derived from the utility being constructed or improved or benefited a general charge upon the taxpayers of the city.

       The votes of disqualified persons voting at an election in a city on the question of a bond issue which would not affect the result of the election regardless of how they voted, does not render an election void.

    Initiating procedures for issuance of bonds.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Before issuing any bonds for any of the purposes enumerated in Section 21-33-301, the governing authority of the issuing municipality shall adopt a resolution declaring its intention so to do, stating the amount of bonds proposed to be issued and the purpose for which the bonds are to be issued, and the date upon which the aforesaid authority proposes to direct the issuance of such bonds. Such resolution shall be published once a week for at least three (3) consecutive weeks in at least one (1) newspaper published in such municipality. The first publication of such resolution shall be made not less than twenty-one (21) days prior to the date fixed in such resolution for the issuance of the bonds, and the last publication shall be made not more than seven (7) days prior to such date. If no newspaper be published in such municipality, then such notice shall be given by publishing the resolution for the required time in some newspaper having a general circulation in such municipality and, in addition, by posting a copy of such resolution for at least twenty-one (21) days next preceding the date fixed therein at three (3) public places in such municipality. The publication of the resolution may be made as provided in Section 21-17-19. If ten percent (10%) of the qualified electors of the municipality, or fifteen hundred (1500), whichever is the lesser, shall file a written protest against the issuance of such bonds on or before the date specified in such resolution, then an election on the question of the bonds shall be called and held as is provided in Section 21-33-309. Notice of such election shall be signed by the clerk of the municipality and shall be published once a week for at least three (3) consecutive weeks in at least one (1) newspaper published in such municipality. The first publication of such notice shall be made not less than twenty-one (21) days prior to the date fixed for such election, and the last publication shall be made not more than seven (7) days prior to such date. If no newspaper is published in such municipality, then such notice shall be given by publishing the same for the required time in some newspaper having a general circulation in such municipality and published in the same or an adjoining county and, in addition, by posting a copy of such notice for at least twenty-one (21) days next preceding such election at three (3) public places in such municipality. If no protest be filed, then such bonds may be issued without an election on the question of the issuance thereof, at any time within a period of two (2) years after the date specified in the above-mentioned resolution. However, the governing authority of any municipality in its discretion may nevertheless call an election on such question, in which event it shall not be necessary to publish the resolution declaring its intention to issue such bonds as herein provided.
     </p>
     <p>
      Under no circumstances shall any municipality exceed the bond limit as set by statute for municipalities.

       City of Hattiesburg could lawfully proceed with issuance of general obligation industrial park bonds under Chapter 886, Local and Private Laws of Mississippi, Regular Session 1984, which dispenses with the necessity for a bond issue election, except upon petition of 10 percent of the city’s registered voters. Brandon v. Hattiesburg, 493 So. 2d 324, 1986 Miss. LEXIS 2532 (Miss. 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   The rule requiring petition of 10 percent, or 1,500, whichever is less, of qualified electors of the municipality for calling an election on bond issues, as appears in Mississippi Code §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t21c33s21-33-307" target="_self">21-33-307</a></cite>, is enforceable only when a municipality purports to issue bonds for one of the 16 general categories of purposes found in Mississippi Code §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t21c33s21-33-301" target="_self">21-33-301</a></cite>; none of which is so elastic as to include industrial park purposes contemplated by the City of Hattiesburg in present case.

      </p>
      <p>
       That a newspaper notice of intention to issue bonds, in stating existing indebtedness, used a period instead of a comma in the figure $36,000, is immaterial. In re Validation of $30,000 Road & Bridge Bonds, 242 Miss. 125, 133 So. 2d 267, 1961 Miss. LEXIS 538 (Miss. 1961).

       Variance between a resolution declaring an intention to issue bonds for the purpose of buying the necessary machinery for road work and the notice given thereof by adding the words “including a motor grader” is immaterial.

       Failure of resolution directing issuance of municipal bonds to state that notice of bond election was given in designated way and for required time, renders bonds invalid.

       The requirement that notice of election be published in some newspaper having a general circulation in the municipality is not met by publication in a newspaper shown only to have been published in the county in which the municipality is situated.

       Issuance of a note by county to pay for road machinery was not invalid because the note was an attempt to create an interest bearing debt in violation of § 4320 Code of 1942 as amended by ch 473 Laws of 1946, because no election was held, inasmuch as the statute authorizing the purchase did not require election as condition precedent to issuance of interest bearing note for a purchase price. Covington County v. Mississippi Road Supply Co., 213 Miss. 583, 57 So. 2d 318, 1952 Miss. LEXIS 400 (Miss.), modified, 59 So. 2d 325 (Miss. 1952).

      <p>
       The fact that a decree of validation erroneously bore date of May 12 instead of June 12, evidently due to a typographical error, did not show that the notice to the taxpayer was not published as required by law prior to the hearing before the chancellor, where such decree of validation recited all the necessary jurisdictional facts.

       Where a municipality was in the status of a lessee by reason of its liability for reasonable compensation for the use of a fire engine purchased under an invalid contract, it was not necessary to submit to the voters the question of making a lease of the equipment purchased thereunder or of allowing the municipality to be held to the obligation of a lessee, notwithstanding that the contract attempted to create an interest bearing obligation.

       Where a contract for the purchase of a fire engine was held invalid because of omission of statutory requirements, the municipality was liable for reasonable compensation for the use of the property and had the status of a lessee, where the transaction was without corruption, and was within the object authorized by law, and not a debtor in an interest-bearing debt incurred without the authorization of the electors and at an election called for that purpose, notwithstanding that the contract was conceded an attempt to create an obligation within this section.

      </p>
      <p>
       After notice of the proposed issuance of municipal bonds if twenty per centum of the taxpayers whether electors or not petition against the same, the municipal authorities can not rightfully issue the bonds for any amount until authorized by affirmative vote of two-thirds of the electors. Town of Clarksdale v. Broaddus, 77 Miss. 667, 28 So. 954, 1900 Miss. LEXIS 65 (Miss. 1900).
      </p>
      <p>
       Before a municipality can rightfully issue bonds for any amount, under this provision authorizing and regulating such issuance, it must first publish notice of the proposed issuance as provided by a subsequent provision [§ 3604, superseded by § 3598-05], so that taxpayers may petition against same.

       Where ten percent of the qualified electors of a town filed a written protest against the issuance of bonds following publication of the notice of the intention to issue the bonds, the governing authorities, if they choose to go forward with the bond issue, must call and hold an election; if three-fifths of the qualified electors who vote in the election vote in favor of the issuance of bonds, then the governing authorities in their discretion may issue the bonds, either in whole or in part, within two years from the date of the election or within two years after the final favorable termination of any litigation affecting the issuance of the bonds.

      </p>
      <p>
       The language in this section which requires the publication of the notice of election prior to the issuance of municipal bonds is mandatory, and failure to meet this requirement would be fatal. An election on the question held in the absence of such a publication would be invalid to authorize the issuance of the bonds. Bourgeois, July 30, 2004, A.G. Op. 04-0358.

       With respect to an election for issuing bonds for water and light purposes a majority of the electors voting in the election was sufficient to authorize issuance of the bonds since those who were indifferent to the election to the extent that they did not go and vote were not entitled to control the result of those who voted in the election. In re Validation of Municipal Bonds, 188 Miss. 817, 196 So. 258, 1940 Miss. LEXIS 75 (Miss. 1940).
      </p>
      <p>
       The provision “or for the construction of special improvements primarily chargeable to the property benefited,” etc., does not make it a necessary part of the requirement as to water and land that there should be a charge primarily made against the improvement or the plant or equipment or the proceeds thereof, and it would be possible to issue bonds for water and light purposes without making the proceeds derived from the utility being constructed or improved or benefited a general charge upon the taxpayers of the city. In re Validation of Municipal Bonds, 188 Miss. 817, 196 So. 258, 1940 Miss. LEXIS 75 (Miss. 1940).
      </p>
      <p>
       Year within which municipal bonds might be issued after favorable determination of litigation did not begin to run until issuance of mandate fifteen days after Supreme Court’s decision, which was time allowed for filing of suggestion of error. Love v. Mayor & Board of Aldermen, 166 Miss. 322, 148 So. 382, 1933 Miss. LEXIS 389 (Miss. 1933).
      </p>
      <p>
       Purpose of statute providing for issuance of municipal bonds within one year was to prevent issuance after reason which prompted electorate to assent thereto had disappeared. Love v. Mayor & Board of Aldermen, 166 Miss. 322, 148 So. 382, 1933 Miss. LEXIS 389 (Miss. 1933).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where contracts for sale of municipal bonds were made within year after favorable determination of litigation, there was an “issue” of the bonds within the year, though mechanical and ministerial work of printing, signing, and delivering the bonds remained to be done after expiration of the year. Love v. Mayor & Board of Aldermen, 166 Miss. 322, 148 So. 382, 1933 Miss. LEXIS 389 (Miss. 1933).

    Maturities and interest.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      All bonds issued by a municipality shall mature annually, with all maturities not longer than twenty (20) years, with not less than one-fiftieth (1/50) of the total issue to mature each year during the first five (5) years of the life of such bonds, not less than one-twenty-fifth (1/25) of the total issue to mature each year during the succeeding ten-year period of the life of such bonds, and the remainder to be amortized, as to principal and interest, into approximately equal annual payments, one (1) payment to mature each year for the remaining life of such bonds. However, in cases where bonds shall be issued or dated subsequent to the date fixed for making the municipal tax levy in the year in which such bonds are to be issued, the first maturity date of not less than one-fiftieth (1/50) of the total issue, may be fixed for any period not exceeding two (2) years from the date of the bonds with the same schedule of subsequent maturities as herein above set forth. Such bonds shall not bear a greater overall maximum interest rate to maturity than that allowed in Section 75-17-101, Mississippi Code of 1972. No bond shall bear more than one (1) rate of interest. Each bond shall bear interest from its date to its stated maturity date at the interest rate specified in the bid. All bonds of the same maturity shall bear the same rate of interest from date to maturity. All interest accruing on such bonds so issued shall be payable semiannually or annually, except that the first interest coupon attached to any such bond may be for any period not exceeding one (1) year.
     </p>
     <p>
      No interest payment shall be evidenced by more than one (1) coupon and neither cancelled nor supplemental coupons shall be permitted. The lowest interest rate specified for any bonds issued shall not be less than seventy percent (70%) of the highest interest rate specified for the same bond issue. The interest rate of any one (1) interest coupon shall not exceed the maximum interest rate allowed on such bonds.
     </p>
     <p>
      Each interest rate specified in any bid must be in multiples of one-eighth of one percent (1/8 of 1%) or in multiples of one-tenth of one percent (1/10 of 1%). The denomination, form, and place, or places, of payment of such bonds shall be fixed in the resolution or ordinance of the governing authorities issuing such bonds. Such bonds shall be executed by the manual or facsimile signature of the mayor and clerk of such municipality, with the seal of the municipality affixed thereto. At least one (1) signature on each bond shall be a manual signature, as specified in the resolution. The coupons may bear only the facsimile signatures of such mayor and clerk. No bonds shall be issued and sold under the provisions of this article for less than par and accrued interest.

       Municipal bonds issued under this section providing that municipalities may on issuing them make a part mature annually and prohibiting in such case the calling in of the bonds until maturity, are not void because of a recital to the effect that the municipality reserves the right after a certain date to pay off and cancel any of the bonds.

       It is not a defense to an action on municipal bonds by a bona fide holder without notice that the municipality was at the time of their issuance a separate school district, that the bonds were issued to raise funds with which to build a schoolhouse, that the debt incurred by their issuance exceeded a three-mill tax for their levy on the taxable property of the municipality, and that the consent of a majority of the taxpayers was not given to authorize the levy of a tax exceeding three mills on the dollar for the erection of the schoolhouse or the issuance of the bonds.

     <p>
      The proceeds of any bonds issued by a municipality shall be placed in the municipal treasury or depository, if there be one, as a special fund, and shall be used for no other purpose than that for which such bonds were authorized to be issued. If the governing authorities of such municipality, or any member thereof, or any other officer, shall wilfully divert, or aid or assist in diverting any such fund, or any part thereof, to any purpose other than that for which such bonds were authorized to be issued, then such person shall be guilty of a felony and, upon conviction, shall be punished by imprisonment in the state penitentiary for a term not exceeding five years and, in addition, he shall be liable personally and on his official bond for the amount so diverted. Any member of such governing authorities may escape the penalty provided for above by requesting and having his vote recorded in the negative on any illegal diversion of the proceeds of such bonds.

       Whenever any municipality shall have on hand any bond and interest funds, any funds derived from the sale of bonds, special funds, or any other funds in excess of the sums which will be required for immediate expenditure and which are not needed or cannot by law be used for the payment of the current obligations or expenses of such municipality, the governing authorities of such municipality shall have the power and authority to invest such excess funds in any bonds or other direct obligations of the United States of America or the State of Mississippi, or of any county or municipality of this state, or of any school district, which such county or municipal or school district bonds have been approved by a reputable bond attorney or have been validated by a decree of the chancery court, or in obligations issued or guaranteed in full as to principal and interest by the United States of America which are subject to a repurchase agreement with a qualified depository. In any event the bonds or obligations in which such funds are invested shall mature or be redeemable prior to the time the funds so invested will be needed for expenditure.

       However, such excess funds may first be offered for investment in interest-bearing accounts with or through municipal depositories serving in accordance with Section 27-105-353 at a rate of interest not less than a simple interest rate numerically equal to the average bank discount rate on United States Treasury bills of comparable maturity. The rate of interest established herein shall be the minimum rate of interest and there shall be no maximum rate of interest.

Any interest derived from the investment of school bond funds shall be handled as provided in Section 37-59-43. Any interest derived from investment of other bond proceeds or from investment of any bond and interest fund, bond reserve fund or bond redemption sinking fund shall be deposited either in the same fund from which the investment was made or in the bond and interest fund established for payment of the principal or interest on the bonds. Any interest derived from special purpose funds which are outside the function of general municipal government shall be paid into that special purpose fund.

       Under § 3612 and § 4347, Code of 1942, a city has authority to make loan to a private individual and to accept assignment of promissory note and a trust deed to realty securing the same. Pace v. Wedgeworth, 198 Miss. 1, 20 So. 2d 842, 1945 Miss. LEXIS 162 (Miss. 1945).
      </p>
      <p>
       Court must presume that municipality, through its officers, in accepting assignment of promissory note and trust deed to realty securing the same, brought itself within the authorization of § 3612 and § 4347, Code of 1942, pertaining to the loaning of funds. Pace v. Wedgeworth, 198 Miss. 1, 20 So. 2d 842, 1945 Miss. LEXIS 162 (Miss. 1945).
      </p>
      <p>
       Supervisors held not liable personally for transfers from county road and bridge bond sinking fund to other unrelated county funds, since transfers were loans within statute, notwithstanding transfers were irregular and statutory requirements for loans from sinking funds were not complied with. Gully v. Thomas, 171 Miss. 749, 158 So. 465, 1935 Miss. LEXIS 5 (Miss. 1935).
      </p>
      <p>
       Loans of county sinking funds, made in manner violative of Code sections, held illegal, so that cause of action for their recovery accrued at once to county. GULLY v. BEW, 170 Miss. 427, 154 So. 284, 154 So. 721, 1934 Miss. LEXIS 107 (Miss. 1934); Harper v. Gully, 154 So. 288 (Miss. 1934); Gully v. Bradford, 155 So. 172 (Miss. 1934).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where loans of county sinking funds by board of supervisors were illegally made, board could not, by extending time for payment, divest itself of immediate right to sue for recovery thereof, and such extension did not suspend or postpone limitation period for State Tax Collector’s suit to foreclose trust deeds securing such loans. GULLY v. BEW, 170 Miss. 427, 154 So. 284, 154 So. 721, 1934 Miss. LEXIS 107 (Miss. 1934); Harper v. Gully, 154 So. 288 (Miss. 1934); Gully v. Bradford, 155 So. 172 (Miss. 1934).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancery clerk held not liable for ministerial act of issuing and delivering warrants for loans of county sinking funds on orders of board of supervisors, though loans were made in illegal manner, there being no charge of bad faith on part of clerk. GULLY v. BEW, 170 Miss. 427, 154 So. 284, 154 So. 721, 1934 Miss. LEXIS 107 (Miss. 1934); Harper v. Gully, 154 So. 288 (Miss. 1934); Gully v. Bradford, 155 So. 172 (Miss. 1934).
      </p>
      <p>
       County boards of supervisors have jurisdiction of lending sinking funds of county on security of real estate. GULLY v. BEW, 170 Miss. 427, 154 So. 284, 154 So. 721, 1934 Miss. LEXIS 107 (Miss. 1934); Harper v. Gully, 154 So. 288 (Miss. 1934); Gully v. Bradford, 155 So. 172 (Miss. 1934).
      </p>
      <p>
       Members of county board of supervisors, having jurisdiction of lending county sinking funds on security of realty, are not personally liable for errors of judgment in exercise of such jurisdiction. GULLY v. BEW, 170 Miss. 427, 154 So. 284, 154 So. 721, 1934 Miss. LEXIS 107 (Miss. 1934); Harper v. Gully, 154 So. 288 (Miss. 1934); Gully v. Bradford, 155 So. 172 (Miss. 1934).
      </p>
      <p>
       Members of county board of supervisors held not liable for failure to collect promptly illegal loans made by prior board, there being no charge that subsequent board knew that proceeds of foreclosure sale would be insufficient or that borrower was insolvent. GULLY v. BEW, 170 Miss. 427, 154 So. 284, 154 So. 721, 1934 Miss. LEXIS 107 (Miss. 1934); Harper v. Gully, 154 So. 288 (Miss. 1934); Gully v. Bradford, 155 So. 172 (Miss. 1934).
      </p>
      <p>
       Members of board of supervisors lending sinking funds on security of trust deeds in manner violating Code, held not liable for making loans, since, in making appropriations, board members acted judicially. GULLY v. BEW, 170 Miss. 427, 154 So. 284, 154 So. 721, 1934 Miss. LEXIS 107 (Miss. 1934); Harper v. Gully, 154 So. 288 (Miss. 1934); Gully v. Bradford, 155 So. 172 (Miss. 1934).

     <p>
      The governing authorities of any municipality of this state shall have the power and authority to borrow money for the current expenses of such municipality in anticipation of the ad valorem taxes to be collected for the then current fiscal year. The governing authority of the municipality may borrow such money, as hereinbefore provided, from any available fund in the municipal treasury, or from any other source, and such loan shall be repaid in the manner herein provided. The money so borrowed shall bear interest at a rate not greater than that allowed in Section 75-17-105, Mississippi Code of 1972, and shall be repaid not later than the following March 15, out of the first moneys collected by reason of the tax levy in anticipation of which such money is borrowed, and such money shall be used for no other purpose than the payment of the current expenses of such municipality. The amount borrowed under the provisions of this section shall in no event exceed fifty percent (50%) of the anticipated, but then uncollected, revenue to be produced by the then current tax levy, or levies, against which such money is borrowed. In borrowing money under the provisions hereof, it shall not be necessary to publish notice of intention so to do or to secure the consent of the qualified electors, either by election or otherwise. Such borrowing may be authorized by resolution of the governing authorities and may be evidenced by a negotiable note, or notes, signed and executed in such form as may be prescribed in such resolution. Money may be borrowed in anticipation of ad valorem taxes under the provisions of this section, regardless of whether or not such borrowing shall create an indebtedness in excess of statutory limitations.

       Any city, town or village that shall have received a binding commitment from the United States of America, or any agency thereof, or the State of Mississippi, or any agency thereof, for a grant or loan may borrow money in anticipation of receipt of funds from such confirmed grant or loan unless prohibited by federal law or by the terms of the agreement concerning such grant or loan and may assign and pledge as security for such interim financing the proceeds of any such grant or loan.

     <p>
      In the event any parcel of taxable property falls under the purview of more than one homeowners’ association, each of whose property owners petition to create a special local improvement assessment district under Section 21-33-553, such parcel may not be assessed pursuant to Sections 21-33-551 through 21-33-561 more than once at any given time. The parcel shall be assessed by the special local improvement assessment district first approved by the electors pursuant to Section 21-33-553. Following the dissolution of the taxing special local improvement assessment district under Section 21-33-555(2), the next special local improvement assessment district to have been approved by the electors pursuant to Section 21-33-553 shall become the taxing district.

    Expenditure of funds.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The governing authorities shall at all times keep within the sums named in their said budget and within the annual revenue, always seeking to lessen expenditures instead of exceeding revenue and budget estimates. There shall not be added to the amount to be appropriated and authorized to be expended for any item, or to the total amount appropriated and authorized to be expended from any fund any amount or percentage whatever because of any anticipated loss of revenue by reason of the nonpayment of taxes levied for the current fiscal year. The amount appropriated and authorized to be expended for any item contained in such budget, except for capital outlay, election expenses, and payment of emergency warrants and interest thereon, must not exceed the amount actually estimated for such item, and the total amount appropriated and authorized to be expended from any fund, except for capital outlay, election expenses and payment of emergency warrants and interest thereon, shall not exceed the total amount actually estimated for all purposes. The total expenditures authorized to be made from any fund shall not exceed the aggregate cash balance, in such fund at the close of the fiscal year immediately preceding, plus the amount of estimated revenues to accrue to such fund, as determined and fixed in the manner provided by this chapter, and the amount which may be raised for such fund by a lawful tax levy during the current fiscal year. Nothing herein contained shall be construed to prevent any municipality from making adequate provision at any time for the payment of principal of and interest on its outstanding bonded indebtedness.

      Expenditures made, liabilities incurred, or warrants issued in excess of any of the budget detailed appropriations as originally and finally determined, or as thereafter revised by transfer as provided by this chapter, shall not be a liability of the municipality, but the official making or incurring such expenditure or issuing such warrant shall be liable therefor personally and upon his official bond.

Any one or more of the governing authorities, or clerk, approving any claim or issuing any warrant in excess of any such budget appropriation, except as above provided, shall forfeit to the municipality twice the amount of such claim or warrant, which shall be recovered in an action against such member, or members, of the governing authorities, or clerk, or all of them, and the several sureties on their official bonds, and it shall be the duty of the governing authorities of such municipality, or the State Auditor, as the head of the State Department of Audit, or the director thereof, appointed by him, or any taxpayer of such municipality, to bring an action therefor through the city attorney, or any attorney designated and empowered so to do by a court of competent jurisdiction. Provided, however, that the term “budgeted expenditures” for purposes of personal liability of members of the local governing authorities under this section shall not include any unfunded liability for municipal employee retirement or pension funds. Nothing in this section shall diminish any responsibility of the members of the local governing authorities to fund any employee retirement or pension plans, or any liability as a result of any failure to fund such plans as otherwise required by law.

    Revision of municipal budget.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Notwithstanding any provision in this chapter to the contrary, the budget of any municipality may be revised as provided in this section and under the conditions herein stated, and when a deficit is indicated the budget shall be revised.
     </p>
     <p>
      The governing authorities of any municipality are authorized to revise the budget for expenses of such municipality at any one (1) regular meeting of said governing authorities held not later than August of the first year in which such governing authorities enter upon the discharge of their duties, provided there be funds in the treasury of the municipality, or coming into the treasury during the fiscal year, not appropriated by the budget of the outgoing board of governing authorities, and there is a deficit in any one (1) or more items provided for in the budget of the preceding board. This section shall not, however, validate or invalidate any contracts made, executed or entered into by the governing authorities of the preceding term.
     </p>
     <p>
      If it appears at any time during the current fiscal year, but not later than the regular July meeting of the board of governing authorities, that collections of anticipated revenues from taxes or other sources will be less than the amount estimated, and a deficit is thereby indicated for any fund, or funds, the governing authorities shall, at a regular meeting, revise and reduce the budget appropriations for such funds as is anticipated will have a deficit, so as to conform to the lowered indicated revenue, including revenue from taxes and all other sources.
     </p>
     <p>
      If it affirmatively appears at any time during the current fiscal year that actual collections and anticipated revenues from taxes or other sources, including grants or donations, will exceed the estimates, then the governing authorities may revise and increase the budget appropriation of such fund, or funds, affected by such increase in revenue, but no such transfer shall be made from fund to fund, or from item to item, which will result in the expenditure of any money for a purpose different from that for which the tax was levied. The budget, as so revised, shall be spread in detail upon the minutes of said board of governing authorities. However, no such increase shall in any event be construed to authorize expenditures or to incur obligations which will result in a deficit in any fund, or funds.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the increase in revenue over the estimates is from other than regular sources, including grants and donations, such excess over the estimate may be expended for improvements and new construction, including buildings, additions to buildings, streets, and street improvements.
     </p>
     <p>
      If it affirmatively appears at any time during the current fiscal year that there is in any fund or account any sum remaining unexpended and not needed or expected to be needed for the purpose or purposes for which appropriated in said budget, then the governing authorities may, in their discretion, transfer such sum or any part thereof to any other fund or funds or account or accounts where needed, by order to such effect entered upon their minutes. This shall not, however, authorize the expenditure of any funds for any purpose other than that for which the levy producing such funds was made.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any amendments made pursuant to this section to an originally adopted budget which exceed ten percent (10%) of the total amount appropriated or authorized to be expended in a particular department fund shall be published or posted within two (2) weeks of the action in a newspaper in the same manner as the final adopted budget. Separate amendments to an originally adopted budget during one fiscal year which affect a particular department fund shall be considered as one (1) amendment in determining whether the ten percent (10%) threshold requiring publication or posting has been reached. This publication or posted notice shall contain a description of the amendment, the amount of money and funds affected, and a detailed statement explaining the need and purpose of the amendment. The vote of each member of the municipality’s governing authority on each amendment shall be included in the publication or posted notice.

If upon examination the State Auditor determines that a municipality has not initiated efforts to comply with the requirements of subsection (1), the State Auditor shall file a certified written notice with the clerk of the municipality notifying the governing authority of the municipality that a certificate of noncompliance will be issued to the State Tax Commission and to the Attorney General thirty (30) days immediately following the date of the filing of the notice unless within that period the municipality substantially complies with the requirements of subsection (1). If, after thirty (30) days from the giving of the notice, the municipality, in the opinion of the State Auditor, has not substantially initiated efforts to comply with the requirements of subsection (1), the State Auditor shall issue a certificate of noncompliance to the clerk of the municipality, State Tax Commission and the Attorney General. Thereafter, the State Tax Commission shall withhold from all allocations and payments to the municipality that would otherwise be payable the amount necessary to pay one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the cost of preparing the required audit or report as contracted for by the State Auditor. The cost shall be determined by the State Auditor after receiving proposals for the audit or report required in subsection (1) of this section. The State Auditor shall notify the State Tax Commission of the amount in writing, and the State Tax Commission shall transfer that amount to the State Auditor.

       Notwithstanding contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff a city is liable for injuries sustained by the plaintiff where it was negligent in permitting unguarded hole to remain in sidewalk for a long period of time.

       It is negligence on the part of a city to allow part of its sidewalk to remain in a dangerous condition for travel for several months without taking precautions to give warning of the danger and a person injured thereby on a dark night, who had temporarily forgotten the condition of the street, may recover damages.

       Planning commission’s approval of a requested right-of-way vacation and realignment of a street was based on more than a mere scintilla of evidence and was neither arbitrary nor capricious because as the governing authority of the city, the city council had the power to vacate any portion of the public street; the layout of the street and the proposed realignment would not result in any change to the street.

       Circuit court did not err in upholding a city’s decision to adopt its planning commission’s approval of a requested right-of-way vacation and realignment of a street because the approval was based on more than a mere scintilla of evidence and was neither arbitrary nor capricious; both the planning commission and the city council considered substantial facts surrounding the property owner’s application, and the city’s decision to approve the application was reached after much consideration.

       Owners of property left in a cul-de-sac by the closing of a portion of a street to permit construction of a new highway are entitled to damages. Mississippi State Highway Com. v. Fleming, 248 Miss. 187, 157 So. 2d 792, 1963 Miss. LEXIS 390 (Miss. 1963).
      </p>
      <p>
       A suit for damages in anticipation that the city would close an alley in violation of statute, and that the State Highway Commission would enter upon the alley and obstruct it by a dirt embankment was prematurely brought where no damages had yet resulted. Collins v. Mississippi State Highway Com., 233 Miss. 474, 102 So. 2d 678, 1958 Miss. LEXIS 405 (Miss. 1958).
      </p>
      <p>
       An ordinance proposing to close a portion of a street lying between school property and public park which in effect converted the public park into a school playground, contrary to the purposes for which the park was dedicated, was void. Board of Mayor & Aldermen v. Wilson, 232 Miss. 435, 99 So. 2d 674, 1958 Miss. LEXIS 291 (Miss. 1958).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where there was a finding by chancellor that closing of street was for public good, in a suit by landowners, whose land did not abut on the closed section of the street, closing ordinance did not violate the constitution. Puyper v. Pure Oil Co., 215 Miss. 121, 60 So. 2d 569, 1952 Miss. LEXIS 545 (Miss. 1952).
      </p>
      <p>
       The adoption of street closing ordinance was itself a determination by the mayor and board of aldermen that the public interest and welfare required that the street be closed. Puyper v. Pure Oil Co., 215 Miss. 121, 60 So. 2d 569, 1952 Miss. LEXIS 545 (Miss. 1952).
      </p>
      <p>
       An ordinance which closed a street did not in effect constitute a donation of portion of right of way of an old highway to private corporation in violation of the constitution, despite the fact that upon closing the abandoned right of way reverted by operation of law to the abutting property owner. Puyper v. Pure Oil Co., 215 Miss. 121, 60 So. 2d 569, 1952 Miss. LEXIS 545 (Miss. 1952).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where full power is granted to authorities of municipality to vacate streets, they may act upon their own motion and any petition of property owners as a basis of the proceeding is not necessary in the absence of statute requiring it. Puyper v. Pure Oil Co., 215 Miss. 121, 60 So. 2d 569, 1952 Miss. LEXIS 545 (Miss. 1952).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a section of a street was closed by an ordinance and where the landlord landowners whose lands did not abut on section of the street which was closed and who had sufficient and adequate access to and from their lands after the closing and also sustained no special damage other than that suffered by public at large, these landowners were not deprived of property without due process of law by the enactment of the ordinance. Puyper v. Pure Oil Co., 215 Miss. 121, 60 So. 2d 569, 1952 Miss. LEXIS 545 (Miss. 1952).
      </p>
      <p>
       The courts of the state have jurisdiction to grant relief against improperly closing an alley by ordinance as such act is a judicial and not a legislative act. Polk v. Hattiesburg, 109 Miss. 872, 69 So. 675, 1915 Miss. LEXIS 236 (Miss. 1915).
      </p>

       One who in pursuance of an ordinance closed a street was not subject to punishment under a statute prohibiting the closing of public highways, which statute did not refer to streets in municipalities. Blocker v. State, 72 Miss. 720, 18 So. 388, 1895 Miss. LEXIS 43 (Miss. 1895).

   City’s ordered termination of two dead end streets did not order the closure of active streets under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t21c37s21-37-7" target="_self">21-37-7</a></cite>, but simply ordered the aforementioned streets to remain unchanged from their current condition. The city, therefore, acted appropriately under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t21c37s21-37-3" target="_self">21-37-3</a></cite>, and the construction company which filed a preliminary plat seeking extension of said streets to its subdivision was owed no compensation. Charles E. Morgan Constr. Co. v. City of Starkville, 909 So. 2d 1145, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 67 (Miss. Ct. App. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Under former section an abutting owner may recover at least nominal damages for the closing of a street or alley. Mississippi State Highway Com. v. Jacobs, 248 Miss. 476, 160 So. 2d 201, 1964 Miss. LEXIS 532 (Miss. 1964).
      </p>
      <p>
       Recovery of damages for the flooding of plaintiff’s premises in consequence of an embankment closing one end of an alley upon which they abutted is not permissible under a declaration seeking damages for destruction of the usefulness of the alley as a means of access. Mississippi State Highway Com. v. Rhymes, 248 Miss. 468, 160 So. 2d 197, 1964 Miss. LEXIS 531 (Miss. 1964).
      </p>
      <p>
       One not an abutting owner, who will be compelled by the closing of an alley to take a less direct route to his place of business, is not a “person aggrieved” by a determination of the city to close the alley, so as to be entitled to appeal therefrom. Hattisburg v. Colson, 236 Miss. 237, 109 So. 2d 868, 1959 Miss. LEXIS 312 (Miss. 1959).
      </p>
      <p>
       Mortgagees of abutting lots are not “persons aggrieved” so as to have a right to appeal from the city’s determination to close an alley, unless the adequacy of their security will be impaired by such closing. Hattisburg v. Colson, 236 Miss. 237, 109 So. 2d 868, 1959 Miss. LEXIS 312 (Miss. 1959).
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the city had no power to close an alley except upon first making due compensation to the abutting landowners, if the city had closed the alley without making due compensation and the State Highway Commission had entered upon and obstructed it by a dirt embankment, the city and Highway Commission would have been jointly liable. Collins v. Mississippi State Highway Com., 233 Miss. 474, 102 So. 2d 678, 1958 Miss. LEXIS 405 (Miss. 1958).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where complainants’ property, which fronted on city street, was divided in half by a highway and where also access to each half was obstructed by highway median strip, which was extended across the street at highway intersection without the city’s consent, the complainants were abutting property owners under former section [Code 1942, § 3374-127]. Hamilton v. Mississippi State Highway Com., 220 Miss. 340, 70 So. 2d 856, 1954 Miss. LEXIS 446 (Miss. 1954).
      </p>
      <p>
       The general rule is that one whose property does not abut on the closing section of the street has no right to compensation for the closing or vacation of the street, if he still has reasonable access to the general system of the streets. Puyper v. Pure Oil Co., 215 Miss. 121, 60 So. 2d 569, 1952 Miss. LEXIS 545 (Miss. 1952).
      </p>
      <p>
       Landowner not entitled to compensation for closing of street which did not abut his property. Town of Wesson v. Swinney, 144 Miss. 867, 110 So. 669, 1926 Miss. LEXIS 421 (Miss. 1926).
      </p>
      <p>
       However, unless the abutting owner has special easement in the use of street in connection with his property for egress or regress he cannot complain of its abandonment by the city. City of Jackson v. Welch, 136 Miss. 223, 101 So. 361, 1924 Miss. LEXIS 120 (Miss. 1924).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where such abutting owner has other convenient access to his property by other streets he cannot complain of the closing of a street which does not deprive him of such convenient and reasonable access. City of Jackson v. Welch, 136 Miss. 223, 101 So. 361, 1924 Miss. LEXIS 120 (Miss. 1924).
      </p>
      <p>
       Authority to vacate streets given under this section does not empower a municipality to vacate them, on a condition reserving a right to re-open it, without making compensation to abutting owners, as such a condition is void. Berry v. Mendenhall, 104 Miss. 94, 61 So. 163, 1913 Miss. LEXIS 11 (Miss. 1913).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a continuous street although known by different names at the north and south ends, formed a continuous street in front of plaintiff’s property, it is held that plaintiff was an “abutting owner” and the city could not vacate the street and permit the erection of a railroad depot therein without first making compensation to plaintiff. Alabama & V. R. Co. v. Turner, 95 Miss. 594, 52 So. 261 (Miss. 1909).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section does not require compensation to be first paid to a person damaged by closing a street who has no property abutting such street where closed. Poythress v. Mobile & O. R. Co., 92 Miss. 638, 46 So. 139, 1908 Miss. LEXIS 217 (Miss. 1908).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where it is made to appear to the authorities that the safety of the public demands it, it is within their power to close a street and a person being damaged thereby may recover damages against the city for so doing. Poythress v. Mobile & O. R. Co., 92 Miss. 638, 46 So. 139, 1908 Miss. LEXIS 217 (Miss. 1908).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section does not dispense with the necessity of compensating abutting property owners. Laurel Improv. Co. v. Rowell, 84 Miss. 435, 36 So. 543, 1904 Miss. LEXIS 69 (Miss. 1904).
      </p>
      <p>
       When a municipality closes a street it deprives the owners of abutting land of a right which is property and which cannot be taken except on due compensation being first made under Const. 1890 § 17. Laurel Improv. Co. v. Rowell, 84 Miss. 435, 36 So. 543, 1904 Miss. LEXIS 69 (Miss. 1904).

       Trial court properly upheld a city’s closure of a portion of a road because without the closure, an intersection would impede the flow of vehicular traffic and constitute a danger to the safety of the traveling public; landowners were not entitled to compensation because their properties did not abut the closed portion of the road.

      </p>
      <p>
       If a factual determination is made that a street has been abandoned by a city, title automatically reverts to the adjoining landowners with no need to formally convey the property; when there is no presumption of abandonment and a factual determination is made that it would be in the public interest to close a street, abutting landowners are entitled to due compensation if damages are sustained.

      <p>
       Municipalities may close public streets temporarily for public purposes, e.g., pending construction work, parades and festivals, regulation of traffic, or other valid purposes under the police power, and this authority includes the authority to temporarily close streets to prevent injury to, destruction of, or interference with public or private property, based upon a finding of necessity; however, absent exigent circumstances, there is no authority for a municipality to regularly prohibit use of a public street at night by some citizens while allowing use of it by others.

       The term “abutting landowners” in this section means only those property owners whose land abuts directly on that portion of street to be closed. Compensation is only due if the governing authorities close or vacate an alley or street by ordinance, and the abutting property owners have incurred damages. Young, Feb. 14, 2005, A.G. Op. 05-0051.

       § 21-37-21.
    Public cemeteries; cemetery board of trustees authorized in certain municipalities.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The governing authorities of municipalities shall have the power and authority to maintain, repair, and enlarge all of the public cemeteries owned or controlled by such municipalities, within or without the municipal limits, at the expense of the treasury of such municipality.
     </p>
     <p>
      The governing authorities of a municipality, in its discretion, may maintain and repair any abandoned public or private nonprofit cemetery located within the corporate boundaries of the municipality. The expense of the maintenance of an abandoned public or private nonprofit cemetery may be paid from any available municipal funds. For the purposes of this section, the term “public or private nonprofit cemetery” includes an abandoned community, religious or fraternal cemetery; however, the term does not include family burial grounds or a for-profit perpetual care cemetery that is subject to Sections 41-43-31 through 41-43-57. “Abandoned cemetery” means a cemetery which shows signs of neglect, including, without limitation, the unchecked growth of vegetation, repeated and unchecked acts of vandalism, or the disintegration of grave markers or boundaries and for which no person can be found who is legally responsible and financially capable of the upkeep of such cemetery.
     </p>
     <p>
      Should there be situated wholly within the corporate limits of any municipality a cemetery which, because of age, abandonment of graves by private owners, or for other good cause, is not being properly maintained, and thereby becomes detrimental to the public health and welfare, and should the governing authorities of that municipality determine that it is to the best interest of the municipality that the municipality assume the maintenance of such cemetery, then such governing authorities shall have the power and they are hereby authorized to acquire title to such cemetery by gift, purchase, eminent domain, or otherwise and are authorized to thereafter maintain, repair, enlarge, fence or otherwise improve such cemetery.
     </p>
     <p>
      The governing authorities of any municipality having a population in excess of seven thousand five hundred (7,500) according to the latest available federal census and being located in a county having an area in excess of eight hundred twenty-five (825) square miles which is traversed by a link of the National System of Interstate and Defense Highways, may, in its discretion, appoint a cemetery board of trustees of not less than five (5) nor more than seven (7) members to serve for staggered terms of office with full power and authority to administer and operate its cemetery, including but not limited to authority for the establishment of a fund, from a portion of the proceeds from the sale of cemetery lots, to be held in trust and invested by the trustees to the end of insuring perpetual care and maintenance of the cemetery with the least possible tax levies. The municipal governing authorities and the trustees are authorized and empowered to promulgate and adopt reasonable rules and regulations, not inconsistent with law, deemed essential in carrying out the provisions of this section.

     <p>
      The governing authorities of any municipality shall have the power and authority, in their discretion, to establish and construct municipal parking facilities for motor vehicles belonging to members of the general public, and to rent, lease, purchase, or otherwise acquire the necessary lands and property for the establishment or construction of such facilities, in any manner now authorized by law for the acquisition of land and property for public purposes.

      Such municipal governing authorities are empowered to operate and prescribe rules, regulations and rates for the use and operation of such parking facility. Such municipal governing authorities are empowered to employ, fix, and pay the compensation of necessary operating personnel. Such municipal governing authorities are empowered to rent, lease, or sell such facility at such price, but in no case at less than an amount sufficient to repay the cost thereof to the municipality, and on such terms as may be reasonable, but in no case at less than amounts sufficient to service and retire any bonds or notes issued in connection therewith, and conditioned that it shall continue for a specified period of time to be operated as a parking facility for the use of the public, subject to such rules, regulations and rates as may be prescribed by the municipality. No commercial enterprise activities other than the parking of motor vehicles shall be authorized by any municipality on the property comprising any part of such parking facilities.

       An ordinance declaring that it is the purpose of the city to avail itself of the provisions of Laws 1946, ch. 414, to establish parking facilities in the city is not sufficient to authorize the city thereafter to establish such parking facilities as it may desire without the adoption of an ordinance declaring the necessity therefor. City of Jackson v. Craft, 36 So. 2d 149 (Miss. 1948).
      </p>
      <p>
       Laws 1946, ch. 414, requires the governing authority of a municipality to determine whether the parking facility it proposes to establish is necessary and will relieve traffic congestion before it adopts the ordinance establishing the facility, and before public notice is given of the adoption thereof. City of Jackson v. Craft, 36 So. 2d 149 (Miss. 1948).
      </p>
      <p>
       When a municipality desires to establish a parking facility, it must comply with the provisions of section 5 of the statute (Laws 1946, ch. 414) by adopting an ordinance, in language appropriate to the requirements of that section, declaring that a specified municipal parking facility is necessary to relieve street traffic congestion, the description or specification of the contemplated location being required by necessary implications. City of Jackson v. Craft, 36 So. 2d 149 (Miss. 1948).

       A City Council has no authority, under Laws 1946, ch. 414 to delegate to the Mayor the duty of selecting the locality for the parking facilities it proposes to establish and determining the necessity therefor. City of Jackson v. Craft, 36 So. 2d 149 (Miss. 1948).

      4. the securing of land for parks, cemeteries, schoolhouses, fire departments, market houses, and for the constructing of any public building;
     </p>
     <p>
      5. the laying out, constructing, erecting or perfecting of levees, or a system of levees, for the protection of such municipality or any part thereof, or for the protection of any public work or building, and for the constructing or perfecting of its drainage system;

       That proceedings in eminent domain were authorized and directed by resolution rather than by ordinance by city operating under legislative charter providing that city may exercise right of eminent domain and that deeds and contracts necessary to be made in writing shall be authorized by resolution of council is immaterial, as distinction between two devices when applied to specific act is one of language only and it is the formal attested action of council expressive of its determination that counts.

       The governing body of a municipality possesses only such authority as is conferred upon it by its charter or by general statutes, together with such powers as are necessary to give effect to the powers granted. Mayor & Bd. of Aldermen v. Engle, 211 Miss. 380, 51 So. 2d 564 (1951).
      </p>
      <p>
       A city can do and perform all acts for which it has authority under its charter from the State from which it derives its existence, except such as may be in conflict with the Constitution. City of Indianola v. Sunflower County, 209 Miss. 116, 46 So. 2d 81, 1950 Miss. LEXIS 367 (Miss. 1950).
      </p>
      <p>
       Powers delegated by the Legislature to municipalities are intended to be exercised in conformity to, and consistent with the general laws of the State, and are to be construed most strongly against a power or right claimed but not clearly given. King v. Louisville, 207 Miss. 612, 42 So. 2d 813, 1949 Miss. LEXIS 374 (Miss. 1949).
      </p>
      <p>
       Municipal powers are only those expressly conferred by statute, and neccessarily implied. Such powers belong to the municipality and not to its officers. Tullos v. Magee, 181 Miss. 288, 179 So. 557, 1938 Miss. LEXIS 70 (Miss. 1938).
      </p>
      <p>
       Municipalities can exercise no powers except such as are delegated to them by the state expressly or by necessary implication. Steitenroth v. Jackson, 99 Miss. 354, 54 So. 955, 1911 Miss. LEXIS 212 (Miss. 1911).
      </p>
      <p>
       A municipality operating under the code chapter on municipalities is restricted in its powers to those conferred by said chapter. City of Hazlehurst v. Mayes, 96 Miss. 656, 51 So. 890, 1910 Miss. LEXIS 199 (Miss. 1910).
      </p>

       A municipality cannot be allowed to exercise powers not clearly given it by its charter. Crittenden v. Booneville, 92 Miss. 277, 45 So. 723, 1908 Miss. LEXIS 177 (Miss. 1908).

      <p>
       Former section gave the broad power to a municipality to purchase and hold real estate and personal property; under such a broad power, it is a general rule of interpretation that there is embraced and included the lesser power to lease, unless there is in the very nature of the use and control of the property an implied inhibition against a lease. Accordingly, a municipality was held liable for the reasonable use of a fire engine where the contract of sale thereof was invalid for failure to follow statutory requirements. American-Lafrance, Inc. v. Philadelphia, 183 Miss. 207, 184 So. 620, 1938 Miss. LEXIS 234 (Miss. 1938).

       Where a purported lease contract giving to a college an option to purchase the leased property was ultra vires in that the special act under which the municipal authorities acted did not authorize the giving of an option, the option provision could not be upheld under the authority of this section. Whitworth College, Inc. v. Brooklhaven, 161 F. Supp. 775, 1958 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2424 (D. Miss.), aff'd, 261 F.2d 868, 1958 U.S. App. LEXIS 3368 (5th Cir. Miss. 1958).
      </p>
      <p>
       The power of a municipality to contract with reference to any subject matter must either be expressly covered by its charter or by general statute, or necessarily implied therefrom. Mayor & Bd. of Aldermen v. Engle, 211 Miss. 380, 51 So. 2d 564 (1951).

      In municipalities in which there is more than one newspaper qualified to publish legal notices, the governing authorities of such municipality shall enter into a contract for the publication of its proceedings, ordinances, resolutions, and other notices required to be published only after inviting competitive bids from such newspapers. Such contracts shall be let to the lowest bidder among them for a period of not more than twelve months from the date of such contract. It shall not be necessary, however, that the governing authorities of such municipality advertise its intention to accept such competitive bids but it shall be sufficient if notice thereof in writing be given to all of such newspapers by mail or delivery at least five days prior to the date on which said bids will be received, which said notice shall specify the date on which such bids will be received.

      The clerk of the municipality shall open and keep a regular set of records, as prescribed by the State Auditor, as the head of the State Department of Audit, or the director thereof, appointed by him, as designated and defined in Title 7, Chapter 7, of the Mississippi Code of 1972, or any office or officers hereafter designated to replace or perform the duties imposed by said chapter, subject always to inspection within office hours by any citizen desiring to inspect the same. Said records shall contain accounts, under headings, corresponding with the several headings of the budget, so that the expenditures under each head may be at once known. Such records shall be paid for out of the general municipal fund, upon the order of the proper municipal authorities. Said clerk shall also mark filed, as of the date of presentation of same, each and every claim against said municipality. He shall number the same in regular consecutive order, shall file and keep the same in like manner, and shall safely preserve the same as records of his office.

     <p>
      Each year’s records shall be kept separate and begin with a new number each year, and run in regular order.
     </p>
     <p>
      In issuing any warrant under order of the governing authorities of the municipality to pay any one of said claims so numbered and kept, said clerk shall enter the number of the claim in the body of the warrant so that the claim may be easily found, and so that possible duplication may be avoided. The governing authorities of the municipality shall designate on each allowance of a claim against the municipality the fund out of which same shall be paid, and to what account the sums shall be charged in said records. Each allowance shall have the number of the claim noted in the minutes of said governing authorities.
     </p>
     <p>
      For failure to perform any duty herein required, said clerk shall be subject to suit on his bond for any damage which the municipality may sustain by reason of such failure. Such suit, or suits, shall be brought by the city attorney or by any attorney designated and empowered to do so by the proper governing authorities of such municipality.

     </h3>
     <p>
      In all municipalities having a population of more than two thousand (2,000), according to the latest federal census, and in other municipalities where the governing authorities should so elect, it shall be the duty of the clerk of the municipality to keep as a record in his office a record to be styled “Docket of Claims,” in which he shall enter all demands, claims and accounts against the municipality presented to him during the month. Said docket shall provide space for the name of the claimant, the number of the claim, the amount of the claim, and on what account. All demands, claims and accounts allowed against the municipality shall be preserved by the clerk as a permanent record, and shall be numbered in such a manner as to relate to the warrants to be issued therefor, and the said warrant issued in payment of such claim shall carry on its face a reference to the number of the claim for which the said warrant is issued in payment. No order for the payment or expenditures of any funds of such municipality in payment of any indebtedness thereof shall be made in municipalities having a claim docket unless such claim is filed as herein provided. However, this provision shall not be applicable to the salaries or other compensation of officers or employees of such municipality where the amount of such salary or other compensation shall have been previously fixed by the governing authorities of the municipality in its approval of the payroll or payrolls on which the same appears, and in case of such allowance, it will be sufficient to enter on the claims docket the total of such payroll, followed by reference to the said payroll upon which such allowance may be found.

       The statute applies to Mayor-Council forms of government and requires that all warrants or checks issued by a municipality be attested by the city clerk; the city clerk’s signature should appear on all warrants or checks issued by the municipality, whether in payment of accounts payable or payroll, attesting the validity and genuineness of the document; the use of a check signing machine is in lieu of the above procedure, and if a city has adopted the usage of a check signing machine, the city may forego the attestation by the clerk if it deems same “meet and proper for the protection of the interest of the municipality.” Peterson, Nov. 30, 2001, A.G.

       § 21-39-21.
    Disposition of lost, stolen, abandoned or misplaced personal property.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The governing authorities of any municipality, upon the receipt or recovery of any lost, stolen, abandoned or misplaced personal property by the marshal, police or other officers of such municipality, shall cause to be posted, in three (3) public places in the municipality, notice that such property has been received or recovered. Such notice shall contain an accurate and detailed description of such property and, if the governing authorities are advised as to who owns such property, a copy of such notice shall be mailed to such person or persons in addition to being posted as herein required. The owner of such property may recover the same by filing a claim with the governing authorities of the municipality and establishing his right thereto. The governing authorities may require bond of the person claiming the property before delivering same to him. Parties having adverse claims to said property may proceed according to law as now provided by statutes.
     </p>
     <p>
      If no person claims the property within one hundred twenty (120) days from the date the notice provided for above is given, the governing authorities of the municipality shall cause the same to be sold at public auction to the highest bidder for cash after first posting notice of such sale in three (3) public places in the municipality at least ten (10) days preceding the date of such sale. The notice shall contain a detailed and accurate description of the property to be sold and shall be addressed to the unknown owners or other persons interested in the property to be sold. The notice shall also set forth the date, time and place such sale is to be conducted and shall designate the person who is to make the sale, which person shall be some official designated by the governing authorities of the municipality.
     </p>
     <p>
      However, lost, stolen, abandoned or misplaced motor vehicles and bicycles may be sold in the manner provided in the preceding paragraph after the expiration of ninety (90) days from their receipt or recovery by the officers of a municipality.
     </p>
     <p>
      The person or officer designated and making the sale of such property shall promptly upon completion of the sale deliver to the clerk of the municipality a copy of the notice authorizing the sale, a list of the property sold, the amount paid for each item, the person to whom each item was sold, and all monies received from such sale, whereupon, the clerk shall deposit the monies in the general fund of the municipality and shall file the information concerning the sale among the other records of his office.
     </p>
     <p>
      If, within ninety (90) days after date of the sale provided for above, any person claims to be the owner of the property sold, the governing authorities shall, upon satisfactory proof of ownership, pay to such person the amount for which such property was sold, and the governing authorities of the municipality may require of such person a bond in such cases as they may deem advisable. No action shall be maintained against a municipality or any of its officers or employees or the purchaser at the sale for any property sold hereunder or the proceeds therefrom after the expiration of ninety (90) days from the date of the sale as herein authorized.
     </p>
     <p>
      A municipality may deduct wrecker and storage fees, not to exceed Five Hundred Dollars ($500.00), from the amount returned to the owner after the sale of property by the municipality. However, a municipality may not deduct wrecker and storage fees from the amount returned to the owner if the owner can prove the property was stolen and notifies the municipality.

       Miss. Code Section 21-39-21 gives governing authorities of any municipality procedure for disposing of “any lost, stolen, abandoned or misplaced personal property”; there is no statutory definition of “abandoned property” under this section; failure of owners of property seized in contemplation of forfeiture, where forfeiture proceeding did not take place promptly, qualified property as “abandoned”. Magee, Jan. 8, 1993, A.G. Op. #92-0909.
      </p>
      <p>
       Municipalities cannot immobilize a vehicle for five days and then declare it to be abandoned and sell it; however, if vehicles remain at the impoundment lot or other storage facility for the required 120 days, after due notice has been provided to the owner, they may be deemed abandoned and sold. Pace, March 10, 2000, A.G. Op. #2000-0111.
      </p>
      <p>
       The manner in which deadly weapons should be disposed of depends on the manner in which they were seized; specifically, Section 41-29-177 provides for the manner in which a weapon that has been seized and forfeited under the Uniform Controlled Substances Law should be disposed of; for all other deadly weapons that are seized, Section 45-9-151 should be followed; Section 21-39-21 is a general statute dealing with lost, stolen, abandoned or misplaced property, but Section 45-9-151 is specific to deadly weapons and therefore the more specific statute should be followed.
   Malta, May 26, 2000, A.G. Op. #2000-0221.
      </p>
      <p>
       A vehicle reported by the Chicago Police Department
   to have been stolen and subsequently abandoned by that Department may be disposed of by the governing authorities of a city pursuant to statutory procedures. The city should make reasonable efforts to locate and notify the owner of the vehicle before selling it. If there is no buyer at a public auction the city may convert it to municipal use. Tutor, July 18, 2003, A.G. Op. 03-0347.
      </p>
      <p>
       County may entertain an ordinance to provide for handling and disposition of lost or abandoned property to the extent such is not addressed elsewhere under the law, and further provided such ordinance comports with due process and otherwise passes constitutional muster. If there is no county ordinance in place that deals with the disposition of lost property, it would probably be safe for the county to follow the notice guidelines established in Section 21-39-21. Stewart, May 20, 2005, A.G. Op. 05-0181.

       Special improvement statutes are legitimate exercises of the taxing power of the legislature. Ramond v. Bay St. Louis, 218 So. 2d 719, 1969 Miss. LEXIS 1613 (Miss. 1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       Special or local improvement statutes can be utilized for street improvements designated by the city council. Ramond v. Bay St. Louis, 218 So. 2d 719, 1969 Miss. LEXIS 1613 (Miss. 1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       Under this and other sections, a municipality, acting under the commission form of government, had all the powers possessed by other municipalities, except as otherwise provided by statute, and it was authorized to enter into a paving contract sued upon. Independent Paving Co. v. Bay St. Louis, 74 F.2d 961, 1935 U.S. App. LEXIS 3576 (5th Cir. Miss. 1935).
      </p>
      <p>
       In construing Laws 1912 ch. 260 city must pursue the statute with strictness. Dean v. Senatobia, 142 Miss. 815, 108 So. 178, 1926 Miss. LEXIS 142 (Miss. 1926).
      </p>
      <p>
       Clear and unambiguous provisions of the statute will be enforced although conflicting with provisions of prior statutes, regardless of provisions that it shall not repeal any other statute relating to same subject matter. Stingily v. Jackson, 140 Miss. 19, 104 So. 465, 1925 Miss. LEXIS 235 (Miss. 1925).
      </p>
      <p>
       The constitutional provisions against reviving or amending the statute by reference to title only held not to refer to repeal or modification of statute because of conflict with provisions of later statute. Stingily v. Jackson, 140 Miss. 19, 104 So. 465, 1925 Miss. LEXIS 235 (Miss. 1925).
      </p>

       Laws 1912 ch. 260 construed with reference to changing the mode of assessment and levy with reference to changing the mode of improvement previously adopted. Firm Lumber Co. v. Hattiesburg, 133 Miss. 808, 98 So. 145, 1923 Miss. LEXIS 179 (Miss. 1923).

     </h3>
     <p>
      When the governing authorities of any municipality shall determine to make any local or special improvement, the cost of which or any part thereof is to be assessed against the property benefited, they shall adopt a resolution declaring necessary the proposed improvement describing the nature and extent of the work, the general character of the material to be used, and the location and terminal points of the streets, highways, boulevards, avenues, squares, alleys or parks, or parts thereof, or clearly define the boundary of areas in which said improvements are to be made. In publishing said resolution declaring the work necessary, the plans and specifications of said work need not be published but may be referred to as being on file in the office of the city clerk or city engineer. The publication of the resolution may be made as provided in Section 21-17-19. Said resolution shall fix a date when the governing authorities of said municipality shall meet, which shall be not less than fifteen (15) days after the date of the first publication of the notice herein provided for, to hear any objections or remonstrances that may be made to said improvements. The notice herein provided for shall be published once each week for three (3) successive publications in a public newspaper having a general circulation in the municipality, and if no newspaper is published therein it shall be sufficient to post said notice in three (3) public places of the municipality for not less than fifteen (15) days before said meeting, one which shall be posted at the town or city hall of said municipality. Moreover, the clerk of the municipality shall send a copy of the notice, by certified mail, postage prepaid, within five (5) days after the first publication of the notice herein provided for, to the last-known address of owners of property affected by the resolution. However, failure of the clerk to mail such notice or failure of the owner to receive such notice shall not invalidate any proceeding in this chapter, where such notice has been published as provided herein. Notice declaring the work necessary shall be notice to the property owners that the work has been declared necessary.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the governing authorities of a municipality desire to make any special or local improvement under the Regional Economic Development Act, the governing authorities also shall comply with any requirements provided therein.

       A resolution of a city council which recited, among other things, that on certain streets the majority of property owners owning more than 50 percent of the front footage of the property and actually residing on the property or otherwise actually occupying the property filed protests against certain designated streets, and that those were removed from the proposed improvement, and further stated that other streets on which there was not a majority protesting were included in the improvement program, the resolution contained no jurisdictional defects; and it was not necessary to adjudicate evidentiary facts which the mayor and commissioners considered prior to making their determinations on the ultimate facts.

       In a proceeding to authorize construction and financing of the street where the only issue left undecided was the amount of the special assessment tax upon various landowners and proper notice was given and no objection was entered until all the work was completed, the property owners were estopped to raise questions previously decided by the city council.

       Where the city council gave notice on September 12, 1949, to hear and consider protests of property owners whose lands abutted on streets and avenues mentioned in a resolution to make special improvements and resolution was also published in the manner and for the time required by law, a protest filed on May 5th, 1951, was not filed in due time and should not be sustained.

       This section [Code 1942, § 3364-04] permits written objections only up to the time set for the validation hearing, and thereafter it was within the discretion of the chancellor to allow or overrule a motion to amend objections filed by the protestants.

       § 21-41-9.
    Whole or part of cost of improvement may be charged against property benefited.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The resolution determining to proceed with the said improvement may direct that the cost and expense of the improvements authorized, or such part as the governing authorities shall fix, shall be a charge upon the property benefited. In said resolution the governing authorities shall direct that the whole or such part of the cost and expense thereof, as they shall fix, shall be assessed against the property abutting upon the improvement, according to the frontage thereof, in the following manner: by taking the number of front feet improved and dividing the total cost of the whole improvement thereby and multiplying the quotient by the number of front feet contained in such abutting lot or pieces of ground; the result shall be assessed by the governing authorities as the amount of the special tax to be assessed against each lot or piece of ground, except that the entire cost of improvements as to sidewalks, curbs, and gutters shall be assessed against the property on which said improvements or any of them abut for its entire frontage only.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the case of water mains, water connections, sanitary sewers or sanitary disposal systems, the said resolution shall provide that the entire cost thereof, or so much of the same as the governing authorities of the municipality shall fix, shall be assessed against either the property benefited or the property on which each such improvement is located, without regard to the front footage of such improvement.
     </p>
     <p>
      Alternatively, in the case of sanitary sewers and sanitary disposal systems, the said resolution may define the entire area to be benefited by the improvement, and may direct that the cost to be assessed against each lot or parcel of land shall be determined by dividing the entire cost thereof by the total number of front feet fronting on all the streets embraced within said improvement area, and multiplying the quotient by the number of feet of street frontage in any particular lot or parcel of land. The result thereof shall be assessed by the governing authorities as the amount of special tax against each lot or piece of ground for the owner’s part of the cost of the entire improvement.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the case of storm sewers and surface drains or drainage systems, the said resolution shall clearly define the area to be benefited by the improvement contemplated, and shall determine that the cost of the improvement to be assessed against each lot or parcel of land within said area shall be determined by dividing the entire cost of the improvement by the total number of square feet in the area defined, and multiplying the quotient by the number of square feet contained in any particular lot or parcel of land within said area. The result thereof shall be assessed by the governing authorities as the amount of special tax against each lot or piece of ground as the owner’s part of the cost of the entire improvement. However, if a majority of the property owners owning more than fifty percent (50%) of the property involved and determined to be benefited by the contemplated improvement shall file a protest, then such improvement shall not be made.

     <p>
      Upon the completion of any improvement authorized by this chapter, the governing authorities shall ascertain and determine the cost of the improvement and declare the same by resolution. Upon said completion the governing authorities shall cause to be prepared a roll or list to be called the “assessment roll” showing the names of the property owners, and, opposite each name a description of each parcel of land. Such roll shall be entered in a well-bound book prepared for that purpose, which shall contain appropriate columns in which payments may be credited. Said book shall be known as “assessment book for local improvements.” It shall be a public record and the entry therein of any assessment shall be and constitute notice to the public of the lien against the land so assessed, and no other record or notice thereof shall be necessary to any person or corporation for that purpose. No error, omission or mistake in regard to the name of the owner shall be held to invalidate any assessment. After the completion of the said assessment roll it shall be delivered to the clerk of the municipality, or to the officer performing the duties of such clerk, who shall thereupon give a notice by publication in some newspaper published in said municipality that the assessment roll (for that piece of local improvement made) has been delivered to him and is open for inspection at his office, and that at a time and place therein mentioned, not less than fifteen days from the date of the first publication, the governing authorities of said municipality will meet to hear and determine any objections or defense.

     <p>
      Assessments shall be made and apportioned in the manner fixed by the resolution of the governing authorities determining to proceed with the improvement. The owner of any property assessed for an improvement, or any party having an interest therein, may appear at the time and place fixed for the hearing and determining of any objections or defense, and object to the proposed assessment against the property or to the amount thereof. The governing authorities of the municipality shall hear and determine all objections and protests to the proposed assessment, under such reasonable rules and regulations as they may adopt. At such meeting, or at any adjournment thereof, the governing authorities may alter, change or correct any assessment; however, no assessment shall be increased without notice to the owner of the property. The governing authorities shall, by resolution, approve and confirm all assessments as finally fixed and adjusted at the said hearing, and said assessments shall, from the date of such confirmation, constitute a lien upon the respective lots or parcels of lands and other real property upon which they are levied, superior to all other liens except those for state and county taxes. All persons who fail to object to the proposed assessments, in the manner herein provided shall be deemed to have consented to and approved the same. Any property owner aggrieved by the decision of the governing authorities may appeal to the circuit court.

      All special assessments levied under the provisions of this chapter, unless otherwise provided by the governing authorities, shall become due and shall be paid to the treasurer of the municipality, (or to the officer performing the duties of such treasurer) in full within ninety (90) days from the date of confirmation thereof. However, the governing authorities of the municipality may by resolution confer upon the property owners who admit the legality of the assessment the privilege of paying the assessment in not exceeding twenty (20) equal installments with interest from the date of the confirmation at the same rate as that fixed in the bonds issued to raise money to pay the cost of the said improvements, which is to be paid in whole or in part by the owners of property abutting to the proposed improvements. Any property owner who shall not have taken an appeal from the assessment, shall, upon failure to pay said assessment in full within ninety (90) days from the date of confirmation, be deemed to have elected to pay said assessment in installments as herein provided, and he shall be deemed to have admitted the legality of the assessment and shall thereby waive all right to contest the validity thereof. The installments of said assessment shall be due and payable at the same time that the annual municipal tax becomes due and payable commencing with the first municipal tax levy, which is payable after the expiration of ninety days from the date of confirmation of the assessment.

     <p>
      The governing authorities shall annually certify to the tax collector, or other officer charged with the duty of collecting taxes in the municipality, the annual installment of assessment due from each tract of land against which an assessment has been levied, together with the amount of the interest upon all unpaid installments at the same rate as that fixed in the bonds issued to raise money to pay the cost of the said improvements, which is to be paid in whole or in part by the owners of property abutting to the proposed improvements. In the event no bonds are issued to raise money to pay the cost of the said improvements, which is to be paid in whole or in part by the owners of property abutting to the proposed improvements, then the said assessments shall bear a rate of interest not to exceed six per centum per annum, and shall be fixed by the governing authorities of the municipality making such improvements at the time when the said assessments are made final. In the event any municipality has made assessments for special improvements authorized by law and there are special improvement bonds outstanding which are paid by special assessments levied against property abutting the streets so improved, the governing authorities of such municipality shall change the interest on such assessments to equal the rate of interest fixed in such bonds and such change shall become effective on the date the governing authorities take such action and shall not be retroactive. Any property owner who has elected to pay his assessment in installments shall have the right at any time to pay the balance of the assessment against his property in full, but in so doing he shall be required to pay all interest which would have accrued thereon had same not been paid until its maturity.
     </p>
     <p>
      The collector shall thereupon enter upon the annual tax roll of the municipality, in a separate column, the amount of the installment and interest to be collected from each tract of land assessed, and said collector shall collect said installment, together with the interest upon all unpaid installments, together with, and at the same time he collects the annual municipal tax.

The collector shall annually report to the clerk of the municipality, or to the officer performing the duties of such clerk, the installments paid in that year. The clerk of the municipality, or the officer performing the duties of such clerk, shall note such payments on the “assessment book for local improvements.” When an assessment is paid in full, or upon the payment of the last installment thereof, the clerk shall note on said “assessment book for local improvements” opposite the assessment, “paid in full.” Upon the payment of each installment an appropriate note thereof shall be made opposite such assessment on said book, so that the amount of the assessment against any property assessed under the provisions of this chapter, which remains a lien upon said property may be determined by reference to the “assessment book for local improvements.”

     <p>
      If there exists upon a portion of a tract of land sold for delinquent assessments, a lien either of a deed of trust or mortgage of any kind, or if a portion of a tract of land sold for said delinquent assessments is owned by one who does not own the entire portion sold, then, subject to the provisions herein stated, the mortgagee or holder of the notes secured by such deed of trust, or the owner of such portion, or any person interested in such real estate, may redeem that portion of the land so sold in solido, upon which portion such mortgagee or owner of notes, or owner of less than the whole of the real estate is interested, in the following manner, to-wit:
     </p>
     <p>
      Such mortgagee, or owner of notes secured by deed of trust, owner, or other person interested, may apply in writing to the municipal clerk within the time provided by law for redemption from sale of taxes to be permitted to redeem such portion of such entire tract so sold in solido in which he is interested. Upon the application being filed with him, it shall be the duty of the municipal clerk to give ten days’ notice in writing of such application by registered mail to the last known post office address, with return receipt requested, to the owner and to the purchaser at the tax sale, and to all persons holding mortgages or other liens of record on the land so sold in solido, or any part thereof, which notice shall designate a time not less than ten days from the mailing thereof when the governing authorities of the municipality shall hear and perform the duties hereinafter provided for. The clerk shall enter on the record of such tax sale notations giving the date when such notices were mailed, and the names and post office addresses of persons to whom mailed. On the date named for such hearing the governing authorities shall make such investigation as they may deem necessary to ascertain the relative value which that portion of land on which the lien of such mortgage or deed of trust is held by the applicant, or of which said applicant may be the owner, or otherwise interested, bears to the value of the entire land sold in solido for special assessment, and whether or not that portion not sought to be redeemed will remain adequate security for any assessment thereon. Should the governing authorities of the municipality determine from such investigation that that portion not sought to be redeemed will be adequate security and the interest of the municipality not adversely affected by permitting less than the whole to be redeemed, then they shall so adjudicate and fix and determine the amount of special improvement assessments which should be applied to each separate portion. The mortgagee or holder of the deed of trust, or owner, or any person interested in such real estate, shall thereupon be entitled to redeem that part of the land so sold by payment of the sum fixed thereon by such governing authorities, regardless of the amount of the purchaser’s bid at the tax sale, with its proportionate part calculated as above provided of all costs, damages and interest consequent upon the sale, and also all subsequent instalments which have accrued prior to the date of said redemption, together with all municipal ad valorem taxes that have accrued upon that portion of said land being redeemed, apportioned in the manner hereinabove provided, and together with interest thereon at the rate of one per centum per month, or any fractional part thereof, from the dates such installments and taxes shall have accrued. If the sale was made to an individual purchaser, the municipality shall upon such redemption, refund to the purchaser the proportionate amount because of said redemption, which shall in nowise affect the purchaser’s rights in so far as that portion which was not redeemed is concerned. Likewise, upon such redemption of less than the whole, in case of sale to the municipality, the municipality’s rights in so far as that portion not redeemed are concerned, shall not be in anywise affected.
     </p>
     <p>
      The decision of the governing authorities as to the right to redeem less than the whole shall be final. Any aggrieved party shall have the right to appeal as in other cases.

     <p>
      If any municipality in this state, including those operating under a special charter, having the power to construct or cause to be made improvements consisting of grading, paving, graveling or any other form of improvement to its streets, avenues, alleys, sidewalks, gutters, sewerage or drainage, has levied or assessed or charged the cost thereof against the property abutting thereon and to the owners thereof, and has paid such cost and has not been paid therefor in full, and if in the judgment of the governing authorities of said municipalities, errors or irregularities have occurred in the assessing or computing of such cost, then such municipality is hereby authorized and empowered to ascertain the cost thereof and to add thereto accrued and unpaid interest, and to declare the same by resolution, and to correct errors or irregularities in said former assessment or assessments accordingly. In no event, however, shall the principal amount thereof, exclusive of interest, be increased.
     </p>
     <p>
      When such errors or irregularities have been corrected, the assessment or assessments so made, and all steps and proceedings leading up thereto or precedent thereto are hereby confirmed and validated for all purposes and against all persons, and said assessment or assessments shall be in lieu of the assessment or assessments in which said errors or irregularities have been made or occurred. Such further proceedings may be had thereon to provide for and fix a lien on said property to secure the payment of said assessment or assessments, and for enforcing the collection thereof, and otherwise, in the same manner as is provided in this chapter, when valid assessments have been made that are not erroneous or irregular.
     </p>
     <p>
      All orders, resolutions, ordinances, and proceedings relative to sidewalk, curb, or gutter improvements heretofore passed and adopted by any such municipality or its governing authorities, are hereby in all things made valid and binding regardless of defects or omissions or informalities or the failure to comply with any law or part of law relative thereto.
     </p>
     <p>
      If and when it shall have been determined by said governing authorities that an over-assessment shall have been made against such person or property, such governing authorities are hereby authorized and empowered to give credit for or refund the amount of such excess.

      <li id="t21c41s21-41-45ol11">
       The obligations so authorized by Section 21-41-41 may be issued at any time after the estimated cost of the special improvements shall have been ascertained by the governing authorities of the municipality, and the amount of indebtedness thereby incurred shall not exceed the estimated cost of such special improvements.
      </li>
      <li id="t21c41s21-41-45ol12">
       Any municipality which determines by resolution to borrow money under the authority of Section 21-41-41 may obtain interim financing in anticipation of such borrowing for one (1) or more of the local improvements authorized by Section 21-41-3 at any time after the estimated cost of each such improvement to be so financed has been ascertained. Such interim financing may be upon such terms and conditions and may bear interest at such rate or rates as are agreed between the municipality and the party advancing the interim funds or the purchaser of the obligations evidencing such indebtedness; provided, however, the maximum rate of interest thereon shall not exceed that established in Section 75-17-101, Mississippi Code of 1972.
      </li>
      <li id="t21c41s21-41-45ol13">
       Such interim financing shall be secured by and repaid from the proceeds of the permanent financing issued under this chapter and may be further secured by any earnings on the investment of the proceeds of the interim financing.

       The final maturity of such interim financing shall not exceed three (3) years after the completion date of any improvement being financed, as certified by the city engineer. Provided, however, that if the governing authorities of the municipality, after a good faith effort, determine by resolution that permanent financing under Section 21-41-41 cannot be obtained, the municipality may renew the interim financing for additional periods of six (6) months until such permanent financing can be obtained. The municipality may enter into agreements with one (1) or more lenders at any time obligating such lenders to provide renewal interim financing upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed by the municipality and the lenders.

      <li id="t21c41s21-41-45ol15">
       The same terms and conditions with respect to the giving of notice, presentation of petitions and holding of an election established in Sections 21-33-307 through 21-33-311, Mississippi Code of 1972, for the issuance of municipal bonds shall apply before a municipality may borrow money under the provisions of this section. Such borrowing shall be authorized by resolution of the governing authorities of the municipality and may be evidenced by a note or notes in negotiable form with coupons or fully-registered form without coupons. The indebtedness incurred hereunder shall not be considered when computing any limitation of indebtedness imposed by law on the municipality.
      </li>
      <li id="t21c41s21-41-45ol16">
       Such borrowing, whether or not evidenced by a negotiable note or notes, may be placed or sold at public or private sale for such price, in such manner and at such time or times as may be determined by the governing authorities of the municipality. All expenses, premiums and commissions deemed necessary or advantageous in connection with the issuance thereof may be paid by the municipality.

No proceedings shall be required for the borrowing of such funds other than those provided for and required herein, and all powers necessary to be exercised in order to carry out the provisions hereof are hereby conferred.

       Pursuant to Section 1-1-109, the Joint Legislative Committee on Compilation, Revision and Publication of Legislation corrected a typographical error in subsection (2). The words “any assets of the district remain shall be transferred” were changed to “any assets of the district remaining shall be transferred”. The Joint Committee ratified the correction at its May 20, 1998 meeting.

       As the statute contemplates that the business improvement district will cease to exist as soon after expiration of the five-year period as any outstanding indebtedness is satisfied, business improvement district funds may be used to pay for services already performed prior to the end of the plan but not yet paid for. Clark, Mar. 30, 2001, A.G. Op. #01-0122.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dissolution is automatic pursuant to the statute when a business improvement district plan terminates and no reauthorization has occurred; however, if the district is reauthorized, then it is not dissolved and the funds do not lapse to the municipality; rather, if the funds were included in the new plan as it was adopted, approved, and reauthorized, the funds are carried over to the district under the new five-year plan. Clark, Mar. 30, 2001, A.G. Op. #01-0122.

       Municipalities may, but are not required, to use the proceeds from bonds issued under the Tax Increment Financing Act to share in the costs of removing overhead utility and telecommunications lines and placing them underground when moving such lines underground is a component of a “redevelopment project” as defined in this section, and when such lines are located on a publicly owned easement or right-of-way. The question of whether other funding sources could be used to “participate” in the utility line relocations would have to be evaluated on a case by case basis. Mills, June 11, 2004, A.G.

       § 21-45-9.
    Issuance of tax increment bonds; issuance of refunding bonds; agreements with developers.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Any governing body may issue tax increment bonds, the final maturity of which shall not extend beyond thirty (30) years, for the purpose of financing all or a portion of the cost of a redevelopment project within the boundaries of the municipality, funding any reserve which the governing body may deem advisable in connection with the retirement of the proposed indebtedness and funding any other incidental expenses involved in incurring such indebtedness. The debt service of indebtedness incurred pursuant to this section shall be provided from the added increments of municipal and county ad valorem tax revenues or any portion of the sales taxes, or both, to result from any such redevelopment project, or sales tax revenue allocated for distribution to a county under Section 27-65-75(1)(d), and shall never constitute an indebtedness of the municipality within the meaning of any state constitutional provision or statutory limitation and shall never constitute nor give rise to a pecuniary liability of the municipality or a charge against its general credit or taxing powers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Said bonds may be authorized by resolution or resolutions of the governing body, and may be issued in one or more series, may bear such date or dates, mature at such time or times, bear interest at such rate or rates, payable at such times, be in such denominations, be in such form, be registered, be executed in such manner, be payable in such medium of payment, at such place or places, be subject to such terms of redemption, with or without premium, carry such conversion or registration privileges and be declared or become due before the maturity date thereof, as such resolution or resolutions may provide; however, such bonds shall not bear a greater interest rate to maturity than that allowed under Section 75-17-101. Said bonds shall be sold for not less than par value plus accrued interest at public sale in the manner provided by Section 31-19-25 or at private sale, in the discretion of the governing body. The lowest interest rate specified for any bonds issued shall not be less than seventy percent (70%) of the highest interest rate specified for the same bond issue. Said bonds may be repurchased by the municipality out of any available funds at a price not to exceed the principal amount thereof and accrued interest, and all bonds so repurchased shall be cancelled. In connection with the issuance of said bonds, the municipality shall have the power to enter into contracts for rating of the bonds by national rating agencies; obtaining bond insurance or guarantees for such bonds and complying with the terms and conditions of such insurance or guarantees; make provision for payment in advance of maturity at the option of the owner or holder of the bonds; covenant for the security and better marketability of the bonds, including, without limitation, the establishment of a debt service reserve fund and sinking funds to secure or pay such bonds; and make any other provisions deemed desirable by the municipality in connection with the issuance of said bonds.
     </p>
     <p>
      If a governing body desires to issue tax increment financing bonds under the Regional Economic Development Act, the governing body also shall comply with any requirements provided therein.
     </p>
     <p>
      In connection with the issuance of said bonds, the municipality may arrange for lines of credit with any bank, firm or person for the purpose of providing an additional source of repayment for such bonds and amounts drawn on such lines of credit may be evidenced by bonds, notes or other evidences of indebtedness containing such terms and conditions as the municipality may determine; provided, however, that such bonds, notes or evidences of indebtedness shall be secured by and payable from the same sources as are pledged to the payment of said bonds which are additionally secured by such line of credit, and that said bonds, notes or other evidences of indebtedness shall be deemed to be bonds for all purposes of this chapter. Pending the preparation or execution of definitive bonds, interim receipts or certificates, or temporary bonds may be delivered to the purchaser or purchasers of said bonds. Any provision of law to the contrary notwithstanding, any bonds, if any, issued pursuant to this chapter shall possess all of the qualities of negotiable instruments.
     </p>
     <p>
      The municipality may also issue refunding bonds for the purpose of paying any of its bonds at or prior to maturity or upon acceleration or redemption. Refunding bonds may be issued at such time prior to the maturity or redemption of the refunded bonds as the municipality may determine. The refunding bonds may be issued in sufficient amounts to pay or provide the principal of the bonds being refunded, together with any redemption premium thereon, any interest accrued or to accrue to the date of payment of such bonds, the expenses of issuing the refunding bonds, the expenses of redeeming the bonds being refunded, and such reserves for debt service or other capital or current expenses from the proceeds of such refunding bonds as may be required by any of the municipality’s resolutions, trust indenture or other security instruments. The issuance of refunding bonds, the maturities and other details thereof, the security therefor, the rights of the holders and the rights, duties and obligations of the municipality in respect of the same shall be governed by the provisions of this chapter relating to the issuance of bonds other than refunding bonds, insofar as the same may be applicable.
     </p>
     <p>
      Before incurring any debt pertaining to a redevelopment project incorporating a tax increment financing plan the governing body may, but shall not be required to, secure an agreement from one or more developers obligating such developer or developers:
     </p>
     <p>
      To effect the completion of all or any portion of the buildings or other facilities or improvements, as described in the redevelopment project, at no cost to the municipality;
     </p>
     <p>
      To pay all or any portion of the real property taxes due on the project in a timely manner; and
     </p>
     <p>
      To maintain and operate all or any portion of the buildings or other facilities or improvements of the project in such a manner as to preserve property values.
     </p>
     <p>
      No breach of any such agreement shall impose any pecuniary liability upon a municipality or any charge upon its general credit or against its taxing powers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Additionally, the municipality may enter into an agreement with the developer under which the developer may construct all or any part of the redevelopment project with private funds in advance of issuance of the bonds and may be reimbursed by the municipality for actual costs incurred by the developer upon issuance and delivery of the bonds and receipt of the proceeds, conditioned upon dedication of redevelopment project by the developer to the municipality to assure public use and access. This condition shall not apply to the privately owned portion of a project for which the Mississippi Development Authority has issued a certificate of convenience and necessity pursuant to the Regional Economic Development Act. In addition, this condition shall not apply to the privately owned portion of a redevelopment project where the governing body of a municipality makes a finding that it is in the best interest of such municipality that such condition shall not apply.

       § 21-45-13.
    Security for principal, interest, and premium on tax increment bond.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The principal, interest and premium, if any, on any tax increment bond shall be secured by a pledge of the revenues payable to the municipality pursuant to the tax increment financing plan and may also be secured, in the discretion of the municipality, by a lien on all or any part of the redevelopment project and any security by any developer pursuant to and secured by a security agreement. The proceedings under which any indebtedness is authorized or any security agreement may contain any agreement or provisions customarily contained in instruments securing such obligations, without limiting the generality of the foregoing provisions respecting the construction, maintenance and operation of buildings or other facilities or improvements of the project, the creation and maintenance of special funds, the rights and remedies available in the event of default to the debt holders or to the trustee, all as the governing body shall deem advisable; provided, however, that in making any such agreements or provisions, no municipality shall have the power to obligate itself except with respect to:
     </p>
     <p>
      The proceeds of the bonds and any property purchased with the proceeds of the bonds;
     </p>
     <p>
      Any security pledged, mortgaged or otherwise made available by a developer for the securing of bonds or other indebtedness; and
     </p>
     <p>
      No municipality shall have the power to obligate itself except with respect to the application of the revenues from the tax increments; nor shall any municipality have the power to incur a pecuniary liability or charge upon its general credit or against its taxing powers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Tax increment financing bonds issued under the Regional Economic Development Act also may be secured as provided therein.
     </p>
     <p>
      The proceedings authorizing any bonds and any security agreement securing bonds may provide that in the event of default in payment of the principal of or interest on such bonds, or in the performance of any agreement contained in such proceedings or security agreement, such payment and performance may be enforced by mandamus or by appointment of a receiver in equity with such powers as may be necessary to enforce the obligations thereof. No breach of any such agreement shall impose any pecuniary liability upon any municipality or any charge upon its general credit or against its taxing powers.
     </p>
     <p>
      The trustee under any security agreement or any depository specified by such security agreement may be such persons or corporation as the governing body shall designate; provided, that they may be residents of Mississippi or nonresidents of Mississippi or incorporated under the laws of the United States or the laws of other states of the United States.

       After adoption of a redevelopment plan containing a tax increment financing plan the clerk shall certify the assessed value of the real property, including personal property located thereon, described in the tax increment financing plan. Property taxable at the time of the certification shall be included in the assessed value at its most recently determined valuation.
       <p>
        Property exempt from taxation at the time of the request shall be included at zero unless it was taxable when the tax increment financing plan was approved, in which case its most recently determined assessed valuation before it became exempt shall be included. These assessed values shall be, and will be referred to as, the “original assessed value.”

A municipality may choose to retain all or a portion of the captured assessed value for purposes of tax increment financing if the plan provides that all or a portion of the captured assessed value is necessary to finance the redevelopment project, including the cost of establishing necessary reserves to insure payment of revenue bonds.
       <p>
        If the tax increment financing plan provides that only a portion of the captured assessed value is necessary to finance the redevelopment program, only that portion shall be set aside and the remainder shall be apportioned to the various municipal tax levy funds and the various county tax levy funds.

Any increase in the amount collected within the boundaries shall be set aside by the municipality in the fund created by the tax increment financing plan.
       <p>
        Each redevelopment plan shall be approved in the same manner and at the same times provided in Section 43-35-13 for the approval of urban renewal plans. Any tax increment financing plan shall become effective on the same date as the redevelopment plan is approved.
