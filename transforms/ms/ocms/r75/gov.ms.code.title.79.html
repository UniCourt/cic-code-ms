    Execution of proxies by fiduciary without order or direction of court.
      </p>
      <p>
       Without obtaining the order or direction of any court or the judge thereof, in vacation, any fiduciary, including those acting as executor, administrator, guardian, agent or trustee, owning corporate stock registered in the name of the fiduciary, as such, or in the name of another for the convenience of the fiduciary, or in the names of more than one fiduciary, whether the corporation issuing such stock is foreign or domestic, may, in addition to the voting rights now vested in such fiduciary, execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, a proxy or proxies to others for the voting of such corporate stock, and may waive notice of and give consent to any meeting of stockholders of any corporation, regular or special, or a meeting of property owners, or cause such to be done, and may authorize in writing any action which could be taken by stockholders in meeting assembled, where such consent is authorized by statute, charter or certificate of incorporation, or bylaws, or cause such written consent to be given, but subject always to the following limitations:
      </p>
      <p>
       In granting any proxy, reasonable care must be exercised in deciding who shall act as proxy and whether or not instructions as to the voting of said stock shall be given to such proxy.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there are two or more fiduciaries acting, the proxy shall be executed by, and voting instructions shall be issued by, agreement of all fiduciaries or a majority of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the event the manner or method of voting, or the purposes to be accomplished, are fixed by the instrument or instruments appointing said fiduciaries, the directions contained therein shall govern.

      In a close corporation where a majority stockholder stands to benefit as a controlling stockholder, the majority’s action must be “intrinsically fair” to the minority interest. Thus, stockholders in close corporations must bear towards each other the same relationship of trust and confidence which prevails in partnerships, rather than resort to statutory defenses. This does not mean that directors, executive officers and stockholders are not required to adhere to the corporate statutes; rather, blind adherence to corporate statutes may not be used to circumvent the corporation’s by-laws, charter or various agreements, such as a stock redemption agreement, because of the “intrinsically fair” standard that is now adopted.

    Filing requirements.
    </p>
    <p>
     A document must satisfy the requirements of this section, and of any other section that adds to or varies these requirements, to be entitled to filing by the Secretary of State.
    </p>
    <p>
     Section 79-4-1.01 et seq. must require or permit filing the document in the Office of the Secretary of State.
    </p>
    <p>
     The document must contain the information required by Section 79-4-1.01 et seq. It may contain other information as well.
    </p>
    <p>
     The document must be typewritten or printed, or, if electronically transmitted, it must be in a format that can be retrieved or reproduced by the Secretary of State in typewritten or printed form.
    </p>
    <p>
     The document must be in the English language. A corporate name need not be in English if written in English letters or Arabic or Roman numerals, and the certificate of existence required of foreign corporations need not be in English if accompanied by a reasonably authenticated English translation.
    </p>
    <p>
     The document must be executed:
    </p>
    <ol>
     <li id="t79c04a01saBol11">
      By the chairman of the board of directors of a domestic or foreign corporation, by its president, or by another of its officers;
     </li>
     <li id="t79c04a01saBol12">
      If directors have not been selected or the corporation has not been formed, by an incorporator; or
     </li>
     <li id="t79c04a01saBol13">
      If the corporation is in the hands of a receiver, trustee or other court-appointed fiduciary, by that fiduciary.
     </li>
     <li id="t79c04a01saBol14">
      The following provisions of a plan or filed document may not be made dependent on facts outside the plan or filed document:
     </li>
     <li id="t79c04a01saBol15">
      If a provision of a filed document is made dependent on a fact ascertainable outside of the filed document, and that fact is not ascertainable by reference to a source described in subsection (k)(2)(i) or a document that is a matter of public record, or the affected shareholders have not received notice of the fact from the corporation, then the corporation shall file with the Secretary of State articles of amendment setting forth the fact promptly after the time when the fact referred to is first ascertainable or thereafter changes. Articles of amendment under this subsection (k)(5) are deemed to be authorized by the authorization of the original filed document or plan to which they relate and may be filed by the corporation without further action by the board of directors or the shareholders.
     </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
     The person executing the document shall sign it and state beneath or opposite his signature his name and the capacity in which he signs. The document may but need not contain a corporate seal, an attestation, acknowledgment or verification. A document required or permitted to be filed under this chapter which contains a copy of a signature, however made, is acceptable for filing.
    </p>
    <p>
     If the Secretary of State has prescribed a mandatory form for the document under Section 79-4-1.21, the document must be in or on the prescribed form.
    </p>
    <p>
     The document must be delivered to the Office of the Secretary of State for filing. Delivery may be made by electronic transmission if, to the extent and in the manner permitted by the Secretary of State. If it is filed in typewritten or printed form and not transmitted electronically, the Secretary of State may require one (1) exact or conformed copy to be delivered with the document.
    </p>
    <p>
     When the document is delivered to the Office of the Secretary of State for filing, the correct filing fee, and any franchise tax, license fee, or penalty required to be paid therewith by this section or any other law must be paid or provision for payment made in a manner permitted by the Secretary of State.
    </p>
    <p>
     Whenever a provision of this chapter permits any of the terms of a plan or a filed document to be dependent on facts objectively ascertainable outside the plan or filed document, the following provisions apply:
    </p>
    <p>
     The manner in which the facts will operate upon the terms of the plan or filed document shall be set forth in the plan or filed document.
    </p>
    <p>
     The facts may include, but are not limited to:
    </p>
    <p>
     Any of the following that is available in a nationally recognized news or information medium either in print or electronically: statistical or market indices, market prices of any security or group of securities, interest rates, currency exchange rates, or similar economic or financial data;

    <p>
     A determination or action by any person or body, including the corporation or any other party to a plan or filed document; or
    </p>
    <p>
     The terms of, or actions taken under, an agreement to which the corporation is a party, or any other agreement or document.

    Appeal from Secretary of State’s refusal to file document.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the Secretary of State refuses to file a document delivered to his office for filing, the domestic or foreign corporation may appeal the refusal to the chancery court of the county where the corporation’s principal office is or will be located, or the Chancery Court of the First Judicial District of Hinds County, Mississippi, if the corporation does not have a principal office in this state. The appeal is commenced by petitioning the court to compel filing the document and by attaching to the petition the document and the Secretary of State’s explanation of his refusal to file.
     </p>
     <p>
      The court may summarily order the Secretary of State to file the document or take other action the court considers appropriate.
     </p>
     <p>
      The court’s final decision may be appealed as in other civil proceedings.

    Notice.
     </p>
     <p>
      Notice under Section 79-4-1.01 et seq. must be in writing unless oral notice is reasonable in the circumstances. Unless otherwise agreed between the sender and the recipient, words in a notice or other communication under this chapter must be in English.
     </p>
     <p>
      A notice or other communication may be given or sent by any method of delivery, except that electronic transmissions must be in accordance with this section. If these methods of delivery are impracticable, a notice or other communication may be communicated by a newspaper of general circulation in the area where published, or by radio, television or other form of public broadcast communication.
     </p>
     <p>
      Notice or other communication to a domestic or foreign corporation authorized to transact business in this state may be delivered to its registered agent or to the secretary of the corporation at its principal office shown in its most recent annual report or, in the case of a foreign corporation that has not yet delivered an annual report, in its application for a certificate of authority.
     </p>
     <p>
      Notice or other communication may be delivered by electronic transmission if consented to by the recipient or if authorized by subsection (j) of this section.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any consent under subsection (d) of this section may be revoked by the person who consented by written or electronic notice to the person to whom the consent was delivered. Any such consent is deemed revoked if (1) the corporation is unable to deliver two (2) consecutive electronic transmissions given by the corporation in accordance with such consent, and (2) such inability becomes known to the secretary or an assistant secretary of the corporation or to the transfer agent, or other person responsible for the giving of notice or other communications; the inadvertent failure to treat such inability as a revocation shall not invalidate any meeting or other action.
     </p>
     <p>
      Unless otherwise agreed between the sender and the recipient, an electronic transmission is received when:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t79c04a01saDol21">
       It enters an information-processing system that the recipient has designated or uses for the purpose of receiving electronic transmissions or information of the type sent, and from which the recipient is able to retrieve the electronic transmission; and
      </li>
      <li id="t79c04a01saDol22">
       It is in a form capable of being processed by that system.
      </li>
      <li id="t79c04a01saDol23">
       If mailed by United States mail postage prepaid and correctly addressed to a recipient other than a shareholder, the earliest when it is actually received or:
      </li>
      <li id="t79c04a01saDol24">
       If an electronic transmission, when it is received as provided in subsection (f) of this section; and

       If oral, when communicated.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      Receipt of an electronic acknowledgement from an information-processing system described in subsection (f)(1) of this section establishes that an electronic transmission was received but, by itself, does not establish that the content sent corresponds to the content received.
     </p>
     <p>
      An electronic transmission is received under this section even if no individual is aware of its receipt.
     </p>
     <p>
      Notice or other communication, if in a comprehensible form or manner, is effective at the earliest of the following:
     </p>
     <p>
      If in physical form, the earliest of when it is actually received, or when it is left at:
     </p>
     <p>
      A shareholder’s address shown on the corporation’s record of shareholders maintained by the corporation under Section 79-4-16.01(c);
     </p>
     <p>
      A director’s residence or usual place of business; or
     </p>
     <p>
      The corporation’s principal place of business;
     </p>
     <p>
      If mailed postage prepaid and correctly addressed to a shareholder, upon deposit in the United States mail;
     </p>
     <p>
      If sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, the date shown on the return receipt signed by or on behalf of the addressee; or
     </p>
     <p>
      Five (5) days after it is deposited in the United States mail;
     </p>
     <p>
      A notice or other communication may be in the form of an electronic transmission that cannot be directly reproduced in paper form by the recipient through an automated process used in conventional commercial practice only if (1) the electronic transmission is otherwise retrievable in perceivable form, and (2) the sender and the recipient have consented in writing to the use of such form of electronic transmission.
     </p>
     <p>
      If Section 79-4-1.01 et seq. prescribes requirements for notices or other communications in particular circumstances, those requirements govern. If articles of incorporation or bylaws prescribe requirements for notices or other communications, not inconsistent with this section or other provisions of Section 79-4-1.01 et seq., those requirements govern. The articles of incorporation or bylaws may authorize or require delivery of notices of meetings of directors by electronic transmission.

       Shareholders in bank seeking to enforce an agreement wherein defendant shareholders and certain of the complainants had pledged “individually not to seek control (of the bank) through ownership or control of stock by ourselves or any other person, and by proxy or otherwise” were not entitled to injunction requiring defendant signatories to vote their stock for the reelection of the present bank directors because the usage of the word “individually” in the agreement appeared to conflict with the subsequent phrase “through ownership or control of stock by ourselves or any other person,” and it was not therefore discernable whether the agreement contemplated that no signatory would seek to acquire or hold 51 percent of stock in the corporation or whether the agreement referred to joint action of the signatories; nor was evidence sufficient to justify the issuance of an injunction where there was no proof of resulting injury to the complaining shareholders stemming from the nomination by defendant shareholders of persons other than the present directors; moreover, stipulation of counsel as to who held how many shares of stock in proxy did not indicate that defendants could have succeeded in electing their nominees.

       An agricultural co-operative association organized under the act of Congress ( 7 USCS §§ 291,
   292) authorizing the formation of such associations for the sole purpose of providing marketing facilities and sales services to growers of cotton, is not a “corporation for profit,” within the meaning of the state statute, where the association, the stock of which is owned exclusively by regional and state co-operative associations, itself derives no profit from its activities, and in fact is expressly referred to in the act of Congress as being “not for profit,” and, although it is authorized to pay dividends on its preferred stock, this stock is simply for use in borrowing money from a governmental agency.

    Emergency bylaws.
       </p>
       <p>
        Unless the articles of incorporation provide otherwise, the board of directors of a corporation may adopt bylaws to be effective only in an emergency defined in subsection (d). The emergency bylaws, which are subject to amendment or repeal by the shareholders, may make all provisions necessary for managing the corporation during the emergency, including:
       </p>
       <ol>
        <li id="t79c04a02ol31">
         Procedures for calling a meeting of the board of directors;
        </li>
        <li id="t79c04a02ol32">
         Quorum requirements for the meeting; and
        </li>
        <li id="t79c04a02ol33">
         Designation of additional or substitute directors.
        </li>
       </ol>
       <p>
        All provisions of the regular bylaws consistent with the emergency bylaws remain effective during the emergency. The emergency bylaws are not effective after the emergency ends.
       </p>
       <p>
        Corporate action taken in good faith in accordance with the emergency bylaws:
       </p>
       <p>
        Binds the corporation; and
       </p>
       <p>
        May not be used to impose liability on a corporate director, officer, employee or agent.
       </p>
       <p>
        An emergency exists for purposes of this section if a quorum of the corporation’s directors cannot readily be assembled because of some catastrophic event.

        In a property damage case, because there was no authority cited for the proposition that an action filed on behalf of a dissolved corporation should have been treated as being filed against a partnership, appellate review of the issue was precluded. In addressing the merits of the issue, it was determined that a dissolved corporation could not have been a real party in interest because it had been dissolved more than eight years before the alleged incident took place, and there was an opportunity given to substitute the real party in interest.

    Emergency powers.
      </p>
      <p>
       In anticipation of or during an emergency defined in subsection (d), the board of directors of a corporation may:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li id="t79c04a03ol21">
        Modify lines of succession to accommodate the incapacity of any director, officer, employee or agent; and
       </li>
       <li id="t79c04a03ol22">
        Relocate the principal office, designate alternative principal offices or regional offices, or authorize the officers to do so.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       During an emergency defined in subsection (d), unless emergency bylaws provide otherwise:
      </p>
      <p>
       Notice of a meeting of the board of directors need be given only to those directors whom it is practicable to reach and may be given in any practicable manner, including by publication and radio; and
      </p>
      <p>
       One or more officers of the corporation present at a meeting of the board of directors may be deemed to be directors for the meeting, in order of rank and within the same rank in order of seniority, as necessary to achieve a quorum.
      </p>
      <p>
       Corporate action taken in good faith during an emergency under this section to further the ordinary business affairs of the corporation:
      </p>
      <p>
       Binds the corporation; and
      </p>
      <p>
       May not be used to impose liability on a corporate director, officer, employee or agent.
      </p>
      <p>
       An emergency exists for purposes of this section if a quorum of the corporation’s directors cannot readily be assembled because of some catastrophic event.

    Reserved name.
     </p>
     <p>
      A person may reserve the exclusive use of a legal corporate name that complies with Section 79-4-4.01, including a fictitious name for a foreign corporation whose corporate name is not available, by delivering an application to the Secretary of State for filing. However, no person or corporation may reserve the name “In God We Trust” which name shall be reserved to the people of the State of Mississippi, as a symbol thereof. The application must set forth the name and address of the applicant and the name proposed to be reserved. If the Secretary of State finds that the corporate name applied for is available, the Secretary of State shall reserve the name for the applicant’s exclusive use for a one-hundred-eighty-day period. The one-hundred-eighty-day period may be renewed once by the applicant by filing a renewal application within thirty (30) days before the expiration of the initial one-hundred-eighty-day period.
     </p>
     <p>
      The owner of a reserved corporate name may transfer the reservation to another person by delivering to the Secretary of State a signed notice of the transfer that states the name and address of the transferee.
     </p>
     <p>
      The reservation of a specified name may be cancelled by delivering to the Secretary of State a notice of cancellation, specifying the name of the reservation to be cancelled and the name and address of the owner or transferee.
     </p>
     <p>
      Unless the Secretary of State finds that any application, notice of transfer, or notice of cancellation filed with the Secretary of State as required by this section does not conform to law, upon receipt of all filing fees required by law the Secretary of State shall prepare and return to the person who filed the instrument a copy of the filed instrument with a notation thereon of the action taken by the Secretary of State.
     </p>
     <p>
      A fee as set forth in Section 79-4-1.22 of this chapter shall be paid at the time of the reservation of any name and at the time of the filing of a notice of the transfer or cancellation of any such reservation.

    Authorized shares.
   </p>
   <p>
    The articles of incorporation must set forth any classes of shares and series of shares within a class, and the number of shares of each class and series, that the corporation is authorized to issue. If more than one (1) class or series of shares is authorized, the articles of incorporation must prescribe a distinguishing designation for each class or series and must describe, prior to the issuance of shares of a class or series, the terms, including the preferences, rights, and limitations of that class or series. Except to the extent varied as permitted by this section, all shares of a class or series must have terms, including preferences, rights and limitations that are identical with those of other shares of the same class or series.
   </p>
   <p>
    The articles of incorporation must authorize:
   </p>
   <ol>
    <li id="t79c04a06saAol11">
     One or more classes or series of shares that together have unlimited voting rights, and
    </li>
    <li id="t79c04a06saAol12">
     One or more classes or series of shares (which may be the same class or classes as those with voting rights) that together are entitled to receive the net assets of the corporation upon dissolution.
    </li>
    <li id="t79c04a06saAol13">
     Entitle the holders to distributions calculated in any manner, including dividends that may be cumulative, noncumulative or partially cumulative; or
    </li>
    <li id="t79c04a06saAol14">
     Have preference over any other class or series of shares with respect to distributions, including distributions upon the dissolution of the corporation.
    </li>
   </ol>
   <p>
    The articles of incorporation may authorize one or more classes or series of shares that:
   </p>
   <p>
    Have special, conditional or limited voting rights, or no right to vote, except to the extent otherwise provided by Section 79-4-1.01 et seq.;
   </p>
   <p>
    Are redeemable or convertible as specified in the articles of incorporation (i) at the option of the corporation, the shareholder or another person or upon the occurrence of a specified event; (ii) for cash, indebtedness, securities or other property; and (iii) at prices and in amounts specified or determined in accordance with a formula;
   </p>
   <p>
    Terms of shares may be made dependent upon facts objectively ascertainable outside the articles of incorporation in accordance with Section 79-4-1.20(k).
   </p>
   <p>
    Any of the terms of shares may vary among holders of the same class or series so long as such variations are expressly set forth in the articles of incorporation.
   </p>
   <p>
    The description of the preferences, rights and limitations of classes or series of shares in subsection (c) is not exhaustive.

    Subscription for shares before incorporation.
   </p>
   <p>
    A subscription for shares entered into before incorporation is irrevocable for six (6) months unless the subscription agreement provides a longer or shorter period or all the subscribers agree to revocation.
   </p>
   <p>
    The board of directors may determine the payment terms of subscriptions for shares that were entered into before incorporation, unless the subscription agreement specifies them. A call for payment by the board of directors must be uniform so far as practicable as to all shares of the same class or series, unless the subscription agreement specifies otherwise.
   </p>
   <p>
    Shares issued pursuant to subscriptions entered into before incorporation are fully paid and nonassessable when the corporation receives the consideration specified in the subscription agreement.
   </p>
   <p>
    If a subscriber defaults in payment of money or property under a subscription agreement entered into before incorporation, the corporation may collect the amount owed as any other debt. Alternatively, unless the subscription agreement provides otherwise, the corporation may rescind the agreement and may sell the shares if the debt remains unpaid more than twenty (20) days after the corporation sends a written demand for payment to the subscriber.
   </p>
   <p>
    A subscription agreement entered into after incorporation is a contract between the subscriber and the corporation subject to Section 79-4-6.21.

    Issuance of shares.
   </p>
   <p>
    The powers granted in this section to the board of directors may be reserved to the shareholders by the articles of incorporation.
   </p>
   <p>
    The board of directors may authorize shares to be issued for consideration consisting of any tangible or intangible property or benefit to the corporation, including cash, promissory notes, services performed, contracts for services to be performed, or other securities of the corporation.
   </p>
   <p>
    Before the corporation issues shares, the board of directors must determine that the consideration received or to be received for shares to be issued is adequate. That determination by the board of directors is conclusive insofar as the adequacy of consideration for the issuance of shares relates to whether the shares are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.
   </p>
   <p>
    When the corporation receives the consideration for which the board of directors authorized the issuance of shares, the shares issued therefor are fully paid and nonassessable.
   </p>
   <p>
    The corporation may place in escrow shares issued for a contract for future services or benefits or a promissory note, or make other arrangements to restrict the transfer of the shares, and may credit distributions in respect of the shares against their purchase price, until the services are performed, the note is paid or the benefits received. If the services are not performed, the note is not paid or the benefits are not received, the shares escrowed or restricted and the distributions credited may be cancelled in whole or part.

    A stockholder in an insolvent corporation who has not paid the stock subscription is liable to the creditors of the corporation and may be sued therefor, and the debt so due by him may be subjected by garnishment as well as in a direct prosecution, and although the subscription is, by its terms, payable on the call of the directors, and no such call has been in fact made.

    Share dividends.
   </p>
   <p>
    Unless the articles of incorporation provide otherwise, shares may be issued pro rata and without consideration to the corporation’s shareholders or to the shareholders of one or more classes or series. An issuance of shares under this subsection is a share dividend.
   </p>
   <p>
    Shares of one class or series may not be issued as a share dividend in respect of shares of another class or series unless (1) the articles of incorporation so authorize, (2) a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by the class or series to be issued approve the issue, or (3) there are no outstanding shares of the class or series to be issued.
   </p>
   <p>
    If the board of directors does not fix the record date for determining shareholders entitled to a share dividend, it is the date the board of directors authorizes the share dividend.

   <p>
    A corporation may issue rights, options or warrants for the purchase of shares or other securities of the corporation. The board of directors shall determine (i) the terms upon which the rights, options or warrants are issued, and (ii) the terms, including the consideration for which the shares or other securities are to be issued.

    Form and content of certificate.
   </p>
   <p>
    Shares may but need not be represented by certificates. Unless this act or another statute expressly provides otherwise, the rights and obligations of shareholders are identical whether or not their shares are represented by certificates.
   </p>
   <p>
    At a minimum each share certificate must state on its face:
   </p>
   <ol>
    <li id="t79c04a06saBol11">
     The name of the issuing corporation and that it is organized under the law of this state;
    </li>
    <li id="t79c04a06saBol12">
     The name of the person to whom issued; and
    </li>
    <li id="t79c04a06saBol13">
     The number and class of shares and the designation of the series, if any, the certificate represents.
    </li>
   </ol>
   <p>
    If the issuing corporation is authorized to issue different classes of shares or different series within a class, the designations, relative rights, preferences and limitations applicable to each class and the variations in rights, preferences and limitations determined for each series (and the authority of the board of directors to determine variations for future series) must be summarized on the front or back of each certificate or the corporation must furnish the shareholder this information on request in writing and without charge.
   </p>
   <p>
    Each share certificate (1) must be signed (either manually or in facsimile) by two (2) officers designated in the bylaws or by the board of directors, and (2) may bear the corporate seal or its facsimile.
   </p>
   <p>
    If the person who signed (either manually or in facsimile) a share certificate no longer holds office when the certificate is issued, the certificate is nevertheless valid.

    Restriction on transfer of shares and other securities.
   </p>
   <p>
    The articles of incorporation, bylaws, an agreement among shareholders or an agreement between shareholders and the corporation may impose restrictions on the transfer or registration of transfer of shares of the corporation. A restriction does not affect shares issued before the restriction was adopted unless the holders of the shares are parties to the restriction agreement or voted in favor of the restriction.
   </p>
   <p>
    A restriction on the transfer or registration of transfer of shares is valid and enforceable against the holder or a transferee of the holder if the restriction is authorized by this section and its existence is noted conspicuously on the front or back of the certificate or is contained in the information statement required by Section 79-4-6.26(b). Unless so noted, a restriction is not enforceable against a person without knowledge of the restriction.
   </p>
   <p>
    A restriction on the transfer or registration of transfer of shares is authorized:
   </p>
   <ol>
    <li id="t79c04a06saBol21">
     To maintain the corporation’s status when it is dependent on the number or identity of its shareholders;
    </li>
    <li id="t79c04a06saBol22">
     To preserve exemptions under federal or state securities law;
    </li>
    <li id="t79c04a06saBol23">
     For any other reasonable purpose.
    </li>
    <li id="t79c04a06saBol24">
     Prohibit the transfer of the restricted shares to designated persons or classes of persons, if the prohibition is not manifestly unreasonable.
    </li>
   </ol>
   <p>
    A restriction on the transfer or registration of transfer of shares may:
   </p>
   <p>
    Obligate the shareholder first to offer the corporation or other persons (separately, consecutively or simultaneously) an opportunity to acquire the restricted shares;
   </p>
   <p>
    Obligate the corporation or other persons (separately, consecutively or simultaneously) to acquire the restricted shares;
   </p>
   <p>
    Require the corporation, the holders of any class of its shares or another person to approve the transfer of the restricted shares, if the requirement is not manifestly unreasonable;
   </p>
   <p>
    For purposes of this section, “shares” includes a security convertible into or carrying a right to subscribe for or acquire shares.

    Shareholders’ preemptive rights.
   </p>
   <p>
    The shareholders of a corporation do not have a preemptive right to acquire the corporation’s unissued shares except to the extent the articles of incorporation so provide.
   </p>
   <p>
    A statement included in the articles of incorporation that “the corporation elects to have preemptive rights” (or words of similar import) means that the following principles apply except to the extent the articles of incorporation expressly provide otherwise:
   </p>
   <ol>
    <li id="t79c04a06saCol11">
     The shareholders of the corporation have a preemptive right granted on uniform terms and conditions prescribed by the board of directors to provide a fair and reasonable opportunity to exercise the right, to acquire proportional amounts of the corporation’s unissued shares upon the decision of the board of directors to issue them.
    </li>
    <li id="t79c04a06saCol12">
     A shareholder may waive his preemptive right. A waiver evidenced by a writing is irrevocable even though it is not supported by consideration.
    </li>
    <li id="t79c04a06saCol13">
     There is no preemptive right with respect to:
    </li>
    <li id="t79c04a06saCol14">
     Holders of shares of any class without general voting rights but with preferential rights to distributions or assets have no preemptive rights with respect to shares of any class.
    </li>
    <li id="t79c04a06saCol15">
     Holders of shares of any class with general voting rights but without preferential rights to distributions or assets have no preemptive rights with respect to shares of any class with preferential rights to distributions or assets unless the shares with preferential rights are convertible into or carry a right to subscribe for or acquire shares without preferential rights.
    </li>
    <li id="t79c04a06saCol16">
     Shares subject to preemptive rights that are not acquired by shareholders may be issued to any person for a period of one (1) year after being offered to shareholders at a consideration set by the board of directors that is not lower than the consideration set for the exercise of preemptive rights. An offer at a lower consideration or after the expiration of one (1) year is subject to the shareholders’ preemptive rights.
    </li>
   </ol>
   <p>
    Shares issued as compensation to directors, officers, agents or employees of the corporation, its subsidiaries or affiliates;
   </p>
   <p>
    Shares issued to satisfy conversion or option rights created to provide compensation to directors, officers, agents or employees of the corporation, its subsidiaries or affiliates;
   </p>
   <p>
    Shares authorized in articles of incorporation that are issued within six (6) months from the effective date of incorporation;
   </p>
   <p>
    Shares sold otherwise than for money.
   </p>
   <p>
    For purposes of this section, “shares” includes a security convertible into or carrying a right to subscribe for or acquire shares.

    Distributions to shareholders.
   </p>
   <p>
    A board of directors may authorize and the corporation may make distributions to its shareholders subject to restriction by the articles of incorporation and the limitation in subsection (c).
   </p>
   <p>
    If the board of directors does not fix the record date for determining shareholders entitled to a distribution (other than one involving a purchase, redemption or other acquisition of the corporation’s shares), it is the date the board of directors authorizes the distribution.
   </p>
   <p>
    No distribution may be made if, after giving it effect:
   </p>
   <ol>
    <li id="t79c04a06saDol11">
     The corporation would not be able to pay its debts as they become due in the usual course of business; or
    </li>
    <li id="t79c04a06saDol12">
     The corporation’s total assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities plus (unless the articles of incorporation permit otherwise) the amount that would be needed, if the corporation were to be dissolved at the time of the distribution, to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution of shareholders whose preferential rights are superior to those receiving the distribution.
    </li>
    <li id="t79c04a06saDol13">
     In all other cases, as of (i) the date the distribution is authorized if the payment occurs within one hundred twenty (120) days after the date of authorization, or (ii) the date the payment is made if it occurs more than one hundred twenty (120) days after the date of authorization.
    </li>
   </ol>
   <p>
    The board of directors may base a determination that a distribution is not prohibited under subsection (c) either on financial statements prepared on the basis of accounting practices and principles that are reasonable in the circumstances or on a fair valuation or other method that is reasonable in the circumstances.
   </p>
   <p>
    Except as otherwise provided in subsection (g), the effect of a distribution under subsection (c) is measured;
   </p>
   <p>
    In the case of distribution by purchase, redemption or other acquisition of the corporation’s shares, as of the earlier of (i) the date money or other property is transferred or debt incurred by the corporation, or (ii) the date the shareholder ceases to be a shareholder with respect to the acquired shares;
   </p>
   <p>
    In the case of any other distribution of indebtedness, as of the date the indebtedness is distributed; and
   </p>
   <p>
    A corporation’s indebtedness to a shareholder incurred by reason of a distribution made in accordance with this section is at parity with the corporation’s indebtedness to its general, unsecured creditors except to the extent subordinated by agreement.
   </p>
   <p>
    Indebtedness of a corporation, including indebtedness issued as a distribution, is not considered a liability for purposes of determinations under subsection (c) if its terms provide that payment of principal and interest are made only if and to the extent that payment of a distribution to shareholders could then be made under this section. If the indebtedness is issued as a distribution, each payment of principal or interest is treated as a distribution, the effect of which is measured on the date the payment is actually made.
   </p>
   <p>
    This section shall not apply to distributions in liquidation under Article 14 (Section 79-4-14.01 et seq.).

    Action without meeting.
   </p>
   <p>
    Action required or permitted by Section 79-4-1.01 et seq. to be taken at a shareholders’ meeting may be taken without a meeting if the action is taken by all the shareholders entitled to vote on the action. The action must be evidenced by one or more written consents describing the action taken, signed by all the shareholders entitled to vote on the action and delivered to the corporation for inclusion in the minutes or filing with the corporate records. A unanimous consent signed under this subsection is the act of the shareholders when consents signed by all shareholders have been delivered to the corporation.
   </p>
   <p>
    The articles of incorporation may provide that any action required or permitted by Section 79-4-1.01 et seq. to be taken at a shareholder’s meeting may be taken without a meeting and without prior notice, if consents in writing setting forth the action so taken are signed by the holders of outstanding shares having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be required to authorize or take the action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote on the action were present and voted. The written consent shall bear the date of signature of the shareholder who signs the consent and be delivered to the corporation for inclusion in the minutes or filing with the corporate records.
   </p>
   <p>
    If not otherwise fixed under Section 79-4-7.03 or 79-4-7.07, and if prior board action is not required respecting the action to be taken without a meeting, the record date for determining the shareholders entitled to take action without a meeting shall be the first date on which a signed written consent is delivered to the corporation. If not otherwise fixed under Section 79-4-7.03 or 79-4-7.07, and if prior board action is required respecting the action to be taken without a meeting, the record date shall be the close of business on the day the resolution of the board taking such prior action is adopted. No written consent shall be effective to take the corporate action referred to therein unless, within sixty (60) days of the earliest date on which a consent delivered to the corporation as required by this section was signed, written consents signed by the holders of shares having sufficient votes to take the action have been delivered to the corporation. A written consent may be revoked by a writing to that effect delivered to the corporation before unrevoked written consents sufficient in number to take the corporation action are delivered to the corporation.
   </p>
   <p>
    A consent signed pursuant to the provisions of this section has the effect of a vote taken at a meeting and may be described as such in any document. Unless the articles of incorporation, bylaws, or a resolution of the board of directors provides for a reasonable delay to permit tabulation of written consents, the action taken by less than unanimous written consent shall be effective when written consents signed by the holders of shares having sufficient votes to take the action are delivered to the corporation.
   </p>
   <p>
    If Section 79-4-1.01 et seq. requires that notice of a proposed action be given to nonvoting shareholders and the action is to be taken by written consent of the voting shareholders, the corporation must give its nonvoting shareholders written notice of the action not more than ten (10) days after (i) written consents sufficient to take the action have been delivered to the corporation, or (ii) such later date that tabulation of consents is completed pursuant to an authorization under subsection (d). The notice must reasonably describe the action taken and contain or be accompanied by the same material that, under Section 79-4-1.01 et seq., would have been required to be sent to nonvoting shareholders in a notice of a meeting at which the proposed action would have been submitted to the shareholders for action.
   </p>
   <p>
    If action is taken by less than unanimous written consent of the voting shareholders, the corporation must give its nonconsenting voting shareholders written notice of the action not more than ten (10) days after (i) written consents sufficient to take the action have been delivered to the corporation, or (ii) such later date that tabulation of consents is completed pursuant to an authorization under subsection (d). The notice must reasonably describe the action taken and contain or be accompanied by the same material that, under Section 79-4-1.01 et seq., would have been required to be sent to voting shareholders in a notice of a meeting at which the action would have been submitted to the shareholders for action.
   </p>
   <p>
    The notice requirements in subsections (e) and (f) shall not delay the effectiveness of actions taken by written consent, and a failure to comply with such notice requirements shall not invalidate actions taken by written consent, provided that this subsection shall not be deemed to limit judicial power to fashion any appropriate remedy in favor of a shareholder adversely affected by a failure to give such notice within the required time period.

    Notice of meeting.
   </p>
   <p>
    A corporation shall notify shareholders of the date, time and place of each annual and special shareholders’ meeting no fewer than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days before the meeting date. If the board of directors has authorized participation by means of remote communication pursuant to Section 79-4-7.09 for any class or series of shareholders, the notice of such class or series of shareholders shall describe the means of remote communication to be used. Unless Section 79-4-1.01 et seq. or the articles of incorporation require otherwise, the corporation is required to give notice only to shareholders entitled to vote at the meeting.
   </p>
   <p>
    Unless Section 79-4-1.01 et seq. or the articles of incorporation require otherwise, notice of an annual meeting need not include a description of the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called.
   </p>
   <p>
    Notice of a special meeting must include a description of the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called.
   </p>
   <p>
    If not otherwise fixed under Section 79-4-7.03 or 79-4-7.07, the record date for determining shareholders entitled to notice of and to vote at an annual or special shareholders’ meeting is the day before the first notice is delivered to shareholders.
   </p>
   <p>
    Unless the bylaws require otherwise, if an annual or special shareholders’ meeting is adjourned to a different date, time or place, notice need not be given of the new date, time or place if the new date, time or place is announced at the meeting before adjournment. If a new record date for the adjourned meeting is or must be fixed under Section 79-4-7.07, however, notice of the adjourned meeting must be given under this section to persons who are shareholders as of the new record date.

    Record date.
   </p>
   <p>
    The bylaws may fix or provide the manner of fixing the record date for one or more voting groups in order to determine the shareholders entitled to notice of shareholders’ meeting, to demand a special meeting, to vote, or to take any other action. If the bylaws do not fix or provide for fixing a record date, the board of directors of the corporation may fix a future date as the record date.
   </p>
   <p>
    A record date fixed under this section may not be more than seventy (70) days before the meeting or action requiring a determination of shareholders.
   </p>
   <p>
    A determination of shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a shareholders’ meeting is effective for any adjournment of the meeting unless the board of directors fixes a new record date, which it must do if the meeting is adjourned to a date more than one hundred-twenty (120) days after the date fixed for the original meeting.
   </p>
   <p>
    If a court orders a meeting adjourned to a date more than one hundred-twenty (120) days after the date fixed for the original meeting, it may provide that the original record date continues in effect or it may fix a new record date.

    Shareholders’ list for meeting.
   </p>
   <p>
    After fixing a record date for a meeting, a corporation shall prepare an alphabetical list of the names of all its shareholders who are entitled to notice of a shareholders’ meeting. The list must be arranged by voting group (and within each voting group by class or series of shares) and show the address of and number of shares held by each shareholder.
   </p>
   <p>
    The shareholders’ list must be available for inspection by any shareholder beginning two (2) business days after notice of the meeting is given for which the list was prepared and continuing through the meeting, at the corporation’s principal office or at a place identified in the meeting notice in the city where the meeting will be held. A shareholder, his agent or attorney is entitled on written demand to inspect and, subject to the requirements of Section 79-4-16.02(c), to copy the list during regular business hours and at his expense, during the period it is available for inspection.
   </p>
   <p>
    The corporation shall make the shareholders’ list available at the meeting, and any shareholder, his agent or attorney is entitled to inspect the list at any time during the meeting or any adjournment.
   </p>
   <p>
    If the corporation refuses to allow a shareholder, his agent or attorney to inspect the shareholders’ list before or at the meeting (or copy the list as permitted by subsection (b)), the chancery court of the county where a corporation’s principal office is located, or the Chancery Court of the First Judicial District of Hinds County, Mississippi, if the corporation does not have a principal office in this state, on application of the shareholder, may summarily order the inspection or copying at the corporation’s expense and may postpone the meeting for which the list was prepared until the inspection or copying is complete.
   </p>
   <p>
    Refusal or failure to prepare or make available the shareholders’ list does not affect the validity of action taken at the meeting.

   </p>
   <p>

    Proxies.
   </p>
   <p>
    A shareholder may vote his shares in person or by proxy.
   </p>
   <p>
    A shareholder or his agent or attorney-in-fact may appoint a proxy to vote or otherwise act for the shareholder by signing an appointment form or by electronic transmission. An electronic transmission must contain or be accompanied by information from which the recipient can determine the date of the transmission, and that the transmission was authorized by the sender or the sender’s agent or attorney-in-fact.
   </p>
   <p>
    An appointment of a proxy is effective when a signed appointment form or an electronic transmission of the appointment is received by the inspector of election or the officer or agent of the corporation authorized to tabulate votes. An appointment is valid for eleven (11) months unless a longer period is expressly provided in the appointment.
   </p>
   <p>
    An appointment of a proxy is revocable unless the appointment form or electronic transmission states that it is irrevocable and the appointment is coupled with an interest. Appointments coupled with an interest include the appointment of:
   </p>
   <ol>
    <li id="t79c04a07saBol11">
     A pledgee;
    </li>
    <li id="t79c04a07saBol12">
     A person who purchased or agreed to purchase the shares;
    </li>
    <li id="t79c04a07saBol13">
     A creditor of the corporation who extended it credit under terms requiring the appointment;
    </li>
    <li id="t79c04a07saBol14">
     An employee of the corporation whose employment contract requires the appointment; or
    </li>
    <li id="t79c04a07saBol15">
     A party to a voting agreement created under Section 79-4-7.31.
    </li>
   </ol>
   <p>
    The death or incapacity of the shareholder appointing a proxy does not affect the right of the corporation to accept the proxy’s authority unless notice of the death or incapacity is received by the secretary or other officer or agent authorized to tabulate votes before the proxy exercises his authority under the appointment.
   </p>
   <p>
    An appointment made irrevocable under subsection (d) is revoked when the interest with which it is coupled is extinguished.
   </p>
   <p>
    A transferee for value of shares subject to an irrevocable appointment may revoke the appointment if he did not know of its existence when he acquired the shares and the existence of the irrevocable appointment was not noted conspicuously on the certificate representing the shares or on the information statement for shares without certificates.
   </p>
   <p>
    Subject to Section 79-4-7.24 and to any express limitation on the proxy’s authority stated in the appointment form or electronic transmission, a corporation is entitled to accept the proxy’s vote or other action as that of the shareholder making the appointment.

    Corporation’s acceptance of votes.
   </p>
   <p>
    If the name signed on a vote, consent, waiver or proxy appointment corresponds to the name of the shareholder, the corporation, if acting in good faith, is entitled to accept the vote, consent, waiver or proxy appointment and give it effect as the act of the shareholder.
   </p>
   <p>
    If the name signed on a vote, consent, waiver or proxy appointment does not correspond to the name of its shareholder, the corporation, if acting in good faith, is nevertheless entitled to accept the vote, consent, waiver or proxy appointment and give it effect as the act of the shareholder if:
   </p>
   <ol>
    <li id="t79c04a07saBol31">
     The shareholder is an entity and the name signed purports to be that of an officer or agent of the entity;
    </li>
    <li id="t79c04a07saBol32">
     The name signed purports to be that of an administrator, executor, guardian or conservator representing the shareholder and, if the corporation requests, evidence of fiduciary status acceptable to the corporation has been presented with respect to the vote, consent, waiver or proxy appointment;
    </li>
    <li id="t79c04a07saBol33">
     The name signed purports to be that of a receiver or trustee in bankruptcy of the shareholder and, if the corporation requests, evidence of this status acceptable to the corporation has been presented with respect to the vote, consent, waiver or proxy appointment;
    </li>
    <li id="t79c04a07saBol34">
     The name signed purports to be that of a pledgee, beneficial owner or attorney-in-fact of the shareholder and, if the corporation requests, evidence acceptable to the corporation of the signatory’s authority to sign for the shareholder has been presented with respect to the vote, consent, waiver or proxy appointment;

   </ol>
   <p>
    The corporation is entitled to reject a vote, consent, waiver or proxy appointment if the secretary or other officer or agent authorized to tabulate votes, acting in good faith, has reasonable basis for doubt about the validity of the signature on it or about the signatory’s authority to sign for the shareholder.
   </p>
   <p>
    The corporation and its officer or agent who accepts or rejects a vote, consent, waiver or proxy appointment in good faith and in accordance with the standards of this section or Section 79-4-7.22(b) are not liable in damages to the shareholder for the consequences of the acceptance or rejection.

    Quorum and voting requirements for voting groups.
   </p>
   <p>
    Shares entitled to vote as a separate voting group may take action on a matter at a meeting only if a quorum of those shares exists with respect to that matter. Unless the articles of incorporation or Sections 79-4-1.01 et seq. provide otherwise, a majority of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter by the voting group constitutes a quorum of that voting group for action on that matter.
   </p>
   <p>
    Once a share is represented for any purpose at a meeting, it is deemed present for quorum purposes for the remainder of the meeting and for any adjournment of that meeting unless a new record date is or must be set for that adjourned meeting.
   </p>
   <p>
    If a quorum exists, action on a matter (other than the election of directors) by a voting group is approved if the votes cast within the voting group favoring the action exceed the votes cast opposing the action, unless the articles of incorporation or Sections 79-4-1.01 et seq. require a greater number of affirmative votes.
   </p>
   <p>
    An amendment of articles of incorporation adding, changing or deleting a quorum or voting requirement for a voting group greater than specified in subsection (b) or (c) is governed by Section 79-4-7.27.

    Voting for directors; cumulative voting.
   </p>
   <p>
    Unless otherwise provided in the articles of incorporation, directors are elected by a plurality of the votes cast by the shares entitled to vote in the election at a meeting at which a quorum is present.
   </p>
   <p>
    For corporations incorporated before July 1, 2002, shareholders shall have a right to cumulate their votes for directors unless the articles of incorporation provide otherwise. For corporations incorporated on or after July 1, 2002, shareholders do not have a right to cumulate their votes for directors unless the articles of incorporation provide otherwise.
   </p>
   <p>
    A statement included in the articles of incorporation that “a designated voting group of shareholders is entitled to cumulate their votes for directors,” or words of similar import, means that the shareholders designated are entitled to multiply the number of votes they are entitled to cast by the number of directors for whom they are entitled to vote and cast the product for a single candidate or distribute the product among two (2) or more candidates.

    Voting trusts.
   </p>
   <p>
    One or more shareholders may create a voting trust, conferring on a trustee the right to vote or otherwise act for them, by signing an agreement setting out the provisions of the trust (which may include anything consistent with its purpose) and transferring their shares to the trustee. When a voting trust agreement is signed, the trustee shall prepare a list of the names and addresses of all owners of beneficial interests in the trust, together with the number and class of shares each transferred to the trust, and deliver copies of the list and agreement to the corporation’s principal office.
   </p>
   <p>
    A voting trust becomes effective on the date the first shares subject to the trust are registered in the trustee’s name. A voting trust is valid for the period specified in the trust agreement.
   </p>
   <p>
    All or some of the parties to a voting trust may extend it for additional terms by signing an extension agreement and obtaining the voting trustee’s written consent to the extension. An extension is valid for the period specified in the extension agreement. The voting trustee must deliver copies of the extension agreement and list of beneficial owners to the corporation’s principal office. An extension agreement binds only those parties signing it.

    Certain agreements among shareholders, otherwise inconsistent with chapter, permitted; conditions.
   </p>
   <p>
    An agreement among the shareholders of a corporation that complies with this section is effective among the shareholders and the corporation even though it is inconsistent with one or more other provisions of this chapter in that it:
   </p>
   <ol>
    <li id="t79c04a07saCol11">
     Eliminates the board of directors or restricts the discretion or powers of the board of directors;
    </li>
    <li id="t79c04a07saCol12">
     Governs the authorization or making of distributions whether or not in proportion to ownership of shares, subject to the limitations in Section 79-4-6.40;

     Governs, in general or in regard to specific matters, the exercise or division of voting power by or between the shareholders and directors or by or among any of them, including use of weighted voting rights or director proxies;
    </li>
    <li id="t79c04a07saCol15">
     Establishes the terms and conditions of any agreement for the transfer or use of property or the provision of services between the corporation and any shareholder, director, officer or employee of the corporation or among any of them;
    </li>
    <li id="t79c04a07saCol16">
     Transfers to one or more shareholders or other persons all or part of the authority to exercise the corporate powers or to manage the business and affairs of the corporation, including the resolution of any issue about which there exists a deadlock among directors or shareholders;

    </li>
   </ol>
   <p>
    An agreement authorized by this section shall be:
   </p>
   <p>
    Set forth (A) in the articles of incorporation or bylaws and approved by all persons who are shareholders at the time of the agreement, or (B) in a written agreement that is signed by all persons who are shareholders at the time of the agreement and is made known to the corporation;
   </p>
   <p>
    Subject to amendment only by all persons who are shareholders at the time of the amendment, unless the agreement provides otherwise; and
   </p>
   <p>
    Valid for ten (10) years, unless the agreement provides otherwise.
   </p>
   <p>
    The existence of an agreement authorized by this section shall be noted conspicuously on the front or back of each certificate for outstanding shares or on the information statement required by Section 79-4-6.26(b). If at the time of the agreement the corporation has shares outstanding represented by certificates, the corporation shall recall the outstanding certificates and issue substitute certificates that comply with this subsection. The failure to note the existence of the agreement on the certificate or information statement shall not affect the validity of the agreement or any action taken pursuant to it. Any purchaser of shares who, at the time of purchase, did not have knowledge of the existence of the agreement shall be entitled to rescission of the purchase. A purchaser shall be deemed to have knowledge of the existence of the agreement if its existence is noted on the certificate or information statement for the shares in compliance with this subsection (c) and, if the shares are not represented by a certificate, the information statement is delivered to the purchaser at or prior to the time of purchase of the shares. An action to enforce the right of rescission authorized by this subsection (c) must be commenced within the earlier of ninety (90) days after discovery of the existence of the agreement or two (2) years after the time of purchase of the shares.
   </p>
   <p>
    An agreement authorized by this section shall cease to be effective when the corporation becomes a public corporation. If the agreement ceases to be effective for any reason, the board of directors may, if the agreement is contained or referred to in the corporation’s articles of incorporation or bylaws, adopt an amendment to the articles of incorporation or bylaws, without shareholder action, to delete the agreement and any references to it.
   </p>
   <p>
    An agreement authorized by this section that limits the discretion or powers of the board of directors shall relieve the directors of, and impose upon the person or persons in whom such discretion or powers are vested, liability for acts or omissions imposed by law on directors to the extent that the discretion or powers of the directors are limited by the agreement.
   </p>
   <p>
    The existence or performance of an agreement authorized by this section shall not be a ground for imposing personal liability on any shareholder for the acts or debts of the corporation even if the agreement or its performance treats the corporation as if it were a partnership or results in failure to observe the corporate formalities otherwise applicable to the matters governed by the agreement.
   </p>
   <p>
    Incorporators or subscribers for shares may act as shareholders with respect to an agreement authorized by this section if no shares have been issued when the agreement is made.

    Shareholder action to appoint custodian or receiver.
   </p>
   <p>
    The chancery court of the county where a corporation’s principal office is located, or the Chancery Court of the First Judicial District of Hinds County, Mississippi, if the corporation does not have a principal office in this state, may appoint one or more persons to be custodians, or, if the corporation is insolvent, to be receivers, of and for a corporation in a proceeding by a shareholder where it is established that:
   </p>
   <ol>
    <li id="t79c04a07saDol61">
     The directors are deadlocked in the management of the corporate affairs, the shareholders are unable to break the deadlock, and irreparable injury to the corporation is threatened or being suffered; or
    </li>
    <li id="t79c04a07saDol62">
     The directors or those in control of the corporation are acting fraudulently and irreparable injury to the corporation is threatened or being suffered.
    </li>
    <li id="t79c04a07saDol63">
     Has jurisdiction over the corporation and all of its property, wherever located.
    </li>
   </ol>
   <p>
    The court:
   </p>
   <p>
    May issue injunctions, appoint a temporary custodian or temporary receiver with all the powers and duties the court directs, take other action to preserve the corporate assets wherever located, and carry on the business of the corporation until a full hearing is held;
   </p>
   <p>
    Shall hold a full hearing, after notifying all parties to the proceeding and any interested persons designated by the court, before appointing a custodian or receiver; and
   </p>
   <p>
    The court may appoint an individual or domestic or foreign corporation (authorized to transact business in this state) as a custodian or receiver and may require the custodian or receiver to post bond, with or without sureties, in an amount the court directs.
   </p>
   <p>
    The court shall describe the powers and duties of the custodian or receiver in its appointing order, which may be amended from time to time. Among other powers,
   </p>
   <p>
    A custodian may exercise all of the powers of the corporation, through or in place of its board of directors, to the extent necessary to manage the business and affairs of the corporation; and
   </p>
   <p>
    A receiver (i) may dispose of all or any part of the assets of the corporation wherever located, at a public or private sale, if authorized by the court; and (ii) may sue and defend in the receiver’s own name as receiver in all courts of this state.
   </p>
   <p>
    The court during a custodianship may redesignate the custodian a receiver, and during a receivership may redesignate the receiver a custodian, if doing so is in the best interests of the corporation.
   </p>
   <p>
    The court from time to time during the custodianship or receivership may order compensation paid and expense disbursements or reimbursements made to the custodian or receiver from the assets of the corporation or proceeds from the sale of its assets.

    In a close corporation where a majority stockholder stands to benefit as a controlling stockholder, the majority’s action must be “intrinsically fair” to the minority interest. Thus, stockholders in close corporations must bear towards each other the same relationship of trust and confidence which prevails in partnerships, rather than resort to statutory defenses. This does not mean that directors, executive officers and stockholders are not required to adhere to the corporate statutes; rather, blind adherence to corporate statutes may not be used to circumvent the corporation’s by-laws, charter or various agreements, such as a stock redemption agreement, because of the “intrinsically fair” standard that is now adopted.

    Generally, a director violates no duty by dealing in his or her own stock on his or her own account.

    Staggered terms for directors.
   </p>
   <p>
    The articles of incorporation may provide for staggering the terms of directors by dividing the total number of directors into two (2) or three (3) groups, with each group containing one-half (1/2) or one-third (1/3) of the total, as near as may be practicable. In that event, the terms of directors in the first group expire at the first annual shareholders’ meeting after their election, the terms of the second group expire at the second annual shareholders’ meeting after their election, and the terms of the third group, if any, expire at the third annual shareholders’ meeting after their election. At each annual shareholders’ meeting held thereafter, directors shall be chosen for a term of two (2) years or three (3) years, as the case may be, to succeed those whose terms expire.

    The shareholders may remove one or more directors with or without cause unless the articles of incorporation provide that directors may be removed only for cause.

   <p>
    If a director is elected by a voting group of shareholders, only the shareholders of that voting group may participate in the vote to remove him.
   </p>
   <p>
    If cumulative voting is authorized, a director may not be removed if the number of votes sufficient to elect him under cumulative voting is voted against his removal. If cumulative voting is not authorized, a director may be removed only if the number of votes cast to remove him exceeds the number of votes cast not to remove him.
   </p>
   <p>
    A director may be removed by the shareholders only at a meeting called for the purpose of removing him and the meeting notice must state that the purpose, or one (1) of the purposes, of the meeting is removal of the director.

   <p>
    The chancery court of the county where a corporation’s principal office is located, or the Chancery Court of the First Judicial District of Hinds County, Mississippi, if the corporation does not have a principal office in this state, may remove a director of the corporation from office in a proceeding commenced either by the corporation or by its shareholders holding at least ten percent (10%) of the outstanding shares of any class if the court finds that (1) the director engaged in fraudulent or dishonest conduct, or gross abuse of authority or discretion, with respect to the corporation, and (2) removal is in the best interest of the corporation.

    The court that removes a director may bar the director from reelection for a period prescribed by the court.

    Action without meeting.
   </p>
   <p>
    Action required or permitted by Section 79-4-1.01 et seq. to be taken by the board of directors may be taken without a meeting if each director signs a consent describing the action taken and delivers it to the corporation.
   </p>
   <p>
    Action taken under this section is the act of the board of directors when one or more consents signed by all the directors are delivered to the corporation. The consent may specify the time at which the action taken thereunder is to be effective. A consent may be withdrawn by a revocation signed by the director and received by the corporation prior to receipt by the corporation of unrevoked written consents signed by all the directors.
   </p>
   <p>
    A consent signed under this section has the effect of action taken at a meeting of the board of directors and may be described as such in any document.

    A director may waive any notice required by Sections 79-4-1.01 et seq., the articles of incorporation or bylaws before or after the date and time stated in the notice. Except as provided by subsection (b), the waiver must be in writing, signed by the director entitled to the notice, and filed with the minutes or corporate records.

    Quorum and voting.
   </p>
   <p>
    Unless the articles of incorporation or bylaws require a greater number or unless otherwise specifically provided in this chapter, a quorum of a board of directors consists of:
   </p>
   <ol>
    <li id="t79c04a08saBol11">
     A majority of the fixed number of directors if the corporation has a fixed board size; or
    </li>
    <li id="t79c04a08saBol12">
     A majority of the number of directors prescribed, or if no number is prescribed, the number in office immediately before the meeting begins, if the corporation has a variable-range size board.
    </li>
   </ol>
   <p>
    The articles of incorporation or bylaws may authorize a quorum of a board of directors to consist of no fewer than one-third (1/3) of the fixed or prescribed number of directors determined under subsection (a).
   </p>
   <p>
    If a quorum is present when a vote is taken, the affirmative vote of a majority of directors present is the act of the board of directors unless the articles of incorporation or bylaws require the vote of a greater number of directors.
   </p>
   <p>
    A director who is present at a meeting of the board of directors or a committee of the board of directors when corporate action is taken is deemed to have assented to the action taken unless: (1) the director objects at the beginning of the meeting (or promptly upon his arrival) to holding it or transacting business at the meeting; (2) the dissent or abstention from the action taken is entered in the minutes of the meeting; or (3) the director delivers written notice of the director’s dissent or abstention to the presiding officer of the meeting before its adjournment or to the corporation immediately after adjournment of the meeting. The right of dissent or abstention is not available to a director who votes in favor of the action taken.

    Committees.
   </p>
   <p>
    Unless this chapter, the articles of incorporation or the bylaws provide otherwise, a board of directors may create one or more committees and appoint one or more members of the board of directors to serve on any such committee.
   </p>
   <p>
    Unless this chapter otherwise provides, the creation of a committee and appointment of members to it must be approved by the greater of (1) a majority of all the directors in office when the action is taken or (2) the number of directors required by the articles of incorporation or bylaws to take action under Section 79-4-8.24.
   </p>
   <p>
    Sections 79-4-8.20 through 79-4-8.24 apply both to committees of the board and their members.
   </p>
   <p>
    To the extent specified by the board of directors or in the articles of incorporation or bylaws, each committee may exercise the powers of the board of directors under Section 79-4-8.01.
   </p>
   <p>
    A committee may not, however:
   </p>
   <ol>
    <li id="t79c04a08saBol21">
     Authorize or approve distributions, except according to a formula or method or within limits prescribed by the board of directors;
    </li>
    <li id="t79c04a08saBol22">
     Approve or propose to shareholders action that Section 79-4-1.01 et seq. requires to be approved by shareholders;
    </li>
    <li id="t79c04a08saBol23">
     Fill vacancies on the board of directors, or subject to subsection (g), on any of its committees; or
    </li>
    <li id="t79c04a08saBol24">
     Adopt, amend or repeal bylaws.
    </li>
   </ol>
   <p>
    The creation of, delegation of authority to, or action by a committee does not alone constitute compliance by a director with the standards of conduct described in Section 79-4-8.30.
   </p>
   <p>
    The board of directors may appoint one or more directors as alternate members of any committee to replace any absent or disqualified member during the member’s absence or disqualification. Unless the articles of incorporation or the bylaws or the resolution creating the committee provide otherwise, in the event of the absence or disqualification of a member of a committee, the member or members present at any meeting and not disqualified from voting, unanimously, may appoint another director to act in place of the absent or disqualified member.

    The members of the board of directors or a committee of the board, when becoming informed in connection with their decision-making function or devoting attention to their oversight function, shall discharge their duties with the care that a person in a like position would reasonably believe appropriate under similar circumstances.

   <p>
    In discharging board or committee duties a director, who does not have knowledge that makes reliance unwarranted, is entitled to rely on the performance by any of the persons specified in subsection (e)(1) or subsection (e)(3) to whom the board may have delegated, formally or informally by course of conduct, the authority or duty to perform one or more of the board’s functions that are delegable under applicable law.

    In a close corporation where a majority stockholder stands to benefit as a controlling stockholder, the majority’s action must be “intrinsically fair” to the minority interest. Thus, stockholders in close corporations must bear towards each other the same relationship of trust and confidence which prevails in partnerships, rather than resort to statutory defenses. This does not mean that directors, executive officers and stockholders are not required to adhere to the corporate statutes; rather, blind adherence to corporate statutes may not be used to circumvent the corporation’s by-laws, charter or various agreements, such as a stock redemption agreement, because of the “intrinsically fair” standard that is now adopted.

    Generally, a director violates no duty by dealing in his or her own stock on his or her own account. This rule is not applicable, however, when there is a showing that a closely held corporation has a practice of purchasing its own stock, or that it ever contemplated doing so, as evidenced by a stock redemption agreement, in order to maintain proportionate control of the corporation.

   <p>
    A director shall not be liable to the corporation or its shareholders for any decision to take or not to take action, or any failure to take any action, as a director, unless the party asserting liability in a proceeding establishes that:
   </p>
   <ol>
    <li id="t79c04a08saCol21">
     No defense by the director based on (i) any provision in the articles of incorporation authorized by Section 79-4-2.02(b)(4) or the protection afforded by Section 79-4-8.61 for action taken in compliance with Section 79-4-8.62 or 79-4-8.63, or (ii) the protection afforded by Section 79-4-8.70, precludes liability; and
    </li>
    <li id="t79c04a08saCol22">
     The challenged conduct consisted or was the result of:
    </li>
    <li id="t79c04a08saCol23">
     For other money payment under an equitable remedy, such as profit recovery by or disgorgement to the corporation, shall also have whatever persuasion burden may be called for to establish that the equitable remedy sought is appropriate in the circumstances.
    </li>
   </ol>
   <p>
    Action not in good faith; or
   </p>
   <p>
    A decision:
   </p>
   <p>
    Which the director did not reasonably believe to be in the best interests of the corporation; or
   </p>
   <p>
    As to which the director was not informed to an extent the director reasonably believed appropriate in the circumstances; or
   </p>
   <p>
    A lack of objectivity due to the director’s familial, financial or business relationship with, or a lack of independence due to the director’s domination or control by, another person having a material interest in the challenged conduct:
   </p>
   <p>
    Which relationship or which domination or control could reasonably be expected to have affected the director’s judgment respecting the challenged conduct in a manner adverse to the corporation; and
   </p>
   <p>
    After a reasonable expectation to such effect has been established, the director shall not have established that the challenged conduct was reasonably believed by the director to be in the best interests of the corporation; or
   </p>
   <p>
    A sustained failure of the director to devote attention to ongoing oversight of the business and affairs of the corporation, or a failure to devote timely attention, by making (or causing to be made) appropriate inquiry, when particular facts and circumstances of significant concern materialize that would alert a reasonably attentive director to the need therefor; or
   </p>
   <p>
    Receipt of a financial benefit to which the director was not entitled or any other breach of the director’s duties to deal fairly with the corporation and its shareholders that is actionable under applicable law.
   </p>
   <p>
    The party seeking to hold the director liable:
   </p>
   <p>
    For money damages, shall also have the burden of establishing that:
   </p>
   <p>
    Harm to the corporation or its shareholders has been suffered; and
   </p>
   <p>
    The harm suffered was proximately caused by the director’s challenged conduct; or
   </p>
   <p>
    For other money payment under a legal remedy, such as compensation for the unauthorized use of corporate assets, shall also have whatever persuasion burden may be called for to establish that the payment sought is appropriate in the circumstances; or
   </p>
   <p>
    Nothing contained in this section shall (1) in any instance where fairness is at issue, such as consideration of the fairness of a transaction to the corporation under Section 79-4-8.61(b)(3), alter the burden of proving the fact or lack of fairness otherwise applicable, (2) alter the fact or lack of liability of a director under another section of this act, such as the provisions governing the consequences of an unlawful distribution under Section 79-4-8.33 or a transactional interest under Section 79-4-8.61, or (3) affect any rights to which the corporation or a shareholder may be entitled under another statute of this state or the United States.

   <p>
    A director who votes for or assents to a distribution in excess of what may be authorized and made pursuant to Section 79-4-6.40(a) or 79-4-14.09(a) is personally liable to the corporation for the amount of the distribution that exceeds what could have been distributed without violating Section 79-4-6.40(a) or 79-4-14.09(a) if the party asserting liability establishes that when taking the action the director did not comply with Section 79-4-8.30.

   </p>

   <p>
    A proceeding to enforce:

    The liability of a director under subsection (a) is barred unless it is commenced within two (2) years after the date (i) on which the effect of the distribution was measured under Section 79-4-6.40(e) or (g); (ii) as of which the violation of Section 79-4-6.40(a) occurred as the consequence of disregard of a restriction in the articles of incorporation; or (iii) on which the distribution of assets to shareholders under Section 79-4-14.09(a) was made; or

    Standards of conduct for officers.

   <p>
    An officer, when performing in such capacity, shall act:

     In good faith;
    </li>
    <li id="t79c04a08saDol12">

   <p>
    In discharging those duties an officer, who does not have knowledge that makes reliance unwarranted, is entitled to rely on:
   </p>

    The performance of properly delegated responsibilities by one or more employees of the corporation whom the officer reasonably believes to be reliable and competent in performing the responsibilities delegated; or
   </p>
   <p>
    Information, opinions, reports or statements, including financial statements and other financial data, prepared or presented by one or more employees of the corporation whom the officer reasonably believes to be reliable and competent in the matters presented or by legal counsel, public accountants, or other persons retained by the corporation as to matters involving skills or expertise the officer reasonably believes are matters (i) within the particular person’s professional or expert competence or (ii) as to which the particular person merits confidence.
   </p>
   <p>
    An officer shall not be liable to the corporation or its shareholders for any decision to take or not to take action, or any failure to take any action, as an officer, if the duties of the office are performed in compliance with this section. Whether an officer who does not comply with this section shall have liability will depend in such instance on applicable law, including those principles of Section 79-4-8.31 that have relevance.

   <h3>
    In a close corporation where a majority stockholder stands to benefit as a controlling stockholder, the majority’s action must be “intrinsically fair” to the minority interest. Thus, stockholders in close corporations must bear towards each other the same relationship of trust and confidence which prevails in partnerships, rather than resort to statutory defenses. This does not mean that directors, executive officers and stockholders are not required to adhere to the corporate statutes; rather, blind adherence to corporate statutes may not be used to circumvent the corporation’s by-laws, charter or various agreements, such as a stock redemption agreement, because of the “intrinsically fair” standard that is now adopted. Fought v. Morris, 543 So. 2d 167, 1989 Miss. LEXIS 221 (Miss. 1989).

    Resignation and removal of officers.

   <p>
    An officer may resign at any time by delivering notice to the corporation. A resignation is effective when the notice is delivered unless the notice specifies a later effective time. If a resignation is made effective at a later time and the board or the appointing officer accepts the future effective time, the board or the appointing officer may fill the pending vacancy before the effective time if the board or the appointing officer provides that the successor does not take office until the effective time.
   </p>
   <p>
    An officer may be removed at any time with or without cause by: (i) the board of directors; (ii) the officer who appointed such officer, unless the bylaws or the board of directors provide otherwise; or (iii) any other officer if authorized by the bylaws or the board of directors.

           In all other cases, that his conduct was at least not opposed to the best interests of the corporation; and

        </li>
        <li id="t79c04a08saEol21iiii">

    A director’s conduct with respect to an employee benefit plan for a purpose he reasonably believed to be in the interest of the participants in and beneficiaries of the plan is conduct that satisfies the requirement of subsection (a)(1)(ii)(B).

    Unless ordered by a court under Section 79-4-8.54(a)(3), a corporation may not indemnify a director under this section:
   </p>
   <p>
    In connection with a proceeding by or in the right of the corporation, except for reasonable expenses incurred in connection with the proceeding if it is determined that the director has met the relevant standard of conduct under subsection (a); or

    Advance for expenses.
   </p>
   <p>
    A corporation may, before final disposition of a proceeding, advance funds to pay for or reimburse the reasonable expenses incurred in connection with the proceeding by an individual who is a party to the proceeding because that individual is a member of the board of directors if the director delivers to the corporation:
   </p>
   <ol>
    <li id="t79c04a08saEol31">
     A signed written affirmation of the director’s good faith belief that the relevant standard of conduct described in Section 79-4-8.51 has been met by the director or that the proceeding involves conduct for which liability has been eliminated under a provision of the articles of incorporation as authorized by Section 79-4-2.02(b)(4); and
    </li>
    <li id="t79c04a08saEol32">
     A signed written undertaking of the director to repay any funds advanced if the director is not entitled to mandatory indemnification under Section 79-4-8.52 and it is ultimately determined under Section 79-4-8.54 or Section 79-4-8.55 that the director has not met the relevant standard of conduct described in Section 79-4-8.51.
    </li>
   </ol>
   <p>
    The undertaking required by subsection (a)(2) must be an unlimited general obligation of the director but need not be secured and may be accepted without reference to the financial ability of the director to make repayment.
   </p>
   <p>
    Authorizations under this section shall be made:
   </p>
   <p>
    By the board of directors:
   </p>
   <p>
    If there are two (2) or more qualified directors, by a majority vote of all the qualified directors (a majority of whom shall for such purpose constitute a quorum) or by a majority of the members of a committee of two (2) or more qualified directors appointed by such a vote; or
   </p>
   <p>
    If there are fewer than two (2) qualified directors, by the vote necessary for action by the board in accordance with Section 79-4-8.24(c), in which authorization directors who are not qualified directors may participate; or
   </p>
   <p>
    By the shareholders, but shares owned by or voted under the control of a director who at the time is not a qualified director may not be voted on the authorization.

    Court-ordered indemnification.
   </p>
   <p>
    A director who is a party to a proceeding because he is a director may apply for indemnification or an advance for expenses to the court conducting the proceeding or to another court of competent jurisdiction. After receipt of an application, and after giving any notice it considers necessary, the court shall:
   </p>
   <ol>
    <li id="t79c04a08saEol41">
     Order indemnification if the court determines that the director is entitled to mandatory indemnification under Section 79-4-8.52;
    </li>
    <li id="t79c04a08saEol42">
     Order indemnification or advance for expenses if the court determines that the director is entitled to indemnification or advance for expenses pursuant to a provision authorized by Section 79-4-8.58(a); or
    </li>
    <li id="t79c04a08saEol43">
     Order indemnification or advance for expenses if the court determines, in view of all the relevant circumstances, that it is fair and reasonable:
    </li>
   </ol>
   <p>
    To indemnify the director; or
   </p>
   <p>
    To advance expenses to the director, even if he has not met the relevant standard of conduct set forth in Section 79-4-8.51(a), failed to comply with Section 79-4-8.53 or was adjudged liable in a proceeding referred to in subsection 79-4-8.51(d)(1) or (d)(2), but if he was adjudged so liable his indemnification shall be limited to reasonable expenses incurred in connection with the proceeding.
   </p>
   <p>
    If the court determines that the director is entitled to indemnification under subsection (a)(1) or to indemnification or advance for expenses under subsection (a)(2), it shall also order the corporation to pay the director’s reasonable expenses incurred in connection with obtaining court-ordered indemnification or advance for expenses. If the court determines that the director is entitled to indemnification or advance for expenses under subsection (a)(3), it may also order the corporation to pay the director’s reasonable expenses to obtain court-ordered indemnification or advance for expenses.

   </p>
   <p>
    A corporation may, by a provision in its articles of incorporation or bylaws or in a resolution adopted or a contract approved by its board of directors or shareholders, obligate itself in advance of the act or omission giving rise to a proceeding to provide indemnification in accordance with Section 79-4-8.51 or advance funds to pay for or reimburse expenses in accordance with Section 79-4-8.53. Any such provision that obligates the corporation to provide indemnification to the fullest extent permitted by law shall be deemed to obligate the corporation to advance funds to pay for or reimburse expenses in accordance with Section 79-4-8.53 to the fullest extent permitted by law, unless the provision specifically provides otherwise.
   </p>
   <p>
    A right of indemnification or to advances for expenses created by this subarticle or under subsection (a) that is in effect at the time of an act or omission shall not be eliminated or impaired with respect to the act or omission by an amendment of the articles of incorporation or bylaws or a resolution of the directors or shareholders adopted after the occurrence of the act or omission, unless, in the case of a right created under subsection (a), the provision creating the right that is in effect at the time of the act or omission explicitly authorizes elimination or impairment after the act or omission has occurred.
   </p>
   <p>
    Any provision pursuant to subsection (a) shall not obligate the corporation to indemnify or advance expenses to a director of a predecessor of the corporation, pertaining to conduct with respect to the predecessor, unless otherwise specifically provided. Any provision for indemnification or advance for expenses in the articles of incorporation, bylaws, or a resolution of the board of directors or shareholders of a predecessor of the corporation in a merger or in a contract to which the predecessor is a party, existing at the time the merger takes effect, shall be governed by Section 79-4-11.06(a)(3).
   </p>
   <p>
    Subject to subsection (b), a corporation may, by a provision in its articles of incorporation, limit any of the rights to indemnification or advance for expenses created by or pursuant to this subarticle.
   </p>
   <p>
    This subarticle does not limit a corporation’s power to pay or reimburse expenses incurred by a director or an officer in connection with his appearance as a witness in a proceeding at a time when he is not a party.

    Effectiveness of directors’ action; disclosure.
   </p>
   <p>
    Directors’ action respecting a director’s conflicting interest transaction is effective for purposes of Section 79-4-8.61(b)(1)if the transaction has been authorized by the affirmative vote of a majority (but no fewer than two (2)) of the qualified directors who voted on the transaction, after required disclosure by the conflicted director of information not already known by such qualified directors or after modified disclosure in compliance with subsection (b), provided that:
   </p>
   <ol>
    <li id="t79c04a08saFol31">
     The qualified directors have deliberated and voted outside the presence of and without the participation by any other director; and
    </li>
    <li id="t79c04a08saFol32">
     Where the action has been taken by a committee, all members of the committee were qualified directors, and either (i) the committee was composed of all the qualified directors on the board of directors, or (ii) the members of the committee were appointed by the affirmative vote of a majority of the qualified directors on the board.
    </li>
    <li id="t79c04a08saFol33">
     The nature of the conflicted director’s duty not to disclose the confidential information.
    </li>
   </ol>
   <p>
    Notwithstanding subsection (a), when a transaction is a director’s conflicting interest transaction only because a related person described in Section 79-4-8.60(5)(v) or (vi) is a party to or has material financial interest in the transaction, the conflicted director is not obligated to make required disclosure to the extent that the director reasonably believes that doing so would violate a duty imposed under law, a legally enforceable obligation of confidentiality, or a professional ethics rule, provided that the conflicted director discloses to the qualified directors voting on the transaction:
   </p>
   <p>
    All information required to be disclosed that is not so violative;
   </p>
   <p>
    The existence and nature of the director’s conflicting interest; and
   </p>
   <p>
    A majority (but no fewer than two (2)) of all the qualified directors on the board of directors, or on the committee, constitutes a quorum for purposes of action that complies with this section.
   </p>
   <p>
    Where directors’ action under this section does not satisfy a quorum or voting requirement applicable to the authorization of the transaction by reason of the articles of incorporation, the bylaws, or provision of law, independent action to satisfy those authorization requirements must be taken by the board of directors or a committee, in which action directors who are not qualified directors may participate.

    Shareholder approval of director’s conflicting interest transaction.
   </p>
   <p>
    Shareholders’ action respecting a director’s conflicting interest transaction is effective for purposes of Section 79-4-8.61(b)(2) if a majority of the votes cast by the holders of all qualified shares are in favor of the transaction after (1) notice to shareholders describing the action to be taken respecting the transaction, (2) provision to the corporation of the information referred to in subsection (b), and (3) communication to the shareholders entitled to vote on the transaction of the information that is the subject of required disclosure, to the extent the information is not known by them.
   </p>
   <p>
    A director who has a conflicting interest respecting the transaction shall, before the shareholders’ vote, inform the secretary or other officer or agent of the corporation authorized to tabulate votes, in writing, of the number of shares that the director knows are not qualified shares under subsection (c), and the identity of the holders of those shares.
   </p>
   <p>
    For purposes of this section, (1) “holder” means, and “held by” refers to shares held by, both a record shareholder (as defined in Section 79-4-13.01(7)) and a beneficial shareholder (as defined in Section 79-4-13.01(2)); and (2) “qualified shares” means all shares entitled to be voted with respect to the transaction except for shares that the secretary (or other officer or agent of the corporation authorized to tabulate votes) either knows, or under subsection (b) is notified, are held by (A) a director who has a conflicting interest respecting the transaction, or (B) a related person of the director (excluding a person described in Section 79-4-8.60(5)(vi)).
   </p>
   <p>
    A majority of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of all qualified shares constitutes a quorum for purposes of compliance with this section. Subject to the provisions of subsection (e), shareholders’ action that otherwise complies with this section is not affected by the presence of holders, or by the voting, of shares that are not qualified shares.
   </p>
   <p>
    If a shareholders’ vote does not comply with subsection (a) solely because of a director’s failure to comply with subsection (b), and if the director establishes that the failure was not intended to influence and did not in fact determine the outcome of the vote, the court may take such action respecting the transaction and the director, and may give such effect, if any, to the shareholders’ vote, as the court considers appropriate in the circumstances.
   </p>
   <p>
    Where shareholders’ action under this section does not satisfy a quorum or voting requirement applicable to the authorization of the transaction by reason of the articles of incorporation, the bylaws or a provision of law, independent action to satisfy those authorization requirements must be taken by the shareholders, in which action shares that are not qualified shares may participate.

    Amendment by board of directors and shareholders.
   </p>
   <p>
    If a corporation has issued shares, an amendment to the articles of incorporation shall be adopted in the following manner:
   </p>
   <p>
    The proposed amendment must be adopted by the board of directors.
   </p>
   <p>
    Except as provided in Sections 79-4-10.05, 79-4-10.07, and 79-4-10.08, after adopting the proposed amendment the board of directors must submit the amendment to the shareholders for their approval. The board of directors must also transmit to the shareholders a recommendation that the shareholders approve the amendment, unless the board of directors makes a determination that because of conflicts of interest or other special circumstances it should not make such a recommendation, in which case the board of directors must transmit to the shareholders the basis for that determination.
   </p>
   <p>
    The board of directors may condition its submission of the amendment to the shareholders on any basis.
   </p>
   <p>
    If the amendment is required to be approved by the shareholders and the approval is to be given at a meeting, the corporation must notify each shareholder, whether or not entitled to vote, of the meeting of shareholders at which the amendment is to be submitted for approval. The notice must state that the purpose, or one of the purposes, of the meeting is to consider the amendment and must contain or be accompanied by a copy of the amendment.
   </p>
   <p>
    Unless the articles of incorporation or the board of directors acting pursuant to subsection (c), requires a greater vote or a greater number of shares to be present, approval of the amendment requires the approval of the shareholders at a meeting at which a quorum consisting of at least a majority of the votes entitled to be cast on the amendment exists, and, if any class or series of shares is entitled to vote as a separate group on the amendment, except as provided in Section 79-4-10.04(c), the approval of each such separate voting group at a meeting at which a quorum of the voting group consisting of at least a majority of the votes entitled to be cast on the amendment by that voting group exists.

    Voting on amendments by voting groups.
   </p>
   <p>
    If a corporation has more than one (1) class of shares outstanding, the holders of the outstanding shares of a class are entitled to vote as a separate voting group, if shareholder voting is otherwise required by the Mississippi Business Corporation Act, on a proposed amendment to the articles of incorporation if the amendment would:
   </p>
   <ol>
    <li id="t79c04a10saAol11">
     Effect an exchange or reclassification of all or part of the shares of the class into shares of another class;

    <li id="t79c04a10saAol12">
     Effect an exchange or reclassification, or create the right of exchange, of all or part of the shares of another class into shares of the class;
    </li>

     Change the rights, preferences or limitations of all or part of the shares of the class;
    </li>
    <li id="t79c04a10saAol14">
     Change the shares of all or part of the class into a different number of shares of the same class;
    </li>
    <li id="t79c04a10saAol15">
     Create a new class of shares having rights or preferences with respect to distributions or to dissolution that are prior or superior to the shares of the class;
    </li>
    <li id="t79c04a10saAol16">
     Increase the rights, preferences or number of authorized shares of any class that, after giving effect to the amendment, have rights or preferences with respect to distributions or to dissolution that are prior or superior to the shares of the class;

     Cancel or otherwise affect rights to distributions that have accumulated but not yet been authorized on all or part of the shares of the class.
    </li>
   </ol>
   <p>
    If a proposed amendment would affect a series of a class of shares in one or more of the ways described in subsection (a), the holders of shares of that series are entitled to vote as a separate voting group on the proposed amendment.
   </p>
   <p>
    If a proposed amendment that entitles the holders of two (2) or more classes or series of shares to vote as separate voting groups under this section would affect those two (2) or more classes or series in the same or a substantially similar way, the holders of shares of all the classes or series so affected must vote together as a single voting group on the proposed amendment, unless otherwise provided in the articles of incorporation or required by the board of directors.
   </p>
   <p>
    A class or series of shares is entitled to the voting rights granted by this section although the articles of incorporation provide that the shares are nonvoting shares.
   </p>
   <p>
    The provisions of subsection (a)(6) shall not apply to preferred stock issued by a public utility subject to the provisions of the Public Utility Holding Company Act, 15 United States Code, Section 79 et seq., where the issuance of its securities is regulated by an agency of the United States.

   <p>
    A corporation’s board of directors may restate its articles of incorporation at any time, with or without shareholder approval, to consolidate all amendments into a single document.
   </p>
   <p>
    If the restated articles include one or more new amendments that require shareholder approval, the amendments must be adopted and approved as provided in Section 79-4-10.03.
   </p>
   <p>
    A corporation that restates its articles of incorporation shall deliver to the Secretary of State for filing articles of restatement setting forth the name of the corporation and the text of the restated articles of incorporation, together with a certificate which states that the restated articles consolidate all amendments into a single document and, if a new amendment is included in the restated articles, which also includes the statements required under Section 79-4-10.06.
   </p>
   <p>
    Duly adopted restated articles of incorporation supersede the original articles of incorporation and all amendments thereto.
   </p>

    An amendment to the articles of incorporation does not affect a cause of action existing against or in favor of the corporation, a proceeding to which the corporation is a party, or the existing rights of persons other than shareholders of the corporation.

    §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t79c04s79-4-11.04" target="_self">79-4-11.04</a></cite>.
    Action on a plan of merger or share exchange.
   </p>
   <p>
    In the case of a domestic corporation that is a party to a merger or share exchange:
   </p>
   <p>
    The plan of merger or share exchange must be adopted by the board of directors.
   </p>
   <p>
    Except as provided in subsection (g) and in Section 79-4-11.05, after adopting the plan of merger, the board of directors must submit the plan to the shareholders for their approval. After adopting the plan of share exchange, the board of directors of the corporation whose shares will be acquired in the share exchange must submit the plan to the shareholders for their approval. The board of directors must also transmit to the shareholders a recommendation that the shareholders approve the plan of merger or share exchange, unless the board of directors makes a determination that because of conflicts of interest or other special circumstances it should not make such a recommendation, in which case the board of directors must transmit to the shareholders the basis for that determination.
   </p>
   <p>
    The board of directors may condition its submission of the plan of merger or share exchange to the shareholders on any basis.
   </p>
   <p>
    If the plan of merger or share exchange is required to be approved by the shareholders, and if the approval is to be given at a meeting, the corporation must notify each shareholder, whether or not entitled to vote, of the meeting of shareholders at which the plan is to be submitted for approval. The notice must state that the purpose, or one (1) of the purposes, of the meeting is to consider the plan and must contain or be accompanied by a copy or summary of the plan. If the corporation is to be merged into an existing corporation or eligible entity, the notice shall also include or be accompanied by a copy or summary of the articles of incorporation or organizational documents of that corporation or eligible entity. If the corporation is to be merged into a corporation or eligible entity that is to be created pursuant to the merger, the notice shall include or be accompanied by a copy or a summary of the articles of incorporation or organizational documents of the new corporation or eligible entity.
   </p>
   <p>
    Unless the articles of incorporation, or the board of directors acting pursuant to subsection (c), requires a greater vote or a greater number of votes to be present, the approval of the plan of merger or share exchange shall require the approval of the shareholders at a meeting at which a quorum consisting of at least a majority of the votes entitled to be cast on the plan exists, and, if any class or series of shares is entitled to vote as a separate group on the plan of merger or share exchange, the approval of each such separate voting group at a meeting at which a quorum of the voting group consisting of at least a majority of the votes entitled to be cast on the merger or share exchange by that voting group is present.
   </p>
   <p>
    Separate voting by voting groups is required:
   </p>
   <ol>
    <li id="t79c04a11ol41">
     On a plan of merger, by each class or series of shares that (A) are to be converted, pursuant to the provisions of the plan of merger, into shares or other securities, interests, obligations, rights to acquire shares or other securities, cash, other property, or any combination of the foregoing, or (B) would have a right to vote as a separate group on a provision of the plan that, if contained in a proposed amendment to articles of incorporation, would require action by separate voting groups under Section 79-4-10.04;
    </li>
    <li id="t79c04a11ol42">
     On a plan of share exchange, by each class or series of shares included in the exchange, with each class or series constituting a separate voting group; and
    </li>
    <li id="t79c04a11ol43">
     On a plan of merger or share exchange, if the voting group is entitled under the articles of incorporation to vote as a voting group to approve a plan of merger or share exchange.
    </li>
    <li id="t79c04a11ol44">
     The number of voting shares outstanding immediately after the merger, plus the number of voting shares issuable as a result of the merger (either by the conversion of securities issued pursuant to the merger or the exercise of rights and warrants issued pursuant to the merger), will not exceed by more than twenty percent (20%) the total number of voting shares of the surviving corporation outstanding immediately before the merger; and
    </li>
    <li id="t79c04a11ol45">
     The number of participating shares outstanding immediately after the merger, plus the number of participating shares issuable as a result of the merger (either by the conversion of securities issued pursuant to the merger or the exercise of rights and warrants issued pursuant to the merger), will not exceed by more than twenty percent (20%) the total number of participating shares outstanding immediately before the merger.
    </li>
   </ol>
   <p>
    Unless the articles of incorporation otherwise provide, approval by the corporation’s shareholders of a plan of merger is not required if:
   </p>
   <p>
    The corporation will survive the merger; and
   </p>
   <p>
    Except for amendments permitted by Section 79-4-10.05, its articles of incorporation will not be changed; and
   </p>
   <p>
    Each shareholder of the corporation whose shares were outstanding immediately before the effective date of the merger will hold the same number of shares, with identical preferences, limitations, and relative rights, immediately after the effective date of change; and
   </p>
   <p>
    As used in subsection (g):
   </p>
   <p>
    “Participating shares” means shares that entitle their holders to participate without limitation in distributions.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Voting shares” means shares that entitle their holders to vote unconditionally in elections of directors.
   </p>
   <p>
    If as a result of a merger or share exchange one or more shareholders of a domestic corporation would become subject to personal liability for the obligations or liabilities of any other person or entity, approval of the plan of merger shall require the execution, by each such shareholder, of a separate written consent to become subject to such personal liability.

   </p>
   <p>
    If a merger or share exchange is abandoned under subsection (a) after articles of merger or share exchange have been filed with the Secretary of State but before the merger or share exchange has become effective, a statement that the merger or share exchange has been abandoned in accordance with this section, signed on behalf of a party to the merger or share exchange by an officer or other duly authorized representative, shall be delivered to the Secretary of State for filing prior to the effective date of the merger or share exchange. Upon filing, the statement shall take effect and the merger or share exchange shall be deemed abandoned and shall not become effective.

    Disposition of assets requiring shareholder approval.
   </p>
   <p>
    A sale, lease, exchange, or other disposition of assets, other than a disposition described in Section 79-4-12.01, requires approval of the corporation’s shareholders if the disposition would leave the corporation without a significant continuing business activity. If a corporation retains a business activity that represented at least twenty-five percent (25%) of total assets at the end of the most recently completed fiscal year, and twenty-five (25%) of either income from continuing operations before taxes or revenues from continuing operations for that fiscal year, in each case of the corporation and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, the corporation will conclusively be deemed to have retained a significant continuing business activity.
   </p>
   <p>
    A disposition that requires approval of the shareholders under subsection (a) shall be initiated by a resolution by the board of directors authorizing the disposition. After adoption of such a resolution, the board of directors shall submit the proposed disposition to the shareholders for their approval. The board of directors shall also transmit to the shareholders a recommendation that the shareholders approve the proposed disposition, unless the board of directors makes a determination that because of conflicts of interest or other special circumstances it should not make such a recommendation, in which case the board of directors shall transmit to the shareholders the basis for that determination.
   </p>
   <p>
    The board of directors may condition its submission of a disposition to the shareholders under subsection (b) on any basis.
   </p>
   <p>
    If a disposition is required to be approved by the shareholders under subsection (a), and if the approval is to be given at a meeting, the corporation shall notify each shareholder, whether or not entitled to vote, of the meeting of shareholders at which the disposition is to be submitted for approval. The notice shall state that the purpose, or one of the purposes, of the meeting is to consider the disposition and shall contain a description of the disposition, including the terms and conditions thereof and the consideration to be received by the corporation.
   </p>
   <p>
    Unless the articles of incorporation or the board of directors acting pursuant to subsection (c) require a greater vote, or a greater number of votes to be present, the approval of a disposition by the shareholders shall require the approval of the shareholders at a meeting at which a quorum consisting of at least a majority of the votes entitled to be cast on the disposition exists.
   </p>
   <p>
    After a disposition has been approved by the shareholders under subsection (b), and at any time before the disposition has been consummated, it may be abandoned by the corporation without action by the shareholders, subject to any contractual rights of other parties to the disposition.
   </p>
   <p>
    A disposition of assets in the course of dissolution under Title 79, Chapter 4, Article 14 is not governed by this section.
   </p>
   <p>
    The assets of a direct or indirect consolidated subsidiary shall be deemed the assets of the parent corporation for the purposes of this section.

    Statutory prohibition against consideration of appreciation or depreciation in anticipation of corporate merger does not exclude consideration of purchase offers made for comparable corporations; in case of offer for comparable company, relevance of purchase offer is not diminished due to consummation of sale; minority discount is proper in determining fair value of stock of dissenters; in determining fair value of stock, court considers market value, asset value, and investment or earnings value; costs and expenses of proceeding which are assessed against corporation where dissenting shareholders were justified in not accepting offer do not include fees of counsel, although fees and expenses of experts may be allowed if court determines that fair value of shares as determined materially exceeds offer of corporation; interest on award accrues from date on which vote was taken on proposed corporate action, and court uses rate of return in effect for one-year certificate of deposit of that date.

    Assertion of appraisal rights by nominees and beneficial owners.
   </p>
   <p>
    A record shareholder may assert appraisal rights as to fewer than all the shares registered in the record shareholder’s name but owned by a beneficial shareholder only if the record shareholder objects with respect to all shares of the class or series owned by the beneficial shareholder and notifies the corporation in writing of the name and address of each beneficial shareholder on whose behalf appraisal rights are being asserted. The rights of a record shareholder who asserts appraisal rights for only part of the shares held of record in the record shareholder’s name under this subsection shall be determined as if the shares as to which the record shareholder objects and the record shareholder’s other shares were registered in the names of different record shareholders.
   </p>
   <p>
    A beneficial shareholder may assert appraisal rights as to shares of any class or series held on behalf of the shareholder only if such shareholder:
   </p>
   <ol>
    <li id="t79c04a13saAol31">
     Submits to the corporation the record shareholder’s written consent to the assertion of such rights no later than the date referred to in Section 79-4-13.22(b)(2)(ii); and
    </li>
    <li id="t79c04a13saAol32">
     Does so with respect to all shares of the class or series that are beneficially owned by the beneficial shareholder.

    Perfection of rights; right to withdraw.
   </p>
   <p>
    A shareholder who receives notice pursuant to Section 79-4-13.22 and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must sign and return on the form sent by the corporation and, in the case of certificated shares, deposit the shareholder’s certificates in accordance with the terms of the notice by the date referred to in the notice pursuant to Section 79-4-13.22(b)(2)(ii).In addition, if applicable, the shareholder must certify on the form whether the beneficial owner of such shares acquired beneficial ownership of the shares before the date required to be set forth in the notice pursuant to Section 79-4-13.22(b)(1).If a shareholder fails to make this certification, the corporation may elect to treat the shareholder’s shares as after-acquired shares under Section 79-4-13.25. Once a shareholder deposits that shareholder’s certificates or, in the case of uncertificated shares, returns the signed forms, that shareholder loses all rights as a shareholder, unless the shareholder withdraws pursuant to subsection (b).
   </p>
   <p>
    A shareholder who has complied with subsection (a) may nevertheless decline to exercise appraisal rights and withdraw from the appraisal process by so notifying the corporation in writing by the date set forth in the appraisal notice pursuant to Section 79-4-13.22(b)(2)(v). A shareholder who fails to so withdraw from the appraisal process may not thereafter withdraw without the corporation’s written consent.
   </p>
   <p>
    A shareholder who does not sign and return the form and, in the case of certificated shares, deposit that shareholder’s share certificates where required, each by the date set forth in the notice described in Section 79-4-13.22(b), shall not be entitled to payment under this article.

    Court costs and expenses.
   </p>
   <p>
    The court in an appraisal proceeding commenced under Section 79-4-13.30 shall determine all court costs of the proceeding, including the reasonable compensation and expenses of appraisers appointed by the court.The court shall assess the court costs against the corporation, except that the court may assess court costs against all or some of the shareholders demanding appraisal, in amounts which the court finds equitable, to the extent the court finds such shareholders acted arbitrarily, vexatiously or not in good faith with respect to the rights provided by this article.
   </p>
   <p>
    The court in an appraisal proceeding may also assess the expenses of the respective parties in amounts the court finds equitable:
   </p>
   <ol>
    <li id="t79c04a13saCol11">
     Against the corporation and in favor of any or all shareholders demanding appraisal if the court finds the corporation did not substantially comply with the requirements of Section 79-4-13.20, 79-4-13.22, 79-4-13.24 or 79-4-13.25; or
    </li>
    <li id="t79c04a13saCol12">
     Against either the corporation or a shareholder demanding appraisal, in favor of any other party, if the court finds that the party against whom the expenses are assessed acted arbitrarily, vexatiously or not in good faith with respect to the rights provided by this article.
    </li>
   </ol>
   <p>
    If the court in an appraisal proceeding finds that the expenses incurred by any shareholder were of substantial benefit to other shareholders similarly situated, and that such expenses should not be assessed against the corporation, the court may direct that such expenses be paid out of the amounts awarded the shareholders who were benefited.
   </p>
   <p>
    To the extent the corporation fails to make a required payment pursuant to Section 79-4-13.24, 79-4-13.25 or 79-4-13.26, the shareholder may sue directly for the amount owed and, to the extent successful, shall be entitled to recover from the corporation all expenses of the suit.

    Dissolution by board of directors and shareholders.
   </p>
   <p>
    A corporation’s board of directors may propose dissolution for submission to the shareholders.
   </p>
   <p>
    For a proposal to dissolve to be adopted:
   </p>
   <ol>
    <li id="t79c04a14saAol21">
     The board of directors must recommend dissolution to the shareholders unless the board of directors determines that because of conflict of interest or other special circumstances it should make no recommendation and communicates the basis for its determination to the shareholders; and

    <li id="t79c04a14saAol22">
     The shareholders entitled to vote must approve the proposal to dissolve as provided in subsection (e).
    </li>
   </ol>
   <p>
    The board of directors may condition its submission of the proposal for dissolution on any basis.
   </p>
   <p>
    The corporation shall notify each shareholder, whether or not entitled to vote, of the proposed shareholders’ meeting. The notice must also state that the purpose, or one of the purposes, of the meeting is to consider dissolving the corporation.
   </p>
   <p>
    Unless the articles of incorporation or the board of directors acting pursuant to subsection (c) require a greater vote, a greater number of shares to be present, or a vote by voting groups, adoption of the proposal to dissolve shall require the approval of the shareholders at a meeting at which a quorum consisting of at least a majority of the votes entitled to be cast exists.

    Although it is the general rule that there is no legal dissolution or surrender of the charter of a nonstock corporation until so decreed pursuant to this section [Code 1942, § 5352], a court of equity may in a proper case treat the corporation as dissolved, even though in a legal sense no dissolution has occurred, and a dissolution may be implied as by consent of all the members when the meetings are voluntarily discontinued and activity of members of such comes to an end.

    Revocation of dissolution.
   </p>
   <p>
    A corporation may revoke its dissolution within one hundred twenty (120) days of its effective date.
   </p>
   <p>
    Revocation of dissolution must be authorized in the same manner as the dissolution was authorized unless that authorization permitted revocation by action of the board of directors alone, in which event the board of directors may revoke the dissolution without shareholder action.
   </p>
   <p>
    After the revocation of dissolution is authorized, the corporation may revoke the dissolution by delivering to the Secretary of State for filing articles of revocation of dissolution, together with a copy of its articles of dissolution, that set forth:
   </p>
   <ol>
    <li id="t79c04a14saAol41">
     The name of the corporation;
    </li>
    <li id="t79c04a14saAol42">
     The effective date of the dissolution that was revoked;
    </li>
    <li id="t79c04a14saAol43">
     The date that the revocation of dissolution was authorized;
    </li>
    <li id="t79c04a14saAol44">
     If the corporation’s board of directors (or incorporators) revoked the dissolution, a statement to that effect;
    </li>
    <li id="t79c04a14saAol45">
     If the corporation’s board of directors revoked a dissolution authorized by the shareholders, a statement that revocation was permitted by action by the board of directors alone pursuant to that authorization; and
    </li>
    <li id="t79c04a14saAol46">
     If shareholder action was required to revoke the dissolution, the information required by Section 79-4-14.03(a)(3).
    </li>
   </ol>
   <p>
    Unless a delayed effective date is specified, revocation of dissolution is effective upon the effective date of the articles of revocation of dissolution are filed.

    A corporate obligor and those who control it may not with impunity dissolve the corporation in a debt avoidance maneuver and cause its assets to be transferred to a new successor corporation. This is so whether the debt arises in contract, quasi-contract, or tort. Where a corporation unsuccessfully sought to avoid liability on a contract with a former shareholder by dissolving the corporation and transferring assets to a newly formed corporation, the shareholder’s rights against the new corporation were limited to the extent that the new corporation acquired assets of the contracting corporation without paying fair value therefor.

    Known claims against dissolved corporation.
   </p>
   <p>
    A dissolved corporation may dispose of the known claims against it by notifying its known claimants in writing of the dissolution at any time after its effective date.
   </p>
   <p>
    The written notice must:
   </p>
   <ol>
    <li id="t79c04a14saAol61">
     Describe information that must be included in a claim;
    </li>
    <li id="t79c04a14saAol62">
     Provide a mailing address where a claim may be sent;
    </li>
    <li id="t79c04a14saAol63">
     State the deadline, which may not be fewer than one hundred twenty (120) days from the effective date of the written notice, by which the dissolved corporation must receive the claim; and
    </li>
    <li id="t79c04a14saAol64">
     State that the claim will be barred if not received by the deadline.
    </li>
   </ol>
   <p>
    A claim against the dissolved corporation is barred:
   </p>
   <p>
    If a claimant who was given written notice under subsection (b) does not deliver the claim to the dissolved corporation by the deadline; or
   </p>
   <p>
    If a claimant whose claim was rejected by the dissolved corporation does not commence a proceeding to enforce the claim within ninety (90) days from the effective date of the rejection notice.
   </p>
   <p>
    For purposes of this section, “claim” does not include a contingent liability or a claim based on an event occurring after the effective date of dissolution.

    Dissolved corporations — chancery court proceedings for security payment of claims; notice; guardian ad litem; satisfaction of claim.
   </p>
   <p>
    A dissolved corporation that has published a notice under Section 79-4-14.07 may file an application with the chancery court of the county where the dissolved corporation’s principal office is located, or the Chancery Court of the First Judicial District of Hinds County, Mississippi, if the corporation does not have a principal office in this state, for a determination of the amount and form of security to be provided for payment of claims that are contingent or have not been made known to the dissolved corporation or that are based on an event occurring after the effective date of dissolution but that, based on the facts known to the dissolved corporation, are reasonably estimated to arise after the effective date of dissolution. Provision need not be made for any claim that is or is reasonably anticipated to be barred under Section 79-4-14.07(c).
   </p>
   <p>
    Within ten (10) days after the filing of the application, notice of the proceeding shall be given by the dissolved corporation to each claimant holding a contingent claim whose contingent claim is shown on the records of the dissolved corporation.
   </p>
   <p>
    The court may appoint a guardian ad litem to represent all claimants whose identities are unknown in any proceeding brought under this section. The reasonable fees and expenses of such guardian, including all reasonable expert witness fees, shall be paid by the dissolved corporation.
   </p>
   <p>
    Provision by the dissolved corporation for security in the amount and the form ordered by the court under subsection (a) of this section shall satisfy the dissolved corporation’s obligations with respect to claims that are contingent, have not been made known to the dissolved corporation or are based on an event occurring after the effective date of dissolution, and such claims may not be enforced against a shareholder who received assets in liquidation.

    Liability for corporate debt was limited to those officers and directors who were actively involved in the control and management of the corporation, and the president’s testimony at trial made it clear he was involved in the control and management of the corporation; however, where there was no proof of any assignment to the president by the corporation of any chose in action as contemplated under Miss. Code § 11-7-7, the president had no standing to pursue the action on behalf of the corporation. Consequently, although the president, individually, could have been held liable for the corporate torts committed by the corporation, he had no authority to sue on a contract that belonged to the corporation; accordingly, all claims brought by the corporation and the president were dismissed. 4 H Constr.

    Procedure for and effect of administrative dissolution.
   </p>
   <p>
    If the Secretary of State determines that one or more grounds exist under Section 79-4-14.20 for dissolving a corporation, he shall serve the corporation with written notice of his determination, except that such determination may be served by first-class mail.
   </p>
   <p>
    If the corporation does not correct each ground for dissolution or demonstrate to the reasonable satisfaction of the Secretary of State that each ground determined by the Secretary of State does not exist within sixty (60) days after service of the notice is perfected, the Secretary of State shall administratively dissolve the corporation by signing a certificate of dissolution that recites the ground or grounds for dissolution and its effective date. The Secretary of State shall file the original of the certificate and serve a copy on the corporation, except that such certificate may be served by first-class mail.
   </p>
   <p>
    A corporation that has been administratively dissolved continues its corporate existence but may not carry on any business except as necessary to wind up and liquidate its business and affairs under Section 79-4-14.05 and notify claimants under Sections 79-4-14.06 and 79-4-14.07.

    The administrative dissolution of a corporation does not terminate the authority of its registered agent.

    The administrative dissolution of a corporation shall not impair the validity of any contract, deed, mortgage, security interest, lien, or act of the corporation or prevent the corporation from defending any action, suit or proceeding in any court of this state.
   </p>
   <p>
    A corporation that has been administratively dissolved may not maintain any action, suit or proceeding in any court of this state until the corporation is reinstated.

    Pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. § 79-4-14.21(c) the corporate existence of the corporation continued, but it was not authorized to carry on any business except that necessary to wind up and liquidate its business and affairs. Because the corporation failed to comply with the process under § 79-4-14.22(a) to reinstate the corporation, the court found that during the period relevant to the present litigation, the corporation was not a viable entity and thus did not have standing to enter into the contracts at issue; therefore, it followed that the corporation’s claims for breach of contract, misrepresentation, and quantum meruit were moot and had to be dismissed. 4 H Constr.

    Reinstatement following administrative dissolution.
   </p>
   <p>
    A corporation administratively dissolved under Section 79-4-14.21 may apply to the Secretary of State for reinstatement at any time after the effective date of dissolution. The applicant must:
   </p>
   <ol>
    <li id="t79c04a14saBol21">
     Recite the name of the corporation and the effective date of its administrative dissolution;
    </li>

     State that the ground or grounds for dissolution either did not exist or have been eliminated;

    <li id="t79c04a14saBol24">
     Contain a certificate from the Mississippi Department of Revenue reciting that all taxes owed by the corporation have been paid.
    </li>
   </ol>
   <p>
    If the Secretary of State determines that the application contains the information required by subsection (a) and that the information is correct, he shall cancel the certificate of dissolution and prepare a certificate of reinstatement that recites his determination and the effective date of reinstatement, file the original of the certificate and serve a copy on the corporation.
   </p>
   <p>
    When the reinstatement is effective:
   </p>
   <p>
    The reinstatement relates back to and takes effect as of the effective date of the administrative dissolution;
   </p>
   <p>
    Any liability incurred by the corporation, director, officer or a shareholder after the administrative dissolution and before the reinstatement shall be determined as if the administrative dissolution had never occurred; and

    Pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. § 79-4-14.21(c) the corporate existence of the corporation continued, but it was not authorized to carry on any business except that necessary to wind up and liquidate its business and affairs. Because the corporation failed to comply with the process under § 79-4-14.22(a) to reinstate the corporation, the court found that during the period relevant to the present litigation, the corporation was not a viable entity and thus did not have standing to enter into the contracts at issue; therefore, it followed that the corporation’s claims for breach of contract, misrepresentation, and quantum meruit were moot and had to be dismissed. 4 H Constr.

    Appeal from denial of reinstatement.
   </p>
   <p>
    If the Secretary of State denies a corporation’s application for reinstatement following administrative dissolution, he shall serve the corporation with a written notice that explains the reason or reasons for denial.
   </p>
   <p>
    The corporation may appeal the denial of reinstatement to the Chancery Court of the First Judicial District of Hinds County or the chancery court of the county where the corporation’s principal office is located or where the corporation is domiciled within thirty (30) days after service of the notice of denial is perfected. The corporation appeals by petitioning the court to set aside the dissolution and attaching to the petition copies of the Secretary of State’s certificate of dissolution, the corporation’s application for reinstatement and the Secretary of State’s notice of denial.
   </p>
   <p>
    The court may summarily order the Secretary of State to reinstate the dissolved corporation or may take other action the court considers appropriate.

    The court’s final decision may be appealed as in other civil proceedings.

    Procedure for judicial dissolution.
   </p>
   <p>
    Venue for a proceeding brought by any party named in Section 79-4-14.30 lies in the county where a corporation’s principal office is or was located, or the Chancery Court of the First Judicial District of Hinds County, Mississippi, if the corporation does not have a principal office in this state.

   <p>
    It is not necessary to make shareholders parties to a proceeding to dissolve a corporation unless relief is sought against them individually.
   </p>
   <p>
    A court in a proceeding brought to dissolve a corporation may issue injunctions, appoint a receiver or custodian pendente lite with all powers and duties the court directs, take other action required to preserve the corporate assets wherever located, and carry on the business of the corporation until a full hearing can be held.
   </p>
   <p>
    Within ten (10) days of the commencement of a proceeding under Section 79-4-14.30(2) to dissolve a corporation that is not a public corporation, the corporation shall send to all shareholders, other than the petitioner, a notice stating that the shareholders are entitled to avoid the dissolution of the corporation by electing to purchase the petitioner’s shares under Section 79-4-14.34 and accompanied by a copy of Section 79-4-14.34.

    An order for the dissolution of a corporation and the appointment of a receiver was void where the petition for the dissolution of the corporation and the appointment of the receiver did not allege the existence of any emergency justifying the appointment of a receiver without notice, and the president and vice president, who owned the majority of the stock, were not given notice, and no bond was executed, as required by Code 1942, § 1357.

   <h3>
    Chancellor was justified in terminating the receivership and returning the assets to the corporation where the entire proceedings wherein the dissolution of the corporation was ordered and the receiver appointed were void for want of notice to other stockholders, and for failure to post the receiver’s bond, without regard to the fact that the president and vice president, who were majority stockholders of the corporation, failed to testify in the case.

    Receivership or custodianship.
   </p>
   <p>
    Unless an election to purchase has been filed under Section 79-4-14.34, a court in a judicial proceeding brought to dissolve a corporation may appoint one or more receivers to wind up and liquidate, or one or more custodians to manage, the business and affairs of the corporation.The court shall hold a hearing, after notifying all parties to the proceeding and any interested persons designated by the court, before appointing a receiver or custodian.The court appointing a receiver or custodian has jurisdiction over the corporation and all its property wherever located.
   </p>
   <p>
    The court may appoint an individual or a domestic or foreign corporation (authorized to transact business in this state) as a receiver or custodian. The court may require the receiver or custodian to post bond, with or without sureties, in an amount the court directs.
   </p>
   <p>
    The court shall describe the powers and duties of the receiver or custodian in its appointing order, which may be amended from time to time. Among other powers:
   </p>
   <ol>
    <li id="t79c04a14saCol21">
     The receiver (i) may dispose of all or any part of the assets of the corporation wherever located, at a public or private sale, if authorized by the court; and (ii) may sue and defend in his own name as receiver of the corporation in all courts of this state;
    </li>
    <li id="t79c04a14saCol22">
     The custodian may exercise all the powers of the corporation, through or in place of its board of directors or officers, to the extent necessary to manage the affairs of the corporation in the best interests of its shareholders and creditors.
    </li>
   </ol>
   <p>
    The court during a receivership may redesignate the receiver a custodian, and during a custodianship may redesignate the custodian a receiver, if doing so is in the best interests of the corporation, its shareholders and creditors.
   </p>
   <p>
    The court from time to time during the receivership or custodianship may order compensation paid and expenses paid or reimbursed to the receiver or custodian from the assets of the corporation or proceeds from the sale of the assets.

    Election to purchase in lieu of dissolution.
   </p>
   <p>
    In a proceeding under Section 79-4-14.30(a)(2) to dissolve a corporation, the corporation may elect or, if it fails to elect, one or more shareholders may elect to purchase all shares owned by the petitioning shareholder at the fair value of the shares.An election pursuant to this section shall be irrevocable unless the court determines that it is equitable to set aside or modify the election.
   </p>
   <p>
    An election to purchase pursuant to this section may be filed with the court at any time within ninety (90) days after the filing of the petition under Section 79-4-14.30(a)(2) or at such later time as the court in its discretion may allow. If the election to purchase is filed by one or more shareholders, the corporation shall, within ten (10) days thereafter, give written notice to all shareholders, other than the petitioner. The notice must state the name and number of shares owned by the petitioner and the name and number of shares owned by each electing shareholder and must advise the recipients of their right to join in the election to purchase shares in accordance with this section. Shareholders who wish to participate must file notice of their intention to join in the purchase no later than thirty (30) days after the effective date of the notice to them. All shareholders who have filed an election or notice of their intention to participate in the election to purchase thereby become parties to the proceeding and shall participate in the purchase in proportion to their ownership of shares as of the date the first election was filed, unless they otherwise agree or the court otherwise directs. After an election has been filed by the corporation or one or more shareholders, the proceeding under Section 79-4-14.30(a)(2) may not be discontinued or settled, nor may the petitioning shareholder sell or otherwise dispose of his shares, unless the court determines that it would be equitable to the corporation and the shareholders, other than the petitioner, to permit such discontinuance, settlement, sale or other disposition.
   </p>
   <p>
    If, within sixty (60) days of the filing of the first election, the parties reach agreement as to the fair value and terms of purchase of the petitioner’s shares, the court shall enter an order directing the purchase of petitioner’s shares upon the terms and conditions agreed to by the parties.
   </p>
   <p>
    If the parties are unable to reach an agreement as provided for in subsection (c), the court, upon application of any party, shall stay the Section 79-4-14.30(a)(2) proceedings and determine the fair value of the petitioner’s shares as of the day before the date on which the petition under Section 79-4-14.30(a)(2) was filed or as of such other date as the court deems appropriate under the circumstances.
   </p>
   <p>
    Upon determining the fair value of the shares, the court shall enter an order directing the purchase upon such terms and conditions as the court deems appropriate, which may include payment of the purchase price in installments, where necessary in the interests of equity, provision for security to assure payment of the purchase price and any additional costs, fees and expenses as may have been awarded, and, if the shares are to be purchased by shareholders, the allocation of shares among them. In allocating petitioner’s shares among holders of different classes of shares, the court should attempt to preserve the existing distribution of voting rights among holders of different classes insofar as practicable and may direct that holders of a specific class or classes shall not participate in the purchase. Interest may be allowed at the rate and from the date determined by the court to be equitable, but if the court finds that the refusal of the petitioning shareholder to accept an offer of payment was arbitrary or otherwise not in good faith, no interest shall be allowed. If the court finds that the petitioning shareholder had probable grounds for relief under Section 79-4-14.30(a)(2)(ii) or (iv), it may award to the petitioning shareholder reasonable fees and expenses of counsel and of any experts employed by him.
   </p>
   <p>
    Upon entry of an order under subsection (c) or (e), the court shall dismiss the petition to dissolve the corporation under Section 79-4-14.30, and the petitioning shareholder shall no longer have any rights or status as a shareholder of the corporation, except the right to receive the amounts awarded to him by the order of the court which shall be enforceable in the same manner as any other judgment.
   </p>
   <p>
    The purchase ordered pursuant to subsection (e) shall be made within ten (10) days after the date the order becomes final unless before that time the corporation files with the court a notice of its intention to adopt articles of dissolution pursuant to Sections 79-4-14.02 and 79-4-14.03, which articles must then be adopted and filed within fifty (50) days thereafter. Upon filing of such articles of dissolution, the corporation shall be dissolved in accordance with the provisions of Sections 79-4-14.05 through 79-4-14.07 and the order entered pursuant to subsection (e) shall no longer be of any force or effect, except that the court may award the petitioning shareholder reasonable fees and expenses in accordance with the provisions of the last sentence of subsection (e) and the petitioner may continue to pursue any claims previously asserted on behalf of the corporation.
   </p>
   <p>
    Any payment by the corporation pursuant to an order under subsection (c) or (e), other than an award of fees and expenses pursuant to subsection (e), is subject to the provisions of Section 79-4-6.40.
   </p>
   <p>
    Nothing contained in this section shall diminish the inherent equity powers of the court to fashion alternative remedies to judicial dissolution.

   <h3>
    If a foreign corporation is not transacting business in Mississippi, a certificate of authority is not required in order to maintain an action in Mississippi, as demonstrated by § 79-4-15.02(c) which states that a court may stay a proceeding commenced by a foreign corporation until it determines whether the corporation requires a certificate of authority; since the court is granted some amount of discretion, it is apparent that not all foreign corporations require a certificate to maintain an action. Mississippi Ins. Guar. Ass'n v. Harkins & Co., 652 So. 2d 732, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 145 (Miss. 1995).

   <h3>
    A foreign corporation was not transacting business in Mississippi, and therefore did not need a certificate of authority in order to maintain an action in Mississippi where the only business contact the corporation had with Mississippi was the actual commencement of the suit, since § 79-4-15.01(b)(1) states that simply maintaining, defending, or settling a proceeding does not constitute “transacting business.” Mississippi Ins. Guar. Ass'n v. Harkins & Co., 652 So. 2d 732, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 145 (Miss. 1995).

    A foreign corporation domesticated in Mississippi under statute remains a resident of state of original incorporation for all jurisdictional purposes, state and federal, and is subject to attachment in Mississippi courts as a “nonresident,” since, for purpose of removing to federal court an action brought in state of domestication, a domesticated foreign corporation is a nonresident.

    In a personal injury action against a domesticated foreign corporation, the trial court’s exercise of jurisdiction as an attachment in chancery on the grounds of nonresidency did not violate the corporation’s right to equal protection of the laws, even though it claimed to be a domestic corporation for all intents and purposes, where the state of incorporation retained, inter alia, supervisory power and the final authority to dissolve the corporation. Louisville & N. R. Co. v. Hasty, 360 So. 2d 925, 1978 Miss. LEXIS 2307 (Miss.), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 1003, 99 S. Ct. 614, 58 L. Ed. 2d 679, 1978 U.S. LEXIS 4129 (U.S. 1978).

    Foreign corporation seeking to maintain action for breach of contract was not barred under Miss Code § 79-3-247 [repealed] from bringing action for failure to have certificate of authority to do business in state where foreign corporation maintained no office or bank account in state and had no employees in state and where purpose of contract was for foreign corporation to manage hotel, thus bringing business within reach of Commerce Clause and within exception to definition of “transacting business” under § 79-3-211 [repealed]. Madden Management, Inc. v. First Equities Corp., 666 F. Supp. 96, 1987 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7872 (N.D. Miss. 1987).
   </h3>
   <h3>
    If foreign corporation is qualified to do business in State of Mississippi, even though it may not be doing any business, its agent for process may be served and courts have personal jurisdiction over that corporation; actually doing business in state has nothing to do with personal jurisdiction where foreign corporation has qualified to do business in state; corporation qualifying to do business in state, under appropriate statutes, becomes like individual as far as suit is concerned. Read v. Sonat Offshore Drilling, Inc., 515 So. 2d 1229, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2929 (Miss. 1987).
   </h3>
   <h3>
    In a diversity action by a Florida construction company in federal district court for Mississippi, seeking to recover a construction contract debt from the surety, a Mississippi bank, the trial court committed reversible error when it granted the bank’s motion for dismissal on the grounds that the foreign company had engaged in intrastate commerce without qualifying to do so as required by Mississippi law, and thus, was precluded from maintaining an action in Mississippi state or federal court, where contract substantially related to interstate activities, where, under the National Bank Act, the bank was required to be sued where it was located, and where it would have been an impermissible burden on interstate commerce to permit Mississippi courtroom doors to remain closed to such foreign company on events and contracts substantially related to interstate activities. Diversacon Industries, Inc. v. National Bank of Commerce, 629 F.2d 1030, 1980 U.S. App. LEXIS 12640 (5th Cir. Miss. 1980).
   </h3>
   <h3>
    A Georgia corporation was not barred from seeking relief in the Mississippi courts for an alleged breach of a restrictive covenant by one of its former employees, even though the claim arose out of the transaction of business in the state and even though plaintiff corporation had not first obtained a certificate of authority from the Secretary of State, where the record supported the trial court’s findings that plaintiff was engaged in interstate commerce and was thus exempted by subsections (d) and (e) of this section from the certificate requirements. Cheatham v. Kem Mfg. Corp., 372 So. 2d 1085, 1979 Miss. LEXIS 2148 (Miss. 1979).
   </h3>
   <h3>
    Payment of the contractor’s privilege tax by a foreign corporation did not relieve it of the requirement that it obtain a certificate of authority to do business from the secretary of state and, absent such certificate, the contractor was not entitled to sue in state court to enforce a construction lien. Town & Country Plumbing Co. v. Delta Real Estate Development, Inc., 357 So. 2d 126, 1978 Miss. LEXIS 2491 (Miss. 1978).
   </h3>
   <h3>
    An Arkansas corporation was doing business within the state where, of its chain of franchised retail stores, several were in Mississippi, and, with respect to a particular Mississippi store from which it sought recovery of franchise fees and other charges, evidence showed that the corporation had a contract right to control virtually the entire operation of the store and that it was in fact significantly involved in that operation. Barbee v. United Dollar Stores, Inc., 337 So. 2d 1277, 1976 Miss. LEXIS 1617 (Miss. 1976).
   </h3>
   <h3>
    An Ohio corporation that had acted as purchaser and lessor of frozen drink machines, buying them from a Georgia corporation and leasing them to individuals in Mississippi who had agreed to lease them in an arrangement made through the Georgia corporation, was not “transacting” business within Mississippi within the meaning of § 79-3-247 [repealed] and could bring an action in the Mississippi district court to recover amounts due on the lease from the lessees. Xyoquip, Inc. v. Mims, 413 F. Supp. 962, 1976 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17295 (N.D. Miss. 1976).

   <h3>
    In a suit filed by a foreign corporation having no certificate of authority to do business in this state, where the record showed that the only business that the plaintiff had transacted in this state was entering into the lease contract with the defendant which was the subject of the suit, the transaction sued upon fell within the exception set up in Code 1972, § 79-3-211(d) [repealed], and the plaintiff was therefore not barred from bringing suit by Code 1972, § 79-3-247 [repealed]. Mid--Continent Refrigerator Co. v. Starks, 298 So. 2d 714, 1974 Miss. LEXIS 1572 (Miss. 1974).

   <h3>
    Diversity action brought by nonresident plaintiffs to recover a brokerage fee allegedly owed by the defendant for two loan commitments was not barred by Code 1972 § 79-3-247 [repealed] where the transactions involved fell within the exception found in Code 1972 § 79-3-211(e) [repealed]. Ivor B. Clark Co. v. Southern Business & Industrial Development Co., 399 F. Supp. 824, 1974 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6123 (S.D. Miss. 1974).

   <h3>
    A foreign corporation not authorized by statute to do business in Mississippi cannot resort either to the state or to the federal court sitting within the state to enforce its rights unless they arose from and were exempted as a transaction in interstate commerce. Cone Mills Corp. v. Hurdle, 369 F. Supp. 426, 1974 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12865 (N.D. Miss. 1974).
   </h3>
   <h3>
    Code 1942, § 5309-239, prohibiting foreign corporations lacking a certificate of authority to maintain any action, suit or proceeding in the state, is a punitive statute designed to penalize those foreign corporations doing business in the State of Mississippi without qualifying as required by Code 1942, § 5309-221. Alabama Live Poultry, Inc. v. Ervin, 246 So. 2d 915, 1971 Miss. LEXIS 1429 (Miss. 1971).
   </h3>
   <h3>
    A foreign corporation’s negotiation and purchase of common stock in one or more subsidiary companies within Mississippi does not render it doing business within the purview of the qualification statutes, and the fact that acquisition of stock in other companies was an avowed purpose of the foreign corporation’s charter has no effect upon the operation of this rule. Mid-Continent Tel. Corp. v. Home Tel. Co., 307 F. Supp. 1014, 1969 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12626 (N.D. Miss. 1969).
   </h3>
   <h3>
    The purchase or ownership of stock, even of a controlling interest, in a domestic corporation by a foreign corporation does not constitute doing business by the foreign corporation sufficient to subject it to service of process in the state of the subsidary’s operation. Mid-Continent Tel. Corp. v. Home Tel. Co., 307 F. Supp. 1014, 1969 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12626 (N.D. Miss. 1969).
   </h3>
   <h3>
    That a foreign corporation entered into a service agreement with its Mississippi subsidiary whereby it furnishes to the subsidiary, upon its request, services in various areas requiring technical training and expertise and also sold to its subsidiary equipment and supplies, lends its money, and other financial assistance, local activities at least partly performed in Mississippi, these facts are insufficient to support the conclusion that the foreign corporation is “doing business” in the State of Mississippi. Mid-Continent Tel. Corp. v. Home Tel. Co., 307 F. Supp. 1014, 1969 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12626 (N.D. Miss. 1969).
   </h3>
   <h3>
    A greater degree of business activity is required to bar a foreign corporation from Mississippi courts than is required to subject the same foreign corporation to local service of process under the state’s long arm statute. Mid-Continent Tel. Corp. v. Home Tel. Co., 307 F. Supp. 1014, 1969 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12626 (N.D. Miss. 1969).
   </h3>
   <h3>
    A foreign corporation is “doing business” within the state where it performs acts (not excluded by the statute itself) that are within the functions of its corporate powers and the business so performed is substantial in scope, and the substantiality and scope of local activity are equated with some substantial part of its ordinary or customary business, usually continuous in the sense that it may be distinguished from merely casual, sporadic, or occasional transactions and isolated acts. Mid-Continent Tel. Corp. v. Home Tel. Co., 307 F. Supp. 1014, 1969 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12626 (N.D. Miss. 1969).
   </h3>
   <h3>
    A corporation is doing business for purposes of requiring it to qualify to have access to the courts of Mississippi when the corporation enters the state and carries on a substantial part of its business there on a regular basis, and the question of whether a corporation is so doing business in the state is one of the facts to be determined by the circumstances of each particular case, and the corporation’s activities must be judged as a whole. Humboldt Foods, Inc. v. Massey, 297 F. Supp. 236, 1968 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7941 (N.D. Miss. 1968).
   </h3>
   <h3>
    A Tennessee food processing corporation, which entered into a contract with five Mississippi planters under which the latter agreed to cultivate 1000 acres of green beans and the processor obligated itself to harvest and transport the beans, was not engaged in doing business in Mississippi, and was not prohibited from maintaining an action in federal court in that state, although not qualified to do business there. Humboldt Foods, Inc. v. Massey, 297 F. Supp. 236, 1968 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7941 (N.D. Miss. 1968).
   </h3>
   <h3>
    A corporation is not doing business in Mississippi merely because it has employees or agents in the state to solicit orders to be transmitted to the principal, or to perform acts incidental to interstate commerce. Humboldt Foods, Inc. v. Massey, 297 F. Supp. 236, 1968 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7941 (N.D. Miss. 1968).
   </h3>

    The penalty imposed against a foreign corporation doing business in Mississippi without having first qualified is that it shall not be permitted to avail itself of the state courts to enforce a cause of action accruing to it prior to the time it qualified to do business; but the contracts and other acts of a foreign corporation entered into or performed prior to its qualification are not rendered invalid.

    Where the sale of phonograph instruments to Mississippi residents by an Illinois corporation, which had no resident agent and had not filed a copy of its charter, was made through a Texas distributor, and was interstate in character, the fact that the distributor, who was compensated by a sales commission, had some sort of an understanding with the purchasers that the instrument would be kept in repair by the distributor, and the distributor did from time to time render this service, did not operate to take away the interstate character of the sale so as to preclude the corporation from foreclosing a chattel mortgage on the instrument.

The fact that local correspondents, who received and transmitted applications for loans to a foreign loan corporation, were or were not agents of the corporation, rather than of the borrower, was immaterial in determining that the corporation was not doing business within the state, and so was not subject to the requirement as to filing a copy of its charter and appointing an agent to receive service of process.

    Consequences of transacting business without authority.
   </p>
   <p>
    A foreign corporation transacting business in this state without a certificate of authority may not maintain a proceeding in any court in this state until it obtains a certificate of authority.
   </p>
   <p>
    The successor to a foreign corporation that transacted business in this state without a certificate of authority and the assignee of a cause of action arising out of that business may not maintain a proceeding based on that cause of action in any court in this state until the foreign corporation or its successor obtains a certificate of authority.
   </p>
   <p>
    A court may stay a proceeding commenced by a foreign corporation, its successor or assignee until it determines whether the foreign corporation or its successor requires a certificate of authority. If it so determines, the court may further stay the proceeding until the foreign corporation or its successor obtains the certificate.
   </p>
   <p>
    A foreign corporation is liable for a civil penalty of Ten Dollars ($10.00) for each day, but not to exceed a total of One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00) for each year, it transacts business in this state without a certificate of authority. The Attorney General may collect all penalties due under this subsection.
   </p>
   <p>
    Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b), the failure of a foreign corporation to obtain a certificate of authority shall not impair the validity of any contract, deed, mortgage, security interest, lien or act of such foreign corporation or prevent the foreign corporation from defending any action, suit or proceeding in any court of this state.

    Mississippi’s closing-door statute, Miss.

Furthermore, the statute did not apply because the bank was merely defending the lawsuit brought by the homeowners. Carson v. McNeal, 375 F. Supp. 2d 509, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13166 (S.D. Miss. 2005).

    Federal district court dismissed, on grounds of res judicata, the claims of a foreign corporation, even though the prior dismissal of its claims by a State court had been erroneous where the corporation had not been authorized to do business at that time under Miss. Code Ann. § 79-4-15.02(a), but the State court should have stayed the proceedings under Miss. Code Ann. § 79-4-15.02(c). Cuba Timber Co., Plaintiff v. Boswell, 339 F. Supp. 2d 773, 2004 U.S. Dist.

    If a foreign corporation is not transacting business in Mississippi, a certificate of authority is not required in order to maintain an action in Mississippi, as demonstrated by § 79-4-15.02(c) which states that a court may stay a proceeding commenced by a foreign corporation until it determines whether the corporation requires a certificate of authority; since the court is granted some amount of discretion, it is apparent that not all foreign corporations require a certificate to maintain an action.

    A foreign corporation was not transacting business in Mississippi, and therefore did not need a certificate of authority in order to maintain an action in Mississippi where the only business contact the corporation had with Mississippi was the actual commencement of the suit, since § 79-4-15.01(b)(1) states that simply maintaining, defending, or settling a proceeding does not constitute “transacting business.” Mississippi Ins.

    In a diversity action by a Florida construction company in federal district court for Mississippi, seeking to recover a construction contract debt from the surety, a Mississippi bank, the trial court committed reversible error when it granted the bank’s motion for dismissal on the grounds that the foreign company had engaged in intrastate commerce without qualifying to do so as required by Mississippi law, and thus, was precluded from maintaining an action in Mississippi state or federal court, where contract substantially related to interstate activities, where, under the National Bank Act, the bank was required to be sued where it was located, and where it would have been an impermissible burden on interstate commerce to permit Mississippi courtroom doors to remain closed to such foreign company on events and contracts substantially related to interstate activities.

    The Mississippi Supreme Court’s judgment holding that because of an out-of-state cotton merchant’s failure to obtain a certificate of authority to qualify to do business in the state as a foreign corporation, the merchant, pursuant to Code 1942, § 5309-239, could not maintain an action in the state courts against a resident cotton farmer for his breach of a contract to sell his future cotton crop to the merchant by delivering the cotton to the merchant at a local warehouse-such contract having been negotiated by an independent, local broker whose practice was to telephone the necessary information to the merchant at its out-of-state office, where a contract was prepared and signed by the merchant and then forwarded to the broker to obtain the farmer’s signature-is repugnant to the commerce clause of the Federal Constitution (Art I, § 8, cl 3), where (1) even though delivery of the cotton to the merchant’s account at the local warehouse, taken in isolation, was an intrastate transaction, nevertheless such delivery was a part of interstate commerce since it was essential for sorting and classifying the cotton as a prerequisite to its shipment in interstate or foreign commerce under the merchant’s contracts for sale of the cotton to customers outside the state, and (2) the merchant’s contracts with the forum state did not exhibit the sort of localization or intrastate character required in situations where a state seeks to require a foreign corporation to qualify to do business, since the local broker who arranged the contracts was paid on a commission basis and had no authority to execute contracts on the merchant’s behalf, and since the merchant had no office or warehouse in the state, and no employees soliciting business or otherwise operating in the state on a regular basis.

   <h3>
    The usual test of whether a foreign corporation is doing business within the meaning of the statutes is whether or not it is doing such acts as are within the function of its corporate powers, and where the business so performed is substantial in scope such corporation is held to be doing business.

    Where the sale of phonograph instruments to Mississippi residents by an Illinois corporation, which had no resident agent and had not filed a copy of its charter, was made through a Texas distributor, and was interstate in character, the fact that the distributor, who was compensated by a sales commission, had some sort of an understanding with the purchasers that the instrument would be kept in repair by the distributor, and the distributor did from time to time render this service, did not operate to take away the interstate character of the sale so as to preclude the corporation from foreclosing a chattel mortgage on the instrument.

   <h3>
    The fact that local correspondents, who received and transmitted applications for loans to a foreign loan corporation, were or were not agents of the corporation, rather than of the borrower, was immaterial in determining that the corporation was not doing business within the state, and so was not subject to the requirement as to filing a copy of its charter and appointing an agent to receive service of process.

    A foreign corporation was not doing business in Mississippi within the meaning of the statute, where it appeared that it was engaged in the business of procuring loans, its local agent sending the applications to the corporation’s home office for examination, and acceptance or rejection, and, if accepted, the transaction in connection with the loan was conducted through the home office, and the corporation required the borrower to pay its commission for handling the loan at the home office, or to execute notes payable to it in the city in which its home office was located.

    In an action on a note by a foreign corporation, in which the defendant pleaded abatement on the ground that the plaintiff had not filed a copy of its charter or appointed an agent to receive service of process, the requirement of interrogatories propounded by the defendant as to all transactions of the corporation within the state from 1923 to 1931 would impose such a burden upon the right to sue as practically to defeat it, and so would not be done, where it appeared that many of the transactions had no relation to the suit before the court and so were irrelevant, there was no index to the plaintiff’s files, which were stored in such a manner that it was practically impossible to go through them, and the defendant had not accepted an offer to give them access to the files.

Watson v. J. R. Watkins Co., 188 Miss. 435, 193 So. 913, 1940 Miss. LEXIS 17 (Miss. 1940).

   <h3>
    However, an undertaking by a foreign corporation in connection with a conditional sale of an ice cream dispenser, otherwise an interstate transaction, to service it gratis for a year, gives the transaction a local character, rendering the contract of conditional sale unenforceable by reason of the corporation’s failure to comply with the requirement of this section [Code 1942, § 5343] with regard to filing a copy of its charter in order to do business in the state.

   </p>
   <ol>
    <li id="t79c04a15saAol41">
     May add the word “corporation,” “incorporated,” “company” or “limited,” or the abbreviation “corp.,” “inc.,” “co.” or “ltd.,” to its corporate name for use in this state; or
    </li>
    <li id="t79c04a15saAol42">
     May use a fictitious name to transact business in this state if its real name is unavailable and it delivers to the Secretary of State for filing a copy of the resolution of its board of directors, certified by its secretary, adopting the fictitious name.
    </li>

     A name that is reserved or registered in the Office of the Secretary of State for any of the entities named in subsection (b) which reservation or registration has not expired.
    </li>
   </ol>
   <p>
    Except as authorized by subsections (c) and (d), the corporate name (including a fictitious name) of a foreign corporation must be distinguishable upon the records of the Secretary of State from:
   </p>
   <p>
    The corporate name of a corporation incorporated or authorized to transact business in this state;
   </p>

    A foreign corporation may apply to the Secretary of State for authorization to use in this state the name of another corporation (incorporated or authorized to transact business in this state) that is not distinguishable upon his records from the name applied for. The Secretary of State shall authorize use of the name applied for if:
   </p>
   <p>
    The other corporation consents to the use in writing and submits an undertaking in form satisfactory to the Secretary of State to change its name to a name that is distinguishable upon the records of the Secretary of State from the name of the applying corporation; or
   </p>

   <p>
    Has merged with the other corporation;
   </p>
   <p>
    Has been formed by reorganization of the other corporation; or

    §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t79c04s79-4-15.31" target="_self">79-4-15.31</a></cite>.
    Procedure for and effect of revocation.
   </p>
   <p>
    If the Secretary of State determines that one or more grounds exist under Section 79-4-15.30 for revocation of a certificate of authority, he shall serve the foreign corporation with written notice of his determination under Section 79-4-15.10, except that such determination may be served by first class mail.
   </p>
   <p>
    If the foreign corporation does not correct each ground for revocation or demonstrate to the reasonable satisfaction of the Secretary of State that each ground determined by the Secretary of State does not exist within sixty (60) days after service of the notice is perfected under Section 79-4-15.10, the Secretary of State may revoke the foreign corporation’s certificate of authority by signing a certificate of revocation that recites the ground or grounds for revocation and its effective date. The Secretary of State shall file the original of the certificate and serve a copy on the foreign corporation under Section 79-4-15.10, except that such certificate may be served by first-class mail.
   </p>
   <p>
    The authority of a foreign corporation to transact business in this state ceases on the date shown on the certificate revoking its certificate of authority.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Secretary of State’s revocation of a foreign corporation’s certificate of authority appoints the Secretary of State the foreign corporation’s agent for service of process in any proceeding based on a cause of action which arose during the time the foreign corporation was authorized to transact business in this state. Service of process on the Secretary of State under the Mississippi Rules of Civil Procedure is service on the foreign corporation. Upon receipt of process, the Secretary of State shall mail a copy of the process to the secretary of the foreign corporation at its principal office shown in its most recent annual report or in any subsequent communication received from the corporation stating the current mailing address of its principal office, or, if none are on file, in its application for a certificate of authority.
   </p>
   <p>
    Revocation of a foreign corporation’s certificate of authority does not terminate the authority of the registered agent of the corporation.
   </p>
   <p>
    The administrative revocation of a foreign corporation’s certificate of authority shall not impair the validity of any contract, deed, mortgage, security interest, lien or act of such foreign corporation or prevent the foreign corporation from defending any action, suit or proceeding with any court of this state.
   </p>
   <p>
    A foreign corporation whose registration has been administratively revoked may not maintain any action, suit or proceeding in any court of this state until such foreign corporation’s certificate of authority has been reinstated.

    Appeal from revocation.
   </p>
   <p>
    A foreign corporation whose certificate of authority is administratively revoked under Section 79-4-15.31 may apply to the Secretary of State for reinstatement at any time after the effective date of such revocation. The application must:
   </p>
   <ol>
    <li id="t79c04a15saCol21">
     Recite the name of the corporation and the effective date of the administrative revocation;
    </li>
    <li id="t79c04a15saCol22">
     State that the ground or grounds for revocation either did not exist or have been eliminated;
    </li>
    <li id="t79c04a15saCol23">
     State that the corporation’s name satisfies the requirements of Section 79-4-4.01; and
    </li>
    <li id="t79c04a15saCol24">
     Contain a certificate from the Mississippi Department of Revenue reciting that the corporation has properly filed all reports and paid all taxes and penalties required by revenue laws of this state.
    </li>
   </ol>
   <p>
    If the Secretary of State determines that the application contains the information required by subsection (a) and that the information is correct, he shall reinstate the certificate of authority, prepare a certificate that recites his determination and the effective date of reinstatement, file the original of the certificate, and serve a copy on the corporation under Section 79-35-13.
   </p>
   <p>
    When the reinstatement is effective, it relates back to and takes effect as of the effective date of the administrative revocation. Any liability incurred by the foreign corporation or a director, officer or shareholder after the administrative revocation and before the reinstatement shall be determined as if the administrative revocation had never occurred, and the corporation resumes carrying on its business as if the administrative revocation had never occurred.

    Appeal from denial of reinstatement.

    Inspection of records by shareholders.
   </p>
   <p>
    Subject to Section 79-4-16.03(c), a shareholder of a corporation is entitled to inspect and copy, during regular business hours at the corporation’s principal office, any of the records of the corporation described in Section 79-4-16.01(e) if he gives the corporation a signed written notice of his demand at least five (5) business days before the date on which he wishes to inspect and copy.
   </p>
   <p>
    A shareholder of a corporation is entitled to inspect and copy, during regular business hours at a reasonable location specified by the corporation, any of the following records of the corporation if the shareholder meets the requirements of subsection (c) and gives the corporation a signed written notice of his demand at least five (5) business days before the date on which he wishes to inspect and copy:
   </p>
   <ol>
    <li id="t79c04a16saAol21">
     Excerpts from minutes of any meeting of the board of directors, records of any action of a committee of the board of directors while acting in place of the board of directors on behalf of the corporation, minutes of any meeting of the shareholders, and records of action taken by the shareholders or board of directors without a meeting, to the extent not subject to inspection under subsection (a) of this section;
    </li>
    <li id="t79c04a16saAol22">
     Accounting records of the corporation; and
    </li>
    <li id="t79c04a16saAol23">
     The record of shareholders.
    </li>
   </ol>
   <p>
    A shareholder may inspect and copy the records identified in subsection (b) only if:
   </p>
   <p>
    His demand is made in good faith and for a proper purpose;
   </p>
   <p>
    He describes with reasonable particularity his purpose and the records he desires to inspect; and
   </p>
   <p>
    The records are directly connected with his purpose.
   </p>
   <p>
    The right of inspection granted by this section may not be abolished or limited by a corporation’s articles of incorporation or bylaws.
   </p>
   <p>
    This section does not affect:
   </p>
   <p>
    The right of a shareholder to inspect records under Section 79-4-7.20 or, if the shareholder is in litigation with the corporation, to the same extent as any other litigant;
   </p>
   <p>
    The power of a court, independently of Section 79-4-1.01 et seq., to compel the production of corporate records for examination.
   </p>

   <p>
    The corporation may comply at its expense with a shareholder’s demand to inspect the record of shareholders under Section 79-4-16.02(b)(3) by providing the shareholder with a list of shareholders that was compiled no earlier than the date of the shareholder’s demand.

    Court-ordered inspection.
   </p>
   <p>
    If a corporation does not allow a shareholder who complies with Section 79-4-16.02(a) to inspect and copy any records required by that subsection to be available for inspection, the chancery court of the county where the corporation’s principal office is located, or the Chancery Court of the First Judicial District of Hinds County, Mississippi, if the corporation does not have a principal office in this state, may summarily order inspection and copying of the records demanded at the corporation’s expense upon application of the shareholder.
   </p>
   <p>
    If a corporation does not within a reasonable time allow a shareholder to inspect and copy any other record, the shareholder who complies with Section 79-4-16.02(b) and (c) may apply to the chancery court in the county where the corporation’s principal office is located, or the Chancery Court of the First Judicial District of Hinds County, Mississippi, if the corporation does not have a principal office in this state, for an order to permit inspection and copying of the records demanded. The court shall dispose of an application under this subsection on an expedited basis.
   </p>
   <p>
    If the court orders inspection and copying of the records demanded, it shall also order the corporation to pay the shareholder’s costs (including reasonable counsel fees) incurred to obtain the order unless the corporation proves that it refused inspection in good faith because it had a reasonable basis for doubt about the right of the shareholder to inspect the records demanded.
   </p>
   <p>
    If the court orders inspection and copying of the records demanded, it may impose reasonable restrictions on the use or distribution of the records by the demanding shareholder.

    Inspection of records by director.
   </p>
   <p>
    A director of a corporation is entitled to inspect and copy the books, records and documents of the corporation at any reasonable time to the extent reasonably related to the performance of the director’s duties as a director, including duties as a member of a committee, but not for any other purpose or in any manner that would violate any duty to the corporation.
   </p>
   <p>
    The chancery court of the county where the corporation’s principal office is located, or the Chancery Court of the First Judicial District of Hinds County, Mississippi, if the corporation does not have a principal office in this state, may order inspection and copying of the books, records and documents at the corporation’s expense, upon application of a director who has been refused such inspection rights, unless the corporation establishes that the director is not entitled to such inspection rights. The court shall dispose of an application under this subsection on an expedited basis.
   </p>
   <p>
    If an order is issued, the court may include provisions protecting the corporation from undue burden or expense, and prohibiting the director from using information obtained upon exercise of the inspection rights in a manner that would violate a duty to the corporation, and may also order the corporation to reimburse the director for the director’s costs (including reasonable counsel fees) incurred in connection with the application.

    Financial statements for shareholders.
   </p>
   <p>
    A corporation shall furnish its shareholders annual financial statements, which may be consolidated or combined statements of the corporation and one or more of its subsidiaries, as appropriate, that include a balance sheet as of the end of the fiscal year, an income statement for that year, and a statement of changes in shareholders’ equity for the year unless that information appears elsewhere in the financial statements. If financial statements are prepared for the corporation on the basis of generally accepted accounting principles, the annual financial statements must also be prepared on that basis.
   </p>
   <p>
    If the annual financial statements are reported upon by a public accountant, his report must accompany them. If not, the statements must be accompanied by a statement of the president or the person responsible for the corporation’s accounting records:
   </p>
   <ol>
    <li id="t79c04a16saBol11">
     Stating his reasonable belief whether the statements were prepared on the basis of generally accepted accounting principles and, if not, describing the basis of preparation; and
    </li>
    <li id="t79c04a16saBol12">
     Describing any respects in which the statements were not prepared on a basis of accounting consistent with the statements prepared for the preceding year.
    </li>
   </ol>
   <p>
    A corporation shall deliver the annual financial statements to each shareholder within one hundred twenty (120) days after the close of each fiscal year. Thereafter, on written request from a shareholder to whom the statements were not delivered, the corporation shall send the shareholder the latest financial statements. A public corporation may fulfill its responsibilities under this section by delivering the specified financial statements, or otherwise making them available, in any manner permitted by the applicable rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.

    If a professional corporation ceases to render professional services, it must amend its articles of incorporation to delete references to rendering professional services and to conform its corporate name to the requirements of Section 79-4-4.01, Mississippi Code of 1972. After the amendment becomes effective, the corporation may continue in existence as a business corporation under the Mississippi Business Corporation Act and it is no longer subject to this chapter.

     Every religious society, subject to the provisions of Sections 79-11-41 through 79-11-47, which is organized, commences or continues to operate in the State of Mississippi after July 1, 1994, and desires to avail itself of the benefits of Sections 79-11-41 through 79-11-47, may provide for the creation and establishment of an irrevocable perpetual religious society trust fund, the principal of which shall permanently remain intact except as hereinafter provided and only the income thereof shall be devoted to the perpetual care of the grounds and buildings of such religious society or which may be used to further the religious purposes of such religious society, and which principal shall be known as the perpetual care fund of such religious society. This fund shall be created and established from funds collected by or donated to the religious society.

The courts may waive the surety bond and control of investments in the case of trusts placed with an established bank or corporate trustee. Only the income from such fund shall be used for the care and maintenance or to further the religious purposes of the religious society for which it was established.

   </h3>
   <h3>
    “SECTION 6. Because the requirements of the Federal Tax Reform Act of 1969 require charitable nonprofit foundations, whether trusts or corporations, to change their governing instruments to comply with said federal act or the state to adopt legislation which complies in lieu of each trust or corporation changing its instrument and because failure to comply by the deadline set in said federal act will result in the loss of tax exemption by such trusts and corporations, the immediate effectiveness of this act is necessary to relieve nonprofit corporations and trusts of the concern about changing their governing instruments and retaining the tax exempt status for such Mississippi organizations; therefore, this act shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage.”

    It is the duty of state officials to act without unreasonable delays on applications either for charter amendments or for new charters, and if such action is unduly delayed or arbitrarily or discriminatorily made, the doors may be opened to federal jurisdiction.

    Where quo warranto proceedings were brought seeking forfeiture of a nonprofit corporation’s franchises and privileges on the ground that such corporation, which operated programs providing services for poor people in certain counties in Mississippi, and which had received a federal grant for a health care delivery program, had exceeded its corporate powers, and such proceedings were removed to federal court, allegations of the corporation that state officials had refused to act on proposed amendments to its charter that set forth the powers of the corporation to operate a health services program and on an application of the health center for a charter as a nonprofit, nonstock corporation, did not preclude remand of the case, but if the state court should fail to give relief on this issue and if the action by state officials should be unduly delayed or arbitrarily or discriminatorily named, the doors would then be open to federal jurisdiction.

    Code 1942, § 5310.1, as formerly enacted, which gave to the governor unlimited discretion to deny a charter to a non-profit corporation was unconstitutional for the reason that it conferred an absolute and arbitrary discretion in a state official to grant or deny a right or privilege.

    Conflict of interest transaction.
   </p>
   <ol>
    <li id="t79c11ol641">
     A conflict of interest transaction is a transaction with the corporation in which a director of the corporation has a direct or indirect interest. A conflict of interest transaction is not voidable by the corporation solely because of the director’s interest in the transaction if any one (1) of the following is true:
     <ol type="a">
      <li id="t79c11ol641a">
       The material facts of the transaction and the director’s interest were disclosed or known to the board of directors or a committee of the board of directors and the board of directors or committee authorized, approved or ratified the transaction;
      </li>
      <li id="t79c11ol641b">
       The material facts of the transaction and the director’s interest were disclosed or known to the members entitled to vote and they authorized, approved or ratified the transaction; or
      </li>
      <li id="t79c11ol641c">
       The transaction was fair to the corporation.
      </li>
     </ol>
    </li>
    <li id="t79c11ol641c2">
     For purposes of this section, a director of the corporation has an indirect interest in a transaction if (a) another entity in which he has a material financial interest or in which he is a general partner is a party to the transaction, or (b) another entity of which he is a director, officer or trustee is a party to the transaction and the transaction is or should be considered by the board of directors of the corporation.
    </li>
    <li id="t79c11ol641c3">
     For purposes of subsection (1)(a) of this section, a conflict of interest transaction is authorized, approved or ratified if it receives the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors on the board of directors (or on the committee) who have no direct or indirect interest in the transaction, but a transaction may not be authorized, approved or ratified under this section by a single director. If a majority of the directors who have no direct or indirect interest in the transaction vote to authorize, approve or ratify the transaction, a quorum is present for the purpose of taking action under this section. The presence of, or a vote cast by, a director with a direct or indirect interest in the transaction does not affect the validity of any action taken under subsection (1)(a) of this section if the transaction is otherwise authorized, approved or ratified as provided in that subsection.
    </li>
    <li id="t79c11ol641c4">
     For purposes of subsection (1)(b) of this section, a conflict of interest transaction is authorized, approved or ratified if it receives the vote of a majority of the members whose votes are entitled to be counted under this subsection. The vote of a member who is a director who has a direct or indirect interest in the transaction, and the vote of a member who is under the control of an entity described in subsection (2)(a) of this section, may not be counted in a vote of members to determine whether to authorize, approve or ratify a conflict of interest transaction under subsection (1)(b) of this section. The vote of those members, however, shall be counted in determining whether the transaction is approved under other sections of Section 79-11-101 et seq. A majority of the members, whether or not present, whose votes are entitled to be counted in a vote on the transaction under this subsection constitutes a quorum for the purpose of taking action under this section.

A director is considered to be serving an employee benefit plan at the corporation’s request if his duties to the corporation also impose duties on, or otherwise involve services by, him to the plan or to participants in or beneficiaries of the plan. “Director” includes, unless the context requires otherwise, the estate or personal representative of a director.

    Advice of counsel was not valid excuse for corporation’s denial of director’s request for indemnification after director was indicted for embezzlement for personal benefit; attorneys misread plain language of statute that called for director to be adjudged liable before indemnification could be denied, and corporation heeded attorneys’ advice at its own risk.

    Corporation’s motivation in denying director’s request for indemnification before his acquittal on charge of embezzlement for personal benefit presented question of fact precluding summary judgment on claim of bad faith breach of contractual duty to indemnify director, even though no judicial interpretation existed concerning statute on indemnification of director, and case allegedly presented matter of first impression.

    Court-ordered inspection where corporation does not allow member to inspect and copy records.

     If a corporation does not allow a member who complies with Section 79-11-285(1) to inspect and copy any records required by that subsection to be available for inspection, the chancery court in the county where the corporation’s principal office is located, or the Chancery Court of the First Judicial District of Hinds County, Mississippi, if the corporation does not have a principal office in this state, may summarily order inspection and copying of the records demanded at the corporation’s expense upon application of the member.
    </li>
    <li id="t79c11ol752">
     If a corporation does not within a reasonable time allow a member to inspect and copy any other record, the member who complies with Section 79-11-285(2) and (3) may apply to the chancery court in the county where the corporation’s principal office is located, or the Chancery Court of the First Judicial District of Hinds County, Mississippi, if the corporation does not have a principal office in this state, for an order to permit inspection and copying of the records demanded. The court shall dispose of an application under this subsection on an expedited basis.
    </li>
    <li id="t79c11ol753">
     If the court orders inspection and copying of the records demanded, it shall also order the corporation to pay the member’s costs (including reasonable attorney’s fees) incurred to obtain the order unless the corporation proves that it refused inspection in good faith because it had a reasonable basis for doubt about the right of the member to inspect the records demanded.
    </li>
    <li id="t79c11ol754">
     If the court orders inspection and copying of the records demanded, it may impose reasonable restrictions on the use or distribution of the records by the demanding member.

   <p>
    The assets of a corporation in the process of voluntary dissolution pursuant to Section 79-11-333 or Section 79-11-335 shall be applied and distributed as follows:
   </p>
   <p>
    All liabilities and obligations of the corporation shall be paid, satisfied and discharged; in case its property and assets are not sufficient to satisfy or discharge all the corporation’s liabilities and obligations, the corporation shall apply them so far as they will go to the just and equitable payment of the liabilities and obligations.
   </p>
   <p>
    Assets held by the corporation upon condition requiring return, transfer or conveyance, which condition occurs by reason of the dissolution, shall be returned, transferred or conveyed in accordance with such requirements.
   </p>
   <p>
    If the corporation to be dissolved is a charitable organization, as defined in Section 79-11-501, the remaining assets shall be transferred to another charitable organization or other charitable organizations, as defined in Section 79-11-501, either domestic or foreign, engaged in activities substantially similar to those of the dissolving corporation, or to the federal government, or to a state or local government, for a public purpose. For all other nonprofit corporations, assets received and held by the corporation subject to limitations permitting their use only for charitable, religious, eleemosynary, benevolent, educational or similar purposes, but not held upon a condition requiring return, transfer or conveyance by reason of the dissolution, shall be transferred or conveyed to one or more domestic or foreign corporations, societies or organizations engaged in activities substantially similar to those of the dissolving corporation.
   </p>
   <p>
    Other assets not described above, if any, shall be distributed in accordance with the provisions of the articles of incorporation or the bylaws to the extent that the articles of incorporation or bylaws determine the distributive right of members, or any class or classes of members, or provide for distribution to others.

   </p>
   <ol>
    <li id="t79c11ol1001">
     A court in a judicial proceeding brought to dissolve a corporation shall have the power to issue injunctions and may appoint one or more receivers to wind up and liquidate, or one or more custodians to manage, the affairs of the corporation. The court shall hold a hearing, after notifying all parties to the proceeding and any interested persons designated by the court, before appointing a receiver or custodian. The court appointing a receiver or custodian has exclusive jurisdiction over the corporation and all of its property wherever located.
    </li>
    <li id="t79c11ol1002">
     The court may appoint an individual or a domestic or foreign business or nonprofit corporation (authorized to transact business in this state) as a receiver or custodian. The court may require the receiver or custodian to post bond, with or without sureties, in an amount the court directs.
    </li>
    <li id="t79c11ol1003">
     The court shall describe the powers and duties of the receiver or custodian in its appointing order, which may be amended from time to time. Among other powers:
     <ol type="a">
      <li id="t79c11ol1003a">
       The receiver (i) may dispose of all or any part of the assets of the corporation wherever located, at a public or private sale, if authorized by the court; provided, however, that the receiver’s power to dispose of the assets of the corporation is subject to any trust and other restrictions that would be applicable to the corporation; and (ii) may sue and defend in the receiver’s or custodian’s name as receiver or custodian of the corporation in all courts of this state;
      </li>
      <li id="t79c11ol1003b">
       The custodian may exercise all of the powers of the corporation, through or in place of its board of directors or officers, to the extent necessary to manage the affairs of the corporation in the best interests of its members and creditors.
      </li>
     </ol>
    </li>
    <li id="t79c11ol1003b4">
     The court during a receivership may redesignate the receiver a custodian, and during a custodianship may redesignate the custodian a receiver, if doing so is in the best interests of the corporation, its members and creditors.
    </li>
    <li id="t79c11ol1003b5">
     The assets of the corporation or the proceeds resulting from a sale, conveyance or other disposition thereof shall be applied and distributed as the court may order, after taking into account the following standards:
     <ol type="a">
      <li id="t79c11ol1003b5a">
       All costs and expenses of the court proceedings and all liabilities and obligations of the corporation shall, to the extent that unencumbered assets are available therefor, be paid first toward the payment of costs and expenses of the court proceedings, and then toward other liabilities and obligations of the corporation.
      </li>
      <li id="t79c11ol1003b5b">
       All liabilities and obligations of the corporation shall be paid, satisfied and discharged; in case its property and assets are not sufficient to satisfy or discharge all the corporation’s liabilities and obligations, the court shall apply them so far as they will go to the just and equitable payment of the liabilities and obligations.
      </li>
      <li id="t79c11ol1003b5c">
       Assets held by the corporation upon condition requiring return, transfer or conveyance, which condition occurs by reason of the dissolution or liquidation, shall be returned, transferred or conveyed in accordance with such requirements.
      </li>
      <li id="t79c11ol1003b5d">
       If the corporation to be dissolved is a charitable organization, as defined in Section 79-11-501, the remaining assets shall be transferred to another charitable organization or other charitable organizations, as defined in Section 79-11-501, either domestic or foreign, engaged in activities substantially similar to those of the dissolving corporation, or to the federal government, or to a state or local government, for a public purpose. For all other nonprofit corporations, assets received and held by the corporation subject to limitations permitting their use only for charitable, religious, eleemosynary, benevolent, educational or similar purposes, but not held upon a condition requiring return, transfer or conveyance by reason of the dissolution, shall be transferred or conveyed to one or more domestic or foreign corporations, societies or organizations engaged in activities substantially similar to those of the dissolving corporation as the court may direct.
      </li>
      <li id="t79c11ol1003b5e">
       Other assets, if any, shall be distributed in accordance with the provisions of the articles of incorporation or the bylaws to the extent that the articles of incorporation or bylaws determine the distributive right of members, or any class or classes of members, or provide for distribution to others.
      </li>
      <li id="t79c11ol1003b5f">
       Any remaining assets may be distributed to such persons, societies, organizations or domestic or foreign corporations, whether for profit or not for profit, specified in the plan of distribution adopted as provided in this chapter, or where no plan of distribution has been adopted, as the court may direct.

    Definitions.
   </p>
   <p>
    The following words and phrases as used in Sections 79-11-501 through 79-11-529 shall have the meanings ascribed herein unless a different meaning is required by the context:
   </p>
   <p>
    (i) “Charitable organization” means either of the following:
   </p>
   <p>
    Any person determined by the Internal Revenue Service to be a tax exempt organization pursuant to Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code; or
   </p>
   <p>
    Any person actually or purporting to be established for any voluntary health and welfare, benevolent, philanthropic, patriotic, educational, humane, scientific, public health, environmental conservation, civic, or other eleemosynary purpose or for the benefit of law enforcement personnel, fire fighters, or other public safety organizations, or any person employing in any manner a charitable appeal as the basis of any solicitation or an appeal that suggests that there is a charitable purpose to any solicitation and includes each local, county or area division within this state of such charitable organization, provided such local, county or area division has authority and discretion to disburse funds or property otherwise than by transfer to any parent organization.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Charitable organization” is not limited to only those organizations to which contributions are tax deductible under Section 170 of the Internal Revenue Code.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Charitable organization” does not include any bona fide duly constituted religious institutions and such separate groups or corporations which form an integral part of religious institutions, provided that:
   </p>
   <p>
    Such religious institutions, groups or corporations are tax exempt pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code;
   </p>
   <p>
    No part of their net income inures to the direct benefit of any individual; and
   </p>
   <p>
    Their conduct is primarily supported by government grants or contracts, funds solicited from their own membership, congregations or previous donors, and fees charged for services rendered.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Charitable purpose” means either of the following:
   </p>
   <p>
    Any purpose described in Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code; or
   </p>
   <p>
    Any voluntary health and welfare, charitable, benevolent, philanthropic, patriotic, educational, humane, scientific, public health, environmental conservation, civic, or other eleemosynary purpose or for the benefit of law enforcement personnel, fire fighters, or other public safety organizations;
   </p>
   <p>
    “Charitable purpose” is not limited to only those purposes for which contributions are tax deductible under Section 170 of the Internal Revenue Code.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Container” means any box, carton, package, receptacle, canister, jar, dispenser, or machine that offers a product for sale or distribution which is or purports to be a solicitation of contributions for a charitable purpose.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Contribution” means the promise or grant of any money or property of any kind or value, including the promise to pay, except payments by members of an organization for membership fees, dues, fines, assessments or for services rendered to individual members, if membership in such organization confers a bona fide right, privilege, professional standing, honor or other direct benefit, other than the right to vote, elect officers or hold offices, and except money or property received from any governmental authority. Reference to the dollar amount of “contributions” in Sections 79-11-501 through 79-11-529 means in the case of promises to pay, or payments for merchandise or rights of any other description, the value of the total amount promised to be paid or paid for such merchandise or rights and not merely that portion of the purchase price to be applied to a charitable purpose.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Fund-raising counsel” means a person (i) who for a fixed fee or rate under a written agreement plans, manages, advises or consults with respect to the solicitation in this state of contributions by a charitable organization, (ii) who neither solicits contributions nor directly or indirectly employ, procure or engage any person compensated to solicit contributions, and (iii) who does not at any time, whether directly or indirectly, receive or have custody or control of contributions. A bona fide nontemporary salaried officer or employee of a charitable organization shall not be deemed to be a fund-raising counsel. No attorney, accountant or banker who renders professional services to a charitable organization or advises a person to make a charitable contribution during the course of rendering professional services to that person shall be deemed, as a result of the professional service or advice rendered, to be a fund-raising counsel.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Person” means any individual, organization, group, association, partnership, corporation, trust or any combination of them or any other entity however established within or without this state.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Professional fund-raiser” means any person who for compensation or other consideration is retained by a charitable organization to solicit in or from this state contributions for charitable purposes directly or in the form of payment for goods, services or admission to fund-raising events, whether such solicitation is performed personally or through his agents, servants or employees or through agents, servants or employees especially employed by or for a charitable organization who are engaged in the solicitation of contributions, the sale of goods or services or the production of fund-raising events under the direction of such person, or a person who plans, conducts, manages, carries on, advises or consults, whether directly or indirectly, in connection with the solicitation of contributions, sale of goods or services or the production of fund-raising events for or on behalf of any charitable organization, but does not qualify as a fund-raising counsel within the meaning of Sections 79-11-501 through 79-11-529, or who engages in the business of or holds himself out as independently engaged in the business of soliciting contributions for such purposes. A bona fide officer or employee of a charitable organization shall not be deemed a professional fund-raiser unless his salary or other compensation is paid as a commission which is computed on the basis of funds to be raised or actually raised.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Professional solicitor” means any person who is employed or retained for compensation by a professional fund-raiser to solicit contributions for charitable purposes from persons in this state.
   </p>
   <p>

   </p>
   <p>
    “Solicitation” or “solicit” means the request, directly or indirectly, for money, credit, property, financial assistance, or any other thing of value on the plea or representation that such money, credit, property, financial assistance, or any other thing of value or a portion of it will be used for a charitable purpose or will benefit a charitable organization. “Solicitation” or “solicit” includes, but is not limited to, the following methods of requesting or securing money, credit, property, financial assistance or any other thing of value:
   </p>
   <p>
    Any oral or written request.
   </p>
   <p>
    The making of any announcement in the press, over the radio or television, by telephone, through the mail or any other media concerning an appeal or campaign by or for any charitable organization or purpose.
   </p>
   <p>
    The distribution, circulation, posting or publishing of any handbill, written advertisement or other publication which directly or by implication seeks to obtain a contribution.
   </p>
   <p>
    The offer of, attempt to sell, or sale of any advertising space, book, card, tag, coupon, device, magazine, membership, merchandise, subscription, flower, ticket, candy, cookies or other tangible item in connection with which any appeal is made for any charitable organization or purpose, or where the name of any charitable organization is used or referred to in any appeal as an inducement or reason for making any sale, or where any statement is made that the whole or any part of the proceeds from the sale will be used for any charitable purpose or will benefit any charitable organization.
   </p>
   <p>
    The use or employment of container, canisters, cards, receptacles or similar devices for the collection of money or other thing of value in connection with which any appeal is made for any charitable organization or purpose.
   </p>
   <p>
    Any announcement requesting the public to attend an appeal, assemblage, athletic or competitive event, carnival, circus, concert, contest, dance, entertainment, exhibition, exposition, game, lecture, meal, party, show, social gathering or other performance or event of any kind.
   </p>
   <p>
    A solicitation shall take place whether or not the person making the solicitation receives any contribution, except that a charitable organization’s use of its own name in any communication shall not alone be sufficient to constitute a solicitation.

   <p>
    The failure of a charitable organization to comply with the notice requirements imposed under Section 79-11-655 or 79-11-657 does not prevent a charitable gift annuity that otherwise meets the requirements of 79-11-651 through 79-11-661 from constituting a qualified charitable gift annuity. The Secretary of State may enforce performance of the requirements of Sections 79-11-655 and 79-11-657 by sending a letter by certified mail, return receipt requested, demanding that the charitable organization comply with the requirements of Sections 79-11-655 and 79-11-657. The Secretary of State may fine the charitable organization in an amount not to exceed One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00) per qualified charitable gift annuity agreement issued until such time as the charitable organization complies with Sections 79-11-655 and 79-11-657.

    Statute of frauds did not bar claim by purported partners because the partners’ claims did not involve a dispute over a contract for the sale of lands, but a dispute over partnership profits and assets. An otherwise enforceable verbal partnership agreement did not constitute a contract for the sale of lands under the statute of frauds simply because the purpose of the partnership included the purchase of real estate.

    Knowledge and notice.
   </p>
   <p>
    A person knows a fact if the person has actual knowledge of it.
   </p>
   <p>
    A person has notice of a fact if the person:
   </p>
   <ol>
    <li id="t79c13a01ol21">
     Knows of it;
    </li>
    <li id="t79c13a01ol22">
     Has received a notification of it; or
    </li>
    <li id="t79c13a01ol23">
     Has reason to know it exists from all of the facts known to the person at the time in question.
    </li>
   </ol>
   <p>
    A person notifies or gives a notification to another by taking steps reasonably required to inform the other person in ordinary course, whether or not the other person learns of it.
   </p>
   <p>
    A person receives a notification when the notification:
   </p>
   <p>
    Comes to the person’s attention; or
   </p>
   <p>
    Is duly delivered at the person’s place of business or at any other place held out by the person as a place for receiving communications.
   </p>
   <p>
    Except as otherwise provided in subsection (f), a person other than an individual knows, has notice, or receives a notification of a fact for purposes of a particular transaction when the individual conducting the transaction knows, has notice, or receives a notification of the fact, or in any event when the fact would have been brought to the individual’s attention if the person had exercised reasonable diligence. The person exercises reasonable diligence if it maintains reasonable routines for communicating significant information to the individual conducting the transaction and there is reasonable compliance with the routines. Reasonable diligence does not require an individual acting for the person to communicate information unless the communication is part of the individual’s regular duties or the individual has reason to know of the transaction and that the transaction would be materially affected by the information.
   </p>
   <p>
    A partner’s knowledge, notice, or receipt of a notification of a fact relating to the partnership is effective immediately as knowledge by, notice to, or receipt of a notification by the partnership, except in the case of a fraud on the partnership committed by or with the consent of that partner.

   <p>
    A statement may be filed in the Office of the Secretary of State. A certified copy of a statement that is filed in an office in another state may be filed in the Office of the Secretary of State. Either filing has the effect provided in this chapter with respect to partnership property located in or transactions that occur in this state.

   <p>
    A certified copy of a statement that has been filed in the Office of the Secretary of State and recorded in the office for recording transfers of real property has the effect provided for recorded statements in this chapter. A recorded statement that is not a certified copy of a statement filed in the Office of the Secretary of State does not have the effect provided for recorded statements in this chapter.
   </p>
   <p>
    A statement filed by a partnership must be executed by at least two partners. Other statements must be executed by a partner or other person authorized by this chapter. An individual who executes a statement as, or on behalf of, a partner or other person named as a partner in a statement shall personally declare under penalty of perjury that the contents of the statement are accurate.
   </p>
   <p>
    A person authorized by this chapter to file a statement may amend or cancel the statement by filing an amendment or cancellation that names the partnership, identifies the statement, and states the substance of the amendment or cancellation.
   </p>
   <p>
    A person who files a statement pursuant to this section shall promptly send a copy of the statement to every nonfiling partner and to any other person named as a partner in the statement. Failure to send a copy of a statement to a partner or other person does not limit the effectiveness of the statement as to a person not a partner.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Secretary of State shall charge and collect fees in the amounts specified for the following purposes:
   </p>
   <p>
    Filing of Statement of Qualification or Statement of Foreign Qualification – Two Hundred Fifty Dollars ($250.00).

    Formation of partnership.
   </p>
   <p>
    Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b), the association of two or more persons to carry on as co-owners of a business for profit forms a partnership, whether or not the persons intend to form a partnership.

   <p>
    An association formed under a statute other than this chapter, a predecessor statute, or a comparable statute of another jurisdiction is not a partnership under this chapter.

   </p>
   <ol>
    <li id="t79c13a02ol11">
     Joint tenancy, tenancy in common, tenancy by the entireties, joint property, common property, or part ownership does not by itself establish a partnership, even if the co-owners share profits made by the use of the property.
    </li>
    <li id="t79c13a02ol12">
     The sharing of gross returns does not by itself establish a partnership, even if the persons sharing them have a joint or common right or interest in property from which the returns are derived.

     A person who receives a share of the profits of a business is presumed to be a partner in the business, unless the profits were received in payment:

   <ol>
    <li id="t79c13a03ol21">
     Subject to the effect of a statement of partnership authority under Section 79-13-303, partnership property held in the name of the partnership may be transferred by an instrument of transfer executed by a partner in the partnership name.

    <li id="t79c13a03ol22">
     Partnership property held in the name of one or more partners with an indication in the instrument transferring the property to them of their capacity as partners or of the existence of a partnership, but without an indication of the name of the partnership, may be transferred by an instrument of transfer executed by the persons in whose name the property is held.

     Partnership property held in the name of one or more persons other than the partnership, without an indication in the instrument transferring the property to them of their capacity as partners or of the existence of a partnership, may be transferred by an instrument of transfer executed by the persons in whose name the property is held.
    </li>
   </ol>
   <p>
    A partnership may recover partnership property from a transferee only if it proves that execution of the instrument of initial transfer did not bind the partnership under 79-13-301 and:
   </p>
   <p>
    As to a subsequent transferee who gave value for property transferred under subsection (a) (1) and (2), proves that the subsequent transferee knew or had received a notification that the person who executed the instrument of initial transfer lacked authority to bind the partnership; or
   </p>

    As to a transferee who gave value for property transferred under subsection (a)(3), proves that the transferee knew or had received a notification that the property was partnership property and that the person who executed the instrument of initial transfer lacked authority to bind the partnership.
   </p>
   <p>
    A partnership may not recover partnership property from a subsequent transferee if the partnership would not have been entitled to recover the property, under subsection (b), from any earlier transferee of the property.
   </p>
   <p>
    If a person holds all of the partners’ interests in the partnership, all of the partnership property vests in that person. The person may execute a document in the name of the partnership to evidence vesting of the property in that person and may file or record the document.

    Statement of partnership authority.
   </p>
   <p>
    A partnership may file a statement of partnership authority, which:
   </p>
   <ol>
    <li id="t79c13a03ol31">
     Must include:
    </li>
    <li id="t79c13a03ol32">
     May state the authority, or limitations on the authority, of some or all of the partners to enter into other transactions on behalf of the partnership and any other matter.
    </li>
   </ol>
   <p>
    The name of the partnership;
   </p>
   <p>
    The street address of its chief executive office and of one office in this state, if there is one;
   </p>
   <p>
    The names and mailing addresses of all of the partners or of an agent appointed and maintained by the partnership for the purpose of subsection (b); and
   </p>
   <p>
    The names of the partners authorized to execute an instrument transferring real property held in the name of the partnership; and
   </p>
   <p>
    If a statement of partnership authority names an agent, the agent shall maintain a list of the names and mailing addresses of all of the partners and make it available to any person on request for good cause shown.
   </p>
   <p>
    If a filed statement of partnership authority is executed pursuant to Section 79-13-105(c) and states the name of the partnership but does not contain all of the other information required by subsection (a), the statement nevertheless operates with respect to a person not a partner as provided in subsections (d) and (e).
   </p>
   <p>
    Except as otherwise provided in subsection (g), a filed statement of partnership authority supplements the authority of a partner to enter into transactions on behalf of the partnership as follows:
   </p>
   <p>
    Except for transfers of real property, a grant of authority contained in a filed statement of partnership authority is conclusive in favor of a person who gives value without knowledge to the contrary, so long as and to the extent that a limitation on that authority is not then contained in another filed statement. A filed cancellation of a limitation on authority revives the previous grant of authority.
   </p>
   <p>
    A grant of authority to transfer real property held in the name of the partnership contained in a certified copy of a filed statement of partnership authority recorded in the office for recording transfers of that real property is conclusive in favor of a person who gives value without knowledge to the contrary, so long as and to the extent that a certified copy of a filed statement containing a limitation on that authority is not then of record in the office for recording transfers of that real property. The recording in the office for recording transfers of that real property of a certified copy of a filed cancellation of a limitation on authority revives the previous grant of authority.
   </p>
   <p>
    A person not a partner is deemed to know of a limitation on the authority of a partner to transfer real property held in the name of the partnership if a certified copy of the filed statement containing the limitation on authority is of record in the office for recording transfers of that real property.
   </p>
   <p>
    Except as otherwise provided in subsections (d) and (e) and Sections 79-13-704 and 79-13-805, a person not a partner is not deemed to know of a limitation on the authority of a partner merely because the limitation is contained in a filed statement.
   </p>
   <p>
    Unless earlier canceled, a filed statement of partnership authority is canceled by operation of law five (5) years after the date on which the statement, or the most recent amendment, was filed with the Secretary of State.

    Partner’s liability.
   </p>
   <p>
    Except as otherwise provided in subsections (b) and (c), all partners are liable jointly and severally for all obligations of the partnership unless otherwise agreed by the claimant or provided by law.
   </p>
   <p>
    A person admitted as a partner into an existing partnership is not personally liable for any partnership obligation incurred before the person’s admission as a partner.
   </p>
   <p>
    An obligation of a partnership incurred while the partnership is a limited liability partnership, whether arising in contract, tort, or otherwise, is solely the obligation of the partnership. A partner is not personally liable, directly or indirectly, by way of contribution or otherwise, for such an obligation solely by reason of being or so acting as a partner. This subsection applies notwithstanding anything inconsistent in the partnership agreement that existed immediately before the vote required to become a limited liability partnership under Section 79-13-1001(b).

    Liability of purported partner.
   </p>
   <p>
    If a person, by words or conduct, purports to be a partner, or consents to being represented by another as a partner, in a partnership or with one or more persons not partners, the purported partner is liable to a person to whom the representation is made, if that person, relying on the representation, enters into a transaction with the actual or purported partnership. If the representation, either by the purported partner or by a person with the purported partner’s consent, is made in a public manner, the purported partner is liable to a person who relies upon the purported partnership even if the purported partner is not aware of being held out as a partner to the claimant. If partnership liability results, the purported partner is liable with respect to that liability as if the purported partner were a partner. If no partnership liability results, the purported partner is liable with respect to that liability jointly and severally with any other person consenting to the representation.
   </p>
   <p>
    If a person is thus represented to be a partner in an existing partnership, or with one or more persons not partners, the purported partner is an agent of persons consenting to the representation to bind them to the same extent and in the same manner as if the purported partner were a partner, with respect to persons who enter into transactions in reliance upon the representation. If all of the partners of the existing partnership consent to the representation, a partnership act or obligation results. If fewer than all of the partners of the existing partnership consent to the representation, the person acting and the partners consenting to the representation are jointly and severally liable.
   </p>
   <p>
    A person is not liable as a partner merely because the person is named by another in a statement of partnership authority.
   </p>
   <p>
    A person does not continue to be liable as a partner merely because of a failure to file a statement of dissociation or to amend a statement of partnership authority to indicate the partner’s dissociation from the partnership.
   </p>
   <p>
    Except as otherwise provided in subsections (a) and (b), persons who are not partners as to each other are not liable as partners to other persons.

    General standards of partner’s conduct.
   </p>
   <p>
    The only fiduciary duties a partner owes to the partnership and the other partners are the duty of loyalty and the duty of care set forth in subsections (b) and (c).
   </p>
   <p>
    A partner’s duty of loyalty to the partnership and the other partners is limited to the following:
   </p>
   <ol>
    <li id="t79c13a04ol31">
     To account to the partnership and hold as trustee for it any property, profit, or benefit derived by the partner in the conduct and winding up of the partnership business or derived from a use by the partner of partnership property, including the appropriation of a partnership opportunity;
    </li>
    <li id="t79c13a04ol32">
     To refrain from dealing with the partnership in the conduct or winding up of the partnership business as or on behalf of a party having an interest adverse to the partnership; and

    <li id="t79c13a04ol33">
     To refrain from competing with the partnership in the conduct of the partnership business before the dissolution of the partnership.
    </li>
   </ol>
   <p>
    A partner’s duty of care to the partnership and the other partners in the conduct and winding up of the partnership business is limited to refraining from engaging in grossly negligent or reckless conduct, intentional misconduct, or a knowing violation of law.
   </p>
   <p>
    A partner shall discharge the duties to the partnership and the other partners under this chapter or under the partnership agreement and exercise any rights consistently with the obligation of good faith and fair dealing.
   </p>
   <p>
    A partner does not violate a duty or obligation under this chapter or under the partnership agreement merely because the partner’s conduct furthers the partner’s own interest.
   </p>
   <p>
    A partner may lend money to and transact other business with the partnership, and as to each loan or transaction the rights and obligations of the partner are the same as those of a person who is not a partner, subject to other applicable law.
   </p>
   <p>
    This section applies to a person winding up the partnership business as the personal or legal representative of the last surviving partner as if the person were a partner.

    Transfer of partner’s transferable interest.
   </p>
   <p>
    A transfer, in whole or in part, of a partner’s transferable interest in the partnership:
   </p>
   <ol>
    <li id="t79c13a05ol11">
     Is permissible;
    </li>
    <li id="t79c13a05ol12">
     Does not by itself cause the partner’s dissociation or a dissolution and winding up of the partnership business; and
    </li>
    <li id="t79c13a05ol13">
     Does not, as against the other partners or the partnership, entitle the transferee, during the continuance of the partnership, to participate in the management or conduct of the partnership business, to require access to information concerning partnership transactions, or to inspect or copy the partnership books or records.
    </li>
   </ol>
   <p>
    A transferee of a partner’s transferable interest in the partnership has a right:
   </p>
   <p>
    To receive, in accordance with the transfer, distributions to which the transferor would otherwise be entitled;
   </p>
   <p>
    To receive upon the dissolution and winding up of the partnership business, in accordance with the transfer, the net amount otherwise distributable to the transferor; and
   </p>
   <p>
    To seek under Section 79-13-801(6) a judicial determination that it is equitable to wind up the partnership business.
   </p>
   <p>
    In a dissolution and winding up, a transferee is entitled to an account of partnership transactions only from the date of the latest account agreed to by all of the partners.
   </p>
   <p>
    Upon transfer, the transferor retains the rights and duties of a partner other than the interest in distributions transferred.
   </p>
   <p>
    A partnership need not give effect to a transferee’s rights under this section until it has notice of the transfer.
   </p>
   <p>
    A transfer of a partner’s transferable interest in the partnership in violation of a restriction on transfer contained in the partnership agreement is ineffective as to a person having notice of the restriction at the time of transfer.

    Partner’s transferable interest subject to charging order.
   </p>
   <p>
    On application by a judgment creditor of a partner or of a partner’s transferee, a court having jurisdiction may charge the transferable interest of the judgment debtor to satisfy the judgment. The court may appoint a receiver of the share of the distributions due or to become due to the judgment debtor in respect of the partnership and make all other orders, directions, accounts, and inquiries the judgment debtor might have made or which the circumstances of the case may require.
   </p>
   <p>
    A charging order constitutes a lien on the judgment debtor’s transferable interest in the partnership. The court may order a foreclosure of the interest subject to the charging order at any time. The purchaser at the foreclosure sale has the rights of a transferee.
   </p>
   <p>
    At any time before foreclosure, an interest charged may be redeemed:
   </p>
   <ol>
    <li id="t79c13a05ol21">
     By the judgment debtor;
    </li>
    <li id="t79c13a05ol22">

    </li>

     With partnership property, by one or more of the other partners with the consent of all of the partners whose interests are not so charged.
    </li>
   </ol>
   <p>
    This chapter does not deprive a partner of a right under exemption laws with respect to the partner’s interest in the partnership.
   </p>
   <p>
    This section provides the exclusive remedy by which a judgment creditor of a partner or partner’s transferee may satisfy a judgment out of the judgment debtor’s transferable interest in the partnership.

    Sections 75-9-406 and 75-9-408 do not apply to a partnership interest in a partnership formed under the laws of Mississippi, including the rights, powers and interests arising under a certificate of partnership or partnership agreement or under this chapter.To the extent of any conflict or inconsistency between this section and Sections 75-9-406 and 75-9-408, this section prevails.It is the express intent of this section to permit the enforcement, as a contract among the partners of a partnership, of any provision of a partnership agreement that would otherwise be ineffective under Sections 75-9-406 and 75-9-408.

   <p>
    A partner has the power to dissociate at any time, rightfully or wrongfully, by express will pursuant to Section 79-13-601(1).
   </p>
   <p>
    A partner’s dissociation is wrongful only if:

    Purchase of dissociated partner’s interest.
   </p>
   <p>
    If a partner is dissociated from a partnership without resulting in a dissolution and winding up of the partnership business under Section 79-13-801, the partnership shall cause the dissociated partner’s interest in the partnership to be purchased for a buyout price determined pursuant to subsection (b).
   </p>
   <p>
    The buyout price of a dissociated partner’s interest is the amount that would have been distributable to the dissociating partner under Section 79-13-807(b) if, on the date of dissociation, the assets of the partnership were sold at a price equal to the greater of the liquidation value or the value based on a sale of the entire business as a going concern without the dissociated partner and the partnership were wound up as of that date. Interest must be paid from the date of dissociation to the date of payment.
   </p>
   <p>
    Damages for wrongful dissociation under Section 79-13-602(b), and all other amounts owing, whether or not presently due, from the dissociated partner to the partnership, must be offset against the buyout price. Interest must be paid from the date the amount owed becomes due to the date of payment.
   </p>
   <p>
    A partnership shall indemnify a dissociated partner whose interest is being purchased against all partnership liabilities, whether incurred before or after the dissociation, except liabilities incurred by an act of the dissociated partner under Section 79-13-702.
   </p>
   <p>
    If no agreement for the purchase of a dissociated partner’s interest is reached within one hundred twenty (120) days after a written demand for payment, the partnership shall pay, or cause to be paid, in cash to the dissociated partner the amount the partnership estimates to be the buyout price and accrued interest, reduced by any offsets and accrued interest under subsection (c).
   </p>
   <p>
    If a deferred payment is authorized under subsection (h), the partnership may tender a written offer to pay the amount it estimates to be the buyout price and accrued interest, reduced by any offsets under subsection (c), stating the time of payment, the amount and type of security for payment, and the other terms and conditions of the obligation.
   </p>
   <p>
    The payment or tender required by subsection (e) or (f) must be accompanied by the following:
   </p>
   <ol>
    <li id="t79c13a07ol11">
     A statement of partnership assets and liabilities as of the date of dissociation;
    </li>
    <li id="t79c13a07ol12">
     The latest available partnership balance sheet and income statement, if any;
    </li>
    <li id="t79c13a07ol13">
     An explanation of how the estimated amount of the payment was calculated; and
    </li>
    <li id="t79c13a07ol14">
     Written notice that the payment is in full satisfaction of the obligation to purchase unless, within one hundred twenty (120) days after the written notice, the dissociated partner commences an action to determine the buyout price, any offsets under subsection (c), or other terms of the obligation to purchase.
    </li>
   </ol>
   <p>
    A partner who wrongfully dissociates before the expiration of a definite term or the completion of a particular undertaking is not entitled to payment of any portion of the buyout price until the expiration of the term or completion of the undertaking, unless the partner establishes to the satisfaction of the court that earlier payment will not cause undue hardship to the business of the partnership. A deferred payment must be adequately secured and bear interest.
   </p>
   <p>
    A dissociated partner may maintain an action against the partnership, pursuant to Section 79-13-405(b)(2) (ii), to determine the buyout price of that partner’s interest, any offsets under subsection (c), or other terms of the obligation to purchase. The action must be commenced within one hundred twenty (120) days after the partnership has tendered payment or an offer to pay or within one (1) year after written demand for payment if no payment or offer to pay is tendered. The court shall determine the buyout price of the dissociated partner’s interest, any offset due under subsection (c), and accrued interest, and enter judgment for any additional payment or refund. If deferred payment is authorized under subsection (h), the court shall also determine the security for payment and other terms of the obligation to purchase. The court may assess reasonable attorney’s fees and the fees and expenses of appraisers or other experts for a party to the action, in amounts the court finds equitable, against a party that the court finds acted arbitrarily, vexatiously, or not in good faith. The finding may be based on the partnership’s failure to tender payment or an offer to pay or to comply with subsection (g).

   </p>
   <p>
    For one (1) year after a partner dissociates without resulting in a dissolution and winding up of the partnership business, the partnership, including a surviving partnership under Article 9, is bound by an act of the dissociated partner which would have bound the partnership under Section 79-13-301 before dissociation only if at the time of entering into the transaction the other party:

   <p>
    A partner’s dissociation does not of itself discharge the partner’s liability for a partnership obligation incurred before dissociation. A dissociated partner is not liable for a partnership obligation incurred after dissociation, except as otherwise provided in subsection (b).
   </p>
   <p>
    A partner who dissociates without resulting in a dissolution and winding up of the partnership business is liable as a partner to the other party in a transaction entered into by the partnership, or a surviving partnership under Article 9, within one (1) year after the partner’s dissociation, only if the partner is liable for the obligation under Section 79-13-306 and at the time of entering into the transaction the other party:

    By agreement with the partnership creditor and the partners continuing the business, a dissociated partner may be released from liability for a partnership obligation.
   </p>
   <p>
    A dissociated partner is released from liability for a partnership obligation if a partnership creditor, with notice of the partner’s dissociation but without the partner’s consent, agrees to a material alteration in the nature or time of payment of a partnership obligation.

    A dissociated partner or the partnership may file a statement of dissociation stating the name of the partnership and that the partner is dissociated from the partnership.

   <p>
    A statement of dissociation is a limitation on the authority of a dissociated partner for the purposes of Section 79-13-303(d) and (e).

    Partnership continues after dissolution.
   </p>
   <p>
    Subject to subsection (b), a partnership continues after dissolution only for the purpose of winding up its business. The partnership is terminated when the winding up of its business is completed.
   </p>
   <p>
    At any time after the dissolution of a partnership and before the winding up of its business is completed, all of the partners, including any dissociating partner other than a wrongfully dissociating partner, may waive the right to have the partnership’s business wound up and the partnership terminated. In that event:
   </p>
   <ol>
    <li id="t79c13a08ol21">
     The partnership resumes carrying on its business as if dissolution had never occurred, and any liability incurred by the partnership or a partner after the dissolution and before the waiver is determined as if dissolution had never occurred; and

    Right to wind up partnership business.
   </p>
   <p>
    After dissolution, a partner who has not wrongfully dissociated may participate in winding up the partnership’s business, but on application of any partner, partner’s legal representative, or transferee, the chancery court of the county in which the partnership’s chief executive office is located, for good cause shown, may order judicial supervision of the winding up.
   </p>
   <p>
    The legal representative of the last surviving partner may wind up a partnership’s business.
   </p>
   <p>
    A person winding up a partnership’s business may preserve the partnership business or property as a going concern for a reasonable time, prosecute and defend actions and proceedings, whether civil, criminal, or administrative, settle and close the partnership’s business, dispose of and transfer the partnership’s property, discharge the partnership’s liabilities, distribute the assets of the partnership pursuant to Section 79-13-807, settle disputes by mediation or arbitration, and perform other necessary acts.

    Statement of dissolution.
   </p>
   <p>
    After dissolution, a partner who has not wrongfully dissociated may file a statement of dissolution stating the name of the partnership and that the partnership has dissolved and is winding up its business.
   </p>
   <p>
    A statement of dissolution cancels a filed statement of partnership authority for the purposes of Section 79-13-303(d) and is a limitation on authority for the purposes of Section 79-13-303(e).
   </p>
   <p>
    For the purposes of Sections 79-13-301 and 79-13-804, a person not a partner is deemed to have notice of the dissolution and the limitation on the partners’ authority as a result of the statement of dissolution thirty (30) days after it is filed.
   </p>
   <p>
    After filing and, if appropriate, recording a statement of dissolution, a dissolved partnership may file and, if appropriate, record a statement of partnership authority which will operate with respect to a person not a partner as provided in Section 79-13-303(d) and (e) in any transaction, whether or not the transaction is appropriate for winding up the partnership business.

    Partner’s liability to other partners after dissolution.
   </p>
   <p>
    Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b) and Section 79-13-306, after dissolution a partner is liable to the other partners for the partner’s share of any partnership liability incurred under Section 79-13-804.
   </p>
   <p>
    A partner who, with knowledge of the dissolution, incurs a partnership liability under Section 79-13-804(2) by an act that is not appropriate for winding up the partnership business is liable to the partnership for any damage caused to the partnership arising from the liability.

    Settlement of accounts and contributions among partners.
   </p>
   <p>
    In winding up a partnership’s business, the assets of the partnership, including the contributions of the partners required by this section, must be applied to discharge its obligations to creditors, including, to the extent permitted by law, partners who are creditors. Any surplus must be applied to pay in cash the net amount distributable to partners in accordance with their right to distributions under subsection (b).
   </p>
   <p>
    Each partner is entitled to a settlement of all partnership accounts upon winding up the partnership business. In settling accounts among the partners, profits and losses that result from the liquidation of the partnership assets must be credited and charged to the partners’ accounts. The partnership shall make a distribution to a partner in an amount equal to any excess of the credits over the charges in the partner’s account. A partner shall contribute to the partnership an amount equal to any excess of the charges over the credits in the partner’s account but excluding from the calculation charges attributable to an obligation for which the partner is not personally liable under Section 79-13-306.
   </p>
   <p>
    If a partner fails to contribute the full amount required under subsection (b), all of the other partners shall contribute, in the proportions in which those partners share partnership losses, the additional amount necessary to satisfy the partnership obligations for which they are personally liable under Section 79-13-306. A partner or partner’s legal representative may recover from the other partners any contributions the partner makes to the extent the amount contributed exceeds that partner’s share of the partnership obligations for which the partner is personally liable under Section 79-13-306.
   </p>
   <p>
    After the settlement of accounts, each partner shall contribute, in the proportion in which the partner shares partnership losses, the amount necessary to satisfy partnership obligations that were not known at the time of the settlement and for which the partner is personally liable under Section 79-13-306.
   </p>
   <p>
    The estate of a deceased partner is liable for the partner’s obligation to contribute to the partnership.
   </p>
   <p>
    An assignee for the benefit of creditors of a partnership or a partner, or a person appointed by a court to represent creditors of a partnership or a partner, may enforce a partner’s obligation to contribute to the partnership.

   <p>
    A partnership may become a limited liability partnership pursuant to this section.
   </p>
   <p>
    The terms and conditions on which a partnership becomes a limited liability partnership must be approved by the vote necessary to amend the partnership agreement except, in the case of a partnership agreement that expressly considers obligations to contribute to the partnership, the vote necessary to amend those provisions.
   </p>
   <p>
    After the approval required by subsection (b), a partnership may become a limited liability partnership by filing a statement of qualification. The statement must contain:
   </p>
   <ol>
    <li id="t79c13a10ol11">
     The name of the partnership;
    </li>
    <li id="t79c13a10ol12">

    </li>
    <li id="t79c13a10ol13">

     A statement that the partnership elects to be a limited liability partnership; and

     A deferred effective date, if any.
    </li>
   </ol>
   <p>
    [Reserved]
   </p>
   <p>
    The status of a partnership as a limited liability partnership is effective on the later of the filing of the statement or a date specified in the statement. The status remains effective, regardless of changes in the partnership, until it is canceled pursuant to Section 79-13-105(d).
   </p>
   <p>
    The status of a partnership as a limited liability partnership and the liability of its partners is not affected by errors or later changes in the information required to be contained in the statement of qualification under subsection (c).
   </p>
   <p>
    The filing of a statement of qualification establishes that a partnership has satisfied all conditions precedent to the qualification of the partnership as a limited liability partnership.
   </p>
   <p>
    An amendment or cancellation of a statement of qualification is effective when it is filed or on a deferred effective date specified in the amendment or cancellation.

   <p>
    If the Secretary of State determines that one or more grounds exist under Section 79-13-1003 for the administrative dissolution of a statement of qualification, the Secretary of State shall serve the limited liability partnership with written notice of his determination, except that such determination may be served by first-class mail.
   </p>
   <p>
    If the limited liability partnership does not correct each ground for dissolution or demonstrate to the reasonable satisfaction of the Secretary of State that each ground determined by the Secretary of State does not exist within sixty (60) days after service of the notice, the Secretary of State shall administratively dissolve the statement of qualification by signing a certification of the dissolution that recites the ground for dissolution and its effective date. The Secretary of State shall file the original of the certificate and serve the limited liability partnership with a copy of the certificate, except that such certificate may be served by first-class mail.

    A limited liability partnership whose statement of qualification has been administratively dissolved under Section 79-13-1004 may apply to the Secretary of State for reinstatement at any time after the effective date of dissolution. The application must:
   </p>
   <ol>
    <li id="t79c13a10ol31">
     Recite the name of the limited liability partnership and the effective date of its administrative dissolution;

     State that the ground or grounds for dissolution either did not exist or have been eliminated;

   <p>
    When the reinstatement is effective:

   <p>
    The reinstatement relates back to and takes effect as of the effective date of the administrative dissolution;

   <p>
    The limited liability partnership may appeal the denial of reinstatement to the Chancery Court of the First Judicial District of Hinds County or the chancery court of the county where the limited partnership is domiciled within thirty (30) days after service of the notice of denial is perfected. The limited liability partnership appeals by petitioning the court to set aside the dissolution and attaching to the petition copies of the Secretary of State’s certificate of dissolution, the limited liability partnership’s application for reinstatement, and the Secretary of State’s notice of denial.

   <p>
    The court may summarily order the Secretary of State to reinstate the dissolved limited liability partnership or may take other action the court considers appropriate.

    Law governing foreign limited liability partnership.
   </p>
   <p>
    The law under which a foreign limited liability partnership is formed governs relations among the partners and between the partners and the partnership and the liability of partners for obligations of the partnership.
   </p>
   <p>
    A foreign limited liability partnership may not be denied a statement of foreign qualification by reason of any difference between the law under which the partnership was formed and the law of this state.
   </p>
   <p>
    A statement of foreign qualification does not authorize a foreign limited liability partnership to engage in any business or exercise any power that a partnership may not engage in or exercise in this state as a limited liability partnership.
   </p>

    Statement of foreign qualification.
   </p>
   <p>
    Before transacting business in this state, a foreign limited liability partnership must file a statement of foreign qualification. The statement must contain:
   </p>
   <ol>
    <li id="t79c13a11ol11">
     The name of the foreign limited liability partnership which satisfies the requirements of the state or other jurisdiction under whose law it is formed and ends with “Registered Limited Liability Partnership,” “Limited Liability Partnership,” “R.L.L.P.,” “L.L.P.,” “RLLP” or “LLP”;
    </li>
    <li id="t79c13a11ol12">
     The street address of the partnership’s chief executive office;
    </li>
    <li id="t79c13a11ol13">
     The information required by Section 79-35-5(a); and
    </li>
    <li id="t79c13a11ol14">
     A deferred effective date, if any.
    </li>
   </ol>
   <p>
    [Reserved]
   </p>
   <p>
    The status of a partnership as a foreign limited liability partnership is effective on the later of the filing of the statement of foreign qualification or a date specified in the statement. The status remains effective, regardless of changes in the partnership, until it is canceled pursuant to Section 79-13-105(d).
   </p>
   <p>
    An amendment or cancellation of a statement of foreign qualification is effective when it is filed or on a deferred effective date specified in the amendment or cancellation.

    Effect of failure to qualify.
   </p>
   <p>
    A foreign limited liability partnership transacting business in this state may not maintain an action or proceeding in this state unless it has in effect a statement of foreign qualification.
   </p>
   <p>
    The failure of a foreign limited liability partnership to have in effect a statement of foreign qualification does not impair the validity of a contract or act of the foreign limited liability partnership or preclude it from defending an action or proceeding in this state.
   </p>
   <p>
    A limitation on personal liability of a partner is not waived solely by transacting business in this state without a statement of foreign qualification.
   </p>
   <p>
    If a foreign limited liability partnership transacts business in this state without a statement of foreign qualification, the Secretary of State is its agent for service of process with respect to a right of action arising out of the transaction of business in this state.

     The foreign limited partnership is without a registered agent in this state for sixty (60) days or more;

    The Secretary of State may not revoke a statement of foreign qualification of a foreign limited liability partnership unless the Secretary of State sends the foreign limited liability partnership notice of the revocation at least sixty (60) days before its effective date, by a record addressed to its registered agent, or to the foreign limited liability partnership if the foreign limited liability partnership fails to appoint and maintain a proper agent in this state. The notice must specify the cause for the revocation of the registration.

   </p>
   <p>
    If the Secretary of State determines that one or more grounds exist under Section 79-13-1106 for revocation of a statement of foreign qualification, he shall serve the foreign limited liability partnership with written notice of his determination, except that such determination may be served by first-class mail.

   <p>
    If the foreign limited liability partnership does not correct each ground for revocation or demonstrate to the reasonable satisfaction of the Secretary of State that each ground determined by the Secretary of State does not exist within sixty (60) days after service of the notice is perfected, the Secretary of State may revoke the foreign limited liability partnership’s statement of foreign qualification by signing a certificate of revocation that recites the ground or grounds for revocation and its effective date. The Secretary of State shall file the original of the certificate and serve a copy on the foreign limited liability partnership, except that such certificate may be served by first-class mail.

   <p>
    The authority of a foreign limited liability partnership to transact business in this state ceases on the date shown on the certificate revoking its registration.

    The Secretary of State’s revocation of a foreign limited liability partnership’s registration appoints the Secretary of State the foreign limited liability partnership’s agent for service of process in any proceeding based on a cause of action which arose during the time the foreign limited liability partnership was authorized to transact business in this state. Service of process on the Secretary of State under this subsection is service on the foreign limited liability partnership. Upon receipt of process, the Secretary of State shall mail a copy of the process to the foreign limited liability partnership at its principal office shown in its most recent communication received from the foreign limited liability partnership stating the current mailing address of its principal office, or, if none are on file, in its application for a registration.

    A foreign limited liability partnership whose statement of foreign qualification is administratively revoked under Section 79-13-1107 may apply to the Secretary of State for reinstatementat any time after the effective date of such revocation. The application must:
   </p>
   <ol>
    <li id="t79c13a11ol41">
     Recite the name of the limited liability partnership and the effective date of the administrative revocation;

     State that the ground or grounds for revocation either did not exist or have been eliminated;

   <p>
    If the Secretary of State denies a foreign limited liability partnership’s application for reinstatement of the statement of foreign qualification following administrative revocation, he shall serve the limited liability partnership with a written communication that explains the reason or reasons for denial.

    The limited liability partnership may appeal the denial of reinstatement to the Chancery Court of the First Judicial District of Hinds County or the chancery court of the county where the limited liability partnership is domiciled within thirty (30) days after service of the communication of denial is perfected. The limited liability partnership appeals by petitioning the court to set aside the revocation and attaching to the petition copies of the Secretary of State’s communication of denial.

    The court may summarily order the Secretary of State to reinstate the registration of the limited liability partnership or may take other action the court considers appropriate.

   </p>
   <p>
    The partnership agreement may:
   </p>
   <p>
    Specify the method by which a specific act or transaction that would otherwise violate the duty of loyalty may be authorized or ratified by one or more disinterested and independent persons after full disclosure of all material facts; and
   </p>
   <p>
    Alter the prohibition in Section 79-14-504(a)(2) so that the prohibition requires only that the partnership’s total assets not be less than the sum of its total liabilities.
   </p>
   <p>
    If not manifestly unreasonable, the partnership agreement may:
   </p>
   <p>

   </p>
   <p>

   <p>
    Alter or eliminate any other fiduciary duty.
   </p>
   <p>
    The court shall decide as a matter of law whether a term of a partnership agreement is manifestly unreasonable under subsection (c)(7) or (d)(2). The court:
   </p>
   <p>
    Shall make its determination as of the time the challenged term became part of the partnership agreement and by considering only circumstances existing at that time; and
   </p>
   <p>
    May invalidate the term only if, in light of the purposes, activities, and affairs of the limited partnership, it is readily apparent that:
   </p>
   <p>
    The objective of the term is unreasonable; or
   </p>
   <p>
    The term is an unreasonable means to achieve its objective.

    Partnership agreement; effect on third parties and relationship to records effective on behalf of limited partnership.
   </p>
   <p>
    A partnership agreement may specify that its amendment requires the approval of a person that is not a party to the agreement or the satisfaction of a condition. An amendment is ineffective if its adoption does not include the required approval or satisfy the specified condition.
   </p>
   <p>
    The obligations of a limited partnership and its partners to a person in the person’s capacity as a transferee or person dissociated as a partner are governed by the partnership agreement. Subject only to a court order issued under Section 79-14-703(b)(2) to effectuate a charging order, an amendment to the partnership agreement made after a person becomes a transferee or is dissociated as a partner:
   </p>
   <ol>
    <li id="t79c14a01ol51">
     Is effective with regard to any debt, obligation, or other liability of the partnership or its partners to the person in the person’s capacity as a transferee or person dissociated as a partner; and
    </li>
    <li id="t79c14a01ol52">
     Is not effective to the extent the amendment imposes a new debt, obligation, or other liability on the transferee or person dissociated as a partner.
    </li>
   </ol>
   <p>
    If a record delivered by a limited partnership to the Secretary of State for filing becomes effective and contains a provision that would be ineffective under Section 79-14-105(c) or (d)(2) if contained in the partnership agreement, the provision is ineffective in the record.
   </p>
   <p>
    Subject to subsection (c), if a record delivered by a limited partnership to the Secretary of State for filing becomes effective and conflicts with a provision of the partnership agreement:
   </p>
   <p>
    The agreement prevails as to partners, persons dissociated as partners, and transferees; and
   </p>
   <p>
    The record prevails as to other persons to the extent they reasonably rely on the record.

    Formation of limited partnership; certificate of limited partnership.
   </p>
   <p>
    To form a limited partnership, a person must deliver a certificate of limited partnership to the Secretary of State for filing.
   </p>
   <p>
    A certificate of limited partnership must state:
   </p>
   <ol>
    <li id="t79c14a02ol11">
     The name of the limited partnership, which must comply with Section 79-14-114;
    </li>
    <li id="t79c14a02ol12">
     The information required by Section 79-35-5;
    </li>
    <li id="t79c14a02ol13">
     The street and mailing addresses of the limited partnership’s principal office;
    </li>
    <li id="t79c14a02ol14">
     The street and mailing addresses of each general partner; and
    </li>
    <li id="t79c14a02ol15">
     Whether the limited partnership is a limited liability limited partnership.
    </li>
   </ol>
   <p>
    A certificate of limited partnership may contain statements as to matters other than those required by subsection (b), but may not vary or otherwise affect the provisions specified in Section 79-14-105(c) and (d) in a manner inconsistent with that section.
   </p>
   <p>
    A limited partnership is formed when:
   </p>
   <p>
    The certificate of limited partnership becomes effective:
   </p>
   <p>
    At least two (2) persons have become partners;
   </p>
   <p>
    At least one (1) person has become a general partner; and
   </p>
   <p>
    At least one (1) person has become a limited partner.
   </p>
   <p>
    Subject to subsection (b) of this section, if any provision of a partnership agreement is inconsistent with the filed certificate of limited partnership, or with a filed statement of dissociation, termination, or change, or with filed articles of merger, or with a statement of conversion or domestication filed under the Mississippi Entity Conversion and Domestication Act:
   </p>
   <p>
    The partnership agreement shall prevail as to partners and transferees; and
   </p>
   <p>
    The filed document prevails as to persons, other than partners and transferees, that reasonably rely on the filed record to their detriment.

    Amendment or restatement of certificate of limited partnership.
   </p>
   <p>
    A certificate of limited partnership may be amended or restated at any time.
   </p>
   <p>
    To amend its certificate of limited partnership, a limited partnership must deliver to the Secretary of State for filing an amendment stating:
   </p>
   <ol>
    <li id="t79c14a02ol21">

    <li id="t79c14a02ol23">
     The amendment.
    </li>
   </ol>
   <p>
    To restate its certificate of limited partnership, a limited partnership must deliver to the Secretary of State for filing a restatement, designated as such in its heading.
   </p>
   <p>
    A limited partnership shall promptly deliver to the Secretary of State for filing an amendment to a certificate of limited partnership to reflect:
   </p>
   <p>
    The admission of a new general partner;
   </p>
   <p>
    The dissociation of a person as a general partner; or
   </p>
   <p>
    The appointment of a person to wind up the limited partnership’s activities and affairs under Section 79-14-802(c) or (d).
   </p>
   <p>
    If a general partner knows that any information in a filed certificate of limited partnership was inaccurate when the certificate was filed or has become inaccurate due to changed circumstances, the general partner shall promptly:
   </p>
   <p>
    Cause the certificate to be amended; or
   </p>
   <p>
    If appropriate, deliver to the Secretary of State for filing a statement of change under Section 79-35-8 or a statement of correction under Section 79-14-209.
   </p>
   <p>
    A certificate of limited partnership may also be amended by filing articles of merger under Article 11 or a statement of conversion, or domestication under the Mississippi Entity Conversion and Domestication Act.

   <p>
    When the Secretary of State files a record, the Secretary of State shall record it as filed on the date and at the time of its delivery. After filing a record, the Secretary of State shall deliver to the person that submitted the record a copy of the record with an acknowledgment of the date and time of filing.

The record and the explanation of the Secretary of State of the refusal to file must be attached to the petition. The court may decide the matter in a summary proceeding.

    Upon formation of a limited partnership, a person becomes a limited partner as agreed among the persons that are to be the initial partners.
   </p>
   <p>
    After formation, a person becomes a limited partner:
   </p>
   <ol>
    <li id="t79c14a03ol11">
     As provided in the partnership agreement;
    </li>
    <li id="t79c14a03ol12">

    A person may become a limited partner without:
   </p>
   <p>
    Acquiring a transferable interest; or
   </p>
   <p>
    Making or being obligated to make a contribution to the limited partnership.

    No liability as limited partner for limited partnership obligations.
   </p>
   <p>
    A debt, obligation, or other liability of a limited partnership is not the debt, obligation, or other liability of a limited partner. A limited partner is not personally liable, directly or indirectly, by way of contribution or otherwise, for a debt, obligation, or other liability of the partnership solely by reason of being or acting as a limited partner, even if the limited partner participates in the management and control of the limited partnership. This subsection applies regardless of the dissolution of the partnership.
   </p>
   <p>
    The failure of a limited partnership to observe formalities relating to the exercise of its powers or management of its activities and affairs is not a ground for imposing liability on a limited partner for a debt, obligation, or other liability of the partnership.

    Rights to information of limited partner and person dissociated as limited partner.
   </p>
   <p>
    On ten (10) days’ demand, made in a record received by the limited partnership, a limited partner may inspect and copy required information during regular business hours in the limited partnership’s principal office. The limited partner need not have any particular purpose for seeking the information.
   </p>
   <p>
    During regular business hours and at a reasonable location specified by the limited partnership, a limited partner may inspect and copy information regarding the activities, affairs, financial condition, and other circumstances of the limited partnership as is just and reasonable if:
   </p>
   <ol>
    <li id="t79c14a03ol21">
     The limited partner seeks the information for a purpose reasonably related to the partner’s interest as a limited partner;
    </li>
    <li id="t79c14a03ol22">
     The limited partner makes a demand in a record received by the limited partnership, describing with reasonable particularity the information sought and the purpose for seeking the information; and
    </li>
    <li id="t79c14a03ol23">
     The information sought is directly connected to the limited partner’s purpose.
    </li>
   </ol>
   <p>
    Not later than ten (10) days after receiving a demand pursuant to subsection (b), the limited partnership shall inform in a record the limited partner that made the demand of:
   </p>
   <p>
    What information the partnership will provide in response to the demand and when and where the partnership will provide the information; and
   </p>
   <p>
    The partnership’s reasons for declining, if the partnership declines to provide any demanded information.
   </p>
   <p>
    Whenever this chapter or a partnership agreement provides for a limited partner to vote on or give or withhold consent to a matter, before the vote is cast or consent is given or withheld, the limited partnership shall, without demand, provide the limited partner with all information that is known to the partnership and is material to the limited partner’s decision.
   </p>
   <p>
    Subject to subsection (j), on ten (10) days’ demand made in a record received by a limited partnership, a person dissociated as a limited partner may have access to information to which the person was entitled while a limited partner if:
   </p>
   <p>
    The information pertains to the period during which the person was a limited partner;
   </p>
   <p>
    The person seeks the information in good faith; and
   </p>
   <p>
    The person satisfies the requirements imposed on a limited partner by subsection (b).
   </p>
   <p>
    A limited partnership shall respond to a demand made pursuant to subsection (e) in the manner provided in subsection (c).
   </p>
   <p>
    A limited partnership may charge a person that makes a demand under this section reasonable costs of copying, limited to the costs of labor and material.
   </p>
   <p>
    A limited partner or person dissociated as a limited partner may exercise the rights under this section through an agent or, in the case of an individual under legal disability, a legal representative. Any restriction or condition imposed by the partnership agreement or under subsection (j) applies both to the agent or legal representative and to the limited partner or person dissociated as a limited partner.
   </p>
   <p>
    Subject to Section 79-14-704, the rights under this section do not extend to a person as transferee.
   </p>
   <p>
    In addition to any restriction or condition stated in its partnership agreement, a limited partnership, as a matter within the ordinary course of its activities and affairs, may impose reasonable restrictions and conditions on access to and use of information to be furnished under this section, including designating information confidential and imposing nondisclosure and safeguarding obligations on the recipient. In a dispute concerning the reasonableness of a restriction under this subsection, the partnership has the burden of proving reasonableness.

    Person erroneously believing self to be limited partner.
   </p>
   <p>
    Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b), a person that makes an investment in a business enterprise and erroneously but in good faith believes that the person has become a limited partner in the enterprise is not liable for the enterprise’s obligations by reason of making the investment, receiving distributions from the enterprise, or exercising any rights of or appropriate to a limited partner, if, on ascertaining the mistake, the person:
   </p>
   <ol>
    <li id="t79c14a03ol31">
     Causes an appropriate certificate of limited partnership, amendment, or statement of correction to be signed and delivered to the Secretary of State for filing; or
    </li>
    <li id="t79c14a03ol32">
     Withdraws from future participation as an owner in the enterprise by signing and delivering to the Secretary of State for filing a statement of negation under this section.
    </li>
   </ol>
   <p>
    A person that makes an investment described in subsection (a) is liable to the same extent as a general partner to any third party that enters into a transaction with the enterprise, believing in good faith that the person is a general partner, before the Secretary of State files a statement of negation, certificate of limited partnership, amendment, or statement of correction to show that the person is not a general partner.
   </p>
   <p>
    If a person makes a diligent effort in good faith to comply with subsection (a)(1) and is unable to cause the appropriate certificate of limited partnership, amendment, or statement of correction to be signed and delivered to the Secretary of State for filing, the person has the right to withdraw from the enterprise pursuant to subsection (a)(2) even if the withdrawal would otherwise breach an agreement with others that are or have agreed to become co-owners of the enterprise.

    After formation of a limited partnership, a person becomes a general partner:

   <ol>

     As provided in the partnership agreement;
    </li>

    General partner agent of limited partnership.
   </p>
   <p>
    Each general partner is an agent of the limited partnership for the purposes of its activities and affairs. An act of a general partner, including the signing of a record in the partnership’s name, for apparently carrying on in the ordinary course the partnership’s activities and affairs or activities and affairs of the kind carried on by the partnership binds the partnership, unless the general partner did not have authority to act for the partnership in the particular matter and the person with which the general partner was dealing knew or had notice that the general partner lacked authority.
   </p>
   <p>
    An act of a general partner which is not apparently for carrying on in the ordinary course the limited partnership’s activities and affairs or activities and affairs of the kind carried on by the partnership binds the partnership only if the act was actually authorized by all the other partners.

    Limited partnership liable for general partner’s actionable conduct.
   </p>
   <p>
    A limited partnership is liable for loss or injury caused to a person, or for a penalty incurred, as a result of a wrongful act or omission, or other actionable conduct, of a general partner acting in the ordinary course of activities and affairs of the partnership or with the actual or apparent authority of the partnership.
   </p>

    If, in the course of a limited partnership’s activities and affairs or while acting with actual or apparent authority of the partnership, a general partner receives or causes the partnership to receive money or property of a person not a partner, and the money or property is misapplied by a general partner, the partnership is liable for the loss.

    General partner’s liability.
   </p>
   <p>
    Except as otherwise provided in subsections (b) and (c), all general partners are liable jointly and severally for all debts, obligations, and other liabilities of the limited partnership unless otherwise agreed by the claimant or provided by law.
   </p>
   <p>
    A person that becomes a general partner is not personally liable for a debt, obligation, or other liability of the limited partnership incurred before the person became a general partner.
   </p>
   <p>
    A debt, obligation, or other liability of a limited partnership incurred while the partnership is a limited liability limited partnership is solely the debt, obligation, or other liability of the limited liability limited partnership. A general partner is not personally liable, directly or indirectly, by way of contribution or otherwise, for a debt, obligation, or other liability of the limited liability limited partnership solely by reason of being or acting as a general partner. This subsection applies:
   </p>
   <ol>
    <li id="t79c14a04ol21">
     Despite anything inconsistent in the partnership agreement that existed immediately before the vote or consent required to become a limited liability limited partnership under Section 79-14-406(b)(2); and
    </li>
    <li id="t79c14a04ol22">
     Regardless of the dissolution of the partnership.
    </li>
   </ol>
   <p>
    The failure of a limited liability limited partnership to observe formalities relating to the exercise of its powers or management of its activities and affairs is not a ground for imposing liability on a general partner for a debt, obligation, or other liability of the partnership.
   </p>
   <p>
    An amendment of a certificate of limited partnership which deletes a statement that the limited partnership is a limited liability limited partnership does not affect the limitation in this section on the liability of a general partner for a debt, obligation, or other liability of the limited partnership incurred before the amendment became effective.

    Actions by and against partnership and partners.
   </p>
   <p>
    To the extent not inconsistent with Section 79-14-404, a general partner may be joined in an action against the limited partnership or named in a separate action.
   </p>
   <p>
    A judgment against a limited partnership is not by itself a judgment against a general partner. A judgment against a partnership may not be satisfied from a general partner’s assets unless there is also a judgment against the general partner.
   </p>
   <p>
    A judgment creditor of a general partner may not levy execution against the assets of the general partner to satisfy a judgment based on a claim against the limited partnership, unless the partner is personally liable for the claim under Section 79-14-404 and:
   </p>
   <ol>
    <li id="t79c14a04ol31">
     A judgment based on the same claim has been obtained against the limited partnership and a writ of execution on the judgment has been returned unsatisfied in whole or in part;

     A court grants permission to the judgment creditor to levy execution against the assets of a general partner based on a finding that partnership assets subject to execution are clearly insufficient to satisfy the judgment, that exhaustion of assets is excessively burdensome, or that the grant of permission is an appropriate exercise of the court’s equitable powers; or

    Each general partner has equal rights in the management and conduct of the limited partnership’s activities and affairs.

    Rights to information of general partner and person dissociated as general partner.
   </p>
   <p>
    A general partner may inspect and copy required information during regular business hours in the limited partnership’s principal office, without having any particular purpose for seeking the information.
   </p>
   <p>
    On reasonable notice, a general partner may inspect and copy during regular business hours, at a reasonable location specified by the limited partnership, any record maintained by the partnership regarding the partnership’s activities, affairs, financial condition, and other circumstances, to the extent the information is material to the general partner’s rights and duties under the partnership agreement or this chapter.
   </p>
   <p>
    A limited partnership shall furnish to each general partner:
   </p>
   <ol>
    <li id="t79c14a04ol51">
     Without demand, any information concerning the partnership’s activities, affairs, financial condition, and other circumstances which the partnership knows and is material to the proper exercise of the general partner’s rights and duties under the partnership agreement or this chapter, except to the extent the partnership can establish that it reasonably believes the general partner already knows the information; and
    </li>
    <li id="t79c14a04ol52">
     On demand, any other information concerning the partnership’s activities, affairs, financial condition, and other circumstances, except to the extent the demand or the information demanded is unreasonable or otherwise improper under the circumstances.
    </li>
    <li id="t79c14a04ol53">
     The person satisfies the requirements imposed on a limited partner by Section 79-14-304(b).
    </li>
   </ol>
   <p>
    The duty to furnish information under subsection (c) also applies to each general partner to the extent the general partner knows any of the information described in subsection (b).
   </p>
   <p>
    Subject to subsection (j), on ten (10) days’ demand made in a record received by a limited partnership, a person dissociated as a general partner may have access to the information and records described in subsections (a) and (b) at the locations specified in those subsections if:
   </p>
   <p>
    The information or record pertains to the period during which the person was a general partner;
   </p>
   <p>
    The person seeks the information or record in good faith; and
   </p>
   <p>
    A limited partnership shall respond to a demand made pursuant to subsection (e) in the manner provided in Section 79-14-304(c).
   </p>
   <p>
    A limited partnership may charge a person that makes a demand under this section the reasonable costs of copying, limited to the costs of labor and material.
   </p>
   <p>
    A general partner or person dissociated as a general partner may exercise the rights under this section through an agent or, in the case of an individual under legal disability, a legal representative. Any restriction or condition imposed by the partnership agreement or under subsection (j) applies both to the agent or legal representative and to the general partner or person dissociated as a general partner.
   </p>
   <p>
    The rights under this section do not extend to a person as transferee, but if:
   </p>
   <p>
    A general partner dies, Section 79-14-704 applies; and
   </p>
   <p>
    An individual dissociates as a general partner under Section 79-14-603(6)(B) or (C), the legal representative of the individual may exercise the rights under subsection (c) of a person dissociated as a general partner.
   </p>
   <p>
    In addition to any restriction or condition stated in its partnership agreement, a limited partnership, as a matter within the ordinary course of its activities and affairs, may impose reasonable restrictions and conditions on access to and use of information to be furnished under this section, including designating information confidential and imposing nondisclosure and safeguarding obligations on the recipient. In a dispute concerning the reasonableness of a restriction under this subsection, the partnership has the burden of proving reasonableness.

    A limited partnership shall reimburse a general partner for any payment made by the general partner in the course of the general partner’s activities on behalf of the partnership, if the general partner complied with Sections 79-14-406, 79-14-409, and 79-14-504 in making the payment.

   <p>
    A limited partnership shall indemnify and hold harmless a person with respect to any claim or demand against the person and any debt, obligation, or other liability incurred by the person by reason of the person’s former or present capacity as a general partner, if the claim, demand, debt, obligation, or other liability does not arise from the person’s breach of Section 79-14-406, 79-14-409, or 79-14-504.
   </p>
   <p>
    In the ordinary course of its activities and affairs, a limited partnership may advance reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees and costs, incurred by a person in connection with a claim or demand against the person by reason of the person’s former or present capacity as a general partner, if the person promises to repay the partnership if the person ultimately is determined not to be entitled to be indemnified under subsection (b).
   </p>
   <p>
    A limited partnership may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of a general partner against liability asserted against or incurred by the general partner in that capacity or arising from that status even if, under Section 79-14-105(c)(8), the partnership agreement could not eliminate or limit the person’s liability to the partnership for the conduct giving rise to the liability.

    Standards of conduct for general partners.
   </p>
   <p>
    A general partner owes to the limited partnership and, subject to Section 79-14-901, the other partners the duties of loyalty and care stated in subsections (b) and (c).
   </p>
   <p>
    The fiduciary duty of loyalty of a general partner includes the duties:
   </p>
   <ol>
    <li id="t79c14a04ol61">
     To account to the limited partnership and hold as trustee for it any property, profit, or benefit derived by the general partner:
    </li>
    <li id="t79c14a04ol62">
     To refrain from dealing with the partnership in the conduct or winding up of the partnership’s activities and affairs as or on behalf of a person having an interest adverse to the partnership; and
    </li>
    <li id="t79c14a04ol63">
     To refrain from competing with the partnership in the conduct or winding up of the partnership’s activities and affairs.
    </li>
   </ol>
   <p>
    In the conduct or winding up of the partnership’s activities and affairs;
   </p>
   <p>
    From a use by the general partner of the partnership’s property; or
   </p>
   <p>
    From the appropriation of a partnership opportunity;
   </p>
   <p>
    The duty of care of a general partner in the conduct or winding up of the limited partnership’s activities and affairs is to refrain from engaging in grossly negligent or reckless conduct, willful or intentional misconduct, or knowing violation of law.
   </p>
   <p>
    A general partner shall discharge the duties and obligations under this chapter or under the partnership agreement and exercise any rights consistently with the contractual obligation of good faith and fair dealing.
   </p>
   <p>
    A general partner does not violate a duty or obligation under this chapter or under the partnership agreement solely because the general partner’s conduct furthers the general partner’s own interest.
   </p>
   <p>
    All the partners of a limited partnership may authorize or ratify, after full disclosure of all material facts, a specific act or transaction by a general partner that otherwise would violate the duty of loyalty.
   </p>
   <p>
    It is a defense to a claim under subsection (b)(2) and any comparable claim in equity or at common law that the transaction was fair to the limited partnership.
   </p>
   <p>
    If, as permitted by subsection (f) or the partnership agreement, a general partner enters into a transaction with the limited partnership which otherwise would be prohibited by subsection (b)(2), the general partner’s rights and obligations arising from the transaction are the same as those of a person that is not a general partner.

    Liability for contribution.
   </p>
   <p>
    A person’s obligation to make a contribution to a limited partnership is not excused by the person’s death, disability, termination, or other inability to perform personally.
   </p>
   <p>
    If a person does not fulfill an obligation to make a contribution other than money, the person is obligated at the option of the limited partnership to contribute money equal to the value, as stated in the required information, of the part of the contribution which has not been made.
   </p>
   <p>
    The obligation of a person to make a contribution may be compromised only by the affirmative vote or consent of all the partners. If a creditor of a limited partnership extends credit or otherwise acts in reliance on an obligation described in subsection (a) without knowledge or notice of a compromise under this subsection, the creditor may enforce the obligation.

    Sharing of and right to distributions before dissolution.
   </p>
   <p>
    Any distribution made by a limited partnership before its dissolution and winding up must be shared among the partners on the basis of the value, as stated in the required information when the limited partnership decides to make the distribution, of the contributions the limited partnership has received from each partner, except to the extent necessary to comply with a transfer effective under Section 79-14-702 or charging order in effect under Section 79-14-703.
   </p>
   <p>
    A person has a right to a distribution before the dissolution and winding up of a limited partnership only if the partnership decides to make an interim distribution. A person’s dissociation does not entitle the person to a distribution.
   </p>
   <p>
    A person does not have a right to demand or receive a distribution from a limited partnership in any form other than money. Except as otherwise provided in Section 79-14-810(f), a partnership may distribute an asset in kind only if each part of the asset is fungible with each other part and each person receives a percentage of the asset equal in value to the person’s share of distributions.
   </p>
   <p>
    If a partner or transferee becomes entitled to receive a distribution, the partner or transferee has the status of, and is entitled to all remedies available to, a creditor of the limited partnership with respect to the distribution. However, the partnership’s obligation to make a distribution is subject to offset for any amount owed to the partnership by the partner or a person dissociated as a partner on whose account the distribution is made.

    Limitations on distributions.
   </p>
   <p>
    A limited partnership may not make a distribution, including a distribution under Section 79-14-810, if after the distribution:
   </p>
   <ol>
    <li id="t79c14a05ol11">
     The partnership would not be able to pay its debts as they become due in the ordinary course of the partnership’s activities and affairs; or
    </li>
    <li id="t79c14a05ol12">
     The partnership’s total assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities plus the amount that would be needed, if the partnership were to be dissolved and wound up at the time of the distribution, to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution and winding up of partners and transferees whose preferential rights are superior to the rights of persons receiving the distribution.
    </li>
    <li id="t79c14a05ol13">
     In all other cases, as of the date:
    </li>
   </ol>
   <p>
    A limited partnership may base a determination that a distribution is not prohibited under subsection (a) on:
   </p>
   <p>
    Financial statements prepared on the basis of accounting practices and principles that are reasonable in the circumstances; or
   </p>
   <p>
    A fair valuation or other method that is reasonable under the circumstances.
   </p>
   <p>
    Except as otherwise provided in subsection (e), the effect of a distribution under subsection (a) is measured:
   </p>
   <p>
    In the case of a distribution as defined in Section 79-14-102(4)(A), as of the earlier of:
   </p>
   <p>
    The date money or other property is transferred or debt is incurred by the limited partnership; or
   </p>
   <p>
    The date the person entitled to the distribution ceases to own the interest or right being acquired by the partnership in return for the distribution;
   </p>
   <p>
    In the case of any other distribution of indebtedness, as of the date the indebtedness is distributed; and
   </p>
   <p>
    The distribution is authorized, if the payment occurs not later than one hundred twenty (120) days after that date; or
   </p>
   <p>
    The payment is made, if the payment occurs more than one hundred twenty (120) days after the distribution is authorized.
   </p>
   <p>
    A limited partnership’s indebtedness to a partner or transferee incurred by reason of a distribution made in accordance with this section is at parity with the partnership’s indebtedness to its general, unsecured creditors, except to the extent subordinated by agreement.
   </p>
   <p>
    A limited partnership’s indebtedness, including indebtedness issued as a distribution, is not a liability for purposes of subsection (a) if the terms of the indebtedness provide that payment of principal and interest is made only if and to the extent that payment of a distribution could then be made under this section. If the indebtedness is issued as a distribution, each payment of principal or interest is treated as a distribution, the effect of which is measured on the date the payment is made.
   </p>
   <p>
    In measuring the effect of a distribution under Section 79-14-810, the liabilities of a dissolved limited partnership do not include any claim that has been disposed of under Section 79-14-806, 79-14-807, or 79-14-808.

    If a general partner consents to a distribution made in violation of Section 79-14-504 and in consenting to the distribution fails to comply with Section 79-14-409, the general partner is personally liable to the limited partnership for the amount of the distribution which exceeds the amount that could have been distributed without the violation of Section 79-14-504.

    A person that receives a distribution knowing that the distribution violated Section 79-14-504 is personally liable to the limited partnership but only to the extent that the distribution received by the person exceeded the amount that could have been properly paid under Section 79-14-504.

   <p>
    A person’s dissociation as a general partner does not of itself discharge the person’s liability as a general partner for a debt, obligation, or other liability of the limited partnership incurred before dissociation. Except as otherwise provided in subsections (b) and (c), the person is not liable for a partnership obligation incurred after dissociation.

    A person whose dissociation as a general partner results in a dissolution and winding up of the limited partnership’s activities and affairs is liable on an obligation incurred by the partnership under Section 79-14-805 to the same extent as a general partner under Section 79-14-404.
   </p>
   <p>
    A person that is dissociated as a general partner without the dissociation resulting in a dissolution and winding up of the limited partnership’s activities and affairs is liable on a transaction entered into by the partnership after the dissociation only if:
   </p>
   <ol>
    <li id="t79c14a06ol71">

    The other party does not have knowledge or notice of the dissociation and reasonably believes that the person is a general partner.

   <p>
    By agreement with a creditor of a limited partnership and the partnership, a person dissociated as a general partner may be released from liability for a debt, obligation, or other liability of the partnership.
   </p>
   <p>
    A person dissociated as a general partner is released from liability for a debt, obligation, or other liability of the limited partnership if the partnership’s creditor, with knowledge or notice of the person’s dissociation as a general partner but without the person’s consent, agrees to a material alteration in the nature or time of payment of the debt, obligation, or other liability.

    Transfer of transferable interest.

   <p>
    A transfer, in whole or in part, of a transferable interest:
   </p>
   <ol>
    <li id="t79c14a07ol11">
     Is permissible;
    </li>
    <li id="t79c14a07ol12">
     Does not by itself cause a partner’s dissociation or a dissolution and winding up of the limited partnership’s activities and affairs; and
    </li>
    <li id="t79c14a07ol13">
     Subject to Section 79-14-704, does not entitle the transferee to:
    </li>
   </ol>
   <p>
    Participate in the management or conduct of the partnership’s activities and affairs; or
   </p>
   <p>
    Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c), have access to required information, records, or other information concerning the partnership’s activities and affairs.
   </p>
   <p>
    A transferee has the right to receive, in accordance with the transfer, distributions to which the transferor would otherwise be entitled.
   </p>
   <p>
    In a dissolution and winding up of a limited partnership, a transferee is entitled to an account of the partnership’s transactions only from the date of dissolution.
   </p>
   <p>
    A transferable interest may be evidenced by a certificate of the interest issued by a limited partnership in a record, and, subject to this section, the interest represented by the certificate may be transferred by a transfer of the certificate.
   </p>
   <p>
    A limited partnership need not give effect to a transferee’s rights under this section until the partnership knows or has notice of the transfer.
   </p>
   <p>
    A transfer of a transferable interest in violation of a restriction on transfer contained in the partnership agreement is ineffective if the intended transferee has knowledge or notice of the restriction at the time of transfer.
   </p>
   <p>
    Except as otherwise provided in Sections 79-14-601(b)(4)(B) and 79-14-603(4)(B), if a general or limited partner transfers a transferable interest, the transferor retains the rights of a general or limited partner other than the transferable interest transferred and retains all the duties and obligations of a general or limited partner.
   </p>
   <p>
    If a general or limited partner transfers a transferable interest to a person that becomes a general or limited partner with respect to the transferred interest, the transferee is liable for the transferor’s obligations under Sections 79-14-502 and 79-14-505 known to the transferee when the transferee becomes a partner.

    Charging order.
   </p>
   <p>
    On application by a judgment creditor of a partner or transferee, a court may enter a charging order against the transferable interest of the judgment debtor for the unsatisfied amount of the judgment. A charging order constitutes a lien on a judgment debtor’s transferable interest and requires the limited partnership to pay over to the person to which the charging order was issued any distribution that otherwise would be paid to the judgment debtor.
   </p>
   <p>
    To the extent necessary to effectuate the collection of distributions pursuant to a charging order in effect under subsection (a), the court may:
   </p>
   <ol>
    <li id="t79c14a07ol21">
     Appoint a receiver of the distributions subject to the charging order, with the power to make all inquiries the judgment debtor might have made; and
    </li>
    <li id="t79c14a07ol22">
     Make all other orders necessary to give effect to the charging order.
    </li>
   </ol>
   <p>
    Upon a showing that distributions under a charging order will not pay the judgment debt within a reasonable time, the court may foreclose the lien and order the sale of the transferable interest. The purchaser at the foreclosure sale obtains only the transferable interest, does not thereby become a partner, and is subject to Section 79-14-702.
   </p>
   <p>
    At any time before foreclosure under subsection (c), the partner or transferee whose transferable interest is subject to a charging order under subsection (a) may extinguish the charging order by satisfying the judgment and filing a certified copy of the satisfaction with the court that issued the charging order.
   </p>
   <p>
    At any time before foreclosure under subsection (c), a limited partnership or one or more partners whose transferable interests are not subject to the charging order may pay to the judgment creditor the full amount due under the judgment and thereby succeed to the rights of the judgment creditor, including the charging order.
   </p>
   <p>
    This chapter does not deprive any partner or transferee of the benefit of any exemption law applicable to the transferable interest of the partner or transferee.
   </p>
   <p>
    This section provides the exclusive remedy by which a person seeking, in the capacity of a judgment creditor, to enforce a judgment against a partner or transferee may satisfy the judgment from the judgment debtor’s transferable interest.

    Winding up.
   </p>
   <p>
    A dissolved limited partnership shall wind up its activities and affairs and, except as otherwise provided in Section 79-14-803, the partnership continues after dissolution only for the purpose of winding up.
   </p>
   <p>
    In winding up its activities and affairs, the limited partnership:
   </p>
   <ol>
    <li id="t79c14a08ol21">
     Shall discharge the partnership’s debts, obligations, and other liabilities, settle and close the partnership’s activities and affairs, and marshal and distribute the assets of the partnership;
    </li>
    <li id="t79c14a08ol22">
     Shall file a statement of dissolution of the limited partnership with the Secretary of State; and

    Preserve the partnership activities, affairs, and property as a going concern for a reasonable time;
   </p>
   <p>
    Prosecute and defend actions and proceedings, whether civil, criminal, or administrative;
   </p>
   <p>
    Transfer the partnership’s property;
   </p>
   <p>
    Settle disputes by mediation or arbitration; and
   </p>
   <p>
    Perform other acts necessary or appropriate to the winding up.
   </p>
   <p>
    If a dissolved limited partnership does not have a general partner, a person to wind up the dissolved partnership’s activities and affairs may be appointed by the affirmative vote or consent of limited partners owning a majority of the rights to receive distributions as limited partners at the time the vote or consent is to be effective. A person appointed under this subsection:
   </p>
   <p>
    Has the powers of a general partner under Section 79-14-804 but is not liable for the debts, obligations, and other liabilities of the partnership solely by reason of having or exercising those powers or otherwise acting to wind up the dissolved partnership’s activities and affairs; and
   </p>
   <p>
    Shall deliver promptly to the Secretary of State for filing an amendment to the partnership’s certificate of limited partnership stating:
   </p>
   <p>
    That the partnership does not have a general partner;
   </p>
   <p>
    The name and street and mailing addresses of the person; and
   </p>
   <p>
    That the person has been appointed pursuant to this subsection to wind up the partnership.
   </p>
   <p>
    On the application of a partner, the chancery court may order judicial supervision of the winding up of a dissolved limited partnership, including the appointment of a person to wind up the partnership’s activities and affairs, if:
   </p>
   <p>
    The partnership does not have a general partner and within a reasonable time following the dissolution no person has been appointed pursuant to subsection (c); or
   </p>

    The applicant establishes other good cause.

   <p>
    The amendment has become effective, delivery to the Secretary of State for filing of an amendment to the certificate of limited partnership within one hundred twenty (120) days of the effective date of the dissolution stating that dissolution has been rescinded under this section.

    Court proceedings.
   </p>
   <p>
    A dissolved limited partnership that has published a notice under Section 79-14-807 may file an application with the chancery court in the county where the limited partnership’s principal office is located or, if the principal office is not located in this state, in the Chancery Court of the First Judicial District of Hinds County, Mississippi, for a determination of the amount and form of security to be provided for payment of claims that are contingent, have not been made known to the limited partnership, or are based on an event occurring after the date of dissolution but which, based on the facts known to the limited partnership, are reasonably expected to arise after the date of dissolution. Security is not required for any claim that is or is reasonably anticipated to be barred under Section 79-14-807.
   </p>
   <p>
    Not later than ten (10) days after the filing of an application under subsection (a), the dissolved limited partnership shall give notice of the proceeding to each claimant holding a contingent claim known to the partnership.
   </p>
   <p>
    In a proceeding brought under this section, the court may appoint a guardian ad litem to represent all claimants whose identities are unknown. The reasonable fees and expenses of the guardian, including all reasonable expert witness fees, must be paid by the dissolved limited partnership.
   </p>
   <p>
    A dissolved limited partnership that provides security in the amount and form ordered by the court under subsection (a) satisfies the dissolved limited partnership’s obligations with respect to claims that are contingent, have not been made known to the partnership, or are based on an event occurring after the date of dissolution, and such claims may not be enforced against a partner or transferee on account of assets received in liquidation.

    Disposition of assets in winding up; when contributions required.
   </p>
   <p>
    In winding up its activities and affairs, a limited partnership shall apply its assets, including the contributions required by this section, to discharge the partnership’s obligations to creditors, including partners that are creditors.
   </p>
   <p>
    After a limited partnership complies with subsection (a), any surplus must be distributed in the following order, subject to any charging order in effect under Section 79-14-703:
   </p>
   <ol>
    <li id="t79c14a08ol81">
     To each person owning a transferable interest that reflects contributions made and not previously returned, an amount equal to the value of the unreturned contributions; and
    </li>
    <li id="t79c14a08ol82">
     Among persons owning transferable interests in proportion to their respective rights to share in distributions immediately before the dissolution of the partnership.
    </li>
    <li id="t79c14a08ol83">
     If a person does not make the additional contribution required by paragraph (2), further additional contributions are determined and due in the same manner as provided in that paragraph.
    </li>
   </ol>
   <p>
    If a limited partnership’s assets are insufficient to satisfy all of its obligations under subsection (a), with respect to each unsatisfied obligation incurred when the partnership was not a limited liability limited partnership, the following rules apply:
   </p>
   <p>
    Each person that was a general partner when the obligation was incurred and that has not been released from the obligation under Section 79-14-607 shall contribute to the partnership for the purpose of enabling the partnership to satisfy the obligation. The contribution due from each of those persons is in proportion to the right to receive distributions in the capacity of a general partner in effect for each of those persons when the obligation was incurred.
   </p>
   <p>
    If a person does not contribute the full amount required under paragraph (1) with respect to an unsatisfied obligation of the partnership, the other persons required to contribute by paragraph (1) on account of the obligation shall contribute the additional amount necessary to discharge the obligation. The additional contribution due from each of those other persons is in proportion to the right to receive distributions in the capacity of a general partner in effect for each of those other persons when the obligation was incurred.
   </p>
   <p>
    A person that makes an additional contribution under subsection (c)(2) or (3) may recover from any person whose failure to contribute under subsection (c)(1) or (2) necessitated the additional contribution. A person may not recover under this subsection more than the amount additionally contributed. A person’s liability under this subsection may not exceed the amount the person failed to contribute.
   </p>
   <p>
    If a limited partnership does not have sufficient surplus to comply with subsection (b)(1), any surplus must be distributed among the owners of transferable interests in proportion to the value of the respective unreturned contributions.
   </p>
   <p>
    All distributions made under subsections (b) and (c) must be paid in money.

    <li id="t79c14a08ol91">

    If a limited partnership, not later than sixty (60) days after service of the notice under subsection (b), does not cure or demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Secretary of State the nonexistence of each ground determined by the Secretary of State, the Secretary of State shall administratively dissolve the partnership by signing a statement of administrative dissolution that recites the grounds for dissolution and the effective date of dissolution. The Secretary of State shall file the statement and serve a copy on the partnership pursuant to Section 79-35-13, except that the statement of administrative dissolution may be served by first-class mail.

    A limited partnership that is administratively dissolved continues in existence as an entity but may not carry on any activities except as necessary to wind up its activities and affairs and liquidate its assets under Sections 79-14-802, 79-14-806, 79-14-807, 79-14-808, and 79-14-810, or to apply for reinstatement under Section 79-14-812.

    Reinstatement.
   </p>
   <p>
    A limited partnership that is administratively dissolved under Section 79-14-811 may apply to the Secretary of State for reinstatement not later than two (2) years after the effective date of dissolution. The application must state:
   </p>
   <ol>
    <li id="t79c14a08ol101">
     The name of the partnership at the time of its administrative dissolution and, if needed, a different name that satisfies Section 79-14-114;

     The effective date of the partnership’s administrative dissolution; and
    </li>
    <li id="t79c14a08ol104">
     That the grounds for dissolution did not exist or have been cured.
    </li>
   </ol>
   <p>
    To be reinstated, a limited partnership must pay all fees, taxes, interest, and penalties that were due to the Mississippi Department of Revenue at the time of the partnership’s administrative dissolution and all fees, taxes, interest, and penalties that would have been due to the Mississippi Department of Revenue while the partnership was administratively dissolved.
   </p>
   <p>
    If the Secretary of State determines that an application under subsection (a) contains the required information, is satisfied that the information is correct, and determines that all payments required to be made to the Mississippi Department of Revenue by subsection (b) have been made, the Secretary of State shall:
   </p>
   <p>
    Cancel the statement of administrative dissolution and prepare a statement of reinstatement that states the Secretary of State’s determination and the effective date of reinstatement; and
   </p>
   <p>
    File the statement of reinstatement and serve a copy on the limited partnership.
   </p>
   <p>
    When reinstatement under this section is effective, the following rules apply:
   </p>
   <p>
    The reinstatement relates back to and takes effect as of the effective date of the administrative dissolution.
   </p>
   <p>
    The limited partnership resumes carrying on its activities and affairs as if the administrative dissolution had not occurred.
   </p>
   <p>
    The rights of a person arising out of an act or omission in reliance on the dissolution before the person knew or had notice of the reinstatement are not affected.

    Subject to subsection (b), a partner may maintain a direct action against another partner or the limited partnership, with or without an accounting as to the partnership’s activities and affairs, to enforce the partner’s rights and otherwise protect the partner’s interests, including rights and interests under the partnership agreement or this chapter or arising independently of the partnership relationship.

    Special litigation committee.
   </p>
   <p>
    If a limited partnership is named as or made a party in a derivative proceeding, the partnership may appoint a special litigation committee to investigate the claims asserted in the proceeding and determine whether pursuing the action is in the best interests of the partnership. If the partnership appoints a special litigation committee, on motion by the committee made in the name of the partnership, except for good cause shown, the court shall stay discovery for the time reasonably necessary to permit the committee to make its investigation. This subsection does not prevent the court from:
   </p>
   <ol>
    <li id="t79c14a09ol41">
     Enforcing a person’s right to information under Section 79-14-304 or 79-14-407; or
    </li>
    <li id="t79c14a09ol42">
     Granting extraordinary relief in the form of a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction.
    </li>
    <li id="t79c14a09ol43">
     Be settled on terms approved by the committee; or
    </li>
    <li id="t79c14a09ol44">
     Be dismissed.
    </li>
   </ol>
   <p>
    A special litigation committee must be composed of one or more disinterested and independent individuals, who may be partners.
   </p>
   <p>
    A special litigation committee may be appointed:
   </p>
   <p>
    By a majority of the general partners not named as parties in the proceeding; or
   </p>
   <p>
    If all general partners are named as parties in the proceeding, by a majority of the general partners named as defendants.
   </p>
   <p>
    After appropriate investigation, a special litigation committee may determine that it is in the best interests of the limited partnership that the proceeding:
   </p>
   <p>
    Continue under the control of the plaintiff;
   </p>
   <p>
    Continue under the control of the committee;
   </p>
   <p>
    After making a determination under subsection (d), a special litigation committee shall file with the court a statement of its determination and its report supporting its determination and shall serve each party with a copy of the determination and report. The court shall determine whether the members of the committee were disinterested and independent and whether the committee conducted its investigation and made its recommendation in good faith, independently, and with reasonable care, with the committee having the burden of proof. If the court finds that the members of the committee were disinterested and independent and that the committee acted in good faith, independently, and with reasonable care, the court shall enforce the determination of the committee. Otherwise, the court shall dissolve the stay of discovery entered under subsection (a) and allow the action to continue under the control of the plaintiff.

    Registration to do business in this state.
   </p>
   <p>
    A foreign limited partnership may not do business in this state until it registers with the Secretary of State under this article.
   </p>
   <p>
    A foreign limited partnership doing business in this state may not maintain an action or proceeding in this state unless it is registered to do business in this state.
   </p>
   <p>
    The failure of a foreign limited partnership to register to do business in this state does not impair the validity of a contract or act of the partnership or preclude it from defending an action or proceeding in this state.
   </p>
   <p>
    A limitation on the liability of a general partner or limited partner of a foreign limited partnership is not waived solely because the partnership does business in this state without registering to do business in this state.
   </p>
   <p>
    Section 79-14-1001(a) and (b) applies even if the foreign limited partnership fails to register under this article.

An investment trust organized in conformity with and by specific reference to this chapter is declared to be neither a general nor a limited partnership, even though the declaration of trust may contain provisions not expressly or by implication contained in this chapter, and even though one (1) or more of the trustees may be or become the holder of a certificate of beneficial interest in the investment trust of which he is trustee.

     The trustees shall hold the legal title to all property at any time belonging to the investment trust, and shall have complete control over the management, operation, disposition, investment and reinvestment of such property and complete control of the management of the business affairs of the investment trust. The trustees may, if so provided in the declaration of trust, elect one of their number as chairman and elect such other officers as may be provided in the declaration of trust. The trustees may designate one or more of their number to act for and on behalf of the trustees in the execution of deeds, notes and other written instruments.
    </li>
    <li id="t79c15ol32">
     The trustees shall have such powers as to the investment and management of the trust estate as may be set out in the declaration of trust, without regard to the type of investments to which trustees generally are restricted by the provisions of Section 91-13-1, Mississippi Code of 1972, as now or hereafter amended, or by any other statute or rule of law or equity. Unless the declaration of trust shall so provide, it shall not be necessary for an investment trust or the trustees thereof to file an accounting with any court, except upon liquidation of the trust. Provided, however, that nothing in this chapter shall impair the power of any court of competent jurisdiction, upon a proper showing of cause, to compel an accounting by the trustees of an investment trust of all funds held by them in such capacity.

     Liability to third persons for any act, omission, or obligation of an investment trust or of a trustee of an investment trust, when acting in such capacity, shall extend to the whole of the trust estate or to so much thereof as may be necessary to discharge such liability, but no trustee shall be personally or individually liable to third persons for any such act, omission, or obligation, unless such trustee with respect to such act, omission, or obligation engaged in intentional fraud or other unlawful conduct prohibited by statute.

    Certificates of beneficial interest.
   </p>
   <ol>
    <li id="t79c15ol41">
     The beneficial ownership of an investment trust shall be evidenced by certificates issued by the trustees in units of value to be provided by the trust instrument. No investment trust shall issue certificates of beneficial interest except for money, labor done, or services rendered or property actually received for the use and lawful purposes of the investment trust. Any investment trust may purchase any property authorized by its declaration of trust, or necessary for the use and lawful purposes of such investment trust, and may issue certificates of beneficial interest to the amount of the value thereof in payment therefor. Any certificate of beneficial interest issued in compliance with this section shall be fully paid, and the holder thereof shall not be liable to any further call or for any further payment. No assessment shall be made against the interest of any holder of such fully paid certificates. In the absence of fraud in the transaction, the judgment of the trustees as to the value of labor done or services performed or property purchased shall be conclusive. For the purpose of determining whether certificates of beneficial interest of any investment trust are fully paid and not liable to any further call, no deduction shall be made in computing the amount of consideration received by such investment trust for such certificates of beneficial interest, for such reasonable compensation or discount in the sale, underwriting, or purchase of such certificates by underwriters or dealers or others performing similar services as may be paid or allowed by the investment trust; and for such purpose the judgment of the trustees as the value of such services shall be conclusive in the absence of fraud in the transaction.

     The certificates of beneficial interest issued pursuant to this section shall be transferable in the same manner as stock certificates of a business corporation are transferable, and the issuance and transfer of such certificates of beneficial interest shall be governed by the statutes applicable to the issuance and transfer of stock of business corporations to the extent that such statutes are not inconsistent with the provisions and purposes of this chapter.

    No holder of a fully paid certificate of beneficial interest in an investment trust shall be personally or individually liable in any manner whatever for any debts, acts, omissions, or obligations incurred by the trustees or by the investment trust. It is expressly declared to be the intention of this chapter that the holders of fully paid certificates of beneficial interest issued by an investment trust organized pursuant to this chapter shall not be considered to be partners, either general or limited, in the business of the trust, and the limited liability provided by this section shall not be altered by reason of the fact that the declaration of trust may contain a provision for the election of successor trustees by the holders of certificates of beneficial interest.

     An investment trust shall not be deemed invalid as violating the rule against perpetuities or any law or statute against suspension of the powers of alienation. Such trust may continue for an indefinite period or for such time as may be necessary for the accomplishment of the purposes for which it was created; provided, however, that the declaration of trust shall contain a provision that such trust may be terminated at any time by the affirmative vote of holders of at least two thirds (2/3) of the amount of certificates of beneficial interest then outstanding, in the manner hereafter provided.

    <li id="t79c15ol62">
     At any meeting called for the purpose, notice of the purpose being contained in the call, the holders of at least two thirds (2/3) of the amount of certificates of beneficial interest then outstanding may by their affirmative vote dissolve the investment trust; the trustees shall thereupon file with the secretary of state an attested certified copy of the minutes of the meeting at which such vote was taken, together with a statement of the names and addresses of all trustees duly verified. The secretary of state, upon receipt of the above, shall record same and execute a certificate to the effect that such minutes and statement have been filed and that it appears therefrom that the investment trust has complied with this section. Such certificate shall be filed for record by the investment trust in the office of the clerk of the chancery court of the county wherein the original declaration of trust was recorded, and thereupon such investment trust shall be dissolved and shall cease to carry on business except for the purpose of adjusting and winding up its affairs. It shall then proceed to adjust and wind up its business, be empowered to carry out its contracts, collect its accounts receivable, and liquidate its assets and apply the same in discharge of its obligations and, after paying such obligations, the holder of each certificate of beneficial interest, according to the amount paid in thereon, shall be entitled to his portion of the balance of the assets. Said investment trust shall continue in existence for the purpose of discharging its debts and obligations, collect and distribute its assets, and doing all other acts required in order to wind up its business, and may sue and be sued for the purpose of enforcing such debts and obligations until its affairs are fully adjusted and wound up for three (3) years.

     If the holders of certificates of beneficial interest of an investment trust shall vote to dissolve, any holder of a certificate of beneficial interest of such trust may, within six (6) months from the date that the certificate of dissolution is filed with the chancery clerk as herein provided, demand an accounting by the trustees of all assets held by them in such capacity; and the chancery court of the county wherein the original declaration of trust was recorded shall have jurisdiction to compel such accounting upon petition by any holder of a certificate of beneficial interest in the investment trust.

   </p>
   <p>
    No foreign investment trust shall have the right to transact business in this state until it shall have procured a certificate of authority so to do from the secretary of state. No foreign investment trust shall be entitled to procure a certificate of authority under Sections 79-15-101 through 79-15-139 to transact in this state any business which an investment trust organized under the Mississippi Investment Trust Law is not permitted to transact. A foreign investment trust shall not be denied a certificate of authority by reason of the fact that the laws of the state or country under which such foreign investment trust is organized governing its organization and internal affairs differ from the laws of this state, and nothing contained in Sections 79-15-101 through 79-15-139 shall be construed to authorize this state to regulate the organization or the internal affairs of such foreign investment trust.
   </p>
   <p>
    Without excluding other activities which may not constitute transacting business in this state, a foreign investment trust shall not be considered to be transacting business in this state, for the purposes of Sections 79-15-101 through 79-15-139, by reason of carrying on in this state any one (1) or more of the following activities:
   </p>
   <p>
    Maintaining or defending any action or suit or any administrative or arbitration proceeding, or effecting the settlement thereof or the settlement of claims or disputes.
   </p>
   <p>
    Maintaining bank accounts.
   </p>
   <p>
    Maintaining offices or agencies for the transfer, exchange and registration of its securities, or appointing and maintaining trustees or depositaries with relation to its securities.
   </p>
   <p>
    Soliciting or procuring orders, whether by mail or through employees or agents or otherwise, where such orders require acceptance without this state before becoming binding contracts.
   </p>
   <p>
    Transacting any business in interstate commerce.
   </p>
   <p>
    Conducting an isolated transaction completed within a period of thirty (30) days and not in the course of a number of repeated transactions of like nature.
   </p>
   <p>
    Investing in or acquiring, in transactions outside of Mississippi, royalties and other non-operating mineral interests, and the execution of division orders, contracts of sale and other instruments incidental to the ownership of such non-operating mineral interests.

    How associations may be formed.
   </p>
   <p>
    Three (3) or more producers of agricultural products in the State of Mississippi who may desire that they, their associates, and successors shall come under this chapter and enjoy its benefits may enter into articles of association and incorporation, which shall set forth the name of the organization, the period of its existence (which shall be for not more than ninety-nine (99) years), its domicile, and that it is to be organized and operated under this chapter. Such articles shall be in duplicate and signed and acknowledged by all those named therein and filed with the Secretary of State of Mississippi. Upon the receipt of Twenty-five Dollars ($25.00) as a recording fee, the Secretary of State shall file both of said copies, endorsing thereon over his official signature the filing and the date thereof. Thereupon and by such filing and indorsement, said association described in the said articles shall be and become a complete and valid corporation without capital stock and without individual liability on the part of the organizers, their associates and successors, who may become members of such incorporated association, or on the part of the directors and officers of such organization, notwithstanding indebtedness be incurred by said corporation and it be without capital stock. Such articles when so filed shall be the charter of such corporation. Upon the filing and endorsement of the articles as aforesaid, the Secretary of State shall return one (1) of said copies of said articles to said corporation, which shall have the same recorded in the record of charters in the office of the clerk of the chancery court of the county in which the principal office or place of business of such corporation is located, and the Secretary of State shall retain the other copy of said articles for his files and record it and said endorsements thereon in the records of charters in his office. Such articles may be amended by the same procedure except that the proposed amendment shall be signed by two (2) executive officers, only after authority given by the vote of a majority of the members present at any membership meeting duly called and held; provided, however, that notice of such meeting and a statement of the substance of the proposed amendment to the articles of association and incorporation shall be mailed or delivered by hand to all members of the incorporated association at least fifteen (15) days prior to the date of such meeting. The recording fee for an amendment to such articles shall be Twenty Dollars ($20.00).

    Associations with capital stock, etc.
   </p>
   <p>
    Such incorporated association may be organized with capital stock at the option of the organizers; and it shall in that event be organized by the same method and for the same recording fee as in the case of those associations organized without capital stock, except that the articles of association shall set forth also that the association is organized with capital stock, and the amount of capital stock authorized, with particulars as to the class or classes thereof, and the par value of shares. There shall be no individual liability on the part of the shareholders, members, officers, or directors.
   </p>
   <p>
    Such association may begin business whenever as many as ten (10) members shall have paid for one (1) or more shares of stock each. The articles of association may provide for preferred stock as well as common stock; but all shares shall have a definite par value, and all shares of the same class shall have the same par value. No stock shall be issued until it shall be paid for in cash or in property or services fairly equal in value to its par value.
   </p>
   <p>
    Common stock and preferred stock enjoying voting rights shall be issued only to, and held by, producers of agricultural products who make use of the services and facilities of the association, or agricultural associations, organizations, federations or corporations organized under this chapter, or whose purposes and operations are in harmony with the purposes of this chapter. But the articles of association may limit the ownership of common stock and preferred stock enjoying voting rights to such producers of agricultural products. Dividends upon the capital stock, common or preferred, shall not be declared or paid in excess of eight percent (8%) per annum. Each share of stock shall entitle the holder thereof to one (1) vote in the management of the association; provided, however, if authorized by the articles of incorporation and association, classes of preferred stock may be issued without voting rights. Shares of nonvoting preferred stock may be issued to any party, whether or not such party is a producer eligible to own common stock or preferred stock which enjoys voting rights. Shares of common stock or of preferred stock which enjoys voting rights shall not be transferable except to producers of agricultural products or organizations to whom they could be issued, and no person shall acquire them by operation of law. If any shareholder of common stock or of preferred stock enjoying voting rights shall cease to be eligible to hold such shares, or shall die, or shall be dissolved, and if such shares be not promptly transferred to some producer or organization eligible to hold the same, the association shall take up such shares at par value or, at the option of the association, at appraised value, such value to be conclusively fixed by the board of directors of the association, and the association may pay therefor in cash or by certificate of indebtedness to be thereafter paid from the income of the association.
   </p>
   <p>
    All shareholders shall be members of the association, but there may also be members who are not shareholders. Such additional members shall have no vote in the management of the association; but they shall be entitled to all other benefits of the association equally with members who are shareholders, as if it were organized without capital stock, except that they shall have no right to stock dividends.
   </p>
   <p>
    If any shareholder shall attempt to transfer his shares, except as permitted, such shares may, at the option of the association, be taken up as in case of the death of a shareholder.
   </p>
   <p>
    Upon the dissolution of the association, any assets remaining after the payment of debts and the retiring of outstanding stock at par value shall be distributed in the manner provided in the bylaws of the incorporated association.

    An incorporated agricultural association has absolute duty of taking up and paying, at its par value only, the stock of a shareholder who has ceased to be a producer of agricultural products and who is unable to transfer such stock to some other producer, although the association may pay for such stock by issuing its certificate of indebtedness payable out of future earnings or income.

    Rights of shareholder in a corporate agricultural association are controlled by the law under which the association is organized which must be read into his contract of purchase of the stock, and, upon becoming a member of the association, he is charged with notice of the law pertaining thereto.

    Shareholder of capital stock in an incorporated agricultural association, upon becoming ineligible to hold stock by reason of fact that he is no longer a producer of agricultural products and who is unable to sell or transfer his stock to another eligible producer or organization, is entitled to be paid by the association only the par value of his stock, which may be paid by association’s certificate of indebtedness payable out of future earnings, and not the amount representing the proportion that his shares bear to the present assets of the association, even though such amount may be greater than the par value of the shares, and such does not deprive the shareholder of property without due process of law in violation of the constitution.

   </p>
   <p>
    Any provision of any law which otherwise would be in conflict with this chapter, or with the powers herein conferred, shall not be construed as applying to the associations herein provided for; and all laws heretofore or hereafter enacted in conflict with any of the provisions hereof shall be construed as not applying to associations of this character, if to construe otherwise would tend to limit, restrict, prohibit, or penalize the associations herein authorized to be organized. Provided, that such interpretation and construction shall be strictly limited to bona fide cooperative associations, and that nothing herein contained is intended nor shall be construed so as to permit any person, firm and/or corporation to engage in any business for the personal profit and gain of said person, firm and/or corporation and not as a strictly cooperative association, and escape liability for taxes or other legal exactions by assuming or claiming the form or guise of a cooperative association.
   </p>
   <p>
    Any association heretofore or hereafter organized under the provisions of Chapters 17, 19, and 21 of Title 79, Mississippi Code of 1972, is hereby authorized and empowered to organize and operate such branch associations as it may deem necessary or useful in carrying out the purposes of this chapter. Such branch associations shall be located at such places as the directors may deem proper, and shall be under the supervision, control and management of the officers and directors of the parent association; and members of such branch associations may or may not be shareholders, but all members of branch associations shall be entitled to the same benefits and privileges as are permitted and enjoyed by members of the parent association.
   </p>
   <p>
    In addition to the foregoing, the articles of incorporation of any association incorporated hereunder may contain any provision consistent with law with respect to management, regulation, government, financing, indebtedness, membership, the establishment of voting districts and the election of delegates for representative purposes, the issuance, retirement, and transfer of its stock, if formed with capital stock, or any provisions relative to the way or manner in which it shall operate or with respect to its members, officers or directors and any other provisions relative to its affairs.
   </p>
   <p>
    The powers herein granted shall be possessed by an association or federation organized hereunder fully and completely, whether specified in the articles of association or not, unless expressly eliminated by the articles of association.
   </p>
   <p>
    Such incorporated association may render the services mentioned in this section to producers of agricultural products who are not members thereof as well as to members, provided that no such incorporated association shall deal in the agricultural products of nonmembers to an amount greater in value than such as are handled by it for members, and that no such incorporated association shall purchase supplies and equipment for nonmembers in an amount greater in value than such as are purchased for members.
   </p>
   <p>
    Whenever such incorporated association shall market the products of, purchase supplies or equipment for, or render other services to nonmembers, such nonmember patrons shall be treated on the same basis as members in that the same charges and deductions shall be made against them as against members for like services, and that they shall be entitled to receive patronage dividends and distributions equally with members on account of like services rendered by such association to them during the period of time for which such patronage dividends or distributions are made, but as to nonmembers such patronage dividends and distributions may be paid as a credit toward the purchase of stock or the payment of a membership fee, at the option of such association.

    Associations may federate.
   </p>
   <p>
    Such associations incorporated hereunder may, in carrying out their purposes, become members of and enjoy the facilities and co-operation of any federation whose members are agricultural societies, organizations or associations, whose purposes and operations are in any way promotive of and not inconsistent with the purposes of this chapter.
   </p>
   <p>
    HISTORY: 
Codes, 1930, § 4094; 1942, § 4489; Laws, 1928, ch. 295; Laws, 1930, ch. 109.

    How federation managed.
   </p>
   <p>
    Five (5) or more associations or corporations organized under this chapter, or whose purposes and operations are in any way promotive of, and not inconsistent with, the purposes of this chapter, whether incorporated hereunder or not, may organize and incorporate a federation of such incorporated associations as members thereof. Such incorporated federation shall be managed by a board of directors to be composed of representatives of such constituent member associations. The articles of association and incorporation for such federation shall contain the names of the constituent member associations, and the signatures and acknowledgments thereto shall be by an executive officer of each of the constituent associations; and the other procedure and details of incorporation shall be the same as herein provided for the incorporation of the constituent incorporated associations. The organization meeting and adoption of bylaws shall be by representatives chosen by the respective constituent members for that purpose, one (1) for each member. In the organization and management of such federation each constituent member shall be entitled to one (1) vote only, and if any constituent member has more than one (1) representative as members of the board of directors of said federation, such representatives as directors shall jointly have one (1) vote only, it being intended that such a federation may be incorporated hereunder as aforesaid for the purposes and with all the rights and powers herein given to associations of producers of agricultural products hereunder. After such federation has been organized and incorporated as provided herein, agricultural societies, organizations, associations or corporations, whose purposes and operations are in any way promotive of, and not inconsistent with, the purposes of this chapter, whether incorporated under this chapter or not, may become members of such federation, and are accepted by the federation; and any such federation may limit its membership to associations incorporated under this chapter.
   </p>
   <p>
    Such federation may be organized with capital stock at the option of the organizing associations, and in that event the provisions of this chapter applying to capital stock organization of incorporated associations shall apply also to such federation, but in addition the common stock thereof shall be owned only by member associations. And the management shall be vested in a board of directors of such number as the bylaws may provide, elected by the shareholders. Such federation may begin business as soon as the organizing associations have paid for at least one (1) share of stock each.
   </p>
   <p>
    The representatives of the member associations in the case of non-stock federations, and the directors of capital stock federations, need not be producers of agricultural products, shareholders or members of the constituent members.

   </p>
   <p>
    Each association incorporated hereunder must, within thirty (30) days after its incorporation, adopt for its government and management a code of bylaws, not inconsistent with the powers granted herein. A majority vote of the members or stockholders, or their written assent, is necessary to adopt such bylaws. The bylaws so adopted may be amended by the vote of a majority of the members present at any membership meeting duly called and held; provided, however, notice of such meeting and a statement of the substance of the proposed bylaw amendment shall be mailed or delivered by hand to all members of the association at least fifteen (15) days prior to the date of such meeting. Each association under its bylaws may also provide for any or all of the following matters:

   <p>
    In its bylaws each association shall provide for one or more regular meetings annually. The board of directors shall have the right to call a special meeting at any time, and ten percent (10%) of the members or stockholders may file a petition stating the specific business to be brought before the association and demand a special meeting at any time. Such meeting must thereupon be called by the directors. Notice of all meetings, together with a statement of the purposes thereof, shall be mailed to each member at least ten (10) days prior to the meeting; provided, however, that the bylaws may require instead that such notice may be given by publication in a newspaper of general circulation, published at the principal place of business of the association.

    Directors; election.
   </p>
   <p>
    The affairs of the association shall be managed by a board of not less than five (5) directors, elected by the members or stockholders from their own number and shall have all rights and powers as provided for under the general corporation laws of this state, and such other powers as may be necessary to the proper execution of provisions of this chapter. The bylaws may provide that the territory in which the association has members shall be divided into districts and that the directors shall be elected according to such districts. In such case the bylaws shall specify the number of directors to be elected by each district, the manner and method of reapportioning the directors and of redistricting the territory covered by the association. The bylaws may provide that primary elections should be held in each district to elect the directors apportioned to such districts and the result of all such primary elections must be ratified by the next regular meeting of the association or may be considered final as to the association.
   </p>
   <p>
    The bylaws may provide that one or more directors may be appointed by the president of Mississippi State University of Agriculture and Applied Science or such other public official, commission, association or board as may be indicated by such bylaws. Such directors shall represent primarily the interest of the general public in such associations. The director or directors so appointed need not be members or stockholders of the association, but shall have the same powers and rights as other directors. Such directors shall not number more than one-fifth (1/5) of the entire number of directors.
   </p>
   <p>
    The directors of an association may provide a fair remuneration for the time actually spent by its officers, directors and employees in its service. No director, during the term of his office, shall be a party to a contract for profit with the association, differing in any way from the business relations accorded regular members or holders of common stock of the association.
   </p>
   <p>
    The bylaws may provide for an executive committee and may allot to such committee all the functions and powers of the board of directors, subject to the general direction and control of the board.
   </p>
   <p>
    When a vacancy on the board of directors occurs, other than by expiration of term, the remaining members of the board, by a majority vote, shall fill the vacancy unless the bylaws provide for an election of directors by districts. In such a case the board of directors shall immediately call a special election to be voted in by the members or stockholders in that district to fill the vacancy.

    Removal of officer or director.
   </p>
   <p>
    Any member may bring charges against an officer or director by filing them in writing with the secretary of the association, together with a petition signed by ten percent (10%) of the members, requesting the removal of the officer or director in question. The removal shall be voted upon at the next regular or special meeting of the association and, by a vote of a majority of the members, the association may remove the officer or director and fill the vacancy. The director or officer against whom such charges have been brought shall be informed in writing of the charges previous to the meeting and shall have an opportunity at the meeting to be heard in person or by counsel and to present witnesses; and the person or persons bringing charges against him shall have the same opportunity. But such officer or director may be suspended by a vote of two thirds (2/3) of the directors, pending the hearing of such charges.
   </p>
   <p>
    In case the bylaws provide for election of directors by districts with primary elections in each district, then the petition for removal of a director must be signed by twenty percent (20%) of the members residing in the district from which he was elected. The board of directors must call a special meeting of the members residing in that district to consider the removal of the director. By a vote of the majority of the members of that district, the director in question shall be removed from office.

    Remedies for breach of contract or bylaws.

   <ol>
    <li id="t79c19ol31">
     The bylaws or the marketing contract of any association existing hereunder may fix, as liquidated damages, specific sums to be paid by the member or stockholder to the association upon the breach or threatened breach by him of any provision of the marketing contract regarding the sale or delivery or withholding of products; and may further provide that the member will pay all costs, premiums for bonds, expenses, and fees in case any action is brought upon the contract by the association; and any such provisions shall be valid and enforceable in the courts of law or equity of this state, and such clauses providing for liquidated damages shall be enforceable as such and shall not be regarded as penalties.
    </li>
    <li id="t79c19ol32">
     In the event of any breach or threatened breach of such marketing contract by a member or other person, the association shall be entitled to an injunction to prevent the breach or further breach of the contract, and to a decree of specific performance thereof. Pending the adjudication of such an action and upon filing a verified complaint showing the breach or threatened breach, and upon filing a bond in the sum of One Hundred Dollars ($100.00), the association shall be entitled to an injunction against the member or other person; provided, however, that the chancellor in his discretion may increase such bond to Five Hundred Dollars ($500.00), after a hearing on five (5) days’ notice to the parties, if justice demands such increase in the amount of said bond.
    </li>
    <li id="t79c19ol33">
     In any action, legal or equitable, upon any marketing contract of any member with any association existing hereunder, it shall be conclusively presumed that the products produced by any person, firm, or corporation during the period of time covered by such marketing contract, on the land of such member, however and by whomsoever produced, are the products of such member and, as such, are subject to the said marketing contract if the said products have been grown or acquired under any contract between such member and such other person, firm, or corporation, entered into after the execution of the said marketing contract; and in such actions, the foregoing remedies for nondelivery or breach shall lie and be enforceable against such person, firms, or corporations.

    An injunction was properly granted to an association to prevent the breach of a marketing contract, by which a farmer had agreed to sell all his cotton at a set price, and the association was entitled to specific performance of the contract, where the farmer’s contention that the contract was voided by an association director’s use of his position to secure a more favorable contract with the association than regular members could obtain, in violation of § 79-19-21, was without merit, the director having negotiated with his buyer a floating price type of contract available to all members and having paid the association its usual marketing fee, and where the execution of such floating price contracts by the director and by other growers did not thereby release them from their agreements with the association and did not thereby release the farmer from his contract.

    Purchasing business of other associations, persons, firms or corporations; payment; stock issued.

    Whenever an association organized or existing hereunder with preferred capital stock shall purchase the stock or any property, or any interest in any property, of any person, firm, or corporation, or association, it may discharge the obligations so incurred, wholly or in part, by exchanging for the acquired interest shares of its preferred capital stock to an amount which at par value would equal a fair market value of the stock or interest so purchased, as determined by the board of directors. In that case the transfer to the association of the stock or interest purchased shall be equivalent to payment in cash for the shares of stock issued.

   <p>
    The provisions of Section 79-25-5 shall not apply to a business combination involving receipt of consideration in exchange for or in respect of the corporation’s stock or assets in the circumstances specified in subsection (b) or (c) of this section or to a corporation meeting one (1) of the requirements of subsection (d) of this section.
   </p>
   <p>
    The vote required by Section 79-25-5 is not required if each of the following conditions is met:
   </p>
   <p>
    The aggregate amount of the cash and the market value as of the valuation date of consideration other than cash to be received per share by holders of common stock in such business combination is at least equal to the highest of the following:
   </p>
   <p>
    The highest per share price (including any brokerage commissions, transfer taxes and soliciting dealers’ fees) paid by the interested shareholder for any shares of common stock of the same class or series acquired by it
   </p>
   <ol>
    <li id="t79c25ol11">
     Within the two-year period immediately prior to the announcement date of the proposal of the business combination, or
    </li>
    <li id="t79c25ol12">
     In the transaction in which it became an interested shareholder, whichever is higher; or
    </li>
   </ol>
   <p>
    The market value per share of common stock of the same class or series on the announcement date or on the determination date, whichever is higher; or
   </p>
   <p>
    The price per share equal to the market value per share of common stock of the same class or series determined pursuant to subsection (b)(i)(B) of this section, multiplied by the fraction of:
   </p>
   <p>
    The highest per share price (including any brokerage commissions, transfer taxes and soliciting dealers’ fees) paid by the interested shareholder for any shares of common stock of the same class or series acquired by it within the two-year period prior to the announcement date; over
   </p>
   <p>
    The market value per share of common stock of the same class or series on the first day in such two-year period on which the interested stockholder acquired his stock.
   </p>
   <p>
    The aggregate amount of the cash and the market value as of the valuation date of consideration other than cash to be received per share by holders of shares of any class or series of outstanding stock other than common stock is at least equal to the highest of the following (whether or not the interested shareholder has previously acquired any shares of a particular class or series of stock):
   </p>
   <p>
    The highest per share price (including any brokerage commissions, transfer taxes and soliciting dealers’ fees) paid by the interested shareholder for any shares of such class of stock acquired by it
   </p>
   <p>
    Within the two-year period immediately prior to the announcement date of the proposal of the business combination, or
   </p>
   <p>
    In the transaction in which it became an interested shareholder, whichever is higher; or
   </p>
   <p>
    The highest preferential amount per share to which the holders of shares of such class of stock are entitled in the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the corporation; or
   </p>
   <p>
    The market value per share of such class of stock on the announcement date or on the determination date, whichever is higher; or
   </p>
   <p>
    The price per share equal to the market value per share of such class of stock determined pursuant to subsection (b)(ii)(c) of this section, multiplied by the fraction of:
   </p>
   <p>
    The highest per share price (including any brokerage commissions, transfer taxes and soliciting dealers’ fees) paid by the interested shareholder for any shares of any class of voting stock acquired by it within the two-year period immediately prior to the announcement date; over
   </p>
   <p>
    The market value per share of the same class of voting stock on the first day in such two-year period on which the interested shareholder acquired any shares of the same class of voting stock.
   </p>
   <p>
    The consideration to be received by holders of any class or series of outstanding stock is to be in cash or in the same form as the interested shareholder has previously paid for shares of the same class or series of stock. If the interested shareholder has paid for shares of any class of stock with varying forms of consideration, the form of consideration for such class of stock shall be either cash or the form used to acquire the largest number of shares of such class or series of stock previously acquired by it. In making any price calculation under subsection (a) of this section, appropriate adjustments shall be made to reflect any reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, recapitalization or similar transaction which may increase or reduce the number of outstanding shares of any class or series of stock of the corporation.
   </p>
   <p>
    After the interested shareholder has become an interested shareholder and prior to the consummation of such business combination:
   </p>
   <p>
    There shall have been no failure to declare and pay at the regular date therefor any full periodic dividends (whether or not cumulative) on any outstanding preferred stock of the corporation.
   </p>
   <p>
    There shall have been:
   </p>
   <p>
    No reduction in the annual rate of dividends paid on any class or series of stock of the corporation that is not preferred stock of the corporation (except as necessary to reflect any subdivision of the stock); and
   </p>
   <p>
    An increase in such annual rate of dividends as necessary to reflect any reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, recapitalization, reorganization or any similar transaction, which has the effect of reducing the number of outstanding shares of the stock.
   </p>
   <p>
    The interested shareholder shall not have become the beneficial owner of any additional shares of stock of the corporation except as part of the transaction which resulted in such interested shareholder becoming an interested shareholder or by virtue of proportionate stock splits or stock dividends.
   </p>
   <p>
    After the interested shareholder has become an interested shareholder, the interested shareholder shall not have received the benefit, directly or indirectly (except proportionately as a shareholder), of any loans, advances, guarantees, pledges or other financial assistance or any tax credits or other tax advantages, provided by the corporation or any of its subsidiaries, whether in anticipation of or in connection with such business combination or otherwise.
   </p>
   <p>
    Whether or not such business combinations are consummated in whole or in part after July 1, 1985, or after the interested shareholder became an interested shareholder, the requirements of Section 79-25-5, do not apply to business combinations that specifically, generally, or generally by types, as to specifically identified or unidentified existing or future interested stockholders or their affiliates, have been approved or exempted therefrom by resolution approved by at least eighty percent (80%) of the continuing directors of the corporation.
   </p>
   <p>
    Unless the certificate of incorporation of the corporation provides otherwise, the requirements of subsection (2) of this section do not apply to any business combination of:
   </p>
   <p>
    A corporation having fewer than five hundred (500) beneficial owners of its stock; or
   </p>
   <p>
    A corporation which elects not to be governed by the requirements of Section 79-25-5 by the adoption, upon a majority vote of its shareholders, of an amendment to its certificate of incorporation within one (1) year from and after July 1, 1985, for existing corporations, or within one (1) year from and after the date of incorporation for corporations organized after July 1, 1985; or
   </p>
   <p>
    An investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940; or
   </p>
   <p>
    Any state or national bank or any bank holding company or any affiliate thereof authorized by the appropriate regulatory authority to be owned by any of the above; or
   </p>
   <p>
    Any state or federal savings and loan association, savings bank or similar savings institution, and any holding company or other affiliate of any state or federal savings and loan association, savings bank or similar savings institution.

    Definitions.
   </p>
   <p>
    As used in this chapter:
   </p>
   <p>
    “Acquiring person” means a person who makes or proposes to make, or persons acting as a “group” as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 who make or propose to make, a control share acquisition; but “acquiring person” does not include the issuing public corporation.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Affiliate” means a person who directly or indirectly controls the corporation. “Control” means the possession, direct or indirect, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of the corporation, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract, or otherwise. A person’s beneficial ownership of ten percent (10%) or more of the voting power of a corporation’s outstanding shares entitled to vote in the election of directors (except a person holding voting power in good faith as an agent, bank, broker, nominee, custodian or trustee for one or more beneficial owners who do not individually or as a group control the corporation) creates a presumption that the person controls the corporation.
   </p>
   <p>
    “All voting power” means the aggregate voting power that the shareholders of an issuing public corporation would have in the election of directors, except for this chapter.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Control shares” means issued and outstanding shares of an issuing public corporation that, except for this chapter, would have voting power when added to all other shares of the issuing public corporation owned of record or beneficially by an acquiring person or in respect to which that acquiring person may exercise or direct the exercise of voting power, that would entitle the acquiring person, immediately after acquisition of the shares (directly or indirectly), to exercise or direct the exercise of the voting power of the issuing public corporation in the election of directors within any of the following ranges of voting power:
   </p>
   <p>
    One-fifth (1/5) or more but less than one-third (1/3) of all voting power;
   </p>
   <p>
    One-third (1/3) or more but less than a majority of all voting power; or
   </p>
   <p>
    A majority or more of all voting power.
   </p>
   <p>
    (i) “Control share acquisition” means acquisition by any person of ownership of, or the power to direct the exercise of voting power with respect to, control shares.
   </p>
   <p>
    A person who acquires shares in the ordinary course of business for the benefit of others in good faith and not for the purpose of circumventing this chapter has not made a control share acquisition of shares in respect of which that person is not able to exercise or direct the exercise of votes without further instruction from others.
   </p>
   <p>
    The acquisition of any control shares does not constitute a control share acquisition if the acquisition is made in good faith and not for the purpose of circumventing this chapter in any of the following circumstances:
   </p>
   <p>
    At a time when the corporation was not subject to this chapter.
   </p>
   <p>
    Pursuant to a contract entered into at a time when the corporation was not subject to this chapter.
   </p>
   <p>
    Pursuant to the laws of descent and distribution under Section 91-1-1 et seq., Mississippi Code of 1972.
   </p>
   <p>
    By a donee under an inter vivos gift.
   </p>
   <p>
    Pursuant to a transfer between or among immediate family members, or between or among persons under direct common control. An “immediate family member” is any relative or spouse of a person, or any relative of such spouse, who has the same home as such person.
   </p>
   <p>
    Pursuant to the satisfaction of a pledge or other security interest.
   </p>
   <p>
    Pursuant to a merger or plan of consolidation or share exchange effected in compliance with Section 79-4-11.01 et seq., Mississippi Code of 1972, if the issuing public corporation is a party to the agreement of merger or plan of consolidation or share exchange.
   </p>
   <p>
    From any person whose previous acquisition of control shares would have constituted a control share acquisition but for this paragraph (e)(iii) (other than this paragraph (e)(iii)(H)), provided the acquisition does not result in the acquiring person holding voting power within a higher range of voting power than that of a person from whom the control shares were acquired.
   </p>
   <p>
    Acquisition by a person of additional shares within the range of voting power for which such person has received approval pursuant to Section 79-27-9 or within the range of voting power resulting from shares acquired in a transaction described in this paragraph (e)(iii).
   </p>
   <p>
    An increase in voting power resulting from any action taken by the issuing public corporation.
   </p>
   <p>
    Pursuant to the solicitation of proxies subject to Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
   </p>
   <p>
    Pursuant to the sale of such shares by the issuing public corporation or its parent or subsidiary corporation.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Interested shares” means the shares of an issuing public corporation in respect of which any of the following persons may exercise or direct the exercise, as of the applicable record date, of the voting power of the corporation in the election of directors, other than solely by the authority of a revocable proxy:
   </p>
   <p>
    The acquiring person.
   </p>
   <p>
    Any officer of the issuing public corporation.
   </p>
   <p>
    Any employee of the issuing corporation who is also a director of the corporation.
   </p>
   <p>
    (i) “Issuing public corporation” means a domestic corporation that has:
   </p>
   <p>
    Any securities registered under Section 12 or is subject to Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; and
   </p>
   <p>
    Either:
   </p>
   <p>
    1. More than ten percent (10%) of its shareholders resident in Mississippi;
   </p>
   <p>
    2. More than ten percent (10%) of its shares owned by Mississippi residents; or
   </p>
   <p>
    3. Five hundred (500) shareholders resident in Mississippi.
   </p>
   <p>
    The residence of a shareholder is presumed to be the address appearing in the records of the corporation.
   </p>
   <p>
    Shares held by banks (except as trustee or guardian), brokers or nominees are disregarded for purposes of calculating the percentages and numbers in this paragraph (g).
   </p>
   <p>
    An issuing public corporation shall not include:
   </p>
   <p>
    Any state or national bank or any bank holding company or any affiliate thereof authorized by the appropriate regulatory authority to be owned by any of the above; or
   </p>
   <p>
    Any state or federal savings and loan association, savings bank or similar savings institution, and any holding company or other affiliate of any state or federal savings and loan association, savings bank or similar savings institution.
   </p>
   <p>
    “Person” means any individual, corporation, partnership, unincorporated association or other entity.

     Any acquiring person who proposes to make a control share acquisition may, and any acquiring person who has made a control share acquisition shall, publish in a newspaper of general circulation and deliver to the issuing public corporation at its principal office a disclosure statement. To be regarded as a disclosure statement, the document must set forth all of the following:
     <ol type="a">

       <ol type="i">
        <li id="t79c27ol31fi">
         A description in reasonable detail of the terms of the proposed control share acquisition; and

        <li id="t79c27ol31fii">
         Representations of the acquiring person, together with a statement in reasonable detail of the facts upon which they are based, that the proposed control share acquisition, if consummated, will not be contrary to law, and that the acquiring person has the financial capacity to make the proposed control share acquisition.

       </ol>
      </li>
     </ol>
    </li>
    <li id="t79c27ol31f2">
     If the directors of the issuing public corporation so order, or if the acquiring person so requests at the time of delivery of a disclosure statement and gives an undertaking to pay the issuing public corporation’s expenses in connection therewith, a special meeting of shareholders of the issuing public corporation must be called within ten (10) days after delivery of the disclosure statement for the purpose of considering the resolution relating to the voting rights to be accorded the shares acquired or to be acquired in the control share acquisition. Unless both the acquiring person and the issuing public corporation agree in writing to another date, the special meeting of shareholders must be held not sooner than thirty (30) days nor later than fifty (50) days after receipt by the issuing public corporation of the request or order for a special meeting.
    </li>
    <li id="t79c27ol31f3">
     If no special meeting of shareholders is called pursuant to subsection (2) of this section, the resolution relating to the voting rights to be accorded the shares acquired in the control share acquisition must be presented to the next special or annual meeting of shareholders.
    </li>
    <li id="t79c27ol31f4">
     If a special meeting is called, notice of the special meeting of shareholders must be given as promptly as reasonably practicable by the issuing public corporation to all shareholders of record as of the record date set for the meeting. If the special meeting was requested by the acquiring person, the directors shall set the record date on a date not later than fifteen (15) days after the request was received by the issuing public corporation.
    </li>
    <li id="t79c27ol31f5">
     Notice of the special meeting, or the annual meeting if no special meeting is called, must include or be accompanied by:

      <li id="t79c27ol31f5b">
       A statement by the board of directors of its position or recommendation, or that it is taking no position or making no recommendation, with respect to the resolution contained in the disclosure statement; and

       A description of any dissent and appraisal rights or any redemption procedure that may accompany or result from the vote of shareholders.
      </li>
     </ol>
    </li>
    <li id="t79c27ol31f5c6">
     Any other provisions of this chapter notwithstanding, a proxy relating to a meeting of shareholders to be held pursuant to this section must be solicited separately from the offer to purchase or solicitation of an offer to sell shares of the issuing public corporation.
    </li>
    <li id="t79c27ol31f5c7">
     All votes cast at the meeting for or against the resolution contained in the disclosure statement must be identified as noninterested shares. To be approved, the resolution must receive the affirmative votes of a majority of all voting power, excluding all interested shares. If the resolution is not approved, the acquiring person, not sooner than six (6) months thereafter, may present a new resolution for a vote of shareholders in accordance with this section at any subsequent shareholder meeting as long as the voting power of the control shares described in the resolution is reduced.

       For purposes of this subsection, a “competing control share acquisition” means a control share acquisition that is the subject of a disclosure statement delivered to the issuing public corporation under subsection (1) of this section before a shareholder vote has been held under subsection (7) of this section with respect to a pending control share acquisition.
      </li>
      <li id="t79c27ol31f5c8b">
       A resolution relating to the voting rights of control shares that are the subject of a pending control share acquisition is not effective unless it receives approval pursuant to subsection (7) of this section and a resolution relating to the voting rights of control shares that are the subject of a competing control share acquisition does not receive such approval. If a resolution applicable to the competing control share acquisition is approved pursuant to subsection (7) of this section, only that resolution is effective.
      </li>
      <li id="t79c27ol31f5c8c">
       If a resolution relating to a pending control share acquisition has been approved pursuant to subsection (7) of this section before a disclosure statement with respect to another control share acquisition is delivered, the resolution is effective in restoring the voting rights of control shares that are the subject of the pending control share acquisition.
      </li>
      <li id="t79c27ol31f5c8d">
       If resolutions relating to two (2) or more control share acquisitions are subject to shareholder vote under subsection (7) of this section, shares held by an acquiring person are not considered interested shares with respect to a vote on a resolution relating to a competing control share acquisition.

    Filing with the Secretary of State.
   </p>
   <ol>
    <li id="t79c29a02ol51">
     The certificate of formation and any certificate of amendment, dissolution, correction or merger and any restated certificate must be delivered to the Office of the Secretary of State. A person who signs a certificate as an agent or fiduciary need not exhibit evidence of the person’s authority as a prerequisite to filing by the Secretary of State. Unless the Secretary of State finds that a certificate is not acceptable for filing, upon receipt of all filing fees required by Section 79-29-1203 and delivery of the certificate the Secretary of State shall:
     <ol type="a">
      <li id="t79c29a02ol51a">
       Certify that the certificate has been filed in the Secretary of State’s office by endorsing upon the signed certificate the word “Filed” and the date and time of the filing. This endorsement is conclusive evidence of the date and time of its filing in absence of actual fraud;
      </li>
      <li id="t79c29a02ol51b">
       File the certificate; and
      </li>
      <li id="t79c29a02ol51c">
       Return a copy to the person who delivered it for filing or that person’s representative with an acknowledgment of the date and time of filing.
      </li>
     </ol>
    </li>
    <li id="t79c29a02ol51c2">
     Upon the filing of a certificate of amendment or upon the future effective date of a certificate of amendment (or judicial decree thereof) or an amended and restated certificate, as provided for therein, the certificate of formation shall be amended, corrected or restated as set forth therein. Upon the filing of a certificate of dissolution (or a judicial decree thereof) by the Secretary of State or upon the future effective date of a certificate of dissolution (or a judicial decree thereof), the certificate of formation is dissolved.
    </li>
    <li id="t79c29a02ol51c3">
     Each certificate delivered to the Office of the Secretary of State for filing must be typewritten or printed, or, if electronically transmitted, it must be in a format that can be retrieved or reproduced by the Secretary of State in typewritten or printed form, and must be in the English language. A limited liability company name need not be in English if written in English letters or Arabic or Roman numerals.
    </li>
    <li id="t79c29a02ol51c4">
     Refused documents shall be returned by the Secretary of State to the limited liability company or its representative within ten (10) days after the document was delivered, together with a brief, written explanation of the reason for the refusal.
     <ol type="a">
      <li id="t79c29a02ol51c4a">
       If the Secretary of State refuses to file a document, the limited liability company may appeal the refusal to the chancery court of the county where the limited liability company’s principal office is or will be located. The appeal is commenced by petitioning the court to compel filing the document and by attaching to the petition the document and the Secretary of State’s explanation of the refusal to file.
      </li>
      <li id="t79c29a02ol51c4b">
       The court may summarily order the Secretary of State to file the document or take other action the court considers appropriate.

    In the case of a limited liability company that is a party to a merger:
   </p>
   <p>
    The agreement of merger must be adopted by the members in accordance with subsection (c) of this section.
   </p>
   <p>
    Unless the agreement of merger is not required to be approved by the members, the limited liability company must notify each member and each owner of a financial interest, whether or not entitled to vote, of the meeting of members at which the agreement of merger is to be submitted for approval.The notice must state that the purpose, or one of the purposes, of the meeting is to consider the agreement of merger and must contain or be accompanied by a copy or summary of the agreement of merger. If the limited liability company is to be merged into an existing entity, the notice shall also include or be accompanied by a copy or summary of the organizational documents of that entity.If the limited liability company is to be merged into an entity that is to be created pursuant to the merger, the notice shall include or be accompanied by a copy or a summary of the organizational documents of the new entity.
   </p>
   <p>
    Approval of the agreement of merger requires the approval of at least a majority of the votes entitled to be cast on the agreement of merger, and, if any class or series of interests is entitled to vote as a separate group on the agreement of merger, the approval of at least a majority of the votes entitled to be cast on the merger by that voting group.
   </p>
   <p>
    Separate voting by voting groups is required:
   </p>
   <p>
    On an agreement of merger, by each class or series of interests that:1. are to be converted, pursuant to the provisions of the agreement of merger, into shares or other securities, interests, obligations, rights to acquire interests or other securities, cash, other property, or any combination of the foregoing; or 2. would have a right to vote as a separate group on a provision in the agreement of merger that, if contained in a proposed amendment to the certificate of formation or operating agreement, would require action by separate voting groups under the certificate of formation or operating agreement;
   </p>
   <p>
    On an agreement of merger, if the voting group is entitled under the certificate of formation or operating agreement, to vote as a voting group to approve an agreement of merger.
   </p>
   <p>
    If as a result of a merger one or more members or owners of a financial interest of a domestic limited liability company would become subject to personal liability for the obligations or liabilities of any entity, approval of the agreement of merger shall require the execution, by each such member and owner of a financial interest, of a separate written consent to become subject to such personal liability.

    Action on an agreement to sell, lease, exchange or otherwise dispose of assets.
   </p>
   <p>
    In the case of a limited liability company that is a party to an agreement outside the ordinary course of the limited liability company’s activities to sell, lease, exchange, or otherwise dispose of assets if the disposition would leave the limited liability company without a significant continuing business activity, as such term is defined in Section 79-29-231(3)(a)(ii):
   </p>
   <p>
    The agreement, referred to herein as the “asset sale agreement,” must be approved by the members in accordance with subsection (c) of this section.
   </p>
   <p>
    Unless the asset sale agreement is not required to be approved by the members, the limited liability company must notify each member and each owner of a financial interest, whether or not entitled to vote, of the meeting of members at which the asset sale agreement is to be submitted for approval.The notice must state that the purpose, or one (1) of the purposes, of the meeting is to consider the asset sale agreement and must contain or be accompanied by a copy or summary of the asset sale agreement.
   </p>
   <p>
    Approval of the asset sale agreement requires the approval of at least a majority of the votes entitled to be cast on the asset sale agreement, and, if any class or series of interests is entitled to vote as a separate group on the asset sale agreement, the approval of at least a majority of the votes entitled to be cast on the asset sale agreement by that voting group.
   </p>
   <p>
    Separate voting by voting groups is required:
   </p>
   <p>
    On an asset sale agreement, by each class or series of interests that would have a right to vote as a separate group on a provision in the asset sale agreement that, if contained in a proposed amendment to the certificate of formation or operating agreement, would require action by separate voting groups under the certificate of formation or operating agreement;
   </p>
   <p>
    On an asset sale agreement, if the voting group is entitled under the certificate of formation or operating agreement, to vote as a voting group to approve an asset sale agreement.
   </p>
   <p>
    If as a result of the asset disposition one or more members or owners of a financial interest would become subject to personal liability for the obligations or liabilities of any entity, approval of the asset sale agreement shall require the execution, by each such member and owner of a financial interest, of a separate written consent to become subject to personal liability.

     An assignee of a financial interest may become a member with governance interests if and to the extent that:(a) the certificate of formation or operating agreement so provides; (b) all other members consent; or (c) in the case of an assignee of a member’s entire financial interest in which, immediately following the assignment, the limited liability company otherwise would have no members, simultaneously with and upon the assignment of the interest to an assignee who agrees to become a member.

     An assignee who has become a member has, to the extent assigned, the governance rights and powers, and is subject to the restrictions and liabilities, of a member under the certificate of formation or operating agreement and this chapter.An assignee who becomes a member also is liable for the obligations of the assignee’s assignor to make and return contributions as provided in Articles 5 and 6 of this chapter.However, the assignee is not obligated for liabilities or obligations unknown to the assignee at the time the assignee became a member and which could not be ascertained from the certificate of formation or the operating agreement.

The court may appoint an individual or entity (authorized to transact business in this state) as a receiver or custodian. The court may require the receiver or custodian to post bond, with or without sureties, in an amount the court directs.

    Establishment of fair market value of total gross assets.

   <ol>
    <li id="t79c33ol31">
     A corporation may establish the fair market value of total gross assets for the purpose of the limitations under Section 79-33-5 through any method reasonable under the circumstances, including:
     <ol type="a">
      <li id="t79c33ol31a">

     Total gross assets include the aggregate coverage under any applicable liability insurance that was issued to the transferor whose assets are being valued for purposes of this title and which insurance has been collected or is collectable to cover successor asbestos-related liabilities (except compensation for liabilities arising from workers’ exposure to asbestos solely during the course of their employment by the transferor). A settlement of a dispute concerning such insurance coverage entered into by a transferor or successor with the insurers of the transferor before April 20, 2004, shall be determinative of the aggregate coverage of such liability insurance to be included in the calculation of the transferor’s total gross assets.

     The adjustment of fair market value of total gross assets continues as provided under subsection (1) of this section until the date the adjusted value is exceeded by the cumulative amounts of successor asbestos-related liabilities paid or committed to be paid by or on behalf of the corporation or a predecessor, or by or on behalf of a transferor, after the time of the merger or consolidation for which the fair market value of total gross assets is determined.
    </li>

     That the agent resigns from serving as agent for service of process for the entity.

    (1) The statement of resignation shall include a certification of the registered agent that at least thirty (30) days prior to the filing of the statement of resignation written notice of the resignation of the registered agent was sent to each represented entity for which the registered agent is resigning as registered agent. This notice shall be addressed and delivered to the last known principal office of each represented entity identified in the statement. The agent shall indicate in the statement each name and address to which the notice was sent. After receipt of the notice of resignation of its registered agent, the represented entity for which the registered agent was acting shall obtain and designate a registered agent.

   <p>
    For purposes of this subsection, the “last known principal office” of the represented entity shall be the address of the entity on file with the Secretary of State’s office or the address most recently supplied to the agent by the entity, whichever is more current, or the actual principal office address if the actual address is known to the agent.

    Service of process on entities.

   <p>
    A registered agent is an agent of the represented entity authorized to receive service of any process, notice, or demand required or permitted by law to be served on the entity.
   </p>
   <p>
    If an entity that previously filed a registered agent filing with the Secretary of State no longer has a registered agent, or if its registered agent cannot with reasonable diligence be served, the governors of the entity will be treated as the entity’s agent for service of process who may be served pursuant to the provisions of the Mississippi Rules of Civil Procedure. The names of the governors and the address of the principal office may be as shown in the most recent annual report filed with the Secretary of State. If the governors of the entity cannot with reasonable diligence be served, service of process against the entity shall be upon the Secretary of State in accordance with the Mississippi Rules of Civil Procedure.
   </p>
   <p>
    If notice or demand cannot be made on an entity pursuant to subsection (a) or (b) of this section, notice or demand may be made by handing a copy to the manager or other individual in charge of any regular place of business or activity of the entity.
   </p>
   <p>
    Notice or demand on a registered agent must be in the form of a written document, except that notice or demand may be made on a commercial registered agent in such other forms of a record, and subject to such requirements as the agent has stated from time to time in its listing under Section 79-35-6 that it will accept.
   </p>
   <p>
    Service of process, notice, or demand may be perfected by any other means prescribed by law other than this chapter, including provisions in the organic entity laws that provide for service of process on the Secretary of State in the event that registration of an organic entity has been canceled, withdrawn or revoked or the domestic organic entity has been administratively dissolved or voluntarily dissolved under the applicable organic entity statute.

    Registered Agents Act effectively makes the location of a corporation’s registered agent irrelevant to the venue analysis; because the Registered Agents Act excludes consideration of the location of a corporation’s registered agent from the question of venue, the Mississippi Consumer Protection Act’s venue statute provides no choice of venue for foreign corporations.

    Registered Agents Act overruled Penn Nat’l Gaming, Inc. v. Ratliff, 954 So. 2d 427 (Miss. 2007) and its holding that a non-resident defendant “resides” in the county where its agent for service of process is located; as the statute provides, the address of a registered agent does not determine venue.

    General venue statute for chancery court did not apply in the State’s action against pharmaceutical manufacturers because the location of a foreign corporation’s registered agent was irrelevant to determine venue; because the general venue statute for chancery court did not apply, and the general venue statute provided criteria that did not rely on the location of a registered agent, the trial court’s reliance on the general venue state was appropriate.

If a plan of conversion is filed as provided in this subsection, references in this chapter to a statement of conversion refer to the plan of conversion filed under this subsection” and redesignated the remaining subsections accordingly.

    When a conversion becomes effective, a foreign entity that is the converted entity may be served with process in this state for the collection and enforcement of any of its debts, obligations, and other liabilities in accordance with applicable law.

   <p>
    If the converting entity is a registered foreign entity, its registration to do business in this state is amended to reflect its new status when the conversion becomes effective.
