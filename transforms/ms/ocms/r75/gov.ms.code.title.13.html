     <p>
      Husbands and wives may be introduced by each other as witnesses in all cases, civil or criminal, and shall be competent witnesses in their own behalf, as against each other, in all controversies between them. Either spouse is a competent witness and may be compelled to testify against the other in any criminal prosecution of either husband or wife for a criminal act against any child, for contributing to the neglect or delinquency of a child, or desertion or nonsupport of children under the age of sixteen (16) years, or abandonment of children. But in all other instances where either of them is a party litigant the other shall not be competent as a witness and shall not be required to answer interrogatories or to make discovery of any matters involved in any such other instances without the consent of both.

   In a divorce case, the chancellor did not err in allowing the husband’s previous wife to testify about the reason for her divorce, as it was relevant to the husband’s character and to child custody. She did not testify to any confidential communications under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t13c01s13-1-5" target="_self">13-1-5</a></cite> or Miss. R. Evid. 504. McNeese v.

   Since the privilege protected by §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t13c01s13-1-5" target="_self">13-1-5</a></cite> extends only to communications which are intended to be confidential, the presence of another person, even a family member, is deemed to mean that the communication was not intended to be confidential.

      <p>
       In a prosecution for murder or manslaughter, the deceased is in no sense a party to the suit, and the wife of deceased was competent to testify as to what occurred at the scene of the killing, and as to statements made by others, or statements made in the presence of others, bearing on the material issues in controversy. McBride v. State, 188 Miss. 620, 196 So. 633, 1940 Miss. LEXIS 83 (Miss. 1940).

       In suit against husband and wife and their grantee to set aside, as fraudulent, conveyance of homestead owned by wife and to enforce judgment against husband and wife, neither husband nor wife could be called as an adverse witness, though homestead was owned by wife, since husband had interest in homestead, and any material evidence that either would give would affect interest of both.

       Because defense counsel failed to lodge an objection to the husband’s testimony against defendant at trial, defendant’s claim was barred from review. Sandlin v. State, 156 So.3d 813, 2013 Miss. LEXIS 538 (Miss. 2013).
      </p>
      <p>
       In defendant’s trial for exploitation of children, defendant’s wife was not incompetent to testify against defendant because the privilege under Miss. R. Evid. 601(a)(2) and Miss. R. Evid. 504(d) did not apply, as defendant was being prosecuted for a criminal act against a child. Hood v. State, 17 So.3d 548, 2009 Miss. LEXIS 379 (Miss. 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Defendant’s marriage to his first wife ended in May 2002 when, upon the first wife’s petition, the Florida court declared that defendant died on August 13, 1998, in the Gulf of Mexico; as such, she was his ex-wife at the time of the trial and, therefore, competent to testify against him, and the information to which she testified was not privileged communication, so Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t13c01s13-1-5" target="_self">13-1-5</a></cite> did not apply to exclude her testimony. Butt v. State, 986 So. 2d 981, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 783 (Miss. Ct. App. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although testimony by third party as to substance of party’s conversation with criminal defendant’s spouse is prohibited, testimony as to fact that conversation with spouse took place is not. Davis v. State, 472 So. 2d 428, 1985 Miss. LEXIS 2119 (Miss. 1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   In a prosecution for child abuse, the trial court properly allowed defendant’s wife to testify against him, and to be cross-examined by the district attorney as an adverse witness, since §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t13c01s13-1-5" target="_self">13-1-5</a></cite> provides no spousal immunity in a prosecution for child abuse. Shelton v. State, 445 So. 2d 844, 1984 Miss. LEXIS 1625 (Miss. 1984).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   In a prosecution for aggravated assault by a wife against her husband, there was no error in compelling the husband to testify against his wife, even though this was against his wishes, where the husband was introduced as a witness by the State of Mississippi, not by his spouse, and the charge did not concern a criminal act against a child, notwithstanding §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t13c01s13-1-5" target="_self">13-1-5</a></cite>. Stubbs v. State, 441 So. 2d 1386, 1983 Miss. LEXIS 3072 (Miss. 1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a prosecution for manslaughter by culpable negligence the court improperly admitted statements made by defendant’s wife to an officer outside the defendant’s presence, where such testimony was hearsay and violated the confidential communication privilege between husband and wife. Bayse v. State, 420 So. 2d 1050, 1982 Miss. LEXIS 2176 (Miss. 1982).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a prosecution for murder, it was error to permit the state to cross-examine the defendant about the presence of his wife at the scene of the crime where the defense had successfully objected to the testimony of the wife when she had been called to the stand by the state. Owens v. State, 405 So. 2d 692, 1981 Miss. LEXIS 2279 (Miss. 1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       In the prosecution of the defendant for the murder of his wife’s father, the trial court properly permitted the wife to testify against the defendant where the nearly simultaneous assault upon the wife by her husband and his threat to kill her “next” on the occasion that he shot and killed her father was such a controversy between them as to make her a competent witness when she was willing to testify. Maiben v. State, 405 So. 2d 87, 1981 Miss. LEXIS 2246 (Miss. 1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a manslaughter prosecution based upon a death arising from child abuse, the child’s mother could not be compelled to testify against her husband. Tapp v. State, 347 So. 2d 974, 1977 Miss. LEXIS 2062 (Miss. 1977).
      </p>
      <p>
       A wife is a competent witness in the prosecution of her husband for crimes involving personal violence against their child. Merritt v. State, 339 So. 2d 1366, 1976 Miss. LEXIS 1696 (Miss. 1976).
      </p>
      <p>
       Peace officer’s testimony as to statements against accused husband’s interest made in his presence by accused’s wife was inadmissible, both as hearsay and as a violation of this section [Code 1942, § 1689]. Caldwell v. State, 194 So. 2d 878, 1967 Miss. LEXIS 1419 (Miss. 1967).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a criminal trial the defendant’s wife could not testify against him without the consent of both. Wallace v. State, 254 Miss. 944, 183 So. 2d 525, 1966 Miss. LEXIS 1590 (Miss. 1966).
      </p>
      <p>
       Under this section [Code 1942, § 1689] a wife is a competent witness before the grand jury investigating a charge that her husband had incestuous relations with their minor daughter, and an indictment returned against the husband is not void. Graham v. State, 250 Miss. 816, 168 So. 2d 496, 1964 Miss. LEXIS 507 (Miss. 1964).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where prosecutor erroneously called defendant’s estranged wife to the witness stand causing defendant to object in presence of the jury to her competency as witness against him, defendant was not entitled to reversal since he made no motion for a mistrial at time of trial. Blackwell v. State, 44 So. 2d 409, 1950 Miss. LEXIS 457 (Miss. 1950).
      </p>
      <p>
       In criminal prosecution against husband for unlawful possession of intoxicating liquor, it is improper for prosecution to call defendant’s wife and offer her as witness against him. Outlaw v. State, 208 Miss. 13, 43 So. 2d 661, 1949 Miss. LEXIS 402 (Miss. 1949).
      </p>
      <p>
       Wife is incompetent as witness against husband in prosecution for unlawful possession of intoxicating liquor unless both she and her husband consent, and when case is close it is prejudicial error for prosecution to ask defendant and court to require answer as to whether defendant objected to wife’s testifying for state, particularly where statement of court impliedly left it entirely to the husband to consent or object. Outlaw v. State, 208 Miss. 13, 43 So. 2d 661, 1949 Miss. LEXIS 402 (Miss. 1949).
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
       Denial by court of motion for preliminary hearing on question of competency of state’s witness to testify in forgery prosecution against accused claiming to be common-law wife of witness is prejudicial error. Wilson v. State, 204 Miss. 111, 37 So. 2d 19, 1948 Miss. LEXIS 348 (Miss. 1948).
      </p>
      <p>
       Introduction in prosecution for bigamy of defendant’s first wife who was sworn but withdrawn before testifying, was harmless error, where guilt of accused was fully established by other evidence. Bryant v. State, 179 Miss. 739, 176 So. 590, 1937 Miss. LEXIS 67 (Miss. 1937).
      </p>

       Where defendant, in a prosecution for neglecting to provide for his children, attempted to explain why he was separated from wife and consented to wife stating her side of the matter, error if any in permitting wife to testify held not reversible. Clark v. State, 181 Miss. 455, 180 So. 602, 1938 Miss. LEXIS 87 (Miss. 1938).
      </p>

       In larceny prosecution against husband for taking money belonging to the wife, permitting wife to testify was not reversible error, where objection to her competency was not made before reception of testimony. Huff v. State, 176 Miss. 443, 169 So. 839, 1936 Miss. LEXIS 153 (Miss. 1936).

       In a murder prosecution, the state is not entitled to an instruction regarding the defendant’s failure to call his wife to the stand. Simpson v. State, 497 So. 2d 424, 1986 Miss. LEXIS 2724 (Miss. 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       At trial of murder charge to which defendant’s sole defense was self-defense, remarks by prosecutor, in closing argument, that the only reason defendant married his wife because he wanted to marry the only eyewitness to the murder he had committed, constituted an impermissible comment upon defendant’s failure to call his wife to testify, and the trial court’s refusal to sustain objections to such remarks was reversible error. Simpson v. State, 497 So. 2d 424, 1986 Miss. LEXIS 2724 (Miss. 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       General rule that an unfavorable inference may be indulged against a party who fails to produce material and necessary testimony which is within his power to control did not apply in a case where the material witness in question was wife of the party, and remark made by appellee’s counsel during summation with reference to the failure of the appellant to call his wife to testify required reversal. Daniels v. Beeson, 312 So. 2d 441, 1975 Miss. LEXIS 1643 (Miss. 1975).
      </p>
      <p>
       Assignment of error that state was permitted to ask accused’s wife if she had testified at the preliminary trial and to make comment on such failure, without basis in record, will not be considered on appeal. Higgins v. State, 120 Miss. 823, 83 So. 245, 1919 Miss. LEXIS 134 (Miss. 1919).

       Prosecuting attorney’s comment on failure of accused to call wife as witness, error. Smith v. State, 112 Miss. 802, 73 So. 793, 1916 Miss. LEXIS 180 (Miss. 1916), overruled,

       Asking accused on cross-examination if wife would testify and if he would object to her testimony, improper but not reversible error. Carter v. State, 99 Miss. 435, 54 So. 734, 1911 Miss. LEXIS 189 (Miss. 1911).

       The failure of the husband to call his wife as a witness for him in a criminal case is not a proper subject of comment by counsel. Johnson v. State, 63 Miss. 313, 1885 Miss. LEXIS 67 (Miss. 1885); Cole v. State, 75 Miss. 142, 21 So. 706, 1897 Miss. LEXIS 90 (Miss. 1897).

       The court did not err when it admitted a pistol and jewelry into evidence, notwithstanding that those items were obtained by virtue of information obtained from the defendant’s wife; this section, insofar as it relates to a criminal prosecution, limits itself to the proper conduct of the trial itself and does not purport to regulate or restrict the conduct of police officers in an ongoing criminal investigation. Clunan v. State, 736 So. 2d 1078, 1999 Miss. App. LEXIS 75 (Miss. Ct. App. 1999).

   There was no violation of the statute concerning spousal competency, §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t13c01s13-1-5" target="_self">13-1-5</a></cite>, or the evidence rule concerning the husband-wife privilege, Rule 504, Miss. R. Ev., where a defendant’s wife told the police where to locate certain items which were subsequently used as physical evidence in the prosecution of the defendant for capital murder committed during the commission of a robbery, since the location of the items did not fall within any protected class of communication, and no out-of-court statements or trial testimony of the wife was admitted against the defendant. Ladner v. State, 584 So. 2d 743, 1991 Miss. LEXIS 434 (Miss.), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">502 U.S. 1015</cite>, <cite class="s_court">112 S. Ct. 663</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">116 L.

      </p>
      <p>
       Although the intended victim of an attempted murder could testify that he was informed of the intended crime, it was reversible error to permit him to testify, over objection, to telephone conversations initiated by the defendant’s wife wherein she related to him the major details of the plot by her husband and others to take his life. Ford v. State, 218 So. 2d 731, 1969 Miss. LEXIS 1616 (Miss. 1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       Admission of statement made by defendant’s wife to witness in prosecution for murder that “he has killed Marvin and fixing to kill –,” was not prejudicial error where defendant admitted the killing. Harris v. State, 209 Miss. 141, 46 So. 2d 91, 1950 Miss. LEXIS 372 (Miss. 1950).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although wife’s letter to the prosecuting witness in a case of assault with intent to murder was privileged in the absence of a waiver by both husband and wife, the defendant could not set up its admission as error where its contents were not prejudicial to the defendant. Martin v. State, 203 Miss. 187, 33 So. 2d 825, 1948 Miss. LEXIS 249 (Miss. 1948).

       No statement made by husband either as a witness or otherwise can be used against the wife in any litigation to which she is a party, unless the husband was acting as the authorized agent of the wife. Gunter v. Reeves, 198 Miss. 31, 21 So. 2d 468, 1945 Miss. LEXIS 166 (Miss. 1945).
      </p>
      <p>
       Rule that no statement made by husband can be used against the wife in a litigation to which she is a party is inapplicable so far as statement or admission is to explain the conduct of a third person. Gunter v. Reeves, 198 Miss. 31, 21 So. 2d 468, 1945 Miss. LEXIS 166 (Miss. 1945).
      </p>
      <p>
       Testimony of a third person in a murder prosecution as to statement made by defendant’s wife to the defendant was incompetent and prejudicial to the defendant, since the wife herself was incompetent to testify against her husband under this section [Code 1942, § 1689]. Smith v. State, 193 Miss. 474, 10 So. 2d 352, 1942 Miss. LEXIS 139 (Miss. 1942).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where wife testified against husband in larceny prosecution without objection, court’s denial of defendant’s motion made, at conclusion of State’s evidence, on ground that evidence was not sufficient to make out offense, held not reversible error, since court was not required to separate objectionable evidence from evidence which was free from objection. Huff v. State, 176 Miss. 443, 169 So. 839, 1936 Miss. LEXIS 153 (Miss. 1936).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence of charges made by wife against husband accusing him of crime not admissible as she could not testify that she made the accusation. Pearson v. State, 97 Miss. 841, 53 So. 689, 1910 Miss. LEXIS 315 (Miss. 1910).

       Criminal statute and rule of evidence rendering convicted perjurer incompetent to testify in criminal proceeding violated provision of state constitution entitling defendant to compulsory process, as evidentiary rule gave district attorney discretion as to whether to render particular witness incompetent by prosecuting him for perjury or preserve his competence by declining to prosecute known perjury. Fuselier v. State, 702 So. 2d 388, 1997 Miss. LEXIS 529 (Miss. 1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       A state’s witness was not incompetent to testify at a capital murder trial on the basis that he was a conceded perjurer where he had not been convicted of perjury. White v. State, 532 So. 2d 1207, 1988 Miss. LEXIS 365 (Miss. 1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       In ruling on the admissibility of a prior conviction for impeachment purposes, a trial judge must make a determination that the probative value outweighs the prejudicial effect of the evidence on the record, and should articulate the reasons for his findings. As a framework for articulating the court’s determination on the record, the judge should consider the impeachment value of the crime, the point in time of the conviction and the witness’s subsequent history, the similarity of the past crime and the charged crime, the importance of the defendant’s testimony, and the centrality of the credibility issue. Johnson v. State, 525 So. 2d 809, 1988 Miss. LEXIS 238 (Miss. 1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       Under law preceding adoption of new Mississippi Rules of Evidence as of January 1, 1986, driving under influence of alcohol was misdemeanor of sufficient gravity that conviction thereof could be used to impeach witness. Wetz v. State, 503 So. 2d 803, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2362 (Miss. 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant charged with armed robbery is denied fair trial by introduction of detail surrounding prior conviction and evidence of other crimes not resulting in convictions; error may be raised on appeal notwithstanding defendant’s failure to object at time of trial where development of inadmissible detail is lengthy and repetitious. Gallion v. State, 469 So. 2d 1247, 1985 Miss. LEXIS 2096 (Miss. 1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   In a prosecution for burglary and theft, the prosecutor was properly allowed to specify each crime that defendant had been convicted of prior to trial, since any felony may be used to impeach the testimony of a witness under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t13c01s13-1-11" target="_self">13-1-11</a></cite>. Johnson v. State, 452 So. 2d 850, 1984 Miss. LEXIS 1764 (Miss. 1984), but see McCarty v. State, 554 So. 2d 909, 1989 Miss. LEXIS 499 (Miss. 1989).

   Under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t13c01s13-1-11" target="_self">13-1-11</a></cite>, defendant’s prior convictions were properly introduced to impeach him. Burns v. State, 438 So. 2d 1347, 1983 Miss. LEXIS 2934 (Miss. 1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a prosecution for the sale of marijuana, the trial court committed reversible error in limiting the impeachment of the state’s undercover informant to questions about the latter’s reputation for truth and veracity and excluding any cross-examination on the informant’s prior convictions. Valentine v. State, 396 So. 2d 15, 1981 Miss. LEXIS 1977 (Miss. 1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       The trial court in an armed robbery prosecution erred in refusing to allow defense counsel to question an accomplice-prosecution witness concerning convictions of misdemeanors, since a witness’ credibility may be impeached by evidence of misdemeanors as well as infamous crimes; the trial court also erred in refusing to permit defense counsel to cross-examine another witness concerning the nature of the felonies of which he had previously been convicted. Sanders v. State, 352 So. 2d 822, 1977 Miss. LEXIS 1983 (Miss. 1977).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the defendant admitted on direct examination that he had been previously convicted of a crime this did not foreclose the prosecution from cross-examining him on this point. Wells v. State, 288 So. 2d 860, 1974 Miss. LEXIS 1877 (Miss. 1974).
      </p>
      <p>
       The jury in a robbery case may take into consideration admitted convictions of defendants testifying as witnesses of fighting, disorderly conduct, assault and battery, larceny, vagrancy, resisting arrest, and breaking jail. Parrish v. State, 237 Miss. 37, 112 So. 2d 548, 1959 Miss. LEXIS 446 (Miss. 1959).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a prosecution for the sale of intoxicating liquors, since defendant’s admission, upon cross-examination, that on the day prior to the date of the alleged offense he had been convicted of possessing liquor went to defendant’s credibility as a witness, and the loss or impairment of credibility affected both defendant’s character and reputation, the trial court committed reversible error in refusing to instruct that the jury was required to believe from the evidence, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant made the particular sale of liquor, and that they were not warranted in convicting him for the sale merely because of his former conviction of possessing liquor and the probable attendant character and reputation arising therefrom. Hassell v. State, 229 Miss. 824, 92 So. 2d 194, 1957 Miss. LEXIS 330 (Miss. 1957).
      </p>
      <p>
       At common law a person convicted of most felonies was disqualified as a witness, but the statute removes this disqualification and conviction now may be used to impeach his credibility and that is a question for the jury. Wetzel v. State, 225 Miss. 450, 76 So. 2d 188, 76 So. 2d 194, 76 So. 2d 846, 78 So. 2d 774, 84 So. 2d 429, 1954 Miss. LEXIS 607, 1954 Miss. LEXIS 608, 1955 Miss. LEXIS 601, 1955 Miss. LEXIS 602, 1956 Miss. LEXIS 396, 1957 Miss. LEXIS 583 (Miss. 1957).
      </p>
      <p>
       Conviction of perjury, though creating a general disqualification to testify at common law and in Mississippi, goes only to the convict’s credit in the federal court, at least when the conviction was under the federal statute punishing perjury. Firemen's Mut. Ins. Co. v. Aponaug Mfg. Co., 149 F.2d 359, 1945 U.S. App. LEXIS 2597 (5th Cir. Miss. 1945).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence of conviction for offense except perjury and subornation of perjury is admissible to impeach the credibility of witness. Brister v. Dunaway, 149 Miss. 5, 115 So. 36, 1927 Miss. LEXIS 105 (Miss. 1927).
      </p>
      <p>
       Accused testifying in his own behalf may be impeached on cross-examination by proof of prior convictions of crimes or misdemeanors. Williams v. State, 87 Miss. 373, 39 So. 1006, 1905 Miss. LEXIS 151 (Miss. 1905).
      </p>
      <p>
       Under the statute a convicted principal may testify against his accessory. Keithler v. State, 18 Miss. 192, 1848 Miss. LEXIS 74 (Miss. 1848).

      <p>
       A trial court did not err in refusing to permit cross-examination of a witness concerning her use of marijuana and involvement in a robbery since specific instances of conduct may be used to attack the credibility of a witness on cross-examination only if probative of truthfulness or untruthfulness, and neither robbery nor marijuana use were probative of the witness’ character for truthfulness or untruthfulness. Johnston v. State, 618 So. 2d 90, 1993 Miss. LEXIS 181 (Miss. 1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       At a hearing on a former wife’s petition to hold her former husband in contempt for failure to pay child support, the wife could not invoke her right against self-incrimination to shield herself from questions on cross-examination as to whether she maintained that the husband had an account at a particular bank, where the wife had voluntarily taken the stand on direct examination and unequivocally identified the signature on the bank account as the husband’s. A party may not testify as to material facts in proceedings which he or she initiated, and later invoke the privilege against self-incrimination on those same matters. Thus, when the wife voluntarily took the stand and testified to material matters on direct examination, she also waived her right against self-incrimination. Wallace v. Jones, 572 So. 2d 371, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 565 (Miss. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although a judge has wide discretionary control over the extent of cross-examination, the arbitrary curtailment upon a proper subject of cross-examination may be grounds for reversal. Thus, denial of a defendant’s right to a broad and extensive cross-examination of a prosecution witness substantially affected the defendant’s rights where the prosecution’s evidence was largely circumstantial, with the exception of that witness. Sayles v. State, 552 So. 2d 1383, 1989 Miss. LEXIS 472 (Miss. 1989).
      </p>
      <p>
       A defendant should have been permitted to cross-examine a prosecution witness as to an alleged affair between the defendant and the witness’ wife, even though the affair took place approximately 2 to 5 years prior to the trial; it was still likely that the witness could or would have a grudge against the defendant, and this question should have been determined by the jury. Sayles v. State, 552 So. 2d 1383, 1989 Miss. LEXIS 472 (Miss. 1989).
      </p>
      <p>
       Bias of mother, who had not testified at trial, was not allowed to be established, although bias, motive, or interest are always material and may be proven by extrinsic evidence, because fact that mother, standing alone, had extreme bias and motive to lie was too remote to impeach credibility of children. Cantrell v. State, 507 So. 2d 325, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2478 (Miss. 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       When witness voluntarily took the stand in a perjury trial and testified on behalf of the defendant therein as to the truthfulness of witness’ brother’s statements concerning a murder, to which witness had pled guilty and had been sentenced, witness waived his Fifth Amendment right and was subject to cross-examination on all relevant and material matters. Hentz v. State, 496 So. 2d 668, 1986 Miss. LEXIS 2712 (Miss. 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       Requiring witness, who had already pled guilty to the murder, to answer questions concerning that murder did not expose witness to prosecution for the murder and did not infringe upon his Fifth Amendment rights, where the witness’ petition for writ of habeas corpus or, in the alternative, petition to withdraw his guilty plea, came months after the term of court expired wherein he had pled and sentence had been entered. Hentz v. State, 496 So. 2d 668, 1986 Miss. LEXIS 2712 (Miss. 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       In prosecution for false pretenses by delivery of a bad check, it was not error for the state to cross-examine a witness who had once been married to defendant and to whom defendant had been furnishing child support. Parker v. State, 484 So. 2d 1033, 1986 Miss. LEXIS 2756 (Miss. 1986).

   Letters written by defendant to relatives and page from manuscript of book about defendant’s life, which expressed defendant’s hostile views toward blacks and civil rights leaders and proclaimed his involvement in the Ku Klux Klan, were relevant to establish defendant’s motive for killing black leader of civil rights organization, and more probative on such issue than prejudicial, especially as there was no evidence that defendant had ever met victim. De La Beckwith v. State, 707 So. 2d 547, 1997 Miss. LEXIS 749 (Miss. 1997), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">525 U.S. 880</cite>, <cite class="s_court">119 S. Ct. 187</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">142 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 153, 1998 U.S. LEXIS 5751 (U.S. 1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Testimony of federal agency informant who infiltrated Ku Klux Klan that defendant, a Klan member, discussed “selective killings” as a “partial solution to the right wing’s problem,” and then said that “he would never ask anyone to do anything that he hadn’t already done himself,” was relevant to show that defendant had violent tendencies towards his perceived political and social enemies, and therefore, testimony was admissible in prosecution for murder of black leader of civil rights organization. De La Beckwith v. State, 707 So. 2d 547, 1997 Miss. LEXIS 749 (Miss. 1997), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">525 U.S. 880</cite>, <cite class="s_court">119 S.

      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Impeachment of former police officer through use of officer’s grand jury testimony was not error in murder prosecution; grand jury testimony was transcribed from tape recording, the transcript was provided to the defense, and the tape recording was offered to the defense. De La Beckwith v. State, 707 So. 2d 547, 1997 Miss. LEXIS 749 (Miss. 1997), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">525 U.S. 880</cite>, <cite class="s_court">119 S.

      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court improperly limited defendant’s right to testify and to cross-examine and impeach certain witnesses; trial court did not allow defendant to cross-examine co-indictee concerning his interest and bias in case by showing threats co-indictee made against defendant’s other witnesses; defendant also was prevented from questioning co-indictee regarding possible promises of leniency from prosecution in return for his testimony against defendant; trial court also improperly denied defendant opportunity to present witness to impeach co-indictee’s denial of threats against potential witnesses for defendant, on basis that proper predicate had not been laid for impeachment, where co-indictee had been asked if he threatened witness and he denied it; moreover, trial court sustained objections during co-indictee’s questioning which for all practical purposes prevented laying of full and proper predicate. Hill v. State, 512 So. 2d 883, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2782 (Miss. 1987).

       In a prosecution for sexual battery, the trial court should have granted the defendant’s motion in limine to preclude admission, for impeachment use pursuant to Rule 609, Miss. R. Ev., of his prior conviction of touching a child for lustful purposes, even though a social worker testified that a general characteristic of pedophiles is an inability to be truthful, since admission of the prior conviction would have been manifestly prejudicial and mere reference to the conviction during the trial would have prejudiced the jury irreparably. Hopkins v. State, 639 So. 2d 1247, 1993 Miss. LEXIS 486 (Miss. 1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       A prior arson conviction might be admissible for impeachment purposes as a crime involving dishonesty or false statement in situations, for example, where the defendant burned a building as part of a scheme to defraud an insurance company. However, where an arson conviction was admitted for impeachment purposes and the prosecution failed to offer prima facie evidence that the arson involved fraud, dishonesty, false statement or other elements suggesting a propensity for lying, the case would be reversed and remanded for a new trial on all issues. McInnis v. State, 527 So. 2d 84, 1988 Miss. LEXIS 248 (Miss. 1988), overruled in part, White v. State, 785 So. 2d 1059, 2001 Miss. LEXIS 44 (Miss. 2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       The decision whether to give an advance ruling on the admissibility of prior convictions for impeachment purposes is discretionary with the trial judge. McInnis v. State, 527 So. 2d 84, 1988 Miss. LEXIS 248 (Miss. 1988), overruled in part, White v. State, 785 So. 2d 1059, 2001 Miss. LEXIS 44 (Miss. 2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       In ruling on the admissibility of a prior conviction for impeachment purposes, a trial judge must make a determination that the probative value outweighs the prejudicial effect of the evidence on the record, and should articulate the reasons for his findings. As a framework for articulating the court’s determination on the record, the judge should consider the impeachment value of the crime, the point in time of the conviction and the witness’s subsequent history, the similarity of the past crime and the charged crime, the importance of the defendant’s testimony, and the centrality of the credibility issue. Johnson v. State, 525 So. 2d 809, 1988 Miss. LEXIS 238 (Miss. 1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       Prosecutor’s question concerning prior conviction, asking whether that crime had involved breaking “in on a little 12-year old girl,” was improper because, while accused who has taken stand on his own behalf may be questioned regarding previous convictions, defendant may not be asked to divulge any details of convictions including whether or not he served time for conviction; asking of question did not constitute reversible error, because upon defense objection, jury was instructed to ignore question and this admonition came before defendant could answer. Williams v. State, 512 So. 2d 666, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2645 (Miss. 1987).

       Trial court erred in refusing to allow the defense counsel to ask a prosecution witness if he had ever been convicted of a crime or misdemeanor, and such error was not harmless as the credibility of the witness was the real issue for the jury to determine in the case.

       Even if defendant’s reputation for peace and violence was properly put in issue when defense counsel in effect inquired into the reputation of the defendant, nevertheless the district attorney went too far a field in attempting to contradict the testimony as to the good reputation of the defendant for peace and violence and to bring out details of crimes for which defendant had not even been indicted, such as 4 other assaults, an incident in which defendant allegedly killed a man, and an incident in which he also killed a baby with a stray shot.

   The right to cross-examine a defendant with reference to his former convictions in order to impeach or discredit his testimony is limited to the fact that the defendant was convicted and does not include the right to go into the details of the former crime, nor into the punishment given as a result of the conviction. Murray v. State, 266 So. 2d 139, 1972 Miss. LEXIS 1388 (Miss. 1972), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">411 U.S. 907</cite>, <cite class="s_court">93 S. Ct. 1534</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">36 L.

       Where, after the defendant had admitted one previous conviction, and the prosecutor had inferred that the defendant had been absent without official leave and had been convicted of crimes in three different states, the prosecutor responded to the defense statement that if the prosecution had any evidence of other convictions they should produce it in the proper manner, replied before the jury, “I will be glad to produce it,” without thereafter producing a scintilla of evidence of other convictions, prejudicial error was committed. Johns v. State, 255 So. 2d 322, 1971 Miss. LEXIS 1287 (Miss. 1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       Under this section [Code 1942, § 1693] the state may show that the defendant had been convicted of criminal offenses for the purpose of discrediting him as a witness, provided that the details of the same are not given. Benedetti v. State, 249 So. 2d 671, 1971 Miss. LEXIS 1179 (Miss. 1971).

      <p>
       In a prosecution of a justice of the peace for embezzlement, the district attorney’s cross-examination of the defendant as to the number of times he had been criticized by the grand jury constituted reversible error, since, while the section [Code 1942, § 1693] permits a cross-examination of a defendant as to convictions, it never permits cross-examination as to indictments and certainly not as to censures by the grand jury, which are hearsay in nature and can only be enlisted for the purpose of degrading and prejudicing the defendant in the eyes of the jury. Interior Contractors, Inc. v. Western Waterproofing Co., 233 So. 2d 829, 1970 Miss. LEXIS 1687 (Miss. 1970).
      </p>
      <p>
       While the district attorney is not permitted to question a defendant about details of prior convictions, where a defendant in response to a question as to prior convictions, testified that he had been convicted of traffic violations and burglary, and that he had been sentenced to the penitentiary and had been released on parole, the district attorney was authorized, by this section [Code 1942, § 1693], to cross-examine the defendant about former offenses not mentioned on direct testimony, which questioning did not extend to details of convictions. Mangrum v. State, 232 So. 2d 703, 1970 Miss. LEXIS 1634 (Miss. 1970).

       Exclusion of certificates of conviction of adverse witnesses is not error where they admit having been convicted. Matthews v. State, 243 Miss. 568, 139 So. 2d 386, 1962 Miss. LEXIS 377 (Miss. 1962).

       Where the accused took the stand as a witness in a prosecution for second degree arson, he thereby subjected himself to cross-examination, and made competent his own testimony, or any other admissible evidence, tending to establish his former conviction of crimes.

       Error of the lower court in permitting the district attorney in prosecution for murder, over objection, to cross-examine the accused in regard to convictions while in the military service and in regard to the type of discharge he received from the military service, was harmless inasmuch as the accused freely and voluntarily confessed to a state of facts making out a clear case of murder and no question was raised in the record as to the confession not being entirely free and voluntary.

       At common law a person convicted of most felonies was disqualified as a witness, but the statute removes this disqualification and conviction now may be used to impeach his credibility.

       In prosecution for murder where the defendant made no objection to prosecutor’s cross-examination of five defense witnesses concerning prior conviction, except as to one question asked the defendant, and that objection was properly sustained and where appellant made no motion for a mistrial, even if there was an error in cross-examination the accused failed to preserve that point on appeal. Wetzel v. State, 225 Miss. 450, 76 So. 2d 188, 76 So. 2d 194, 76 So. 2d 846, 78 So. 2d 774, 84 So. 2d 429, 1954 Miss. LEXIS 607, 1954 Miss. LEXIS 608, 1955 Miss. LEXIS 601, 1955 Miss.

       Examination of a witness touching his conviction of a crime may extend to misdemeanors as well as to infamous crimes and the record of conviction of a misdemeanor is admissible to impeach the veracity of a witness.

      </p>
      <p>
       In a prosecution for unlawful sale of intoxicating liquors, where the accused denied that he was ever convicted of a crime, it was an error to allow admission in evidence of a justice of peace court docket which showed only that the accused was charged with a crime. Breland v. State, 221 Miss. 371, 73 So. 2d 267, 1954 Miss. LEXIS 547 (Miss. 1954).

       In prosecution for assault and battery with intent to kill, defendant’s prior conviction of drunkenness was competent evidence against him when both sides, without objection, entered upon proof of fact whether he was drunk or drinking on night of crime, and defendant took stand as witness, as his prior conviction of crime was competent as bearing upon weight of his testimony and his credibility as witness. Phillips v. State, 43 So. 2d 208 (Miss. 1949).
      </p>

       It is competent for state to question defendant in criminal prosecution in regard to previous convictions of crime when accused has taken witness stand in his own behalf. Scarbrough v. State, 204 Miss. 487, 37 So. 2d 748, 1948 Miss. LEXIS 383 (Miss. 1948).

       In criminal prosecution, it is not competent for state, in presenting its case in chief, to prove that defendant has been convicted or is guilty of other crimes wholly disconnected with, and having no direct bearing on, case under investigation.

      </p>
      <p>
       Where the defendant on trial for burglary, in answer to a question on direct examination, stated that he had previously been convicted of wilful trespass, it was prejudicial error for the prosecuting attorney to make further inquiries for the purpose of showing that the conviction had followed withdrawal of a plea of guilty to a greater offense, wholly disconnected with the charge on which defendant was being tried.

      </p>
      <p>
       Under this section [Code 1942, § 1693], if the defendant, in a murder prosecution, offers himself as a witness, then proof of the fact that he has been previously convicted of a crime, but not the extent of the punishment imposed, would be competent to affect his credibility as a witness. Hartfield v. State, 186 Miss. 75, 189 So. 530, 1939 Miss. LEXIS 220 (Miss. 1939).

       Admission, on cross-examination, by party jointly indicted with defendant that, in addition to crime for which he and defendant were being tried, there were indictments pending against him for other offenses, held reversible error where he had not been convicted of those offenses. Graham v. State, 179 So. 340 (Miss. 1938).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where defendant on cross-examination admitted previous conviction of grand larceny, fact that jurors were informed by further cross-examination that defendant had served penitentiary term held not to warrant reversal.

   Defendant was properly precluded from giving impeachment testimony about taped conversations in which state witness allegedly said that district attorney’s office was threatening to revoke probation if he did not testify, where defendant did not tell counsel about conversations until after witness had been excused, thus preventing the laying of proper predicate for impeachment testimony, where defendant made no objection to release of witness, and where defense counsel did not reveal existence of tape pursuant to discovery requirements when trial commenced the next day, but waited until defendant’s testimony to try to elicit that information.

       Trial court improperly limited defendant’s right to testify and to cross-examine and impeach certain witnesses; trial court did not allow defendant to cross-examine co-indictee concerning his interest and bias in case by showing threats co-indictee made against defendant’s other witnesses; defendant also was prevented from questioning co-indictee regarding possible promises of leniency from prosecution in return for his testimony against defendant; trial court also improperly denied defendant opportunity to present witness to impeach co-indictee’s denial of threats against potential witnesses for defendant, on basis that proper predicate had not been laid for impeachment, where co-indictee had been asked if he threatened witness and he denied it; moreover, trial court sustained objections during co-indictee’s questioning which for all practical purposes prevented laying of full and proper predicate.

       Plea of guilty being tantamount to a conviction for purposes of this statute, the credibility as a witness of defendant in a burglary prosecution could properly be impeached by evidence of his prior plea of guilty in an out of state prosecution for forgery, even though sentence had not been imposed and final judgment had not been entered on that plea.

       In seeking to impeach a prosecution witness, defense counsel could not question the witness as to mere charges of the commission of offenses, especially where such charges were pending and the witness’s testimony might incriminate him.

       Before evidence may be received under the other bad acts exception to the primary relevancy rule, the proponent must articulate precisely the evidential hypothesis by which the consequential act may be inferred from the proffered evidence. Houston v. State, 531 So. 2d 598, 1988 Miss. LEXIS 426 (Miss. 1988).

       The certified abstract of a court record showing a defendant’s prior conviction was competent evidence of such conviction and was not rendered incompetent by the fact that the abstract included the punishment inflicted for the prior offense. Lovelace v. State, 410 So. 2d 876, 1982 Miss. LEXIS 1875 (Miss. 1982).

       In a robbery prosecution against a daughter, who had testified that she had grabbed her mother’s metal box containing money and a pistol and fled to prevent the mother from obtaining the pistol, evidence that on several occasions the mother had shot at members of the accused’s family should have been permitted to go to the jury as tending to show the bias and prejudice of the mother, who was a prosecuting witness, even though it was not part of the res gestae. Hardin v. State, 232 Miss. 470, 99 So. 2d 600, 1958 Miss. LEXIS 294 (Miss. 1958).

       Cross examination by district attorney in robbery prosecution of defendant’s witness as to number of times sheriff raided his place and concerning his sales of whisky was incompetent but not reversible error. Ivey v. State, 206 Miss. 734, 40 So. 2d 609, 1949 Miss. LEXIS 297 (Miss. 1949).

       Conviction of crime admissible to impeach veracity of witness only after he has denied conviction. Alabama & V. R. Co. v. Thornhill, 106 Miss. 387, 63 So. 674, 1913 Miss. LEXIS 146 (Miss. 1913), overruled,

       It is proper under this section [Code 1942, § 1693] to ask a witness on cross-examination if he had not confessed to having been a convict in the penitentiary, and his answer may be contradicted. The record of such conviction is only necessary where the object is to show conviction, but if the witness is asked for the purpose of discrediting him the question is competent without the production of the record. Jackson v. State, 75 Miss. 145, 21 So. 707, 1897 Miss. LEXIS 92 (Miss. 1897).

       While undue delay in imposition of punishment for contempt will not be tolerated, withholding imposition of punishment on witness found guilty of direct criminal contempt until the day following the conclusion of the trial did not constitute undue delay.

      <p>
       A judgment which simply stated that witness had been found in contempt 27 times for refusing to answer questions, and had been punished for 6 acts, but did not specify the 6 acts, was not sufficiently clear and explicit to warrant Supreme Court to affirm, annul, reverse, or modify it. Hentz v. State, 496 So. 2d 668, 1986 Miss. LEXIS 2712 (Miss. 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       While contempt proceeding is summary and the judge may act upon that which he personally knows is direct contempt, the judgment of conviction should contain material facts constituting the contempt, and, in rendering the judgment and making up the record, the causes for contempt should be separately stated so as to constitute res judicata. Hentz v. State, 496 So. 2d 668, 1986 Miss. LEXIS 2712 (Miss. 1986).

       In a personal injury action arising from a motor vehicle accident, the plaintiff, by filing suit and submitting evidence on his injuries, waived the physician-patient privilege only to the extent of those injuries and expenses for treatment. Thus, information given to the plaintiff’s treating physician concerning the cause of the accident was privileged. Additionally, the plaintiff did not waive the privilege by answering questions on cross-examination and denying that he had made certain statements regarding the cause of the accident to the treating physician. The testimony of a plaintiff on cross-examination as to communications made to his or her physician is not voluntary so as to constitute a waiver of the physician-patient privilege. Sessums ex rel.

       A grant of letters of administration on an estate is prima facie evidence of the death of a person upon whose estate the administration is granted. Cock v. Abernathy, 77 Miss. 872, 28 So. 18, 1900 Miss. LEXIS 47 (Miss. 1900).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section [Code 1942, § 1698] does not justify the presumption of the death of three infant devisees, who at the time of their departure from their last-known residence in this state, about eleven years before the trial, were of very tender years, the eldest being only seven years old, and who disappeared along with their mother and stepfather, the last named being at the time under apprehension of a criminal prosecution. The presumption of death not arising in such case because of the number and youth of such devisees, their subjection to the will of others and their incapacity to absent themselves from and conceal themselves within the state, the burden of proving their death is on him who asserts it, and is not met by the testimony of one or two witnesses who casually learned that such devisees once lived in a certain town in the state, such witnesses having only slight opportunity of knowing the facts. Manley v. Patterson, 73 Miss. 417, 19 So. 236 (Miss. 1895).
      </p>
      <p>
       The uncontradicted testimony of the mother that the last she ever heard of her son was that ten years before he sailed on board a vessel for a foreign port, and that about five days afterwards there was a storm at sea, and that neither the ship nor anyone on board has ever been heard of since, and that she is satisfied her son is dead, fully establishes the presumption of death authorized by the statute. Learned v. Corley, 43 Miss. 687, 1870 Miss. LEXIS 76 (Miss. 1870), overruled,
   Cole v. Johnson, 53 Miss. 94, 1876 Miss. LEXIS 41 (Miss. 1876).

       Where a woman, more than twenty years after her husband had left her and gone to Arkansas, and, after having been informed by his sister that a letter from a postmaster in Arkansas stated that her husband had been drowned, remarried, without any divorce having been granted, and it was thereafter discovered that her first husband was still living and had also remarried, the woman’s second marriage was invalid, and the heirs of her second husband were entitled, as against her, to the proceeds of an insurance association policy, a bylaw of which association provided that beneficiaries must be related by blood or by marriage, or must be persons upon whom the insured was wholly dependent for a living, notwithstanding she was designated in such policy as beneficiary. Frank v. Frank, 193 Miss. 605, 10 So. 2d 839, 1942 Miss. LEXIS 159 (Miss. 1942).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where woman’s undivorced husband lived openly within state after his release from penitentiary and kept in touch with near relatives living in county in which he had formerly resided, such woman’s subsequent marriage while husband lived held invalid, since inquiry would have disclosed that he was then alive, notwithstanding rumors that he was dead. Watson v. Watson, 177 Miss. 767, 171 So. 701, 1937 Miss. LEXIS 149 (Miss. 1937).
      </p>
      <p>
       The presumption of the death of a husband or wife authorized by the statute will be applied in favor of the validity of a marriage contracted by the abandoned party after the expiration of the seven years. Spears v. Burton, 31 Miss. 547, 1856 Miss. LEXIS 115 (Miss. 1856); Gibson v. State, 38 Miss. 313, 1860 Miss. LEXIS 2 (Miss. 1860).

      <p>
       The presumption of one’s death arising from seven years’ absence without being heard from disappears when proof is made that he was alive within that time. Hill v. United Timber & Lumber Co., 68 So. 2d 420 (Miss. 1953).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section [Code 1942, § 1698] embodies a rule at common law, and under it the presumption of death of a husband arising from seven years of absence without being heard from disappears when proof was made that he was alive within that time. Frank v. Frank, 193 Miss. 605, 10 So. 2d 839, 1942 Miss. LEXIS 159 (Miss. 1942).
      </p>
      <p>
       Statutory presumption of death ends when it is shown that person whose death is in question is, in fact, alive. Watson v. Watson, 177 Miss. 767, 171 So. 701, 1937 Miss. LEXIS 149 (Miss. 1937); Johnson v. Lee, 212 Miss. 603, 55 So. 2d 140, 1951 Miss. LEXIS 489 (Miss. 1951).
      </p>
      <p>
       That person was fugitive from justice held insufficient to rebut statutory presumption of death from absence for 7 years. Parker v. New York Life Ins. Co., 142 Miss. 517, 107 So. 198, 1926 Miss. LEXIS 60 (Miss. 1926).

   Willie v. State, 585 So. 2d 660, 1991 Miss. LEXIS 454 (Miss. 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       Certified copies of sentencing orders were proper proof of prior convictions, sufficient under habitual offender statute, where certification at issue contained attestation that copy was true and correct, and attestation bore seal of court; lack of book and page number were not fatal. Monroe v. State, 515 So. 2d 860, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2764 (Miss. 1987).

      </p>

       In a prosecution for the unlawful possession of a slot machine found upon the accused’s premises during a search by national guardsmen under authority of an executive order, and a search warrant issued by the county judge, it was not error to introduce in evidence a copy of the executive order, certified by the secretary of state, since whatever right, if any, accused had to subpoena witnesses and contradict the facts set forth in the original executive order applied as well to the copy as to the original. Brady v. State, 229 Miss. 677, 91 So. 2d 751, 1957 Miss. LEXIS 314 (Miss. 1957).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section [Code 1942, § 1725] is applicable to the commissioner of public safety and therefore certified copy of orders suspending defendant’s driving license was competent evidence in prosecution for driving a motor vehicle upon a public highway without a driving license. Middleton v. State, 214 Miss. 697, 59 So. 2d 320, 1952 Miss. LEXIS 508 (Miss. 1952).

       In a personal injury action, a truck driver who struck a pedestrian was not negligent as a matter of law by virtue of the fact that he did not see the pedestrian in the highway in time to avoid striking him; the issue of the driver’s negligence was for the jury to decide. Hood v. Oakley, 519 So. 2d 1236, 1988 Miss. LEXIS 158 (Miss. 1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       In an action for damages resulting from an automobile accident, although negligence will not be presumed because the accident and the injury occurred, the accident is a proper circumstance or fact to be considered by the jury in deciding the issue of negligence. Bigelow v. Sports Cars, Ltd., 221 So. 2d 108, 1969 Miss. LEXIS 1492 (Miss. 1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       In an action for damages resulting from an automobile accident, an instruction to the effect that if the rights of the plaintiff were doubtful in the minds of the jury, the jury should find for the defendant, because the burden is upon the plaintiff to prove his case by the greater weight of the believable evidence or the plaintiff has no right to recover, was improper, as leading to the conclusion that the jury was required to believe that the plaintiff must prove his case beyond a reasonable doubt, placing a greater burden of proof on the plaintiff than is required in a civil case. Bigelow v. Sports Cars, Ltd., 221 So. 2d 108, 1969 Miss. LEXIS 1492 (Miss. 1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       While a patrolman or police officer, not an eyewitness to an accident, who investigates the accident shortly after it happens may properly testify as to the matters and things that he finds at the scene, he cannot be allowed to invade the province of the jury by giving his opinion as to how the accident happened. Lynch v. Suthoff, 220 So. 2d 593, 1969 Miss. LEXIS 1464 (Miss. 1969).

       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       Evidence held inadmissible to contradict official map on file in general land office. H. Weston Lumber Co. v. Strahan, 128 Miss. 54, 90 So. 452, 1921 Miss. LEXIS 298 (Miss. 1921).
      </p>
      <p>
       Plaintiff introducing certificates from U. S. Land Office showing his entry of land involved and cancellation of prior entry under which defendants claimed, could bring ejectment. Gilleylen v. Isbel, 119 Miss. 566, 81 So. 161, 1919 Miss. LEXIS 24 (Miss. 1919).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section [Code 1942, § 1744] is only rule of evidence, and establishes only prima facie title which may be defeated by paramount title. Halloway v. Miles, 110 Miss. 532, 70 So. 697, 1915 Miss. LEXIS 78 (Miss. 1915).
      </p>
      <p>
       Plaintiff holding letter or writing signed by register of U. S. Land Office allowing his application to make homestead entry, may maintain ejectment. Methodist Episcopal Camp Ground Ass'n v. Brown, 105 Miss. 313, 62 So. 276, 1913 Miss. LEXIS 207 (Miss. 1913).
      </p>
      <p>
       Receiver’s certificate to one in possession of public lands claiming as homestead constitutes title supporting action for cutting and removing timber. Hiwannee Lumber Co. v. McPhearson, 95 Miss. 589, 49 So. 741, 1909 Miss. LEXIS 291 (Miss. 1909).
      </p>
      <p>
       Grantee of certificate from register of land office holds full legal title to the land, and may maintain action thereon against a trespasser. Johnson v. Davis, 91 Miss. 708, 45 So. 979, 1907 Miss. LEXIS 207 (Miss. 1907).
      </p>
      <p>
       The certificate vests title only when properly issued and while in full force and uncanceled. Where the certificate was indorsed “suspended for want of township plat,” and was deposited in the general land-office at Washington City, but was sent to the plaintiff to be used for the purpose of testing his title to the land, and then to be returned, it was insufficient to vest title and sustain ejectment. Davis v. Freeland's Lessee, 32 Miss. 645, 1856 Miss. LEXIS 232 (Miss. 1856).
      </p>
      <p>
       The statute gives to the certificate the effect of vesting a complete legal title, to all intents and purposes, in the person to whom issued and his assignees, and not simply to entitle the holder to recover the land in an action. Lindsey v. Henderson, 27 Miss. 502, 1854 Miss. LEXIS 86 (Miss. 1854).
      </p>
      <p>
       A prior entry and a certificate thereof, without a patent, gives a better right in equity than a subsequent entry of the same land by another to whom a patent is issued; and a court of chancery, at the instance of the first enterer, will set aside the title of the patentee. Hester v. Kembrough, 20 Miss. 659, 1849 Miss. LEXIS 112 (Miss. 1849).
      </p>
      <p>
       The certificate is but a substitute for a better title, and is not on an equal footing with a patent. If a patent be issued to another person to the same land after a certificate of entry to one without a patent, the holder of the patent will prevail in an action of ejectment against the holder of the certificate. Dickinson v. Brown, 17 Miss. 130, 1847 Miss. LEXIS 97 (Miss. 1847).

       Parties to controversy involving validity and effect of power of attorney which has not been acknowledged and recorded in manner of conveyance of land with respect to conveyance of real property situated in Greece may stipulate to application and enforcement of Mississippi rules of law, rather than otherwise applicable to Greek law; if parties do so, trial judge may proceed to adjudge all issues according to Mississippi law and enter final judgment which, subject to appeal, would not doubt be enforceable against parties in courts of Mississippi, even though, in Republic of Greece, judgment may not be worth paper it is written on.

       Before court may resolve question of whether power of attorney which has not been acknowledged and recorded in manner provided for instruments of conveyance of interests in land is valid and enforceable with respect to real property located in Republic of Greece, Greek law must be consulted to determine whether there is conflict between laws of Mississippi and those of Greece with respect to real property and powers of attorney.

     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t13c01s13-1-227ol11">
       Petition. — A person who desires to perpetuate his own testimony or that of another person regarding any matter that may be cognizable in any court of this state may file a verified petition in the circuit or chancery court in the county of the residence of any expected adverse party. The petition shall be entitled in the name of the petitioner and shall show: (1) that the petitioner expects to be a party to an action cognizable in a court of this state but is presently unable to bring it or cause it to be brought, (2) the subject matter of the expected action and his interest therein, (3) the facts which he desires to establish by the proposed testimony and his reasons for desiring to perpetuate it, (4) the names or a description of the persons he expects will be adverse parties and their addresses so far as known, and (5) the names and addresses of the persons to be examined and the substance of the testimony which he expects to elicit from each, and shall ask for an order authorizing the petitioner to take the depositions of the persons to be examined named in the petition, for the purpose of perpetuating their testimony.
      </li>
      <li id="t13c01s13-1-227ol12">
       Notice and service. — The petitioner shall thereafter serve a notice upon each person named in the petition as an expected adverse party, stating that the petitioner will apply to the court, at a time and place named therein, for the order described in the petition. At least twenty (20) days before the date of hearing the notice shall be served in the same manner of service of summons; but if such service cannot with due diligence be made upon any expected adverse party named in the petition, the court may make such order as is just for service by publication or otherwise, and shall appoint, for persons not served in the manner provided by law, an attorney who shall represent them, and, in case they are not otherwise represented, shall cross-examine the deponent.
      </li>
      <li id="t13c01s13-1-227ol13">
       Order and examination. — If the court is satisfied that the perpetuation of the testimony may prevent a failure or delay of justice, it shall make an order designating or describing the persons whose depositions may be taken and specifying the subject matter of the examination and whether the depositions shall be taken upon oral examination or written interrogatories. The depositions may then be taken in accordance with Sections 13-1-201, 13-1-226 through 13-1-237, 13-1-241, and 13-1-243; and the court may make orders of the character provided for by Section 13-1-234. For the purpose of applying Sections 13-1-201, 13-1-226 through 13-1-237, 13-1-241, and 13-1-243, to depositions for perpetuating testimony, each reference therein to the court in which the action is pending shall be deemed to refer to the court in which the petition for such deposition was filed.
      </li>
      <li id="t13c01s13-1-227ol14">
       Use of deposition. — If a deposition to perpetuate testimony is taken under Sections 13-1-201, 13-1-226 through 13-1-237, 13-1-241, 13-1-243, it may be used in any action involving the same subject matter subsequently brought in a circuit, chancery or county court in accordance with Section 13-1-232(a).
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      Pending appeal. — If an appeal has been taken from a judgment of a court or before the taking of an appeal if the time therefor has not expired, the court in which the judgment was rendered may allow the taking of the depositions of witnesses to perpetuate their testimony for use in the event of further proceedings in the court. In such case the party who desires to perpetuate the testimony may make a motion in the court for leave to take the depositions, upon the same notice and service thereof as if the action was pending in the court. The motion shall show (1) the names and addresses of persons to be examined and the substance of the testimony which he expects to elicit from each; (2) the reasons for perpetuating their testimony. If the court finds that the perpetuation of the testimony is proper to avoid a failure or delay of justice, it may make an order allowing the depositions to be taken and may make orders of the character provided for by Section 13-1-234, and thereupon the depositions may be taken and used in the same manner and under the same conditions as are prescribed in Sections 13-1-201, 13-1-226 through 13-1-237, 13-1-241, and 13-1-243, for depositions taken in actions pending in the court.
     </p>

      Perpetuation by action.— This section does not limit the power of a court to entertain an action to perpetuate testimony.

This payment shall be made promptly when the copy of the records is delivered to the proper person, as provided in subsection (4) of this section, whether or not the financial records are entered into evidence, and the amount of the payment shall be the amount certified by the custodian in the affidavit required by subsection (6) of this section.

If the bank has none of the records described or only part thereof, the custodian shall so state in the affidavit and furnish the affidavit and such records as are available. The furnishing of the affidavit with respect to such reasonable charges shall be sufficient proof of such expense, which shall be taxed as costs of the court.

       A judgment creditor may conduct a post-judgment examination of a third party who is not employed by nor an agent of the judgment debtor, but such an examination is limited in scope to nonprivileged matters which are relevant to the judgment creditor’s allegations that the judgment debtor has assets which properly should be discovered and used to satisfy the judgment.

      As used in Sections 13-1-301 through 13-1-315 the following terms shall have the definition ascribed to them herein unless the context requires otherwise:
     </p>
     <p>
      “Deaf person” means any person whose hearing is totally impaired or whose hearing is so seriously impaired as to prohibit the person from understanding oral communications when spoken to in a normal conversational tone. The term further includes, but is not limited to, a person who is mute and a person who is both deaf and mute.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Qualified interpreter” means an interpreter certified by the national registry of interpreters for the deaf, Mississippi Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf or, in the event a qualified interpreter so certified is not available, an interpreter whose qualifications are otherwise determined. Efforts to obtain the services of a qualified interpreter qualified with a legal skills certificate or a comprehensive skills certificate will be made prior to accepting services of an interpreter with lesser certification. No qualified interpreter may be appointed unless the appointing authority and the deaf person make a preliminary determination that the interpreter is able to interpret accurately the statements of the deaf person and interpret the proceedings in which a deaf person may be involved.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Oral interpreter” means a person who interprets language through facial and lip movements only and who does not use manual communication. An oral interpreter shall be provided upon the request of a deaf person who does not communicate in sign language. The right of a deaf person to have an interpreter may not be waived except by a deaf person who does not use sign language and who initiates such request for waiver in writing. Such waiver is subject to approval of counsel of such deaf person, if existent, and is subject to approval of the appointing authority.

       Trial court properly denied defendant’s motion for postconviction relief on his claim that he was denied due process by the State’s failure to provide an interpreter during his arrest, interrogation, and pretrial matters because there was no evidence in the record concerning the pre-court events other than defendant’s verified motion which was not even supported by his own affidavit; the trial court did not err by denying defendant’s motion on incompetency grounds because no evidence was presented by defendant to support his claim of mental incompetency.

    Hearing to determine need for interpreter; notification of need.

     </h3>
     <p>
      If the judge, or any other person charged under the provisions of Sections 13-1-301 through 13-1-315 with providing an interpreter, believes that a person claiming to be entitled to an interpreter may not actually be deaf or hearing impaired, unable to communicate verbally because of his hearing disability, or otherwise not entitled to such services, the judge may, on good cause shown, hold a hearing to determine the extent of the person’s handicap or disability and the bona fide need for interpreting services. If it is determined that the person is not entitled to such services, an interpreter shall not be provided. Except in a preliminary hearing in a criminal case, every deaf person whose appearance before a proceeding entitles him to an interpreter shall notify the appointing authority of his disability not less than five (5) days prior to any appearance and shall request at such time the services of an interpreter. When a deaf person reasonably expects to need an interpreter for more than a single day, he shall so notify the appointing authority, and such notification shall be sufficient for the duration of his participation in the proceedings. When a deaf person receives notification of an appearance less than five (5) days before such appearance, he shall provide his notification and request for an interpreter as soon thereafter as practicable.

    Fees for interpreters.

     </h3>
     <p>
      An interpreter appointed under the provisions of Sections 13-1-301 through 13-1-315 shall be entitled to a reasonable fee for such services in addition to actual expenses for travel and transportation. The court or appointing authority may consider standards established by the Mississippi Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf in determining a reasonable fee. When the interpreter is appointed by a court in a criminal case the fee shall be paid out of the general fund of the state, county or municipality, as the case may be. An interpreter’s fee in a civil action shall be paid out of funds provided by law or by one or more of the parties as the court may direct and may be taxed ultimately as costs in the discretion of the court. When an interpreter is provided by an appointing authority pursuant to subsection (2) of Section 13-1-303, the fee shall be paid out of funds available to the appointing authority.

     <ol>
      <li id="t13c01s13-1-403ol11">
       An out-of-court statement made by a child under the age of twelve (12) describing any act of child abuse, sexual abuse or any other offense involving an unlawful sexual act, contact, intrusion or penetration performed in the presence of, with, by or on the declarant child, not otherwise admissible, is admissible in evidence to prove the contents thereof, if:
       <ol type="a">
        <li id="t13c01s13-1-403ol11a">
         Such statement is made for the purpose of receiving assistance or advice in order to prevent or mitigate the recurrence of the offenses, or in order to obtain advice about the psychological, social or familial consequences associated with the offenses; and
        </li>
        <li id="t13c01s13-1-403ol11b">

           Is unavailable as a witness, provided that there is other corroborative evidence of the abuse or offense. A finding of unavailability, except in those situations specified by Rule 804 of the Mississippi Rules of Evidence, shall require a finding by the court, based on the specific behavioral indicators described in Section 13-1-411, that the child’s participation in the trial would result in a substantial likelihood of traumatic emotional or mental distress; and

         The court finds in a hearing conducted outside the presence of the jury that the time, content and circumstances of the statement provide sufficient guarantees of trustworthiness. In determining the trustworthiness of the statement, the court may consider the age and maturity of the child, the nature and duration of the abuse or offense alleged, factors which may detract from the declarant’s credibility, information provided about the child’s reliability based on the specific behavioral indicators described in Section 13-1-411, or any other factor deemed appropriate.

       Since the promulgation of rules for the regulation of trial lie at the core of the judicial power, officers of neither the legislative nor executive departments of government, acting jointly or severally, had authority to confer legal validity upon the Evidence of Child Sexual Abuse Act. As that act enjoys no legal validity, it may not be regarded as “law” within Rule 802, Miss. R. Ev., which declares that hearsay is not admissible “except as provided by law.” Thus, a child’s out-of-court statements of complaints against his father were inadmissible in a child sexual battery prosecution of the father even though expert testimony indicated that the child would experience traumatic or emotional distress if he were required to testify against his father in open court. Hall v. State, 539 So. 2d 1338, 1989 Miss. LEXIS 104 (Miss. 1989).

       Upon motion and hearing in camera, the trial court may order that the testimony of a child under the age of sixteen (16) that an unlawful sexual act, contact, intrusion, penetration or other sexual offense was committed upon him or her, or that he or she witnessed its perpetration upon another child, be taken outside of the courtroom and shown in the courtroom by means of closed circuit television, upon a finding based on specific behavioral indicators described in Section 13-1-411, that there is a substantial likelihood that the child will suffer traumatic emotional or mental distress if compelled to testify in open court.
      </li>

       Closed circuit television testimony may be taken by any method not inconsistent with the Mississippi Rules of Civil Procedure and the Mississippi Uniform Criminal Rules of Circuit Court Practice. After a determination that the defendant’s presence would cause a substantial likelihood of traumatic emotional or mental distress to the child, the judge may exclude the defendant from the room where the testimony is taken. In any case in which the defendant is so excluded, arrangements must be made for the defense attorney to be in continual contact with the defendant by any appropriate private electronic or telephonic method throughout the questioning. The defendant and the jury must be able to observe the demeanor of the child witness at all times during the questioning.

   Although the Internal Revenue Service was correct that the company failed to meet its statutory duty to provide notice of the non-judicial foreclosure sale under 26 U.S.C.S. § 7425(c)(1), there was nothing in the record to suggest that the error was in any way wilful; as for the company’s efforts to market the property prior to obtaining it in the sale, there was no dispute that the company strictly followed Mississippi statutory law and published the Notices of Foreclosure Sale for four consecutive weeks pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t13c03s13-3-1" target="_self">13-3-1</a></cite> et seq., and it was not enough for the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to simply claim that the company acted wilfully with respect to the sales. Moreover, although the IRS demonstrated a mistake, there was no evidence of a wilful act that transgressed equitable standards of conduct; therefore, as a matter of law, the company could rely on the equitable presumption against merger, its liens in the subject properties did not merge with legal title, and it maintained liens superior to the IRS’s tax liens as to the subject properties. 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 105390.

       This section [Code 1942, § 1844] has no application to newspaper notices given by a board of supervisors to the public that equalized tax rolls are ready for inspection. Miller v. Lucks, 203 Miss. 824, 36 So. 2d 140, 1948 Miss. LEXIS 325 (Miss. 1948).
      </p>
      <p>
       The term “process,” within the meaning of the section [Code 1942, § 1844], stipulating that all process, except where otherwise provided, shall be issued and signed by the clerk of the court, includes the ordinary warrant for arrest, and certainly so when taken in connection with the section opening with the sentence that “the process for arrest on an indictment shall be a capias,” etc. Cooper v. State, 193 Miss. 672, 10 So. 2d 764, 1942 Miss. LEXIS 156 (Miss. 1942).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section [Code 1942, § 1844] was not applicable to require a seal of the court to be affixed to a printed notice to taxpayers of validation proceedings in connection with the issuance of bonds for the construction or purchase of a municipal electric plant, since the process referred to in this section [Code 1942, § 1844] is not a newspaper notice to taxpayers such as is required under Code of 1930, § 313 (Code 1942, § 4314). Mississippi Power & Light Co. v. Batesville, 187 Miss. 737, 193 So. 814, 1940 Miss. LEXIS 247 (Miss. 1940).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section [Code 1942, § 1844] does not require a seal to be affixed to notices by the board of supervisors to taxpayers of tax assessments, since the statute requiring the seal to be upon process refers to process addressed to individuals and not publication of a general notice by a board of supervisors to the public or a part thereof not specifically named, the object of the statute as to seal being to advise the party upon whom the writ is to be served that its authenticity is genuine. Mullins v. Lyle, 183 Miss. 297, 183 So. 696, 1938 Miss. LEXIS 243 (Miss. 1938).
      </p>
      <p>
       This statute has no application to process issued by justice of the peace, the justice of the peace not being required or authorized to have a seal. Matthews v. State, 134 Miss. 807, 100 So. 18, 1924 Miss. LEXIS 327 (Miss. 1924).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section [Code 1942, § 1844] is not applicable to notices in disbarment proceedings. Ex parte Cashin, 128 Miss. 224, 90 So. 850, 1922 Miss. LEXIS 109 (Miss. 1922).
      </p>

      </h4>
      <p>
       A writ of garnishment is not rendered ineffective by an erroneous recital that judgment had been rendered in county court when in fact it was in circuit court, where it was issued under the signature of the clerk of the circuit court, bore its seal, was for an amount in excess of county court’s jurisdiction, and was returnable on a date when the circuit court term, and not that of the county court, would begin. Mid-South Pipeline Contractors, Inc. v. Citizens Nat'l Bank, 239 Miss. 621, 124 So. 2d 697, 1960 Miss. LEXIS 331 (Miss. 1960).
      </p>
      <p>
       Sealing of a writ of execution is requisite to its validity. W. T. Rawleigh Co. v. Howell, 196 Miss. 489, 18 So. 2d 134, 1944 Miss. LEXIS 218 (Miss. 1944).
      </p>
      <p>
       Location of seal is not important in effecting authentication. W. T. Rawleigh Co. v. Howell, 196 Miss. 489, 18 So. 2d 134, 1944 Miss. LEXIS 218 (Miss. 1944).
      </p>
      <p>
       Mere fact that the seal had been placed upon a writ of execution elsewhere than upon the face of the writ proper, such as upon the unprinted margin or upon that part of the document utilized to detail accrued costs, does not render it invalid. W. T. Rawleigh Co. v. Howell, 196 Miss. 489, 18 So. 2d 134, 1944 Miss. LEXIS 218 (Miss. 1944).
      </p>
      <p>
       Affixing clerk’s seal to writ of execution, consisting of printed form upon single sheet, the right half of which contained the writ proper and the left half an itemized cost bill, at the lower lefthand corner of the part containing the cost bill instead of upon that part of the writ proper, sufficiently satisfied this section [Code 1942, § 1844].W. W. T. Rawleigh Co. v. Howell, 196 Miss. 489, 18 So. 2d 134, 1944 Miss. LEXIS 218 (Miss. 1944).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the original subpoena has no seal, after thirty years, in a collateral attack, the law presumes the execution of a proper subpoena. McAllum v. Spinks, 129 Miss. 237, 91 So. 694, 1922 Miss. LEXIS 13 (Miss. 1922).
      </p>
      <p>
       All process of the court should bear a seal or should show there is no seal or it will be bad. Burton v. Cramer, 123 Miss. 848, 86 So. 578, 1920 Miss. LEXIS 87 (Miss. 1920); McAllum v. Spinks, 129 Miss. 237, 91 So. 694, 1922 Miss. LEXIS 13 (Miss. 1922).
      </p>
      <p>
       Process without the seal of the court, or if there be no seal without a statement of that fact, is bad. Pharis v. Conner, 11 Miss. 87, 1844 Miss. LEXIS 48 (Miss. 1844).

       The fact that a capias for arrest on a misdemeanor charge was issued on the affidavit of the county prosecuting attorney, by the clerk of the county court without any order therefor from the county judge did not render it invalid, or avoid jurisdiction, by the court over the person of the defendant, since, inasmuch as the affidavit of the county prosecuting attorney took the place of an indictment in the circuit court, the process on the charge of misdemeanor so made was a capias to be issued by the clerk of the county court. Cooper v. State, 193 Miss. 672, 10 So. 2d 764, 1942 Miss. LEXIS 156 (Miss. 1942).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section [Code 1942, § 1844], while it applies to the clerks of all courts, applies only as to process issuing out of the courts of which they are clerks, and vests no authority in a clerk of the circuit court to issue a warrant for the arrest of a person charged with the commission of a crime by an affidavit lodged with him. Martin v. State, 190 Miss. 32, 199 So. 98, 1940 Miss. LEXIS 188 (Miss. 1940).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   If the process be issued by another, with the clerk’s consent in his name, it is sufficient. Barry v. Gamble, <cite class="us_code">44 U.S. 32</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">11 L. Ed. 479</cite>, 1845 U.S. LEXIS 417 (U.S. 1845).

       The process to bring in defendants in all civil actions in justice court shall be a summons which shall be served in one of the following modes:
       <p>
        First.— Upon the defendant personally, if to be found in the county, by handing him a true copy of the process.
       </p>
       <p>
        Second.— If the defendant cannot himself be found in the county, then by leaving a true copy of the process at his usual place of abode, with his wife or some other person of his family above the age of sixteen (16) years, and willing to receive such copy.

       <p>
        Third.— If the defendant cannot himself be found, and if no person of his family aged sixteen (16) years can be found at his usual place of abode who is willing to receive such copy, then by posting a true copy on a door of the defendant’s usual place of abode; provided, however, that if this mode is used when the defendant’s usual place of abode is a multi-family dwelling, a copy of the summons shall be mailed to the defendant by the clerk of the court upon return of service.

       <p>
   The requisites of a summons in chancery should be complied with in order to authorize a pro confesso. Gulf &amp; S. I. R. Co. v. F. L. Riley Mercantile Co., 139 Miss. 158, 104 So. 81, 1925 Miss. LEXIS 136 (Miss.), writ of error dismissed,

      </p>
      <p>
       A judgment by default, while not void, is erroneous where the return-day named in the summons is prior to the date of service of summons. T. A. Howard Lumber Co. v. Hopson, 136 Miss. 237, 101 So. 363, 1924 Miss. LEXIS 121 (Miss. 1924).
      </p>

       A case where a bank is bound by service of summons although the summons was intended for a bank of like name which was defunct. Campbell & Campbell v. Pickens Bank, 134 Miss. 559, 99 So. 378, 1924 Miss. LEXIS 305 (Miss. 1924).
      </p>
      <p>
       There must be a valid service of process, an appearance of defendant or a waiver of process before there can be a valid judgment. Boutwell v. Grayson, 118 Miss. 80, 79 So. 61, 1918 Miss. LEXIS 54 (Miss. 1918), overruled,

      <p>
       The writ should show in proper case that partition as well as injunction was sought. Field v. Junkin, 99 Miss. 834, 56 So. 172, 1911 Miss. LEXIS 258 (Miss. 1911).
      </p>

       The failure of a writ to apprise the defendant of the nature of the suit does not render it void. Guess v. Smith, 100 Miss. 457, 56 So. 166, 1911 Miss. LEXIS 5 (Miss. 1911).
      </p>
      <p>
       The service of an injunction writ under a bill to restrain the commission of trespasses and demanding damages and the statutory penalty for cutting trees is not a summons and does not authorize a decree pro confesso.

       A sheriff may hire an individual to serve process on a fee basis. McWilliams, Nov. 14, 1997, A.G. Op. #97-0711.

      <p>
       A summons for a replevin hearing wherein the property is not immediately seized may be served by placing a true copy on the door of the defendant’s usual place of abode. Parker, May 3, 2002, A.G. Op. #02-0225.
      </p>
      <p>
       A constable may serve a summons for a replevin by any of the means set forth in Section 13-3-5; if the constable is unable to determine whether or not the defendant is in possession of the property described in the declaration, he should note such on the return. Enlow, Nov. 15, 2002, A.G. Op. #02-0646.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a constable posts process on the door of a home as allowed by this section and the process is later returned to the court with credible information that the defendant does not live at that address, then the constable is not entitled to a fee for service of process. Davis, Mar. 5, 2004,
   A.G. Op. 04-0093.

       There is no statutory provision allowing for private process servers within the State of Mississippi other than the emergency situation.
   Process in criminal matters must be served by a constable or sheriff or sheriff’s deputy. Subpoenas may be served by private process servers. Huckaby, Aug. 25, 2006, A.G. Op. 06-0378.

   City Board of Aldermen (Board) never concluded that the publisher was unqualified, and to the contrary, the Board expressly stated in its motion that no determination could be made whether the publisher was qualified or in compliance with Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t13c03s13-3-31" target="_self">13-3-31</a></cite> since it did not receive any circulation information; the circuit court properly held that the determining issue in this case, however, was not that of circulation figures, but it was instead the lower bid submitted by the newspaper.

   Judgment determining that appellee’s publication was a newspaper qualified to publish legal notices in DeSoto County within the meaning of Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t13c03s13-3-31" target="_self">13-3-31</a></cite> was affirmed, where appellee presented sufficient evidence to sustain the trial court’s finding that the publication’s principal public business office was in DeSoto County. The publication had more than 20 employees in Southaven, a city in De Soto County, including a general manager, editor, advertising staff, advertising manager, advertising sales staff, a deputy editor, several reporters, clerical staff, and circulation staff consisting of a district manager and one or two field representatives.

   State supreme court reversed the denial of a summary judgment motion filed by bank and trustee as the city where the newspaper was published encompassed two different counties and thus, the newspaper was deemed to be published in both counties under Miss.

   Trial court misapplied
   Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t13c03s13-3-31" target="_self">13-3-31</a></cite> in finding that the successful bidder’s newspaper section was not adequate under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t13c03s13-3-31" target="_self">13-3-31</a></cite> for the publication of legal notices, because it was not published every day, it was not identified by letter like other sections, and it contained different information depending upon its destination; § 13-3-31 did not determine when a section of the newspaper was treated as a separate and independent newspaper, and instead it simply defined a newspaper and provided the criteria that a newspaper had to satisfy in order to publish legal notices.

Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t13c03s13-3-31" target="_self">13-3-31</a></cite> when it determined that the successful bidder’s proposal to publish the legal notices in a section of its newspaper that was published once a week was a qualified bid; the section of the paper at issue was sold with the newspaper, it was a section of the paper despite not being identified by letter like the other sections, and it did not matter that the section was only included in papers sold in the city, as notices only had to be published there.

      </p>
      <p>
       Contention that notice to creditors was not published in a newspaper which qualified as a valid publisher of legal notices, which was not raised in the court below, would not be considered by the Supreme Court on appeal.

   Municipal authorities cannot let a contract to publish legal notices to a newspaper not qualified under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t13c03s13-3-31" target="_self">13-3-31</a></cite>, regardless of whether or not it is the lowest bidder; thus a city council’s order dividing the publication of its legal notices equally among three newspapers was null and void where it was subsequently determined that one of the newspapers was not legally qualified; a subsequent order of the council awarding the contract to the other two newspapers was not arbitrary, capricious, discriminatory, illegal or without substantial basis and the circuit court thus erred in setting it aside.

      <p>
       Although a newspaper may be directed towards one particular area, locality or group within a relevant area, as long as that newspaper publishes news, human interest, advice columns, sports, arts, etc., which are of interest to the general public, its distribution is not entirely limited to one geographic area, is available to anyone who wishes to subscribe, and there exists paid subscribers, the newspaper is one of general circulation.

      </p>

       A finding that three members of the city council had not personally seen a particular newspaper in their neighborhoods was insufficient to support a determination that the newspaper did not meet the general circulation requirement.

      <p>
       The fact that a subscription to a subsidiary Mississippi newspaper cannot be effected without a subscription to the Tennessee newspaper is immaterial to whether the Mississippi newspaper under the statute; similarly, the fact that the purchase price of a newspaper and the purchase price of the subsidiary Mississippi newspaper are part of a single price package is also immaterial.

       If a school district has either made a finding of fact that its current publisher is qualified under this section or has not made a finding of fact that it fails to meet the requirements and provisions of this section, there is no statutory requirement that the school district respond to a request by another newspaper to be designated as the official newspaper of the school district for legal notices.

    Sheriff to mark and return process.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The sheriff shall mark on all process the day of the receipt thereof by him, and he shall return the same promptly and in any event within the time during which the person served must respond to the process, with a written statement of his proceedings thereon, and of his fees, for serving it. For failing to note the time of the receipt of process, or for failing to return the same, the sheriff shall forfeit to the party aggrieved the sum of One Hundred Dollars ($100.00), and shall be liable for all damages, and the court may enforce return of the process by fine and imprisonment for contempt. Whenever a sheriff of any county shall receive from another county any writ or other process directed to him, he shall not be liable for a failure to return the same to the county from which the same was issued if he shall show to the court that he mailed the same in the post office, directed to the clerk of the court by whom the same was issued, at least two (2) days before the sitting of the court to which the same was returnable.

      <p>
       The penalty provided under this section [Code 1942, § 1862] for a failure of the sheriff to note on the execution the date of its receipt, was not recoverable against the sheriff and his sureties where the execution plaintiffs suffered no loss or injury by reason thereof and were not “aggrieved.” McInnis v. Parker, 183 Miss. 648, 184 So. 418, 1938 Miss. LEXIS 277 (Miss. 1938).
      </p>
      <p>
       List of special venire and copy of the indictment need not be served on accused by sheriff. Ivey v. State, 154 Miss. 60, 119 So. 507, 1928 Miss. LEXIS 198 (Miss. 1928).
      </p>
      <p>
       The officer’s return may be amended after judgment. H. Lupkin & Sons v. Russell, 108 Miss. 742, 67 So. 185, 1914 Miss. LEXIS 267 (Miss. 1914).
      </p>
      <p>
       An officer’s return of service of a summons which merely recites that the writ was on a certain day “executed by personal service” on the defendant is insufficient. The return should state the facts. Dogan v. Barnes, 76 Miss. 566, 24 So. 965, 1898 Miss. LEXIS 121 (Miss. 1898).
      </p>
      <p>
       A defective return attempting to show personal service of process is not equivalent to the general return “executed” heretofore authorized under Code 1880, § 1528. Dogan v. Barnes, 76 Miss. 566, 24 So. 965, 1898 Miss. LEXIS 121 (Miss. 1898).

      <p>
       The Mississippi statutes providing for the method of services on a resident or a qualified foreign corporation, the “doing business” statute, and the statute providing for substituted service on any corporation doing business in the state, must be read together, and such reading leads to the inescapable conclusion that effective process under these statutes presupposes a factual determination that the foreign corporation is doing business in the state of Mississippi. Hyde Constr. Co. v. Koehring Co., 321 F. Supp. 1193, 1969 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13680 (D. Miss. 1969).

       An employee of a corporation whose duties are generally those of a stenographer and receptionist is not an “agent” or “clerk” of the corporation within the meaning of this section [Code 1942, § 1866], and the service upon her of a writ of garnishment issued against the corporation will not suffice to support a judgment against the corporation as garnishee where the writ was not brought to the attention of any of the corporation’s officers or agents. First Jackson Sec. Corp. v. B. F. Goodrich Co., 253 Miss. 519, 176 So. 2d 272, 1965 Miss. LEXIS 1010 (Miss. 1965).

       Where a copy of summons and complaint in a suit against a domestic corporation was delivered to an individual for delivery to the president of the corporation and this individual was a clerk who later delivered the process to the president, this did not constitute a personal service on the defendant corporation.

Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t13c03s13-3-57" target="_self">13-3-57</a></cite>; the only connection Mississippi had to the lawsuit was that the car accident occurred in Mississippi and the lawsuit was not about the accident.

       The long-arm statute was clearly enacted for the benefit of residents only, and it has not been expanded through the process of judicial interpretation to include nonresident plaintiffs not qualified to do business within the state; there is no defect under federal constitutional standards for limiting the long-arm statute to resident plaintiffs, since the state is not obligated to make its courts available to nonresidents, who themselves are not doing business in the state, to sue other nonresidents.

       If a nonresident is doing such business in the state as would subject him to the jurisdiction of the court and such business is of such nature that it is hazardous or subject to the police powers of the state to be regulated, and the cause of action grows out of such business so done, then the substituted service is good and the statute is constitutional.

       This statute, as applied to a corporate citizen of another state engaged in levy construction work of large proportions in Mississippi employing many men to operate trucks and other heavy and cumbersome machinery and equipment, is not unconstitutional as denying defendant equal protection of the law, due process of law, or privileges and immunities afforded to residents, or as burdening interstate commerce.

       Power of state to confer jurisdiction on courts over individual nonresidents by substituted service depends upon whether such enabling statute is a reasonable exercise of the state’s police power to regulate the business of such nonresident, and if the regulation is one for the protection of health, safety and welfare of those within its borders, rather than a mere attempt to extend the jurisdiction of its courts over citizens beyond its borders, the state may properly legislate to that end. Sugg v. Hendrix, 142 F.2d 740, 1944 U.S. App. LEXIS 3496 (5th Cir. Miss. 1944).

       After an employee was terminated, and his employers refused to reimburse his expenses, the court did not have personal jurisdiction over the individuals working for the employer as the employee alleged no facts supporting the individuals’ involvement in his tort claims.

   In a breach of contract and tortious inference with business relations case that was removed to federal court pursuant to 28 U.S.C.S. § 1446 and in which the court accepted as true a Mississippi company’s assertion that it and a foreign company contemplated that the contract would be performed in part in Mississippi and that the contract was in fact performed in part in Mississippi, the district court had no difficulty concluding that Mississippi’s long-arm statute, Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t13c03s13-3-57" target="_self">13-3-57</a></cite>, was satisfied; since the district court also found that the requirements of due process were met, the foreign company’s Fed.

   In a matter arising out of a high speed chase, which allegedly resulted in decedents’ deaths, neither an Alabama county or that county’s sheriff from Alabama entered upon the highways of Mississippi, involving themselves in efforts to stop the fleeing felons, or in any other way subjected themselves to jurisdiction under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t13c03s13-3-63" target="_self">13-3-63</a></cite>; therefore, the supreme court proceeded with a long-arm analysis to determine if jurisdiction could be conferred upon them under the Mississippi long-arm statute, Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t13c03s13-3-57" target="_self">13-3-57</a></cite>, and the supreme court found no minimum contacts, so the county and the sheriff were not subject to personal jurisdiction in Mississippi.

   Trial court erred in denying New York commuter van company’s motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction under Miss. R. Civ. P. 12(b) in the Mississippi residents’ wrongful death action that arose following an auto accident that occurred in New York because, although the van company was not qualified to do business in Mississippi and, therefore, met the threshold requirement for coverage by the long-arm statute, Miss. Rev. Stat. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t13c03s13-3-57" target="_self">13-3-57</a></cite>, there was no evidence in the record to demonstrate that the van company’s actions had brought it under either the contract, tort, or “doing business in” provisions of the long-arm statute.

       Defendants, by demonstrating that the individuals’ claims against the non-diverse defendants were time-barred, sustained their burden of showing that no reasonable possibility of recovery existed against the non-diverse defendants on the claims raised in the individuals’ original complaint; while the individuals argued that their claims were not time-barred because defendants’ fraudulent concealment tolled the statute of limitations, they were unable to support their fraudulent concealment claim. Thus, the individuals’ motion to remand was denied. White v. City Fin. Co., 277 F. Supp. 2d 646, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14205 (S.D. Miss. 2003).

       The contract prong of the long-arm statute was satisfied by the allegations of breach of implied warranty of merchantability and the breach of implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose claims where at least part of the warranty work was performed in the forum state; the misrepresentation claim against the manufacturer was sufficient to support jurisdiction under the tort prong of the long-arm statute because the materials and a representative were sent to the forum state.

       In an action arising from a contract under which the plaintiff was to sell 80 percent of its oil and gas working interest in an oil and gas field, the plaintiff set out a prima facie case for personal jurisdiction under the contract prong of the statute and, therefore, the district court erred in dismissing the defendant for lack of personal jurisdiction where the plaintiff argued that a codefendant entered into a contract with the plaintiff on behalf of itself and the defendant, which financed and purchased 75 percent of the 80 percent working interest in the oil and gas field.

   Under Mississippi law, malicious prosecution requires institution or continuation of original judicial proceedings, either criminal or civil; by, or at instance of defendants; termination of such proceedings in plaintiff’s favor; malice in instituting proceedings; want of probable cause in proceedings; and suffering of damages as result of action or prosecution complained of. Allred v. Moore &amp; Peterson, 117 F.3d 278, 1997 U.S. App. LEXIS 18148 (5th Cir. Miss. 1997), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">522 U.S. 1048</cite>, <cite class="s_court">118 S.

   Suffering of damages within state from alleged malicious prosecution was insufficient, without more, to support personal jurisdiction under tort prong of Mississippi long-arm statute. Allred v.

       <p>
   For purposes of Mississippi long-arm statute, injury suffered in malicious prosecution tort is institution of criminal or civil proceedings where institution ought not to have occurred (and occurred for an improper reason); Mississippi does not permit damages to serve as a proxy for injury in personal jurisdiction calculus.

   In an action by a Mississippi plaintiff alleging various torts arising from a Missouri defendant’s repair and replacement of the plaintiff’s diesel engines, the defendant was not subject to personal jurisdiction in Mississippi, although the tort prong of Mississippi’s long arm statute (§<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t13c03s13-3-57" target="_self">13-3-57</a></cite>) applied because the engines malfunctioned in Mississippi, where, inter alia, the defendant was not qualified to do business in Mississippi, had never done business in Mississippi, owned no property in Mississippi, had no place of business in Mississippi, did not advertise or sell products in Mississippi, and was careful to protect its distribution agreement, which forbid it from providing any sales and services outside Kansas and part of Missouri; exercise of jurisdiction under the long-arm statute would not comport with the dictates of Fourteenth Amendment.

Peterson v. Test Int'l, E.C., 904 F. Supp. 574, 1995 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17100 (S.D. Miss. 1995).

   In a personal injury action by a Mississippi plaintiff arising from an automobile accident that occurred in Tennessee, the nonresident defendant’s consummation of an agreement to breed her dog in Mississippi, and her installation of a telephone line at a friend’s home in Mississippi when she briefly stayed there, were insufficient to meet the “contract” prong of the Mississippi long arm statute (§<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t13c03s13-3-57" target="_self">13-3-57</a></cite>) where the Tennessee automobile accident was unrelated to the contracts performed by the defendant in Mississippi.

       A nonresident defendant must do more than merely place its product in the “stream of commerce” before its actions will be deemed “purposefully directed” at Mississippi for purposes of due process analysis.

       <p>
   A nonresident manufacturer’s placement of its product into the stream of commerce did not constitute an act “purposefully directed” toward Mississippi where there was no evidence of any activity by the manufacturer indicative of an intent to serve the Mississippi market; thus, the limitations of the due process clause prevented utilization of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t13c03s13-3-57" target="_self">13-3-57</a></cite> to gain personal jurisdiction over the manufacturer.

   In an action against a nonresident church and archdiocese, alleging that a priest engaged in homosexual activity with the plaintiff at homes in Mississippi and that church officials knew that the plaintiff was staying overnight with the priest, and should have known that homosexual activity would occur, personal jurisdiction did not exist over the church and archdiocese under the Mississippi long-arm statute (§<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t13c03s13-3-57" target="_self">13-3-57</a></cite>), since the plaintiff failed to prove a prima facie case on which jurisdiction was based predicated on theories of respondeat superior, negligent hiring, or negligent supervision.

       Long-arm statute could not be used as basis for obtaining personal jurisdiction in product liability action brought against non-resident defendants who were doing business in Mississippi and who were licensed as automobile manufacturers or dealers under Mississippi Motor Vehicle Commission Law, where defendants were not registered to do business in Mississippi, automobile accident which gave rise to action occurred in another state, and action was brought by non-resident plaintiffs.

      <p>
       In action, brought by truck driver who was injured when rubber strap broke as driver was attempting to attach it to tarp, against Ohio manufacturer of strap which sold strap to Alabama company which in turn sold it to plaintiff’s employee, evidence failed to establish that part of tort occurred in Mississippi for purposes of determining whether personal jurisdiction could be asserted there over Ohio manufacturer; although plaintiff made products liability allegation that he received box containing allegedly defective straps from his employer in Mississippi, plaintiff did not attempt to use strap until he reached Oklahoma, injury occurred in Oklahoma, none of manufacturer’s actions were directed towards Mississippi, and none of alleged acts took place in Mississippi.

      <p>
       In action, brought by truck driver injured when rubber strap broke as he attempted to attach it to tarp, against Ohio manufacturer of strap which sold strap to Alabama company which in turn sold it to plaintiff’s employer, evidence failed to establish sufficient basis to subject manufacturer to long-arm jurisdiction on theory of strict tort liability, notwithstanding that manufacturer was sufficiently engaged in business of selling rubber strap to be considered “seller,” as none of manufacturer’s sales activities or solicitations took place in or were directed towards Mississippi.

      </p>
      <p>
       Assuming it was otherwise available to plaintiff, Mississippi statute providing that non-resident corporations found doing business in Mississippi would be subject to suit in state to same extent as domestic corporations, regardless of whether cause of action accrued within or outside of state, did not provide statutory basis for assertion of personal jurisdiction over nonresident corporation in personal injury action by nonresident plaintiff, where Mississippi long-arm statute would not allow that result.

       Under particular facts, it would not be unfair or offend due process for Mississippi court to exercise jurisdiction in suit by Mississippi corporation against Illinois corporation which had agreed to move Mississippi corporation’s barges which had become stranded in river; defendant’s activities in Mississippi were such that it could reasonably foresee being hailed into court in Mississippi. Falco Lime, Inc. v. Tide Towing Co., 779 F. Supp. 58, 1991 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17756 (N.D. Miss. 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       In determining whether exercise of long arm jurisdiction under state statute comports with due process requirements, court must determine whether defendant has established sufficient contacts with forum state indicating purposeful availment of privilege of conducting activities within forum and thereby invoking benefits and protection of its laws, with focus of inquiry at this stage being upon nature of underlying litigation. Falco Lime, Inc. v. Tide Towing Co., 779 F. Supp. 58, 1991 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17756 (N.D. Miss. 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       Extent of jurisdiction of federal court over nonresident defendant depends on whether defendant is amenable to service of process under forum state’s long arm statute and whether such exercise of jurisdiction would comport with dictates of due process. Falco Lime, Inc. v. Tide Towing Co., 779 F. Supp. 58, 1991 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17756 (N.D. Miss. 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       In deciding whether federal court sitting in diversity has jurisdiction over nonresident defendant, reach of long arm statute should be determined before considering whether exercise of jurisdiction would comport with due process, for if service was defective under state statute, constitutional issue should not even be considered. Falco Lime, Inc. v. Tide Towing Co., 779 F. Supp. 58, 1991 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17756 (N.D. Miss. 1991).
      </p>

       State’s long-arm statute relating to tort actions did not authorize jurisdiction over foreign corporation which had entered into charter agreement with Mississippi corporation seeking damages for loss of use of barges which allegedly went aground as result of Illinois corporation’s negligence in maintaining and operating tug. Falco Lime, Inc. v. Tide Towing Co., 779 F. Supp. 58, 1991 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17756 (N.D. Miss. 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       Mississippi’s long arm statute’s contract provision served to confer personal jurisdiction over Illinois corporation which had entered into charter agreement with Mississippi corporation seeking damages for loss of use of barges which allegedly ran aground as result of Illinois corporation’s negligent maintenance and operation of tug. Falco Lime, Inc. v. Tide Towing Co., 779 F. Supp. 58, 1991 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17756 (N.D. Miss. 1991).

       In order for “tort” prong of long-arm statute to apply, at least some part of tort must have been committed within Mississippi. Murray v. Remington Arms Co., 795 F. Supp. 805, 1991 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20550 (S.D. Miss. 1991).
      </p>

       In products liability action brought against defendant manufacturer of rifle, tort provision of long-arm statute would not form basis for jurisdiction over nonresident manufacturer where allegations are that injuries to various plaintiffs occurred in Texas, Washington, and Canada. Murray v. Remington Arms Co., 795 F. Supp. 805, 1991 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20550 (S.D. Miss. 1991).

       Nonresident plaintiffs may not utilize “doing business” provision of long-arm statute to obtain jurisdiction over nonresident defendant. Murray v. Remington Arms Co., 795 F. Supp. 805, 1991 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20550 (S.D. Miss. 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       In products liability action, nonresident plaintiffs could not use “doing business” provision of long-arm statute to obtain personal jurisdiction over nonresident defendant manufacturer, even if court considered as true, for purposes of litigation, assertion that defendant manufacturer was alter ego of co-defendant, its parent corporation, which had registered agent in state and had not challenged personal jurisdiction; there was no Mississippi law to support intended use of alter ego theory to impute residency of parent corporation to subsidiary. Murray v. Remington Arms Co., 795 F. Supp. 805, 1991 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20550 (S.D. Miss. 1991).

       Nonresidents may not utilize “doing business” provision of long-arm statute to invoke jurisdiction in Mississippi over foreign corporation. Ferry v. Langston Corp., 792 F. Supp. 512, 1990 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20053 (S.D. Miss. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       For defendant to be amenable to process under “doing business” provision of long-arm statute, there must be nexus between defendant’s activities in Mississippi and plaintiff’s cause of action; however, there is no requirement that there be direct relation or nexus between the two, claim must merely be “incident to” such business. Ferry v. Langston Corp., 792 F. Supp. 512, 1990 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20053 (S.D. Miss. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       There was no sufficient connection, to form basis for long-arm jurisdiction, between defendant manufacturer’s business activity in Mississippi and injury sustained by plaintiffs’ deceased by machine manufactured by defendant, where defendant was New Jersey corporation which sold machine to deceased’s employer in Louisiana, deceased had lived and worked in Louisiana, and plaintiffs resided in Louisiana; all that appeared from submissions to court was that defendant sold equipment in interstate commerce and had sold equipment which was distributed to Mississippi purchasers. Ferry v. Langston Corp., 792 F. Supp. 512, 1990 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20053 (S.D. Miss. 1990).

      <p>
       Personal jurisdiction would not lie, over nonresident manufacturer, under long-arm statute or under due process clause, where manufacturer was organized or existed under laws of Federal Republic of Germany, was not qualified to do business in Mississippi, had no real estate, personal property, bank accounts, or other property in state, had never entered into contract to be performed within state, and had never performed any act which had or could have had effect within state.

      <p>
       Mississippi long-arm statute allows for assertion of jurisdiction over person of nonresident defendant who makes contract with resident of Mississippi to be performed in whole or in part, by either party, within Mississippi; or who commits tort in whole or in part in Mississippi; or who does any business or performs any character of work or service in state.

   In action brought by California residents against asbestos products manufacturers alleging damages as result of presence of asbestos-containing materials in buildings located outside Mississippi, claims for fraud and conspiracy accrued at time of sale of products, which was before 1980 when §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t13c03s13-3-57" target="_self">13-3-57</a></cite> was amended, thus District Court in Mississippi lacked jurisdiction under tort prong of statute. Black v. Carey Canada, Inc., 791 F. Supp. 1120, 1990 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20087 (S.D. Miss. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Sale of asbestos-containing products in Mississippi and alleged misrepresentation by defendant manufacturers as to consequences of exposure of such products did not subject defendants to service of process under tort provisions of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t13c03s13-3-57" target="_self">13-3-57</a></cite>; otherwise all manufacturers who commit mass torts would be subject to service of process under tort provisions of statute, which would swallow all restrictions placed on long-arm statute. Black v. Carey Canada, Inc., 791 F. Supp. 1120, 1990 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20087 (S.D. Miss. 1990).

      <p>
       In order for jurisdiction to have been proper as to defendants who owned a weekend home in Mississippi but whose “usual place of abode” was in Louisiana, service of process should have been made pursuant to Mississippi’s long-arm statute, since the defendants owned real property in Mississippi, and thus had taken advantage of the laws of Mississippi and the protections afforded under such laws. Alpaugh v. Moore, 568 So. 2d 291, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 606 (Miss. 1990).

      <p>
       A court had personal jurisdiction over a former Mississippi resident in an action brought by his former wife who alleged that she incurred $5,000 in debts by reason of his desertion, where the allegations included a debt incurred in Mississippi by reason of the former husband’s conduct in Mississippi. Petters v. Petters, 560 So. 2d 722, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 201 (Miss. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       By virtue of the supremacy clause, the Federal Uniformed Services Former Spouses’ Protection Act overrides Mississippi’s long-arm statutes to the extent that Mississippi law would exceed the limitations of the federal enactment. Thus, a former husband’s absence from Mississippi for 15 continuous years precluded personal jurisdiction by reason of residence or domicile since the language of the federal Act makes it clear that only current domicile or residence may suffice to confer authority upon a court to adjudge rights in a former service person’s military retirement pension. Petters v. Petters, 560 So. 2d 722, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 201 (Miss. 1990).

       Mississippi long-arm statute could not bring owners of trucking company located and primarily doing business in Nevada and Colorado into court in Mississippi where only contacts between defendants and Mississippi were permit to carry property through the state and purchase of operating authorities permitting shipment into Mississippi. Cycles, Ltd. v. W.J. Digby, Inc., 889 F.2d 612, 1989 U.S. App. LEXIS 18373 (5th Cir. Miss. 1989).
      </p>
      <p>
       The “doing-business” provision of Mississippi’s long-arm statute may not be used by nonresident plaintiffs to bring nonresident defendants into court in the state; even residents must establish a nexus between plaintiff’s cause of action and defendant’s in-state business contacts to use such long-arm provision. Mills v. Dieco, Inc., 722 F. Supp. 296, 1989 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12349 (N.D. Miss. 1989).
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 13-3-57 requires no direct nexus to the non-resident’s business done in Mississippi, but requires only that the claim be incident thereto. The statute thus requires far less than that the liability generating conduct have occurred in Mississippi. There is no constitutional imperative that the action arise out of the non-resident defendant’s contacts/activities in this state. All that is required is that the non-resident defendant have continuous and systematic general contacts with Mississippi. These contacts must amount to something more than occasional “fortuitous” instances where the defendant had in the past come into some casual, isolated contact with an in-state resident. McDaniel v. Ritter, 556 So. 2d 303, 1989 Miss. LEXIS 501 (Miss. 1989).

   An airline passenger’s personal representatives’ claim against the estate of an airline pilot arose out of facts sufficiently incident to business done by the pilot in Mississippi that the pilot’s estate was amenable to suit in Mississippi under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t13c03s13-3-57" target="_self">13-3-57</a></cite> where the pilot and the passenger were employees of a Mississippi corporation which had an office in Mississippi, and the airplane crash which gave rise to the passenger’s claim occurred during a trip made on behalf of the corporation.

   The use of the word “representative” in §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t13c03s13-3-57" target="_self">13-3-57</a></cite> encompasses executors and administrators of an estate and contemplates that the actions of a decedent during his or her lifetime which would have rendered him or her amenable to suit will similarly subject his or her administrator or executor (i.e. his or her personal “representative”) to in personam jurisdiction in Mississippi.

       When nonresident defendant moves to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, plaintiffs need not make full showing on merits that jurisdiction is proper, but must make prima facie showing of facts upon which in personam jurisdiction is predicated; plaintiffs failed to come forward with proof in acceptable form to controvert defendant’s unrebutted affidavit, which conclusively established that defendant was not doing business and had never done business in Mississippi.

       Subjecting Alabama car dealership to jurisdiction of Mississippi court in wrongful death action arising from automobile accident occurring in Mississippi but allegedly resulting from dealer’s sale and shipment to Mississippi dealership of master cylinder for use in attempting to repair vehicle’s brakes would not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice so as to violate federal due process requirements, where (1) most of witnesses reside in Mississippi, (2) two or three defendants reside in Mississippi, (3) only Mississippi court can resolve matter in single action, and (4) Alabama dealer is not inconvenienced unreasonably since distance between Alabama and Mississippi is not great; moreover, Mississippi has exceptionally strong interest in providing forum for redress of injuries to its residents occurring within its borders and caused by allegedly defective product shipped from outside state.

   In a diversity action one long-distance telephone call that was alleged to constitute a tort committed “in whole or in part” in Mississippi was a proper basis on which to predicate federal diversity jurisdiction under Code §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t13c03s13-3-57" target="_self">13-3-57</a></cite>, since the statute includes in its reach defendants who commit a single tort, an alleged tortfeasor need not have been present in the state, and if the alleged tortfeasor causes injury in Mississippi he is covered by the statute. Brown v. Flowers Industries, Inc., 688 F.2d 328, 1982 U.S. App. LEXIS 25419 (5th Cir. Miss. 1982), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">460 U.S. 1023</cite>, <cite class="s_court">103 S.

   Service of process in an action for personal injuries sustained in an automobile accident was improperly made pursuant to §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t13c03s13-3-57" target="_self">13-3-57</a></cite>, where although the plaintiff was a Mississippi resident when the accident occurred, she was not a resident when suit was filed and, at that time, the Mississippi statute could be used against nonresident defendants only by a plaintiff who was a resident when the suit was filed. Golden v. Cox Furniture Mfg. Co., 683 F.2d 115, 1982 U.S. App. LEXIS 17055 (5th Cir. Miss. 1982).

   The 1980 amendment to §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t13c03s13-3-57" target="_self">13-3-57</a></cite> merely creates a right in nonresidents to make use of the statute where the tort is committed in whole or in part in the state; otherwise the statute remains the same and the amendment strengthens the view that a nonresident may not use the statute as a vehicle to bring suit in the courts of the state against nonresidents or foreign corporations not qualified under the constitution or state law to do business in the state when incidents giving rise to the cause of action occur outside of Mississippi. Thompson v. F. W. Woolworth Co., 508 F. Supp. 522, 1981 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10531 (N.D. Miss. 1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       In an action arising out of the sale of a grinding machine, service of summons on the nonresident defendants pursuant to the state long-arm statute was improper, notwithstanding plaintiff buyers’ allegations that defendants, the company’s owner and sales director, had committed a tort in part in Mississippi against a resident and that the owner had also made a contract to be performed by a party in Mississippi, where the sales had been made through a Tennessee corporation doing business in Tennessee, where the contacts leading up to the sales at issue had been made in Tennessee, and where the transactions had been closed in that state and the machines delivered to plaintiffs at their place of business in Tennessee; thus, the court did not possess in personam jurisdiction over defendants. Blanton v. American Tool & Grinding Co., 472 F. Supp. 257, 1979 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12938 (N.D. Miss. 1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       In an action against a nonresident corporate landowner for personal injuries sustained by plaintiff’s minor child in the waters surrounding defendant’s land, the trial court committed reversible error in sustaining a motion to dismiss for lack of in personam jurisdiction where allegations of negligence and of knowledge of a dangerous condition in such waters were sufficient for the trial court to acquire jurisdiction under the long-arm statute. Mandel v. James Graham Brown Foundation, Inc., 375 So. 2d 1017, 1979 Miss. LEXIS 2444 (Miss. 1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       If a plaintiff can obtain process on a non-resident defendant, in a suit filed under the long arm statute, he will not be excused for his failure to sue and will not be entitled to claim that the statute of limitations is tolled during the absence of the defendant from the state; if a plaintiff makes such a claim, the burden is on him to show the duration of the defendant’s absence from the state and to show that defendant cannot be served with process under any of the ways provided by the long arm statute. Gulf Nat'l Bank v. King, 362 So. 2d 1253, 1978 Miss. LEXIS 2162 (Miss. 1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       The application of the long-arm statute did not deny defendants due process of law where, inter alia, the execution of the contract at issue occurred largely in Mississippi, following telephone negotiations initiated in the state, and where defendant partially performed its part of the contract in Mississippi. Sheridan, Inc. v. C. K. Marshall & Co., 360 So. 2d 1223, 1978 Miss. LEXIS 2322 (Miss. 1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       In an action to collect an amount allegedly due on a sale of products manufactured in Mississippi and sold to a Maine buyer on open account, the court lacked in personam jurisdiction over defendant buyer where the sale of the system at issue, for use on an egg farm, had been negotiated by telephone and correspondence, where defendant had not been present in Mississippi at any time and where he had no other business connections in the state; the only fact that could arguably justify in personam jurisdiction was that the system had been fabricated in Mississippi according to plans and specifications especially prepared in the state by plaintiff, but this activity was performed by plaintiff in order to place itself in a position to make the sale to its Maine customer. Reed-Joseph Co. v. De Coster, 461 F. Supp. 748, 1978 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16847 (N.D. Miss. 1978).

      <p>
       In an action arising when a Tennessee auctioneer sold certain livestock over which the Mississippi plaintiff had a security interest, defendant’s motion to dismiss for lack of in personam jurisdiction would be granted, in accordance with the state long arm statute, where the contract between defendant and the plaintiff’s debtor was wholly performed in Tennessee and where, if treated as a tort action, the action in its entirety occurred in Tennessee; although defendant’s contacts with the state would satisfy the mandate of due process, the presence of one representative within the state and the act of advertising within the state would not constitute doing business within the meaning of the statute where there was no causal relationship between the cause of action alleged and the activities of the defendant within the forum state. Indianola Production Credit Asso. v. Burnette-Carter Co., 450 F. Supp. 303, 1977 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12823 (N.D. Miss. 1977).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendants’ motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction would be granted where, according to their uncontradicted affidavits, neither defendant was qualified to do business, was doing business, or had ever done business in the state, where neither had committed a tort in the state, and where neither had entered into a contract with a resident of the state to be performed in whole or in part in the state.

       In an action for breach of contract brought by a New York corporation qualified to do and doing business in Mississippi against a Belgian corporation not otherwise connected with the state, in personam jurisdiction would be exercised pursuant to the long-arm statute and in accordance with the requirements of due process where the contract was partly performed in the state. Chromcraft Corp. v. Mirox, S. A., 446 F. Supp. 342, 1977 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14242 (N.D. Miss. 1977).

       A Louisiana shipping corporation was subject to personal jurisdiction in Mississippi in an action for breach of contract where, inter alia, the shipper either loaded or unloaded petroleum products at a port in Mississippi on 8 different occasions and where it submitted reports concerning the movement of petroleum products to proper state officials. Smego Marine Transport, Inc. v. International Trading & Transport, Ltd., 446 F. Supp. 21, 1977 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14966 (N.D. Miss. 1977).

      <p>
       In personam jurisdiction over a third-party nonresident defendant was not available under the long-arm statute in an action concerning certain defective goods which it shipped to a Mississippi retailer and which were, in turn, delivered to a Mississippi buyer where the nonresident’s only contact with the state consisted of the isolated acts of receiving a telephone call and supplying goods from a point outside Mississippi; the exercise of personal jurisdiction under such circumstances would also be a violation of due process. R. Clinton Constr. Co. v. Bryant & Reaves, Inc., 442 F. Supp. 838, 1977 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12222 (N.D. Miss. 1977).

      <p>
       In an action against a foreign corporation alleging that the corporation interfered in a business relationship between its Mississippi subsidiary and a Mississippi resident, a foreign merger agreement involving the subsidiary was not a contract with a Mississippi resident within the meaning of this section; The corporation’s exercise of its legitimate business interest in selling its subsidiary did not constitute a tort against a Mississippi resident within the meaning of this section; The corporation was not doing business in Mississippi within the meaning of this section, even though its Mississippi subsidiary was wholly owned, the subsidiary’s financing had to be obtained through the corporation, the subsidiary’s long range plans were submitted to the corporation for approval, the boards of directors of the two corporations were nearly identical and board meetings of the subsidiary were held at the corporate offices of the corporation, where the formal legal requirements dividing the two corporations were scrupulously observed, where the subsidiary was recognized as a corporate entity legally distinct from its parent, where the subsidiary was adequately financed, where the subsidiary paid all of the salaries of its employees and its own expenses, including payment for services rendered by its parent, where there was no commingling of funds, and where the subsidiary maintained its own books, records, and a balance sheet.

   Nonresident limited partners of a nonresident limited partnership doing business in the state could not be made subject to jurisdiction of the state’s courts in an action against the partnership where they had done none of the acts specified by the long arm statute (§<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t13c03s13-3-57" target="_self">13-3-57</a></cite>) as prerequisites to jurisdiction, and had paid their indebtedness to the partnership in full, thus, under the statute governing circumstances in which limited partners are proper parties to a suit against the partnership (§§<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.79.html#t79c13s79-13-3" target="_blank">79-13-3</a></cite>,<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.79.html#t79c13s79-13-51" target="_blank">79-13-51</a></cite>), not being subject to being made parties.

       Where the notice of service of a non-resident corporation was delivered to the president of the corporation in accord with statutory requirements, and an interlocutory default judgment was entered upon failure of the defendant to answer, the default judgment could not be set aside on the grounds that the president of the corporation mislaid the notice due to anxiety over his wife’s recent death.

       Where the consideration for a contract was the agreement between the plaintiff and the nonresident defendant to cause a merger of Mississippi and Arkansas corporations, which would require a partial performance of the contract by both plaintiff and defendant in Mississippi, the defendant was within the reach of this statute.

       Where the Associated Press sent a dispatch from Louisiana to its Mississippi members incorrectly indicating that plaintiff, a Mississippi resident, had been convicted of marijuana possession, the district court had jurisdiction of plaintiff’s libel action under the terms of the amended Mississippi long-arm statute; the AP’s contacts with Mississippi were sufficient to justify, under the due process clause, Mississippi’s exercise of its jurisdiction.

   A nonresident executor administering an estate in and under the supervision of the Tennessee courts, whose only contact with Mississippi touching upon the court administration of the estate had been the probation of the foreign will and the recording of a certified copy of the record of his appointment and qualification in Tennessee, had such minimal and tenuous contact with Mississippi as to be outside the coverage of this section [Code 1972, §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t13c03s13-3-57" target="_self">13-3-57</a></cite>].

      </p>
      <p>
       The long-arm statute was clearly enacted for the benefit of residents only, and it has not been expanded through the process of judicial interpretation to include nonresident plaintiffs not qualified to do business within the state; there is no defect under federal constitutional standards for limiting the long-arm statute to resident plaintiffs, since the state is not obligated to make its courts available to nonresidents, who themselves are not doing business in the state, to sue other nonresidents.

   Process served pursuant to §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t13c03s13-3-57" target="_self">13-3-57</a></cite> is not valid or effective to subject the nonresident defendant to in personam jurisdiction unless the cause of action arises from, or is connected with, the consummation of some transaction or performance of some act within the state by such nonresident defendant.

      <p>
       Code 1942, § 1437 could not be used to sustain in personam jurisdiction over individual defendants on grounds that the activities of the individual defendants in connection with the contract performed, or to be performed in Mississippi by the defendant corporation, created a situation under which this section would reach the individual defendants’ in personam jurisdiction, since jurisdiction over individual officers and employees of a corporation cannot be predicated merely upon the jurisdiction over the corporation itself.

       An administratrix, residing outside and being a nonresident of the state of Mississippi has, by her actions in administering an estate in Mississippi, subjected herself to process under Code 1942, § 1437, on a cause of action arising out of an automobile accident which occurred in Alabama.

      </p>
      <p>
       The statutory purpose is to afford to Mississippi residents a right of action locally against the nonresident who commits a tort, in whole or in part, in this state against a resident of this state, and to limit the reach of this section [Code 1942, § 1437] and products liability cases “to injuries in this state” unduly restricts the clear meaning of the statute. Breedlove v. Beech Aircraft Corp., 334 F. Supp. 1361, 1971 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11662 (N.D. Miss. 1971).

       There is no statutory requirement that the part of the tort which causes the injury be committed in Mississippi; the words require only that a part of the tort be committed in this state. Breedlove v. Beech Aircraft Corp., 334 F. Supp. 1361, 1971 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11662 (N.D. Miss. 1971).

       Through the enactment of Code 1942, § 1438, actions brought pursuant to this section [Code 1942, § 1437] shall be issued and served in the same manner and with the same effect as process issued and served pursuant to Code 1942, § 9352-61.

       Under Code 1942, § 1438, providing that service of process made upon the secretary of state shall be made in the same manner and by the same procedure and with the same force and effect as is provided by the nonresident motorist statute as amended and supplemented, service can be made pursuant to a subsequently inserted provision of the nonresident motorist statute, Code 1942, § 9352-61, so as to permit service upon any person who is a nonresident at the time the action is filed, even though at the time of the incident giving rise to the action, such person was a resident of Mississippi.

       In a malpractice action against a nonresident doctor who resided in Mississippi at the time of the alleged tort, the court held that the addition in this section [Code 1942, § 1438] of the words “as amended and supplemented” indicate that the legislature intended to give those suing nonresidents under Code 1942, § 1437 the same rights to service and effect of process as are given to those suing nonresident motorists under Code 1942, § 9352-61.

       It is well settled that the Mississippi “long arm” statute applies to individual as well as to corporate defendants. Alford v. Whitsel, 322 F. Supp. 358, 1971 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14729 (N.D. Miss. 1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       For amenability of a nonresident individual defendant to process served pursuant to the Mississippi “long arm” statute, the nonresident must purposefully do some act or consummate some transaction in Mississippi, the cause of action must arise from or be connected with such act or transaction, and the assumption of jurisdiction by the state must not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice, consideration being given to the quality, nature, and extent of the activity in Mississippi, the relative convenience of the parties, the benefits and protection of the laws of the state afforded the respective parties, and the basic equities of the situation. Alford v. Whitsel, 322 F. Supp. 358, 1971 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14729 (N.D. Miss. 1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       The personal appearance of the defendant before a Mississippi grand jury, and his alleged malicious and willful withholding of facts which would have exonerated the plaintiff, a Mississippi resident, from criminal charges relating to a check given the defendant by the plaintiff, constituted the commission of a tort within Mississippi against a resident of the state, within the meaning of the Mississippi “long arm” statute. Alford v. Whitsel, 322 F. Supp. 358, 1971 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14729 (N.D. Miss. 1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       In applying the so-called long-arm statute the courts should be sensitive to any conflict between the letter of the law and traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice, and if the latter is offended, the former may have to yield. Beacham v. Beacham, 243 So. 2d 62, 1971 Miss. LEXIS 1505 (Miss. 1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a nonresident corporation signed a sales representative agreement with a resident of Mississippi, which resident fully performed the contract in the state by making sales of the corporation’s products and furnishing other information to the corporation as well as supervising the installation of the product, which installation required representatives of the corporation to make numerous trips to the facility site to assist in the installation, the corporation was amenable to the process and jurisdiction of the courts of Mississippi in a suit by the Mississippi resident to recover commissions allegedly due under the agreement. Beacham v. Beacham, 243 So. 2d 62, 1971 Miss. LEXIS 1505 (Miss. 1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a suit to recover commissions allegedly due under a sales representative agreement between the plaintiff and the defendant, a nonresident corporate manufacturer, where the defendant made a special appearance and moved for dismissal of the suit on the ground that it was not subject to process of the court, which motion was overruled, the corporate defendant’s action in answering the bill of complaint and in participating in defending the suit did not estop it from making a further attack on the court’s jurisdiction on appeal. Beacham v. Beacham, 243 So. 2d 62, 1971 Miss. LEXIS 1505 (Miss. 1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Mississippi statutes providing for the method of service on a resident or a qualified foreign corporation, the “doing business” statute, and the statute providing for substituted service on any corporation doing business in the state, must be read together, and such reading leads to the inescapable conclusion that effective process under these statutes presupposes a factual determination that the foreign corporation is doing business in the state of Mississippi. Hyde Constr. Co. v. Koehring Co., 321 F. Supp. 1193, 1969 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13680 (D. Miss. 1969).
      </p>

       A foreign corporation qualified to do business in Mississippi is a resident within the meaning of subd (a) of this section [Code 1942, § 1437] so that it may bring a suit under the terms of the section. C. H. Leavell & Co. v. Doster, 211 So. 2d 813, 1968 Miss. LEXIS 1276 (Miss. 1968).
      </p>

       Nonresident plaintiff corporations qualified to do business in Mississippi are residents of the state within the meaning of the first category mentioned in subd (a) of this section [Code 1942, § 1437]. C. H. Leavell & Co. v. Doster, 211 So. 2d 813, 1968 Miss. LEXIS 1276 (Miss. 1968).
      </p>
      <p>
       A foreign corporation qualified to do business under the laws of Mississippi should have the same privileges and advantages of invoking the aid of the courts of this state under this section [Code 1942, § 1437] as resident corporations if they are to have equal protection of the laws. C. H. Leavell & Co. v. Doster, 211 So. 2d 813, 1968 Miss. LEXIS 1276 (Miss. 1968).
      </p>
      <p>
       A foreign corporation qualified to do business in Mississippi may not be sued under the terms of this section [Code 1942, § 1437] because a foreign corporation, to be reached by the section, must not be qualified as doing business in the state. C. H. Leavell & Co. v. Doster, 211 So. 2d 813, 1968 Miss. LEXIS 1276 (Miss. 1968).
      </p>
      <p>
       It is now settled that there is little reason to distinguish between nonresident individuals and foreign corporations with respect to obtaining jurisdiction over them under this section [Code 1942, § 1437]. Smith v. Barker, 306 F. Supp. 1173, 1968 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7727 (N.D. Miss. 1968).

       The “long arm” amendment to this section [Code 1942, § 1437] which became effective July 1, 1964 does not apply retrospectively to torts committed prior to its effective date. Mladinich v. Kohn, 186 So. 2d 481, 1966 Miss. LEXIS 1321 (Miss. 1966).
      </p>
      <p>
       The three basic factors which must coincide if jurisdiction is to be entertained by courts of this state over nonresident individuals and foreign corporations are (1) the nonresident defendant or foreign corporation must purposely do some act or consummate some transaction in the state, (2) the cause of action must arise from, or be connected with, such act or transaction, and (3) the assumption of jurisdiction by the state must not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice, consideration being given to the quality, nature and extent of activity in this state, the relative convenience of the parties, the benefits and protection of the laws of this state afforded the respective parties, and the basic equities of the situation.

       While the statute forbidding access by foreign corporations to the courts of the state because of their failure to comply with statutory provisions for doing business is strictly construed so that exclusion from access to the courts of the state requires a strong showing that the statute has been violated, the statute providing for services on a designated agent where, without a compliance with the statute, a corporation has undertaken to do business in state is liberally construed since otherwise citizens of a state would be forced to resort to another jurisdiction in order to maintain suits against foreign corporations as to matters arising out of transactions had within the statute.

       Change of status of defendant from that of resident of this state at time of entering into contract on which suit is brought to that of nonresident at time suit is filed does not affect validity of service of process under this section [Code 1942, § 1438] when defendant is still engaged in same business within state.

       Trial court erred in granting a limited liability company’s (LLC) motion to dismiss due to lack of personal jurisdiction because it was “doing business” within the State under the long-arm statute; the LLC collaborated with a corporation about creating a sports-training facility in the State, communicated and planned furthering its formation, participated in meetings in the State, substantially participated in the creation of a Mississippi company, and became members of that company.

       It is no longer necessary, in a products liability claim, to determine whether the manufacturer is “doing business”, as interpreted by earlier Mississippi decisions, to render the nonresident manufacturer subject to suit and jurisdiction under the state’s “long-arm” statute.

       A New Orleans television broadcasting station whose programs were regularly heard by thousands of residents of the Mississippi Gulf coast area, which regularly reported news events in that area, solicited advertising there, and carried advertising by New Orleans stores directed especially toward Gulf coast residents, had sufficient minimum contacts in Mississippi to be amenable to process under this section [Code 1942, § 1437].

       An action initiated in a Virginia federal district court by railroad companies against, among others, two car leasing companies for damages sustained as a result of a derailment occurring in Mississippi, would be transferred to a Mississippi federal court, where one of the companies leased cars with 6% of its lease revenue attributable to miles traveled over Mississippi tracks, and the other leasing company systematically solicited and did business within Mississippi and filed annual sales tax returns in Mississippi, and where, in both instances, such contacts were directly involved with the alleged cause of action; the contacts being sufficient to make the defendant leasing companies amenable, constitutionally, to service of process under the Mississippi “long arm” statute.

       Where a Wisconsin corporate manufacturer had 10 distributors in Mississippi, made substantial sales to its distributors, sent an average of 17 employees into the state each year to give assistance to its distributors, had several pieces of equipment operating within the state, extended and secured credit within the state and made contracts with its distributors, giving it considerable control over their activities, the corporation was “doing business” in Mississippi within the “long-arm” and “doing business” statutes. Hyde Constr. Co. v. Koehring Co., 321 F. Supp. 1193, 1969 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13680 (D. Miss. 1969).

       Neither the fact that a manufacturer of equipment sold its products to Mississippi distributors or wholesalers, nor the fact that the manufacturer had employees on an average of 17 or 18 per year visiting within Mississippi to give assistance to the distributors in the sale of equipment manufactured by it and to help repair and adjust such equipment, standing alone, would compel a finding that the manufacturer is or was “doing business” within the state of Mississippi under the provisions of Code 1942, § 1437 or Code 1942, § 5345.

       A nonresident individual who sold a portable elevator to a resident of Mississippi, and, through his agents and in his own truck, delivered it to the purchaser in Mississippi, had prior to sale assembled the elevator at his premises in Tennessee, and who over a period of 10 or 15 years made 15 percent of his total gross sales to residents of Mississippi, and who, in connection with these sales, it was his common practice to go to the customer’s home within the state to appraise property offered as trade-in on new equipment and delivered the merchandise within that state, was amenable to process under this section [Code 1942, § 1437].

       A nonresident individual whose agents, trucks, and other property were brought into Mississippi in the ordinary course of his business, had contacts within that state which were purposeful, continuous, and systematic activities, and rendered him amenable to process, despite the fact that he maintained no telephone listing, bank account, office, warehouse, or storage facilities there.

       Although it conducted occasional demonstrations of its products and sent complaint investigators into the state, a foreign corporation which had salesmen in the state doing promotional and sales work but who had no authority to close sales, and maintained no plant or sales office within the state, was not doing business in the state so as to subject it to the jurisdiction of the state court.

       In determining whether a corporation is doing business in the state, each case must be decided upon its peculiar facts. Jarrard Motors, Inc. v. Jackson Auto & Supply Co., 237 Miss. 660, 115 So. 2d 309, 1959 Miss. LEXIS 517 (Miss. 1959).
      </p>
      <p>
       Fact that under contract nonresident automotive distributors possessed almost absolute control over the method and manner of doing business by resident dealer, together with the failure of the nonresident distributors to comply with Code 1942, §§ 8072 and 8073, established that nonresident distributors were doing business within the state. Jarrard Motors, Inc. v. Jackson Auto & Supply Co., 237 Miss. 660, 115 So. 2d 309, 1959 Miss. LEXIS 517 (Miss. 1959).

       Under this section [Code 1942, § 1437] authorizing substituted service of process on foreign corporations doing business within state without having qualified therefor, jurisdiction is not conferred on a single act or acts, but a series of acts amounting to a continuity is required.

      <p>
       A less strict interpretation of the phrase doing business, is applied where there is an issue of whether a state board has jurisdiction, than is applied where the statute involved is one stating that a corporation must qualify before doing business in order to have access to the courts of state. Davis-Wood Lumber Co. v. Ladner, 210 Miss. 863, 50 So. 2d 615, 1951 Miss. LEXIS 322 (Miss. 1951).

       Where a corporation has entered the state through its agent and is engaged in carrying on and transacting through them a substantial part of its ordinary business on the regular basis, it is doing business within the state so as to be subject to process.

       Where a lumber company, a Louisiana corporation, executed in this state a contract for the manufacture of lumber and the contract was wholly performed in this state and also the contract involved continuous substantial series of transactions covering a period of two years during which the lumber company sent its trucks into the state several times each week to pick up the timber, the lumber company was doing business within the statute providing for service against nonresident corporation doing business in the state.

       To constitute a foreign corporation doing business in a particular jurisdiction, the business must be of such nature and character as to warrant the inference that the corporation has subjected itself to the local jurisdiction, and is by its duly authorized officers or agents present within the state where the service of process is attempted. Lee v. Memphis Pub. Co., 195 Miss. 264, 14 So. 2d 351, 1943 Miss. LEXIS 133 (Miss. 1943).

       Maintenance by a foreign newspaper corporation of a news-gathering office in the state, the employment of a resident contract man to recommend suitable persons to become local distributors in the state, and a contract with a truck operator to transport its papers into the state for sale and distribution by local distributor, did not constitute “doing business” in the state so as to make such corporation amenable to service of process in the state.

       Circuit court properly denied an insurer’s motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction because the insurer waived its defense, and the long-arm statute was irrelevant; the insurer’s implied consented to the State’s jurisdiction created an independent basis for jurisdiction.

       Because a nonresident paramour’s actions allegedly broke up a wife’s Mississippi marriage, the long-arm statute’s language was sufficiently broad enough to bring the paramour within its scope; however, since the wife did not meet her burden of showing the paramour had the constitutionally required purposeful minimum contacts in Mississippi, the circuit court erred in denying the paramour’s motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction.

However, the complaint did not allege that any of the acts relating to a claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress occurred in Mississippi or that the sexual activity that occurred in Mississippi inflicted emotional distress.

Considering the interests of Mississippi in providing a forum for legal redress for residents who were negligently injured by out-of-state physicians, the court found that the circuit court’s assumption of personal jurisdiction over the physician comported with traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice and did not offend U.S. Const. amend. XIV. Estate of Jones v. Phillips, 992 So. 2d 1131, 2008 Miss. LEXIS 420 (Miss. 2008).

   Trial court erred in dismissing the homeowners’ claims alleging that the original owners knew of a home’s defects at the time they sold it to the subsequent owners because the assertion that the original owners committed a Mississippi tort sustained personal jurisdiction under Miss.

   Mississippi attorney’s breach of contract suit, filed in a Mississippi federal district court against Louisiana and Pennsylvania attorneys seeking payment for litigation services, was transferred under the Fifth Circuit’s first-to-file rule to a Louisiana federal district court in which defendants had previously filed a declaratory judgment action raising similar issues, even though Mississippi was a proper venue under 28 U.S.C.S. § 1391(a) because some of the acts sued upon took place there, the court had long-arm personal jurisdiction over defendants under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t13c03s13-3-57" target="_self">13-3-57</a></cite>, and Mississippi was a convenient forum under 28 U.S.C.S. § 1404(a). Street v. Smith, 456 F.

   Where the tort and its resultant injuries occurred within Mississippi, the court’s exercise of personal jurisdiction over defendants was comfortably within the contours of the “tort prong” of Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t13c03s13-3-57" target="_self">13-3-57</a></cite>; the allegedly defective pipe collapsing completed the tort (damage requirement) and created numerous economic effects (costs associated with the collapsing pipe and subsequent redrilling of the oil well).

   Court denied defendants’ motion to dismiss a physician’s breach of contract action for lack of personal jurisdiction because the fact that defendants sent an agent into Mississippi to help execute an additional portion of the contract was sufficient to satisfy the contract prong of the Mississippi long-arm statute, Miss.

   Employees claimed that the court could assert personal jurisdiction over the manufacturer, a foreign corporation with no contacts in the forum state, because it was insufficiently separate from its subsidiary, which did have contacts in the forum state; however, the manufacturer’s vice-president stated that the manufacturer was a holding company incorporated under the laws of Ohio, and the subsidiary was separately and adequately capitalized and the manufacturer did not pay the subsidiary’s expenses. Thus, the contacts between the manufacturer and its subsidiary were insufficient to satisfy Mississippi’s long arm statute, Miss.

   Where the employees attached a one-page sheet from the manufacturer’s website, which showed the name of the fabricator, among others, the document clearly did not provide evidence of contacts between the fabricator and the forum state sufficient for the exercise of personal jurisdiction under Miss.

   In a negligence action by property owners in Mississippi regarding flooding, Mississippi had a strong interest in adjudicating the dispute because Mississippi residents were injured, Mississippi property was destroyed, and the City of Mobile, Alabama, and the Board of Water &amp; Sewer Commissioners of the City of Mobile continued to release water from the subject reservoir. Also, the interest of the hundreds of other Mississippi property owners in obtaining convenient and effective relief was furthered by keeping the suit in Mississippi because their property was located in the county where the suit was filed; maintenance of the suit did not offend “traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice,” and application of the “long-arm” statute in the case did not violate the United States Constitution. Horne v. Mobile Area Water &amp; Sewer Sys., 897 So. 2d 972, 2004 Miss. LEXIS 846 (Miss. 2004), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">544 U.S. 922</cite>, <cite class="s_court">125 S.

       Where Louisiana auto dealer’s radio ads reached into Mississippi, it sold autos to Mississippi residents, and it contracted with plaintiff bank in Mississippi, its minimum contacts with Mississippi allowed that state to exercise personal jurisdiction over the dealer; moreover, since the dealer’s facilities were not far from the forum, it was not unfair to force it to defend in Mississippi.

       In a Jones Act case, the trial court had jurisdiction over a non-resident defendant that had numerous employees from Mississippi and recruited employees from Mississippi by advertising in that state; further, the fact that the defendant had entered into a contract with the plaintiff in Mississippi was alone sufficient to subject the defendant to the personal jurisdiction of the Mississippi courts.

       In an action arising from the purchase from the defendant by the plaintiff of tubing that was to be regularly used as production tubing for down-hole use in oil wells and saltwater disposal wells, two defendants who previously purchased and resold the tubing at issue were not subject to personal jurisdiction in Mississippi where both were foreign corporations, neither had any dealings with the plaintiff in Mississippi or elsewhere, and the transactions in which they sold the tubing occurred outside Mississippi.

       The defendant nonresident corporation was entitled to dismissal of the complaint because the court had no basis for asserting personal jurisdiction over it, notwithstanding that the alleged tort was committed partly in Mississippi where the plaintiff was residing when he discovered an allegedly erroneous credit report by the defendant, since the defendant did not have minimum contacts with Mississippi and did not purposely avail itself of the benefits and privileges of the state.

   The Mississippi long-arm statute did not allow a federal district court sitting in Mississippi to take jurisdiction over the defendant because the plaintiff, as a nonresident of Mississippi, could not take advantage of the contract portion of the Mississippi long-arm statute and any tort committed by the defendant was committed solely in Mexico.

       In an action arising from the plaintiff’s purchase of an airplane engine from an Arkansas corporation, the Arkansas corporation was not subject to jurisdiction in Mississippi since (1) no part of the contract between the parties was performed in whole or in part by either party in Mississippi, (2) no element of the alleged tortious conduct took place in Mississippi, (3) the defendants did not have a presence in Mississippi which was continuing and substantial in nature, (4) the defendants did not have sufficient minimum contacts with Mississippi such that maintaining the action would not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice, and (5) the defendants did not have continuous and systematic contacts with Mississippi such that due process was satisfied.

       § 13-3-63.
    Service when defendant is nonresident motorist; appointment of secretary of state as agent.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The acceptance by a nonresident of the rights and privileges conferred by the provisions of this section, as evidenced by his operating, either in person or by agent or employee, a motor vehicle upon any public street, road or highway of this state, or elsewhere in this state, or the operation by a nonresident of a motor vehicle on any public street, road or highway of this state, or elsewhere in this state, other than under this section, shall be deemed equivalent to an appointment by such nonresident of the Secretary of State of the State of Mississippi to be his true and lawful attorney, upon whom may be served all lawful processes or summonses in any action or proceeding against him, growing out of any accident or collision in which said nonresident may be involved while operating a motor vehicle on such street, road or highway, or elsewhere in this state, and said acceptance or operation shall be a signification of his agreement that any such process or summons against him which is so served shall be of the same legal force and validity as if served on him personally. Service of such process or summons shall be made by the sheriff of Hinds County, upon prepayment of the fees to which he is entitled by law, by serving two (2) copies of the process or summons for each nonresident defendant, with a fee of Fifteen Dollars ($15.00) for each such defendant on the Secretary of State or by leaving two (2) copies of said process or summons with the fee in the office of the Secretary of State, and such service shall be service upon said nonresident defendant with the same force and effect as if such nonresident had been personally served with such process or summons within the State of Mississippi. One (1) of the copies of such process or summons shall be preserved by the Secretary of State as a record of his office. Notice of such service, together with a copy of the process or summons, shall be mailed forthwith as certified or registered mail, restricted for delivery to addressee only and with postage prepaid, by the Secretary of State to each such nonresident defendant at his last known address, which address shall be written on the process or summons upon the issuance thereof by the clerk of the court wherein the action is pending, or notice of such service and copy of process or summons actually shall be delivered to the said defendant. The defendant’s return receipt or evidence of defendant’s refusal to accept delivery of such certified or registered mail, in case such notice and copy of process or summons are sent by certified or registered mail, or affidavit of the person delivering such notice and copy of process or summons, in case such notice and copy of process or summons actually are delivered, shall be filed in the court wherein such action is pending before judgment can be entered against such nonresident defendant. The Secretary of State, upon receipt of such return receipt or evidence of the refusal of such defendant to accept delivery of such certified or registered mail, shall promptly return same to the clerk of the court wherein such action is pending, and the said clerk of the court shall promptly file and preserve same among the records of such action or proceeding. The court in which the action is pending may order such continuance as may be necessary to afford the defendant reasonable opportunity to defend the action.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any cause of action arising out of such accident or collision against any such nonresident, in case of the death of such nonresident, shall survive against his administrator, executor or other personal representative of his estate, and service of all necessary and lawful process or summons, when had or obtained upon any such nonresident owner, nonresident operator or agent or employee, or upon the executor, administrator or other legal representative of the estate of such nonresident owner or nonresident operator, in the manner as hereinbefore provided, for the service of all lawful processes or summonses, herein, shall be deemed sufficient service of process or summons to give any court of this state, in which such action may be filed in accordance with the statutes of the State of Mississippi, jurisdiction over the cause of action and over the nonresident owner, nonresident operator or agent or employee, or the nonresident executor, or administrator of such nonresident owner or nonresident operator, defendant or defendants, and shall warrant and authorize personal judgment against such nonresident owner, nonresident operator, agent, employee, executor or administrator or other legal representative of the estate of such nonresident owner or nonresident operator, defendant or defendants, in the event the plaintiff in such cause of action shall prevail.
     </p>
     <p>
      The agency or relationship created under the provisions of this section by and between the nonresident owner or nonresident operator of a motor vehicle operating upon the public road, street or highway of this state, or elsewhere in this state, as hereinbefore set forth, in the event of the death of such nonresident owner or nonresident operator of such motor vehicle, shall survive and continue and extend to his executor, administrator or other legal representative of his estate, and the Secretary of State of the State of Mississippi shall be in the same position and relationship with respect to the executor, administrator or other legal representative of the estate of such nonresident owner or nonresident operator of such motor vehicle, as he was in or would have been in with the nonresident owner or nonresident operator of said motor vehicle, had such nonresident owner or nonresident operator survived, and in any action arising or growing out of such accident or collision in which such nonresident owner or nonresident operator of a motor vehicle may be involved while operating a motor vehicle on such street, road or highway or elsewhere in this state, where the nonresident owner or nonresident operator of such motor vehicle has died prior to the commencement of an action against him because of or growing out of such accident or collision, service of process or summons may be had or made upon the nonresident executor, administrator or other legal representative of the estate of such nonresident owner or operator of the motor vehicle involved in such accident or collision, in the same manner and upon the same notice as hereinbefore provided in the case of process or summons upon the nonresident owner or nonresident operator of such motor vehicle. When such process or summons is served, made or had against the nonresident executor or administrator or such nonresident owner or such nonresident operator of such motor vehicle involved in such accident or collision, it shall be deemed sufficient service of such summons or process to give any court in this state in which such action may be filed, in accordance with the provisions of the statutes of the State of Mississippi, jurisdiction over the cause of action and over such nonresident executor or administrator of such nonresident owner or operator of such motor vehicle insofar as such cause of action is involved.
     </p>
     <p>
      The provisions of this section shall likewise apply to any person who is a nonresident at the time any action or proceeding is commenced against him, even though said person was a resident at the time any action or proceeding accrued against him.

   Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t13c03s13-3-63" target="_self">13-3-63</a></cite> is not the exclusive method by which nonresident motorists have to be served because §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t13c03s13-3-63" target="_self">13-3-63</a></cite> merely provides an alternative method to serve a particular class of out-of-state defendants; even if the statute provided an exclusive method of service, it would conflict with Miss.

       <p>
   Where plaintiffs delivered copies of a summons and complaint to the Mississippi Secretary of State who in turn sent the documents to a nonresident motorist by certified mail, restricted delivery, but the documents were returned to the Secretary as unclaimed, such service was insufficient to permit entry of a default judgment against the nonresident; despite case law indicating that service was complete upon delivery to the Secretary, Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t13c03s13-3-63" target="_self">13-3-63</a></cite> clearly stated that judgment could not be entered against the nonresident until the return receipt was filed with the court, indicating that the nonresident either received or refused delivery of the documents. Arceneaux v. Davidson, 325 F. Supp. 2d 742, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13333 (S.D. Miss. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Circuit Court properly ordered examination of judgment debtor and production of documents in county where suit was filed, where judgment debtor had waived its right to argue that it could not be found in that county, and thus statute concerning examination of judgment debtor by judgment creditor was construed consistently with venue already established for trial of action. H & W Transfer & Cartage Service, Inc. v. Griffin, 511 So. 2d 895, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2610 (Miss. 1987).

   The Federal Motor Carrier Act § 221(c), which provides that every motor carrier shall file in each state in which it operates a designation of a person to receive service on its behalf, does not preempt §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t13c03s13-3-63" target="_self">13-3-63</a></cite> and service may be made upon a non-resident motor carrier under either statute.

      <p>
       Where the notice of service of a non-resident corporation was delivered to the president of the corporation in accord with statutory requirements, and an interlocutory default judgment was entered upon failure of the defendant to answer, the default judgment could not be set aside on the grounds that the president of the corporation mislaid the notice due to anxiety over his wife’s recent death. Western Chain Co. v. Brownlee, 317 So. 2d 418, 1975 Miss. LEXIS 1758 (Miss. 1975).
      </p>
      <p>
       The jurisdiction of the court under this statute is not restricted to suits by Mississippi residents, and the circuit court had jurisdiction over a suit arising out of an accident which occurred in Mississippi even though the suit did not involve the interests or rights of any resident of Mississippi. Vick v. Cochran, 316 So. 2d 242, 1975 Miss. LEXIS 1705 (Miss. 1975).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where default judgment in non-resident motorist case was entered on the first day of a scheduled two week return term, and, upon learning of decision, counsel for defendants promptly filed motion to set aside default judgment in which they set forth a meritorious defense, judgment should have been set aside and the case set for trial on its merits either immediately or on a day certain within the remainder of the term. Martin v. Palmertree, 312 So. 2d 447, 1975 Miss. LEXIS 1645 (Miss. 1975).

       Under Code 1942, § 1438, providing that service of process made upon the secretary of state shall be made in the same manner and by the same procedure and with the same force and effect as is provided by the nonresident motorist statute as amended and supplemented, service can be made pursuant to a subsequently inserted provision of the nonresident motorist statute, Code 1942, § 9352-61, so as to permit service upon any person who is a nonresident at the time the action is filed, even though at the time of the incident giving rise to the action, such person was a resident of Mississippi. McKnight v. Dyer, 331 F. Supp. 343, 1971 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12274 (N.D. Miss. 1971).
      </p>

       This section [Code 1942, § 9352-61] is strictly construed and the provisions thereof must be followed to give the court jurisdiction over a nonresident. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Stewart, 209 So. 2d 438, 1968 Miss. LEXIS 1448 (Miss. 1968).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section [Code 1942, § 9352-61] reflects the legislature’s intent to create a service of process tantamount for all purposes to personal service. Ellis v. Milner, 194 So. 2d 232, 1967 Miss. LEXIS 1406 (Miss. 1967).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section [Code 1942, § 9352-61] has the purpose of placing a nonresident motorist summoned under it on a parity with a resident in all respects, it requires the nonresident using state highways to consent to service of process upon the secretary of state, it puts nonresidents on the same footing as residents in litigation of accidents growing out of the use of state highways, and they have equal procedural rights with residents once the prescribed service of process has been effected. Ellis v. Milner, 194 So. 2d 232, 1967 Miss. LEXIS 1406 (Miss. 1967).
      </p>
      <p>
       The term “personal representative” as used in this section [Code 1942, § 9352-61] is the equivalent of “legal representative,” and is intended to include persons such as the administrator or executor of a nonresident deceased motorist. Hill v. James, 252 Miss. 501, 175 So. 2d 176, 1965 Miss. LEXIS 1126 (Miss. 1965).

      <p>
       A Mississippi court does not acquire jurisdiction of the nonresident widow and minor children of a deceased out-of-state motorist sued in their individual capacities under the survival provisions of this section [Code 1942, § 9352-61] which apply only to the administrator, executor, or other legal representative of the decedent. Hill v. James, 252 Miss. 501, 175 So. 2d 176, 1965 Miss. LEXIS 1126 (Miss. 1965).

       This provision, being in derogation of the common law, should be strictly construed. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Tillman, 249 Miss. 141, 161 So. 2d 604, 1964 Miss. LEXIS 383 (Miss. 1964).
      </p>
      <p>
       The basic purposes of the statute are to subject to the jurisdiction of the Mississippi court nonresidents concerned in the operation of motor vehicles in Mississippi, in order that its citizens may assert in its courts any proper claims against such persons, and to afford a nonresident defendant the opportunity to adequately defend an accident suit. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Tillman, 249 Miss. 141, 161 So. 2d 604, 1964 Miss. LEXIS 383 (Miss. 1964).

       This is a procedural statute, remedial in nature, and as such to be given a liberal construction. Stroo v. Farmer, 200 F. Supp. 344, 1961 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2899 (S.D. Miss. 1961).

      <p>
       Where a truck from another state which had carried a load of hay to a Mississippi destination was, at the time of the accident, standing in a barn on private property while the driver was still in his seat and the engine was running, this section [Code 1942, § 9352-61] applied regardless of whether the wheels of the truck were turning or not. Stroo v. Farmer, 200 F. Supp. 344, 1961 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2899 (S.D. Miss. 1961).
      </p>
      <p>
       The purpose of this section [Code 1942, § 9352-61] is to subject to the jurisdiction of the Mississippi courts nonresidents concerned in the operation of automobiles within the state within the terms of the statute, so that its citizens may assert as against such persons their claims in local courts. Tanksley v. Dodge, 181 F.2d 925, 1950 U.S. App. LEXIS 2724 (5th Cir. Miss. 1950).
      </p>
      <p>
       The word “operation” includes all means and extent of use of the highways of Mississippi which nonresidents may acquire under the terms of the statute, and also any similar manner of use even though the privilege be not obtained precisely in accordance with the general statutory provisions; and, it, therefore, as a basis of acquiring jurisdiction, brings within its reach a nonresident owner in whose behalf the motor vehicle is driven over the Mississippi highways. Tanksley v. Dodge, 181 F.2d 925, 1950 U.S. App. LEXIS 2724 (5th Cir. Miss. 1950).
      </p>
      <p>
       A distinction is made between “operator” and “driver”; the operator is recognized to be the owner operating the motor vehicle, and while the driver is recognized as also operating, he is the person actually driving at any given time. Tanksley v. Dodge, 181 F.2d 925, 1950 U.S. App. LEXIS 2724 (5th Cir. Miss. 1950).

   In a matter arising out of a high speed chase, which allegedly resulted in decedents’ deaths, neither an Alabama county or that county’s sheriff from Alabama entered upon the highways of Mississippi, involving themselves in efforts to stop the fleeing felons, or in any other way subjected themselves to jurisdiction under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t13c03s13-3-63" target="_self">13-3-63</a></cite>; therefore, the supreme court proceeded with a long-arm analysis to determine if jurisdiction could be conferred upon them under the Mississippi long-arm statute, Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t13c03s13-3-57" target="_self">13-3-57</a></cite>, and the supreme court found no minimum contacts, so the county and the sheriff were not subject to personal jurisdiction in Mississippi.

       A nonresident owner of an automobile who operates it, or causes it to be operated by another, over the highways of the state of Mississippi, subjects himself, within the terms of the statute, to service of process which is sufficient to require him to defend a suit upon the merits.

       Nonresident seller of automobiles who procured drivers, as purchaser’s agent, to deliver cars sold to purchaser residing in another state was neither operator nor driver within this section [Code 1942, § 9352-61]; and, therefore, he was not subject to substituted service of process in death action resulting from an accident involving one of the cars on a Mississippi highway.

       Circuit court erred in dismissing a driver’s personal injury complaint with prejudice because the driver exhibited good cause for not timely serving process on the insured where the record clearly showed that over a period of almost two years, the driver unsuccessfully attempted to locate the insured, the Secretary of State attempted to forward the summons to the insured, but it was returned unclaimed, the insured could not be located by the driver, the courts, or his own insurance carrier, and the circuit court failed to consider that the statute of limitations could be tolled.

   A nonresident defendant was not entitled to dismissal of an action arising from a motor vehicle accident based on the provision of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t13c03s13-3-63" target="_self">13-3-63</a></cite> which requires that notice of service of process on the secretary of state actually be delivered to the nonresident defendant, although he did not concede that he had received a copy of the summons and complaint, where he had actual knowledge of the commencement of the suit, the basis of the suit, and the identity of the other defendants in the action. Wesley v. Mississippi Transp. Comm'n, 857 F. Supp. 523, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10036 (S.D. Miss. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       Notice to a nonresident motorist by one of the three methods provided by this section [Code 1942, § 9352-61] is essential to confer jurisdiction upon the local courts. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Stewart, 209 So. 2d 438, 1968 Miss. LEXIS 1448 (Miss. 1968).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section [Code 1942, § 9352-61] provides three methods for the service of process upon a nonresident, and it is essential to due process that a nonresident defendant be given notice of the action against him in accordance with the provisions of the section. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Stewart, 209 So. 2d 438, 1968 Miss. LEXIS 1448 (Miss. 1968).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where it appears conclusively that the notice intended for a nonresident motorist was forwarded to an address which did not exist, that there was no return receipt from the defendant, no evidence of refusal of the letter by him, nor any evidence of actual delivery of the process to him, a default judgment entered by the court against such defendant was void. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Stewart, 209 So. 2d 438, 1968 Miss. LEXIS 1448 (Miss. 1968).
      </p>
      <p>
       The general rule is that substituted service of process is complete when made upon the designated state official, and therefore receipt by the nonresident defendant of the specified notice of such service is not the determinative date for completion of process. Ellis v. Milner, 194 So. 2d 232, 1967 Miss. LEXIS 1406 (Miss. 1967).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where there was a passage of over a month between the date of service on the secretary of state and the rendition of a default judgment against a nonresident defendant, and he had no one file pleadings for him in the court or make any other representation, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in entering a default judgment. Ellis v. Milner, 194 So. 2d 232, 1967 Miss. LEXIS 1406 (Miss. 1967).
      </p>
      <p>
       Service under this section [Code 1942, § 9352-61] by mailing a summons to defendant at his correct address is good although another address is stated in the summons, and the name given therein was an alias. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Tillman, 249 Miss. 141, 161 So. 2d 604, 1964 Miss. LEXIS 383 (Miss. 1964).

       Upon consideration of a motion to quash service of summons in a death action growing out of an automobile accident, the question is whether the allegations of the complaint and the facts of the case as disclosed show that the defendant brought before the court is such a defendant as is subjected by the statute to substituted service of process.

       Under the Alabama nonresident motorist statute, the Alabama court had jurisdiction where both parties were nonresidents and the judgment is entitled to full faith and credit in Mississippi. Burns v. Godwin, 211 Miss. 310, 51 So. 2d 486, 1951 Miss. LEXIS 357 (Miss. 1951).
      </p>
      <p>
       The constitutionality of this statute is affirmed. Bouchillon v. Jordan, 40 F. Supp. 354, 1941 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2937 (D. Miss. 1941).
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that no venue is provided in the act itself does not render the act as so unreasonable as to offend any part of the constitution. Bouchillon v. Jordan, 40 F. Supp. 354, 1941 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2937 (D. Miss. 1941).
      </p>
      <p>
       In cases not within the operation of Chapter 246 of the Act of 1940 fixing the venue in the county where the cause of action accrues, the proper venue of an action commenced as provided in this statute is the county where the secretary of state resides. Bouchillon v. Jordan, 40 F. Supp. 354, 1941 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2937 (D. Miss. 1941).

       The failure of the circuit clerk to affix his signature to a venire facias is merely an irregularity amendable by motion and a motion to quash dispenses with amendment where the writ has already served its purpose. Hale v. State, 72 Miss. 140, 16 So. 387, 1894 Miss. LEXIS 88 (Miss. 1894).

     <p>
      The sheriff or other proper officer of a county may execute process out of his county, in case the person to be served or property to be seized was in the officer’s county when the writ was received, but had removed or been carried into another county before its execution. In such case the officer shall state the facts in his return, and the writ and return shall have the same effect as if the process had been returned not executed and a testatum or duplicate writ had been issued to and executed and returned by an officer of the county where served.

       No reversible error was found in trial judge excluding testimony directed toward identity of person who actually served summons; one acting generally as deputy sheriff, under written appointment from sheriff, although not having qualified according to law, is de facto officer and between third parties his actions are valid; and, in absence of proof to contrary, it is presumed that person whose name was appended to return on writ as special deputy was duly authorized as such. Pointer v. Huffman, 509 So. 2d 870, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2583 (Miss. 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       A motion by plaintiff to permit an amendment to the return of service of process to show that the person served was defendant’s designated agent for accepting service of process was improperly denied where the testimony of deputy sheriff who executed the summons was competent to amend his return for such purposes and where such an amendment would be a ministerial act permitted by this section.

       Where a judgment by default has been rendered at the return term upon a return of personal service of a summons apparently regular such judgment may, at a subsequent term, be vacated by a motion showing that the return was false and that the summons had only been served four days before its return day, and the court will direct an issue of fact to try the truth of the return. If the motion be sustained, the suit will be a pending one. Meyer Bros. v. Whitehead, 62 Miss. 387, 1884 Miss. LEXIS 90 (Miss. 1884).
      </p>
      <p>
       The statute clearly contemplates that the party objecting to the return in a pending action should plead the facts in the nature of a plea in abatement. A mere motion to set aside should be overruled and testimony thereon refused. Mayfield v. Barnard, 43 Miss. 270, 1870 Miss. LEXIS 36 (Miss. 1870).

   Similar legislation in Texas, forbidding the defendant to come into court and challenge the validity of service upon him in a personal action, without surrendering himself to the jurisdiction of the court, has been held not to deprive him of liberty or property within the prohibition of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution.

      If any person subpoenaed as a witness shall fail to appear and attend as required, an attachment shall be issued by order of the court or other authority before which he was subpoenaed to appear, returnable at such time as the court or authority may appoint. The court or authority shall, on ordering the attachment, direct whether the witness shall enter into bond for his appearance, and in what sum, and whether with or without sureties, which bond the sheriff, or other officer by whom the attachment is executed, is authorized to take, payable to the state. In case the witness shall appear in answer to the attachment, the court may discharge him therefrom, on good cause shown, or may require him to enter into recognizance or bond for his appearance until discharged, to testify in the cause. In case the witness shall not appear, in pursuance of his recognizance or bond, the same proceedings shall be had as upon the forfeiture of a recognizance in a criminal case.

       An execution issued to the sheriff of another county by the clerk of a circuit court, on a duly enrolled judgment of a justice of the peace of his county, returnable before such justice, is not authorized by this section (Code 1892, § 3459), but is void.

      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      In case of the levy of an execution or attachment on the stock, shares, or interest of the defendant in any corporation or joint stock company, the officer shall go to the office or principal place of business of the corporation or company, and there declare that he attaches or levies upon the stock, shares, or interest of the defendant therein at the suit of the plaintiff. The officer shall demand of any officer, agent, or clerk of such corporation or company there present, and who is not the defendant, a statement in writing, under oath, of the amount of the defendant’s stock, the number of his shares, or extent of his interest in such corporation or company, and shall leave with the officer, agent, or clerk, a copy of the writ. If no such officer, agent, or clerk be present, the officer shall post conspicuously at such office or place of business a copy of the writ, with a statement therewith that he has attached or levied upon the stock, shares, or interest of the defendant at the suit of the plaintiff, and that he demands of the corporation or company the statement, under oath, of the defendant’s stock, share, or interest therein. The stock, shares, and interest of the defendant in the corporation or company, including all dividends that may accrue after such levy, shall be bound by the lien of the execution or attachment. The corporation or company shall, within a reasonable time, not longer than ten days after the levy, deliver to the officer a statement in writing, under oath, of the particulars demanded by the officer, and of the value of the defendant’s stock, shares, or interest, and in case the corporation or company shall neglect or refuse to do so, or shall wilfully make any false statement thereof, such corporation or company shall be liable to the plaintiff for the full amount of the judgment or decree, or of such judgment as the plaintiff shall recover if the process be an attachment. The failure of the corporation or company to make such statement shall not affect the right of the officer to sell the stock, shares, or interest of the defendant.

       § 13-3-157.
    When a bond of indemnity shall be required.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      If the sheriff shall levy an execution, attachment, or writ of seizure for the purchase-money on any personal property, and a doubt shall arise whether the right to the property be in the defendant or not, the sheriff may demand of the plaintiff a bond with sufficient sureties, payable to the officer, in a penalty equal to double the value of the property, conditioned that the obligors therein will indemnify and save harmless the officer against all damages which he may sustain in consequence of the seizure or sale of the property, and will pay to and satisfy any person claiming title to the property all damages which such person may sustain in consequence of the seizure or sale. If such bond be not given on or before the day of the sale or the return day of the attachment, the sheriff shall be justified in releasing the levy and delivering the property to the party from whose possession it was taken; but the plaintiff or his agent or attorney shall have reasonable notice, in writing, before the day of sale or return day of the writ, that the bond is required.
     </p>
     <p>
      However, in instances where a warrant is issued by the Chairman of the State Tax Commission, as the commissioner, under the authority of any statute by which such commissioner is authorized to issue such warrants, and where the officer to whom such warrant is directed shall demand of the commissioner an indemnifying bond under the circumstances and conditions hereinbefore provided, the commissioner is hereby authorized to execute such indemnifying bond demanded and pay all obligations which may accrue by reason of the execution of such bond out of the funds appropriated by the Legislature to defray the expenses of the State Tax Commission.

   The requirement, under a former enactment of this provision (Code 1871, § 846), that execution sales be made at the county courthouse was not made applicable by the Conformity Act to execution of sales of personal property by a United States marshal and an execution sale may therefore be made at the courthouse of the United States where the judgment was rendered and the execution issued. Yazoo &amp; M. V. R. Co. v. Clarksdale, <cite class="us_code">257 U.S. 10</cite>, <cite class="s_court">42 S. Ct. 27</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">66 L. Ed. 104</cite>, 1921 U.S. LEXIS 1309 (U.S. 1921).

       <p>
   As a general rule United States marshals in making sales of land under execution are required (U. S. Rev. Stat., § 914, 28 USC § 724) to conform to the laws of the state governing the subject of such sales and they must be made at the place provided by the law of the state for sheriff’s sales of land under execution.

   The word “place” in a statute (Act of Congress Feb. 16, 1838), authorizing marshal’s sales of land under execution in Mississippi to be made upon written request of defendant “at the place where the United States court for the district is holden” does not mean any place in the town or city where the court was held, but a particular place in which the court held its sittings.

   In a partition action, the chancellor’s award of attorney’s fees payable by the appealing parties, and assessed against the sale proceeds, was error, as there was no evidence that said fees were reasonable and there was no bad faith shown. Further, as to notice of the sale, Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t13c03s13-3-163" target="_self">13-3-163</a></cite> did not apply where the chancellor gave specific instruction for terms of the sale pursuant to Miss.

   A sheriff’s sale was in compliance with the ten day advertisement requirements of Code 1972 §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t13c03s13-3-165" target="_self">13-3-165</a></cite>, where the first notice was posted on November 14, 1975, and the sale occurred on November 24, 1975; the provisions of Code 1972 §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.01.html#t01c03s1-3-67" target="_blank">1-3-67</a></cite> prescribe the applicable formula for computing such ten day period, in that the first day is to be excluded and the last included.

      <p>
       Posted notices of the time and place of public sale of a repossessed automobile which comply with the provisions of this section [Code 1942, § 1926] are the only form of notice the seller is required to give the buyer, and notice to the buyer of the time and place of sale by means of a letter is not necessary. Ward v. McPhail Oldsmobile, Inc., 203 So. 2d 491, 1967 Miss. LEXIS 1378 (Miss. 1967).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the retained title contract provided that the seller could purchase an automobile at public sale, the sale at which the seller purchased the repossessed vehicle was valid. Ward v. McPhail Oldsmobile, Inc., 203 So. 2d 491, 1967 Miss. LEXIS 1378 (Miss. 1967).
      </p>
      <p>
       The seller of an automobile, under the terms of a retained title contract, has a right to sell the repossessed automobile at public sale, either in the county where the contract was made and where the automobile was returned to the seller by the finance company, or in the county of the residence of the purchaser.

       Fact that sheriff gave only eight days’ notice of sale of merchandise for failure to pay sales tax and not the ten days’ notice as required by statute constituted such misconduct that the sheriff was no longer entitled to protection of the writ, and, if sued in trespass, his defense could not rest upon the process nor could it be used in diminution of damages.

       The Legislature amended Sections 13-3-163 and 13-3-165 to provide that any expense or cost incurred by advertising and providing notice for legal sales shall be paid by the plaintiff. The amendments did not relieve the sheriff from liability for ensuring that proper notice is given prior to a legal sale. A sheriff may provide for the advertisement of such sales and then charge the cost of such advertisement to the plaintiff. Hooks, April 5, 1996, A.G. Op. #96-0163.

    Who are competent jurors; determination of literacy.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Every citizen not under the age of twenty-one years, who is either a qualified elector, or a resident freeholder of the county for more than one year, is able to read and write, and has not been convicted of an infamous crime, or the unlawful sale of intoxicating liquors within a period of five years and who is not a common gambler or habitual drunkard, is a competent juror. No person who is or has been within twelve months the overseer of a public road or road contractor shall, however, be competent to serve as a grand juror. The lack of any such qualifications on the part of one or more jurors shall not, however, vitiate an indictment or verdict. Moreover, no talesman or tales juror shall be qualified who has served as such talesman or tales juror in the last preceding two years, and no juror shall serve on any jury who has served as such for the last preceding two years. No juror shall serve who has a case of his own pending in that court, provided there are sufficient qualified jurors in the district, and for trial at that term.
     </p>
     <p>
      In order to determine that prospective jurors can read and write, the presiding judge shall, with the assistance of the clerk, distribute to the jury panel a form to be completed personally by each juror prior to being empaneled as follows:
     </p>
     <p>
      “1. Your name Last First Middle initial 2. Your home address 3. Your occupation 4. Your age 5. Your telephone number If none, write none 6. If you live outside the county seat, the number of miles you live from the courthouse Miles Sign your name”
     </p>
     <p>
      Click to view
     </p>
     <p>
      The judge shall personally examine the answers of each juror prior to empaneling the jury and each juror who cannot complete the above form shall be disqualified as a juror and discharged.
     </p>
     <p>
      A list of any jurors disqualified for jury duty by reason of inability to complete the form shall be kept by the circuit clerk and their names shall not be placed in the jury box thereafter until such person can qualify as above provided.

       The statute does not place improper restrictions as to who can serve on a jury and is not unconstitutional. Milano v. State, 790 So. 2d 179, 2001 Miss. LEXIS 110 (Miss. 2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       The literacy requirements of this section are constitutional. Edwards v. State, 737 So. 2d 275, 1999 Miss. LEXIS 80 (Miss. 1999).

       <p>
   The literacy and age requirements of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t13c05s13-5-1" target="_self">13-5-1</a></cite> do not violate the constitutional rights of accused persons to be tried by an impartial jury. The literacy requirements of the statute are constitutional, and the statute does not bar persons over 65 years of age from serving on a jury, but merely grants those individuals the privilege to claim an exemption should they desire not to serve. Wilson v. State, 574 So. 2d 1324, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 845 (Miss. 1990).
      </p>

   Mississippi’s exemption of jurors who are illiterate or under 21 years of age, pursuant to §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t13c05s13-5-1" target="_self">13-5-1</a></cite>, or over 65 years of age, pursuant to §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t13c05s13-5-25" target="_self">13-5-25</a></cite>, did not violate the defendant’s rights under the Sixth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.Turner v.

       <p>
   Section<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t13c05s13-5-1" target="_self">13-5-1</a></cite> is not unconstitutional because it prevents those between the ages of 18 and 21 from serving on juries. Irving v. State, 498 So. 2d 305, 1986 Miss. LEXIS 2518 (Miss. 1986), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">481 U.S. 1042</cite>, <cite class="s_court">107 S. Ct. 1986</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">95 L.

      </p>
      <p>
       With the variety of cases now in the courts and the multitude of written documents entered into evidence, the requirement that a juror be able to read and write is a reasonable and nondiscriminatory regulation which operates equally against all persons tried by juries, and is as essential to the state’s obligation to afford an accused a fair trial as it is to assure a fair trial for the state. Terrell v. State, 262 So. 2d 179, 1972 Miss. LEXIS 1305 (Miss. 1972).
      </p>
      <p>
       The question of whether this section [Code 1942, § 1762] is unconstitutional due to sex discrimination is now moot, since in its revised form it applies to every citizen without regard to sex. Willis v. Carson, 324 F. Supp. 1144, 1971 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14114 (S.D. Miss. 1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       Persons alleging discrimination in the jury selection system have the burden of proving it. Ford v. White, 299 F. Supp. 772, 1969 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12607 (S.D. Miss. 1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       Code 1942, §§ 1762, 1762-03, and 1766 which deal with the qualifications and selection of jurors are in pari materia and, when considered as a whole, are not void for vagueness. King v. Cook, 297 F. Supp. 99, 1969 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9067 (N.D. Miss. 1969).

   In a capital murder case, excusing a juror who responded affirmatively when asked if any jurors could not read or write did not violate defendant’s constitutional right to an impartial jury; the requirement of Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t13c05s13-5-1" target="_self">13-5-1</a></cite> that a juror be able to read and write is a reasonable and nondiscriminatory regulation that operates equally against all persons tried by juries.

       To the extent that Fleming v. State, 687 So. 2d 146 (Miss. 1997) stands for the proposition that a violation of the first section of the statute requires an automatic reversal or invokes a presumption of prejudice, it is hereby overruled. Roberts Co. v. Moore, 214 So.3d 202, 2017 Miss. LEXIS 80 (Miss. 2017).
      </p>
      <p>
       Statute did not violate due process rights of appellant by excluding from jury service persons in his age group, 18 to 20 years; amendment of U.S. Constitution by Twenty-Sixth Amendment did not qualify persons under 21 years of age as jurors under state laws. Joyce v. State, 327 So. 2d 255, 1976 Miss. LEXIS 1768 (Miss. 1976).

       <p>
   Rule that exclusion of women from jury service violates state criminal defendant’s Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment rights to impartial jury trial held not to apply retroactively. Daniel v. Louisiana, <cite class="us_code">420 U.S. 31</cite>, <cite class="s_court">95 S. Ct. 704</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">42 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 790, 1975 U.S. LEXIS 27 (U.S. 1975), overruled in part, Griffith v. Kentucky, <cite class="us_code">479 U.S. 314</cite>, <cite class="s_court">107 S.

      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   The requirement that a petit jury be selected from a representative cross section of the community, which is fundamental to the jury trial guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment, is violated by the systematic exclusion of women from jury panels. Taylor v. Louisiana, <cite class="us_code">419 U.S. 522</cite>, <cite class="s_court">95 S. Ct. 692</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">42 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 690, 1975 U.S. LEXIS 2 (U.S. 1975).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   A state criminal defendant’s right to an impartial jury trial under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments is violated by the operation of a state’s constitutional and statutory provisions which operate to exclude women from jury service. Taylor v. Louisiana, <cite class="us_code">419 U.S. 522</cite>, <cite class="s_court">95 S. Ct. 692</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">42 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 690, 1975 U.S. LEXIS 2 (U.S. 1975).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Fourteenth Amendment is not applicable on the issue as to whether or not women will be required to serve as jurors in a state court, the power to prescribe the qualifications of jurors being in the legislature, which may include or exclude women from jury duty. Smith v. State, 229 So. 2d 551, 1969 Miss. LEXIS 1246 (Miss. 1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       A defendant appealing a conviction of rape did not have standing to raise the issue as to whether failure to include women as qualified jurors was in violation of his rights under the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution. Smith v. State, 229 So. 2d 551, 1969 Miss. LEXIS 1246 (Miss. 1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the jury for the term of court at which the defendant was tried was drawn prior to the effective date of the amendment permitting women to serve on juries, a motion to quash the indictment on the ground that women were excluded from the jury by statute was properly overruled. Gordon v. State, 222 So. 2d 141, 1969 Miss. LEXIS 1522 (Miss. 1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       Limiting jury service to males and excluding women from such service does not constitute a denial to a female defendant of equal protection of the laws. White v. State, 214 So. 2d 467, 1968 Miss. LEXIS 1310 (Miss. 1968).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   The exclusion of women from jury service does not constitute an invalid discrimination. Reed v. State, 199 So. 2d 803, 1967 Miss. LEXIS 1309 (Miss. 1967), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">390 U.S. 413</cite>, <cite class="s_court">88 S. Ct. 1113</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">19 L.

      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Women are not required to perform jury duty in Mississippi; nor does the federal constitution require women to serve on juries in state courts. Shinall v. State, 199 So. 2d 251, 1967 Miss. LEXIS 1290 (Miss.), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">389 U.S. 1014</cite>, <cite class="s_court">88 S. Ct. 590</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">19 L.

       Unlike classification by race, classification of persons eligible for jury duty on the basis of sex, applicable alike to all races, is not unconstitutional. Cobb v. Greenville, 187 So. 2d 861, 1966 Miss. LEXIS 1364 (Miss. 1966).

      <p>
       The trial court in a narcotics prosecution did not err in overruling defendant’s motion to quash the indictment and petit venire, which motion alleged that the statutory exclusion of persons 18, 19 and 20 years of age to serve on grand and petit juries violated defendant’s federal constitutional rights and systematically excluded black persons from grand and petit juries; the fact that such age group has been permitted to register and vote by amendment to the U.S. Constitution did not qualify persons under 21 to serve as jurors under state law. Fermo v. State, 370 So. 2d 930, 1979 Miss. LEXIS 2028 (Miss. 1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       The contention that there had been a systematic exclusion of Negroes and Indians from grand juries was not supported where, though names of prospective jurors had to be drawn from a list of voters or people owning real estate and it was difficult to get names of people who don’t vote or own real property, and though there was a small number of Indians in the county, Indians and Negroes were on the venire from which the grand jury was chosen. Tubby v. State, 327 So. 2d 272, 1976 Miss. LEXIS 1780 (Miss. 1976).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where county officials charged with grand jury selection knew or had reason to know that the voter registration lists failed to be representative of adult black males, they were under an affirmative duty to utilize a selection method which had the potential for yielding juries which represented a fair cross-section of the qualified citizens of the community, and this duty included a resort to the county land rolls as an additional source of qualified blacks. Ford v. Hollowell, 385 F. Supp. 1392, 1974 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11740 (N.D. Miss. 1974).
      </p>
      <p>
       Under-registration of Negroes on jury lists because of failure to register to vote does not constitute discrimination. Ford v. White, 299 F. Supp. 772, 1969 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12607 (S.D. Miss. 1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       The voter registration rolls of April 1966 of Quitman County were unconstitutionally tainted by the vestiges of a state-sanctioned discriminatory voter registration procedure, the effect of which was to prevent adequate representation of Negroes on the jury lists. King v. Cook, 298 F. Supp. 584, 1969 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12753 (N.D. Miss. 1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       Jurors are not to be summoned because of their race, but rather summoned without discrimination from all persons qualified as jurors, and where a record does not show a systematic exclusion of Negroes from jury service, the state has met the burden of proof necessary to show that there is no systematic exclusion of Negroes from the jury. Smith v. State, 229 So. 2d 551, 1969 Miss. LEXIS 1246 (Miss. 1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where defendant’s proof showed that a disproportion between Negroes and whites on the jury lists had existed over a long period of time, he had made out a prima facie case of the systematic exclusion of Negroes from the jury which indicted him, and it was incumbent upon the state to show that there was no systematic exclusion of Negroes from the grand jury and that defendant’s constitutional rights were not infringed by the manner and procedure in which the grand jurors were drawn, and in the absence of such rebuttal testimony on the part of the state the presumption of purposeful prior exclusion stands and the motion to quash the indictment should have been sustained. Reeves v. Reeves, 210 So. 2d 780, 1968 Miss. LEXIS 1521 (Miss. 1968).
      </p>
      <p>
       Allegations that because of the interrelationship between the racial restrictions of the Mississippi voter qualification laws and requirements with respect to the selection of grand and petit jurors a defendant would be denied his equal civil rights to trial by a jury free from exclusion were insufficient to justify the removal to the federal courts of the trial of a Negro charged with the crime of rape. Bass v. Mississippi, 381 F.2d 692, 1967 U.S. App. LEXIS 5438 (5th Cir. Miss. 1967).
      </p>
      <p>
       In order for the state to sustain the burden of refuting the defendant’s prima facie case that Negroes had been systematically excluded from the juries of the county in which he was tried, it must be shown that the board of supervisors had abandoned its former practice of systematic exclusion and that Negroes were currently being selected for jury service as other qualified citizens. Black v. State, 187 So. 2d 815, 1966 Miss. LEXIS 1355 (Miss. 1966).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the state did not sustain burden of refuting the prima facie case made by the defendant that Negroes had been systematically excluded from juries of Chickasaw County, the defendant’s conviction could not be allowed to stand and the indictment against him was quashed and the cause remanded to await the action of a qualified grand jury summoned from a proper jury list. Black v. State, 187 So. 2d 815, 1966 Miss. LEXIS 1355 (Miss. 1966).
      </p>
      <p>
       Issue whether Negroes were systematically excluded from grand and petit juries held waived by failure of competent counsel for Negro defendant to raise it in the trial court. Gordon v. State, 160 So. 2d 73 (Miss. 1964).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   The complete exclusion from jury service, of Negroes in a county in which they are a majority, violates the constitutional rights of a Negro charged with crime. United States ex rel. Goldsby v. Harpole, 263 F.2d 71, 1959 U.S. App. LEXIS 4557 (5th Cir. Miss.), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">361 U.S. 838</cite>, <cite class="s_court">80 S. Ct. 58</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">4 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 78, 1959 U.S. LEXIS 522 (U.S. 1959), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">361 U.S. 850</cite>, <cite class="s_court">80 S. Ct. 109</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">4 L.

      </p>
      <p>
       Whether there has been a systematic racial discrimination by administrative officials in the selection of jurors is a question to be determined from the facts in each particular case. Cameron v. State, 233 Miss. 404, 102 So. 2d 355, 1958 Miss. LEXIS 397 (Miss. 1958).
      </p>
      <p>
       The board of supervisors is not required to place in a jury box the names of all the Negroes who meet the qualifications for jury service, since they do not now and have never placed in a jury box for any one year the names of all the white men who meet such qualifications. Cameron v. State, 233 Miss. 404, 102 So. 2d 355, 1958 Miss. LEXIS 397 (Miss. 1958).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a prosecution of a Negro for the rape of a white woman the conclusion of the trial judge, in passing upon the issue of fact presented by a motion to quash the indictment, that there had been no systematic, intentional, deliberate discrimination on account of race, was not manifestly wrong in view of the evidence. Cameron v. State, 233 Miss. 404, 102 So. 2d 355, 1958 Miss. LEXIS 397 (Miss. 1958).
      </p>
      <p>
       The proof by a Negro defendant on a charge for an offense against a white person, that no Negro had served on a grand jury for the past thirty years is very strong evidence of purposeful racial discrimination in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, which the state has the burden of disproving by showing that the names of Negroes were not placed in the jury box for some other reason than the fact that they are Negroes. Seay v. State, 212 Miss. 712, 55 So. 2d 430, 1951 Miss. LEXIS 499 (Miss. 1951).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a prosecution of Negro defendant for felonious assault of white person where the evidence failed to disclose any reason for the absence of the names of Negroes in the jury boxes other than the mere fact that supervisors just did not place their names in the box, and no reason was given for the absence of the names of Negroes in the jury boxes, the conviction of the defendant will be reversed. Seay v. State, 212 Miss. 712, 55 So. 2d 430, 1951 Miss. LEXIS 499 (Miss. 1951).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Where, in a county the adult population of which is more than 35% Negro, no Negro has served on a grand or petit criminal court jury for 30 years, the inference of systematic exclusion is not sufficiently repelled by showing that a relatively small number of Negroes meet a requirement that a juror must be a qualified elector.

       Opinion of a juror formed on rumor does not disqualify him if he is fair and impartial.

       Errors relating to the jury selection process were forfeited on appeal due to a failure to object contemporaneously below; at any rate, the outcome would have been the same because, while the trial court erred in appointing a foreperson, the trial court either did not commit error or cured other errors. Personal privilege exemptions had to be asserted by the individual, jurors who sat on a jury in the last two years could have been required to serve due to a lack of potential jurors, an error relating to a failure to complete the jury questionnaire was corrected during direct questioning at voir dire, and a juror’s answer to a question about prior convictions fulfilled the statutory requirements.

       Although defendant argued that the trial court committed reversible error by excusing two potential jurors because they had served on a jury in the past two years, rather than permitting those jurors the discretion to decide whether or not to serve, procedural bar aside, the error was harmless because defendant did not claim any constitutional violation or that he was in any manner prejudiced by the dismissal of the potential jurors.

       Under Const. 1890 § 264, as it formerly read, providing certain qualifications for jurors, but directing that the want thereof shall not vitiate any verdict, which section of the Constitution is substantially embodied in this section [Code 1942, § 1762], it is not cause for reversing a conviction of murder that it was discovered after the verdict that one of the jurors was not a qualified elector and had not been drawn on the venire but had been summoned by mistake in place of a person by the same name who was drawn. Complaint may be made only where that occurs which impugns the fairness of the trial. Tolbert v. State, 71 Miss. 179, 14 So. 462, 1893 Miss. LEXIS 185 (Miss. 1893).

       Const. 1890 § 264, as that section formerly read, declaring that “the want of such qualification in any juror shall not vitiate any indictment or verdict,” which section of the Constitution is substantially embodied in this section [Code 1942, § 1762], does not apply where the judgment is assailed because of the court’s action in overruling an exception seasonably made to a juror.

       Although provisions for jury selection are merely directory, courts must make every reasonable effort to comply with the statutory method of drawing, selecting and serving jurors; the jury system must remain untainted and beyond suspicion. Avery v. State, 555 So. 2d 1039, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 7 (Miss. 1990), overruled,
   Mayfield v. State, 612 So. 2d 1120, 1992 Miss. LEXIS 861 (Miss. 1992).

   In civil jury trial in Federal District Court, equal protection component of Fifth Amendment due process clause prohibits private litigant from using peremptory challenge to exclude prospective jurors on account of race because such race-based exclusion violates equal protection rights of excluded jurors; opposing litigant has third-party standing to raise excluded jurors’ rights in opposing litigant’s own behalf; and, while role of litigants in determining jury’s composition may provide one reason for wide acceptance of jury system and its verdicts, if race stereotypes are price for acceptance of jury panel, price is too high to meet standard of constitution.

   “Significant period of time” for purposes of determining federal constitutional violation is not limited to period of time after passage of Miss. Jury Selection Act which was a step forward in eradicating racial discrimination in selection of juries; plaintiff black state prisoner indicted for and convicted of murder who claimed denial of equal protection because for 20 year period up to and including his indictment all 42 grand jury foremen appointed by circuit judges of county he was indicted were white even though population of county was 43% black, established prima facie case of racial discrimination in county, which State failed to rebut inasmuch as its rebuttal testimony merely indicated that judges in county never indicated to circuit clerk that they selected grand jury foremen based on race, and testimony neither denied use of racial criteria nor advanced any other objective non-discriminatory criteria; and conviction would be vacated. Johnson v. Puckett, 929 F.2d 1067, 1991 U.S. App. LEXIS 7522 (5th Cir. Miss.), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">502 U.S. 898</cite>, <cite class="s_court">112 S. Ct. 274</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">116 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 226, 1991 U.S. LEXIS 5358 (U.S. 1991).

   Although persons over 65 years of age and persons who have served on a jury within 2 years are exempt from jury service under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t13c05s13-5-25" target="_self">13-5-25</a></cite>, neither the circuit court nor the deputy circuit clerk have authority to act unilaterally and strike such persons from the jury list. Such persons are eligible for jury service and have every lawful right and authority to serve if called and selected. When their names are drawn, such persons must be summoned the same as other prospective jurors and no one has authority to exempt any such juror from service unless he or she claims the privilege and asks to be excused. Thus, a judgment of conviction and sentence was reversed where the deputy circuit clerk unilaterally struck from the jury list all persons over 65 years of age and all persons who had served on a jury within the 2 preceding years. Adams v. State, 537 So. 2d 891, 1989 Miss. LEXIS 28 (Miss. 1989).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   A defendant indicted by a county grand jury on various drug-related offenses was not entitled to removal of the indictments to federal court, notwithstanding his contention that the grand juries were illegally constituted in that blacks had not been considered for appointment as forepersons, where state law clearly provided that no one could be excluded from jury service because of race and where there was no equivalent basis for a prediction that defendant could not enforce his federal rights in state court. Williams v. Mississippi, 608 F.2d 1021, 1979 U.S. App. LEXIS 9387 (5th Cir. Miss. 1979), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">449 U.S. 804</cite>, <cite class="s_court">101 S. Ct. 49</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">66 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 8, 1980 U.S. LEXIS 2550 (U.S. 1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a homicide prosecution, the trial judge correctly overruled a defense motion to quash the indictment, venire and panel on the ground that blacks and women were systematically excluded from serving as grand jury foremen, where Mississippi followed the “random” method of jury selection and where the evidence was insufficient to establish a prima facie case of discrimination in the selection of jury foremen by trial judges. Herring v. State, 374 So. 2d 784, 1979 Miss. LEXIS 2347 (Miss. 1979).

      <p>
       In a robbery case, the trial court’s ruling denying defendant’s Batson challenge against the State’s peremptory strike of a member of the venire was not clearly erroneous or against the overwhelming weight of the evidence. Payne v. State, 207 So.3d 1282, 2016 Miss. App. LEXIS 493 (Miss. Ct. App. 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Mississippi caselaw did not extend the Batson protection to religiously based peremptory strikes of jurors; the only objection offered by defendant was a Batson objection. Because defendant did not object that religiously based peremptory strikes violated Miss. Const. Art. 3, § 18 and Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t13c05s13-5-2" target="_self">13-5-2</a></cite>, the trial judge did not err in accepting the reason offered by the State as a race-neutral reason not prohibited by Batson. Jackson v. State, 910 So. 2d 658, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 170 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 904 So. 2d 184, 2005 Miss. LEXIS 402 (Miss. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Peremptory challenges to jurors may not be exercised to exclude a juror on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, or economic status. Thorson v. State, 721 So. 2d 590, 1998 Miss. LEXIS 392 (Miss. 1998).

      <p>
       <p>
   In a drug case, a trial court did not err by denying a motion to quash the venire due to the fact that less than three percent were minorities; there was no evidence to show that the jury was not selected at random under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t13c05s13-5-2" target="_self">13-5-2</a></cite>. Magee v. State, 951 So. 2d 589, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 123 (Miss. Ct. App. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       In defendant’s trial for the sale of cocaine, defendant failed to make a prima facie showing that the fair cross-section requirement was violated; defendant also failed to show that there was a systematic exclusion of blacks from the jury pool. Yarbrough v. State, 911 So. 2d 951, 2005 Miss. LEXIS 610 (Miss. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where defendant failed to show that the under-representation of a racial group on his jury was based on a systematic exclusion in selection of the jury venire, defendant was not denied a jury that was a fair cross-section of the community. Pratt v. State, 870 So. 2d 1241, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 273 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).

       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       Defendant’s conviction for the sale of cocaine was appropriate because a single venire wherein a distinctive group was underrepresented did not constitute systematic exclusion of that group from the jury-selection process. Simmons v. State, 13 So.3d 844, 2009 Miss. App. LEXIS 471 (Miss. Ct. App. 2009).

    Jury wheel—selection and deposit of names or identifying numbers of prospective jurors—procedure where less than all names on master list used.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Unless all the names on the master list are to be placed in the jury wheel pursuant to Section 13-5-10, the names or identifying numbers of prospective jurors to be placed in the jury wheel shall be selected by the jury commission at random from the master list in the following manner: The total number of names on the master list shall be divided by the number of names to be placed in the jury wheel; the whole number nearest the quotient shall be the “key number,” except that the key number shall never be less than two (2). A “starting number” for making the selection shall then be determined by a random method from the number from one (1) to the key number, both inclusive. The required number of names shall then be selected from the master list by taking in order the first name on the master list corresponding to the starting number and then successively the names appearing in the master list at intervals equal to the key number, recommencing if necessary at the start of the list until the required number of names has been selected. The name of any person who is under the age of twenty-one (21) years and the name of any person who has been permanently excused from jury service pursuant to Section 13-5-23(4) shall be passed over without interrupting the sequence of selection. Any person who has been excluded from the master list for jury service may be reinstated to the master list after one (1) year by requesting that the circuit clerk reinstate him to the master list. Upon recommencing at the start of the list, names previously selected from the master list shall be disregarded in selecting the additional names. The jury commission may use an electronic or mechanical system or device in carrying out its duties.

       In defendant’s trial for wire fraud, the trial court properly ordered the circuit court clerk to draw the jury from both judicial districts within the county in order to expand the jury pool, and to be certain that a fair and impartial jury as nearly as possible, could be impaneled; there was no prejudice to defendant as a result. McGee v. State, 853 So. 2d 125, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 159 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 852 So. 2d 577, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 834 (Miss. Ct. App. 2003).

       Defendant in a murder trial failed to show that a jury selection method of drawing juries from two judicial districts did not result in a fair cross-section of the community. Thomas v. State, 818 So. 2d 335, 2002 Miss. LEXIS 130 (Miss. 2002).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court’s decision to draw jury venire from both judicial districts, rather than just a jury venire from the district where the burglary victims were likely less well known, was not error as the record did not show that the jury selection process was fraudulent, unfair, or deprived defendant of due process. Cunningham v. State, 828 So. 2d 208, 2002 Miss. App. LEXIS 11 (Miss. Ct. App. 2002).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Fact that special venire in transferee county was drawn randomly from county as a whole, rather than alternately from each of county’s two judicial districts as required by statute, did not amount to reversible error in murder prosecution, as defendant failed to demonstrate any prejudice resulting from noncompliance with statute and failed to demonstrate that jury was not chosen from fair cross-section of community. De La Beckwith v. State, 707 So. 2d 547, 1997 Miss. LEXIS 749 (Miss. 1997), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">525 U.S. 880</cite>, <cite class="s_court">119 S.

   Statutory method of selecting jurors in criminal prosecution is directory, not mandatory, and unless it is shown that method used was fraudulent or such radical departure from method prescribed by the statute as to be unfair to defendant or to prevent due process of law, appellate court will not reverse.

   A murder defendant did not establish that the trial judge abused his discretion by refusing the defendant’s request to draw venire members from both of the county’s judicial districts where the defendant did not offer evidence indicating that the jury selected was biased or partial.

       In homicide prosecution, where court ordered special venire from first district of county, refusal to order one from second district held not error, statute being directory. Taylor v. State, 148 Miss. 621, 114 So. 390, 1927 Miss. LEXIS 48 (Miss. 1927).

       Trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying a doctor’s motion to quash the jury panel—when the doctor contended that the doctor was denied a fair trial in a medical malpractice action because the doctor, who was Caucasian, had an all-African-American venire in a county that was 25 percent Caucasian—because the appellate court found no evidence showing any actual fraud, prejudice, or such a flagrant violation of duty as to amount to fraud. Kronfol v. Johnson, — So.3d —, 2019 Miss. App. LEXIS 183 (Miss. Ct. App. Apr. 30, 2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although defendant argued that the trial court committed reversible error by excusing two potential jurors because they had served on a jury in the past two years, rather than permitting those jurors the discretion to decide whether or not to serve, procedural bar aside, the error was harmless because defendant did not claim any constitutional violation or that he was in any manner prejudiced by the dismissal of the potential jurors. Gause v. State, 65 So.3d 295, 2011 Miss. LEXIS 314 (Miss. 2011), limited, Hall v. State, 127 So.3d 202, 2013 Miss. LEXIS 649 (Miss. 2013).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   A trial court’s excusal of a potential juror on hardship grounds was not an abuse of discretion where the juror had 4 children at home with no one to care for them. Nixon v. State, 533 So. 2d 1078, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2917 (Miss. 1987), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">490 U.S. 1102</cite>, <cite class="s_court">109 S. Ct. 2458</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">104 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 1012, 1989 U.S. LEXIS 2745 (U.S. 1989), overruled,

       <p>
   Non-compliance with §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t13c05s13-5-23" target="_self">13-5-23</a></cite>, on exemption of jurors, does not warrant quashing of venire unless there is showing of actual fraud, prejudice, or such flagrant violation of duty as to amount to fraud. Pulliam v. State, 515 So. 2d 945, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2895 (Miss. 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   The exemptions from jury duty set forth in this section [Code 1942, § 1764] are not unreasonable or discriminatory, and a defendant, indicted and tried for murder, was not thereby prejudiced in his right to a fair trial. Capler v. State, 237 So. 2d 445, 1970 Miss. LEXIS 1509 (Miss. 1970), vacated, <cite class="us_code">408 U.S. 937</cite>, <cite class="s_court">92 S. Ct. 2862</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">33 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 754, 1972 U.S. LEXIS 1910 (U.S. 1972).
      </p>
      <p>
       The trial court did not commit reversible error in overruling defendant’s motion for a mistrial, or that a new panel of jurors be tendered to him, where, after ten jurors had been finally accepted to try the defendant for murder, the court, out of the presence of defendant or his counsel, excused a juror because illness required the juror’s presence at home, but allowed the defendant one additional peremptory challenge. Upshaw v. State, 231 Miss. 158, 94 So. 2d 337, 1957 Miss. LEXIS 500 (Miss. 1957).
      </p>
      <p>
       While it is obvious that there may be circumstances, making strict compliance with this section [Code 1942, § 1764] impossible as regards presenting excuses from jury service, the trial judge is under a duty to require compliance therewith except where it is impracticable to do so. Parker v. State, 201 Miss. 579, 29 So. 2d 910, 1947 Miss. LEXIS 423 (Miss. 1947).
      </p>
      <p>
       As regards the matter of presenting excuses from jury service, the rule is that it is not enough to warrant the court in quashing the venire that the trial judge has violated or failed to do his duty in this regard, but, to so warrant, the evidence and circumstances must show actual fraud or such flagrant violation of duty in this respect as that the proven facts and circumstances show a legal fraud on the rights of the defendant. Parker v. State, 201 Miss. 579, 29 So. 2d 910, 1947 Miss. LEXIS 423 (Miss. 1947).
      </p>
      <p>
       In the absence of a showing of fraud on the rights of the accused in a criminal case, it was not reversible error for the trial court to excuse from jury service, for good cause, before the case was called for trial and in chambers without notice to the accused, 26 of the 74 persons who appeared in response to an order for a special venire of 90 persons. Parker v. State, 201 Miss. 579, 29 So. 2d 910, 1947 Miss. LEXIS 423 (Miss. 1947).
      </p>
      <p>
       Indictment for murder held not void because grand juror allegedly served as both election commissioner and grand juror. Robinson v. State, 178 Miss. 568, 173 So. 451, 1937 Miss. LEXIS 228 (Miss. 1937).

     <p>
      Every citizen over sixty-five (65) years of age, and everyone who has served as a grand juror or as a petit juror in the trial of a litigated case within two (2) years, shall be exempt from service if the juror claims the privilege.No qualified juror shall be excluded because of any such reasons, but the same shall be a personal privilege to be claimed by any person selected for jury duty.Any citizen over sixty-five (65) years of age may claim this personal privilege outside of open court by providing the clerk of court with information that allows the clerk to determine the validity of the claim.
     </p>
     <p>
      Provided, however, that no person who has served as a grand juror or as a petit juror in a trial of a litigated case in one (1) court may claim the exemption in any other court where the juror may be called to serve.

       Although a trial court erred in removing a potential juror, defendant failed to object at trial; therefore, he was procedurally barred from arguing the error at trial. Moreover, the error was harmless. Spires v. State., 10 So.3d 477, 2009 Miss. LEXIS 260 (Miss. 2009).

   Transfer of venue to another county for trial proceedings did not deprive defendant in murder prosecution of his right to be tried by jury chosen from fair cross-section of community including senior citizens, despite defendant’s contention that moving jurors to the other county made elderly persons more inclined to exercise their statutory exemption from jury service; defendant failed to present any evidence indicating that jury lists were not representative of community.

   Although persons over 65 years of age and persons who have served on a jury within 2 years are exempt from jury service under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t13c05s13-5-25" target="_self">13-5-25</a></cite>, neither the circuit court nor the deputy circuit clerk have authority to act unilaterally and strike such persons from the jury list. Such persons are eligible for jury service and have every lawful right and authority to serve if called and selected. When their names are drawn, such persons must be summoned the same as other prospective jurors and no one has authority to exempt any such juror from service unless he or she claims the privilege and asks to be excused. Thus, a judgment of conviction and sentence was reversed where the deputy circuit clerk unilaterally struck from the jury list all persons over 65 years of age and all persons who had served on a jury within the 2 preceding years.

      <p>
       Although defendant argued that the trial court committed reversible error by excusing two potential jurors because they had served on a jury in the past two years, rather than permitting those jurors the discretion to decide whether or not to serve, procedural bar aside, the error was harmless because defendant did not claim any constitutional violation or that he was in any manner prejudiced by the dismissal of the potential jurors. Gause v. State, 65 So.3d 295, 2011 Miss. LEXIS 314 (Miss. 2011), limited, Hall v. State, 127 So.3d 202, 2013 Miss. LEXIS 649 (Miss. 2013).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the trial court erred by informing two potential jurors that he was required to dismiss them because they had previously served on a jury in the last two years, the error was harmless, and defendant had not preserved his challenge for appellate review since there had not been a contemporaneous objection to the error. Trevillion v. State, 26 So.3d 1098, 2009 Miss. App. LEXIS 828 (Miss. Ct. App. 2009).

       Errors relating to the jury selection process were forfeited on appeal due to a failure to object contemporaneously below; at any rate, the outcome would have been the same because, while the trial court erred in appointing a foreperson, the trial court either did not commit error or cured other errors. Personal privilege exemptions had to be asserted by the individual, jurors who sat on a jury in the last 2 years could have been required to serve due to a lack of potential jurors, an error relating to a failure to complete the jury questionnaire was corrected during direct questioning at voir dire, and a juror’s answer to a question about prior convictions fulfilled the statutory requirements.

       Trial court properly denied defendant’s motion to quash a venire because defendant did not show that the exclusion of persons with surnames beginning with “T-Z,” which was due to an algorithm used by the county’s computer system, disproportionally affected any distinctive group in the county; defendant alleged no prejudice resulting from the trial court’s noncompliance with the statute, and failed to show that persons whose surnames began with “A” through “S” did not represent a fair cross-section of the community.

       Trial court did not improperly sequester the names of the jurors in defendant’s trial for tax evasion. The judge decided in the case at bar to keep the jurors’ names secret based on events from defendant’s previous prosecution; moreover, defendant failed to properly brief this issue. King v. State, 897 So. 2d 981, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 689 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004), cert. denied, 896 So. 2d 373, 2005 Miss. LEXIS 224 (Miss. 2005).

Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t13c05s13-5-32" target="_self">13-5-32</a></cite> without notice or opportunity for a hearing prejudiced him in any way, the error was not a basis for reversal. King v. State, 857 So. 2d 702, 2003 Miss. LEXIS 450 (Miss. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       Before a trial judge makes a determination not to make a jury list available to litigants or trial attorneys whose clients will have a cause for trial, he should cause the record clearly to demonstrate good and sufficient reason “in the interest of justice” as the section provides. Before making his determination to keep confidential or secret the names of the jurors drawn from the jury box, the litigants or counsel should have notice that such action is being considered by the trial judge; then the court should make its decision only after a hearing is accorded the defendant on the issue. Valentine v. State, 396 So. 2d 15, 1981 Miss. LEXIS 1977 (Miss. 1981).

       Even if the appellate court assumed the person that sat on the grand jury was the same person that sat on the petit jury, it was unable to determine whether that person took part in the grand jury deliberations incident to the indictment against defendant. Havard v. State, 986 So. 2d 333, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 756 (Miss. Ct. App. 2007), cert. denied, 987 So. 2d 451, 2008 Miss. LEXIS 557 (Miss. 2008).

       Where ground of motion to quash indictment in murder prosecution “for defects and irregularities in the drawing, summoning, impaneling and organization of the grand jury” was too broad, the supreme court would assume, to the advantage of defendant, that the basis was made particular by the introduction of testimony purporting to relate to the method of summoning and impaneling the grand jury.

      Before swearing any grand juror as such, he shall be examined by the court, on oath, touching his qualification. After the grand jurors shall have been sworn and impaneled, no objection shall be raised, by plea or otherwise, to the grand jury, but the impaneling of the grand jury shall be conclusive evidence of its competency and qualifications.

       Supreme Court must indulge presumption that grand jury is composed of persons who have reasonable degree of intelligence and would perform their duties in accordance with law and evidence before them. State v. Pacific (Ex parte Jones County Grand Jury, First Judicial Dist.), 705 So. 2d 1308, 1997 Miss. LEXIS 747 (Miss. 1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       Petitioner’s allegation in an application for writ of habeas corpus that his conviction constituted a deprivation of his liberty without due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution because of the systematic exclusion of members of his race from the lists from which grand and petit juries were selected in the county where he was indicted and convicted, and because of his ignorance and circumstances of his arrest and incarceration, and as a consequence of the law of Mississippi he was not able to challenge the competency of the grand jury, together with a showing of the speed in which the petitioner was tried following his indictment, were sufficient to entitle the petitioner to a hearing on the question of whether he had adequately safeguarded his constitutional rights during his trial for murder. United States ex rel. Goldsby v. Harpole, 249 F.2d 417, 1957 U.S. App. LEXIS 4002 (5th Cir. Miss. 1957).
      </p>
      <p>
       Grand jury which returned indictment is not shown to be illegal on hearing on motion for new trial after conviction of felonious assault by cutting with knife when circuit clerk merely stated that all jurors were white men, and it was neither shown nor intimated that there were no names of Negroes in jury box out of which grand and petit jury were drawn, but it did appear that jury boxes were practically exhausted after these juries had been drawn, it being common knowledge that number of Negroes who register and qualify for jury service are almost nominal in comparison with number of white persons who do so. Ferrell v. State, 208 Miss. 539, 45 So. 2d 127, 1950 Miss. LEXIS 272 (Miss. 1950).

      <p>
       It is duty of circuit and chancery clerks, board of supervisors and sheriff to comply strictly with all of requirements of statutes in manner of listing, drawing and selecting jurors, compiling jury lists, and summoning and impaneling juries, but since statutes on the subject are merely directory, judgment will not be reversed where there was no radical departure from statutory scheme of selecting and impaneling jury and jury selected was fair and impartial. Lott v. State, 204 Miss. 610, 37 So. 2d 782, 1948 Miss. LEXIS 394 (Miss. 1948).
      </p>

       On motion to quash jury list from which grand and petit juries were to be chosen, for alleged reason that board of supervisors had not selected names of jurors in manner required by law governing selection of qualified electors, placing names in jury box, and subsequent drawing of juries, it is competent to show by testimony of chancery and circuit clerks manner in which statutory requirements were complied with. Lott v. State, 204 Miss. 610, 37 So. 2d 782, 1948 Miss. LEXIS 394 (Miss. 1948).
      </p>
      <p>
       The strict language of this section [Code 1942, § 1784], that the impaneling of the grand jury shall be conclusive evidence of its competence and qualification, permits of no exception. Reynolds v. State, 199 Miss. 409, 24 So. 2d 781, 1946 Miss. LEXIS 211 (Miss. 1946).

       Defendant argued, on appeal, that his indictment on two counts of aggravated assault and possession of a firearm by a felon should have been dismissed because the alleged victim’s brother-in-law sat on the grand jury that indicted defendant; however, defendant failed to submit this issue to the trial court, either in a motion to dismiss, or in defendant’s motion for J.N.O.V.

       <p>
   Manner in which lists of jurors are selected by board of supervisors and placed in jury box involves solely question of state procedure and trial court is not in error in overruling motion to quash indictment on that ground when objections to qualification of grand jurors is not made before they are impaneled and defendant was at time represented by able lawyer and had reason to believe his case would be investigated by grand jury and he could have obtained information as to venire from which grand jury would be drawn.

       Motion to quash jury list from which grand jury was chosen, made by defendant after indictment by grand jury, but before arraignment, is made too late as strict language of this section [Code 1942, § 1784] that impaneling of grand jury shall be conclusive evidence of its competence and qualifications admits of no exceptions.

In the absence of any showing that the grand jury was not fair and impartial, there was no ground for reversal of a conviction on an indictment found by it. Posey v.

       Indictment for murder held not void because grand juror allegedly serves as both election commissioner and grand juror. Robinson v. State, 178 Miss. 568, 173 So. 451, 1937 Miss. LEXIS 228 (Miss. 1937).
      </p>
      <p>
       A county prosecuting attorney may be present with the grand jury while considering a case and may find a valid indictment while he is present but he must not improperly influence the jury. State v. Coulter, 104 Miss. 764, 61 So. 706, 1913 Miss. LEXIS 84 (Miss. 1913); Le Barron v. State, 107 Miss. 663, 65 So. 648, 1914 Miss. LEXIS 128 (Miss. 1914).
      </p>
      <p>
       An indictment found when only fourteen grand jurors were present and twelve or more concurred when finding it and was returned into court by the full grand jury of eighteen members was valid. McCoy v. State, 101 Miss. 613, 57 So. 622, 1911 Miss. LEXIS 122 (Miss. 1911).
      </p>
      <p>
       The foreman of a grand jury has no authority to discharge a member thereof but the court may do so and he should supply the place by selecting another juror. McCoy v. State, 101 Miss. 613, 57 So. 622, 1911 Miss. LEXIS 122 (Miss. 1911).
      </p>
      <p>
       It is unlawful for the sheriff to be called into the grand jury room to aid in examining a witness and an indictment based on such testimony is invalid. Herrington v. State, 98 Miss. 410, 53 So. 783, 1910 Miss. LEXIS 77 (Miss. 1910).
      </p>
      <p>
       The minutes of the court must show that the grand jury was sworn, otherwise an indictment found by them is void. Hardy v. State, 96 Miss. 844, 51 So. 460, 1910 Miss. LEXIS 176 (Miss. 1910).
      </p>
      <p>
       A plea of not guilty does not waive the right to file a motion to quash a void indictment since permitting such motion is discretionary. Hardy v. State, 96 Miss. 844, 51 So. 460, 1910 Miss. LEXIS 176 (Miss. 1910).

      The court shall appoint one of the grand jurors to be foreman of the grand jury, to whom the following oath shall be administered in open court, in the presence of the rest of the grand jurors, to wit:
     </p>
     <p>
      “You, as foreman of this grand inquest, shall diligently inquire into, and true presentment make, of all such matters and things as shall be given you in charge, or otherwise come to your knowledge, touching the present service. The counsel of the state, your fellows, and your own you will keep secret. You shall not present any person through malice, hatred or ill will, nor shall you leave any person unpresented through fear, favor or affection, or for any reward, hope or promise thereof, but in all your presentments, you shall present the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, to the best of your skill and understanding. So help you God.”
     </p>
     <p>
      And the following oath shall be administered to the other jurors, to wit:
     </p>
     <p>
      “The same oath that your foreman has now taken before you on his part, you, and each of you, shall well and truly observe, and keep on your respective parts. So help you God.”

   A trial court did not err in overruling a defendant’s motion to quash the indictment and/or demur to the indictment, even though the minutes of the court did not reflect that a grand jury foreman was appointed or that the foreman was given the oath as required by §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t13c05s13-5-45" target="_self">13-5-45</a></cite>, where one of the names of the grand jurors was listed on the indictment as the grand jury foreman, the foreman signed the grand jury report and indictment in the slot where the foreman signs, and the foreman’s name was listed along with the other sworn grand jurors, since the statute does not provide that the court minutes must reflect that a grand jury foreman was appointed and sworn. Rogers v. State, 599 So. 2d 930, 1992 Miss. LEXIS 123 (Miss.), overruled in part, Mayfield v. State, 612 So. 2d 1120, 1992 Miss. LEXIS 861 (Miss. 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       A defendant’s claim that his indictment for murder was void on the ground that black foremen were systematically not appointed to the grand jury would be rejected where there was no testimony in the record to the effect that failure to select a black grand jury foreman had been intentionally or purposely done and where the crucial period for determining discrimination did not begin until 1975 when the new Jury Selection Act went into effect and there was an insufficient period of time to enable the Court to determine whether there had been constitutionally prohibited discrimination. Johnson v. State, 404 So. 2d 553, 1981 Miss. LEXIS 2234 (Miss. 1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a homicide prosecution, the trial judge correctly overruled a defense motion to quash the indictment, venire and panel on the ground that blacks and women were systematically excluded from serving as grand jury foremen, where Mississippi followed the “random” method of jury selection and where the evidence was insufficient to establish a prima facie case of discrimination in the selection of jury foremen by trial judges. Herring v. State, 374 So. 2d 784, 1979 Miss. LEXIS 2347 (Miss. 1979).

      The judge shall charge the grand jury concerning its duties and expound the law to it as he shall deem proper, and he shall particularly charge it concerning enforcement of the following statutes:

       those defining the duties of public officers;
      </li>
      <li id="t13c05s13-5-47ol15">
       those relating to the collection and paying over of fines and forfeitures;
      </li>
      <li id="t13c05s13-5-47ol16">
       those relating to providing fire escapes in hotels, theaters and other buildings;

      </li>
      <li id="t13c05s13-5-47ol18">
       all such other statutes as he shall deem proper at any time.
       <p>
        Moreover, the judge shall especially charge the grand jury with respect to the state forest fire laws as set forth in Section 95-5-25 and Section 92-17-13, and charge that the grand jury shall report to him as to the status of forest protection in the county.
       </p>
       <p>
        It shall be unlawful for the district attorney or other officer, or person, to deliver to the grand jury the charge required by this section to be delivered by the judge, but this shall not prevent the judge from having the circuit clerk read the charge proposed by the judge, to the grand jury in the presence of the judge, when, by reason of physical infirmity, the judge shall be unable to deliver his charge.

       A circuit judge’s supplemental charge to the grand jury that citizens had reported to the court that the district attorney had “failed to investigate and prosecute” certain crimes and that, if the jurors should “determine that the district attorney has actively disobeyed investigation of these matters,” they were to apply to the court for further instructions singled out the district attorney and his office as targets for grand jury action and should have been expunged for exceeding the judge’s authority which did not extend to denunciation of individuals. Necaise v. Logan, 341 So. 2d 91, 1976 Miss. LEXIS 1492 (Miss. 1976).
      </p>
      <p>
       One indicted for robbery committed seven months prior thereto is not prejudiced by circuit judge’s charge to grand jury which made indictment that “there has been a series of outbreaks of crime in your community recently. I
   _______________
   want you to bring me these indictments by noon today,” as remark did not direct undue attention to any particular single crime. Goss v. State, 205 Miss. 177, 38 So. 2d 700, 1949 Miss. LEXIS 424 (Miss. 1949).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the defendant charged with selling liquor relies solely on her testimony as her only evidence, jurors to try the same are incompetent who have heard the judge charge the grand jury that “blind tigers” were unworthy of belief and would commit perjury. Johnson v. State, 106 Miss. 598, 64 So. 261, 1913 Miss. LEXIS 167 (Miss. 1913).
      </p>
      <p>
       It was prejudicial error as against one convicted of unlawfully selling liquor for the court in charging the grand jury relative to such offense to say, “Have you ever heard the name of C. F. [defendant’s name]?” Fuller v. State, 85 Miss. 199, 37 So. 749, 1904 Miss. LEXIS 122 (Miss. 1904).
      </p>
      <p>
       It is improper for a judge, directly or indirectly, to designate a particular individual as making unlawful sales of intoxicants. If he does and the individual is indicted on seasonable motion the indictment will be quashed. Fuller v. State, 85 Miss. 199, 37 So. 749, 1904 Miss. LEXIS 122 (Miss. 1904).
      </p>
      <p>
       A conviction for such unlawful sale will be reversed if on overruling an application for a continuance the judge announces, in the presence of jurors, that there has been much complaint about the failure to convict “these criminals” and that the court feared it largely due to continuances. Fuller v. State, 85 Miss. 199, 37 So. 749, 1904 Miss. LEXIS 122 (Miss. 1904).
      </p>
      <p>
       It is sufficient ground for quashing an indictment under Code 1892 §§ 1120, 1121 (Code 1906 §§ 1201, 1202) that the grand jury sought to be finally discharged without indicting defendant and the court refused to discharge them and instructed them specifically as to the criminal character of defendant’s business, saying that the law was plain and it was of opinion that it had sufficient evidence to find an indictment, that other grand juries had indicted, and that the business in which defendant was engaged was a flagrant violation of the statute. Blau v. State, 82 Miss. 514, 34 So. 153, 1903 Miss. LEXIS 145 (Miss. 1903).

       Trial court properly denied a public utility’s motion to quash a grand jury subpoena because issuance of the subpoena was a lawful exercise of the grand jury’s investigative authority, and the evidence was relevant to its investigation and had the potential to result in criminal indictments; when the grand jury seeks information relevant to a legitimate criminal investigation, and that information has the potential to support probable cause to indict, the grand jury should not be hindered.

State, 38 So. 324 (Miss. 1905), the court, in accordance with the public policy of the state, may fill the vacancies on a grand jury by the same or a similar method or provided by statute for the selection of the original jurors.

       In a prosecution for capital murder an indictment returned by a grand jury was not void on the asserted ground that the grand jury was recalled by the district attorney’s office, where the judge recalled the grand jury initially, where once the grand jury was impanelled or recalled it was in session for the duration of the term or until discharged, and where in the present case the district attorney merely selected the days it would actually meet and was not recalling the grand jury. Oates v. State, 421 So. 2d 1025, 1982 Miss. LEXIS 2267 (Miss. 1982).
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that the grand jury was in session at the time defendant was arrested for armed robbery and then adjourned without returning an indictment, has no bearing on the question of the right to release on bail, in absence of proof of any investigation of the case by the grand jury. Wooton v. Bethea, 209 Miss. 374, 47 So. 2d 158, 1950 Miss. LEXIS 401 (Miss. 1950).

      <p>
       Under ch. 253 Laws of 1916 it is mandatory that a circuit judge impanel a grand jury during the first half of each term of court but there is no limitation as to how long it shall continue. Bell v. State, 118 Miss. 140, 79 So. 85, 1918 Miss. LEXIS 65 (Miss. 1918).

       The general rules of grand jury secrecy have no application to testimony given by witnesses who are to be used by the State at a pretrial hearing or at trial with respect to charges lodged by an indictment rendered and served as a result of such testimony.

       The opinion of a well-respected federal judge was improper influence and such evidence should not have been presented to the grand jury. Hood v. State, 523 So. 2d 302, 1988 Miss. LEXIS 74 (Miss. 1988).

   The filing of the list of witnesses sworn before the grand jury in the circuit clerk’s grand jury docket prior to trial fulfilled the requirements of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t13c05s13-5-63" target="_self">13-5-63</a></cite>.

       Statute was complied with where list of witnesses was filed with clerk, which constituted return to court. Shaw v. State, 513 So. 2d 916, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2816 (Miss. 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       The important and solemn responsibilities of the grand jury ought to be performed without fear or favor and without any manner of influence, and the door to the grand jury should be closed to outsiders who are not witnesses and who have no official business to perform. Case v. State, 220 So. 2d 289, 1969 Miss. LEXIS 1447 (Miss. 1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       It is improper for a private prosecuting attorney to go before the grand jury. Case v. State, 220 So. 2d 289, 1969 Miss. LEXIS 1447 (Miss. 1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       A committee of the bar association whose motives were admittedly good should not be permitted to appear before the grand jury. Case v. State, 220 So. 2d 289, 1969 Miss. LEXIS 1447 (Miss. 1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that a forestry commission employee, who investigated a forest fire and talked to the witnesses but had no personal knowledge of the facts, testified before the grand jury that he brought the case up in justice of the peace court and had the witnesses there for the preliminary hearing, did not place him in the category of a special prosecutor employed to assist with the prosecution, and hence his appearance before the grand jury was not an improper influence. Case v. State, 220 So. 2d 289, 1969 Miss. LEXIS 1447 (Miss. 1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       The appearance of a forestry commission employee, who had investigated a forest fire and talked to the witnesses, but had no personal knowledge of the facts, did not constitute an improper influence on the grand jury which indicted the defendant on a charge of feloniously firing woods not his own. Case v. State, 220 So. 2d 289, 1969 Miss. LEXIS 1447 (Miss. 1969).

      After the drawing of the grand jury, the remaining jurors in attendance shall be impaneled into three petit juries for the first week of court if there be a sufficient number left, and, if not, the court may direct a sufficient number for that purpose to be drawn and summoned. If there be more than enough jurors for the three juries, or for two juries if the court shall direct only two to be impaneled, the excess may be discharged, or they may be retained, in the discretion of the court, to serve as talesmen. If so retained, they shall have the privilege of members of the regular panel, of exemption from service.

       In prosecution for unlawful possession of intoxicating liquor, where only four jurors were on the jury panel and presumably twelve jurors were at the time deliberating another case, and trial judge entered order adjudicating that there were insufficient number of jurors on the petit jury panels for the week from which to obtain a jury to try the case and the sheriff was directed to summon from the body of the county twelve men to serve as jurors in the case and the sheriff called additional jurors from the bystanders in the courtroom and the jury so impaneled was tendered for trial, defendant’s motion to quash the panel should have been sustained and enough jurors to compute the jury panels should have been drawn from the jury box and summoned. Moffett v. State, 220 Miss. 587, 71 So. 2d 303, 1954 Miss. LEXIS 475 (Miss. 1954).
      </p>
      <p>
       It is only when the full panels have been drawn and made up and are subsequently exhausted that the trial judge may direct the sheriff to select additional men from the body of the county without drawing them from the jury box. Moffett v. State, 220 Miss. 587, 71 So. 2d 303, 1954 Miss. LEXIS 475 (Miss. 1954).
      </p>

   A fairer trial was assured the defendant in a murder prosecution by the court’s overruling a motion, made after the case had been called for trial and while the jury was being selected, to call additional jurors from the jury box after the regular panel and special venire had both been exhausted, leaving the defendant with only two peremptory challenges which he immediately expended, than would have been by drawing from the general jury box which was so nearly depleted that many jurors would have had to be drawn from the box of the district where the homicide occurred. Lewis v. State, 201 Miss. 48, 28 So. 2d 122, 1946 Miss. LEXIS 356 (Miss. 1946), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">331 U.S. 785</cite>, <cite class="s_court">67 S.

      <p>
       This section [Code 1942, § 1792], applies to drawing of jurors for regular panels, and is inapplicable to jurors summoned to complete a panel for the trial of a particular case made necessary by the exhaustion of regular panels for the week. Smith v. State, 196 Miss. 524, 18 So. 2d 300, 1944 Miss. LEXIS 225 (Miss. 1944).

       Where both of two regular panels for the week became exhausted before the jury in a criminal case was completed, whereupon the court ordered the sheriff “to go into the body of the county and bring in 13 jurors,” which the sheriff did, summoning no jurors who were then in the courtroom, defendant’s objection that jurors for completion of the panel should be drawn from the jury box as required by this section [Code 1942, § 1792] and not from a panel composed in whole or in part of jurors so summoned by sheriff, was without merit. Smith v. State, 196 Miss. 524, 18 So. 2d 300, 1944 Miss. LEXIS 225 (Miss. 1944).

       The circuit court did not err in refusing defendant’s request in a prosecution for burglary to complete the jury, where there was an insufficient number, by drawing additional names from the general jury box of the county, and in directing the sheriff to complete the required number from bystanders, where the words providing that juries might be completed from the bystanders as it appeared in the former enactment and omitted under the amendatory act, applied only to the original organization of the court in the first week of the term; in other words, neither Code 1930, § 2058, nor chapter 301, Laws of 1938, dealt with or gave directions to the trial court as to the procedure in handling a jury after the original organization of the court in the first week of that term.

    Impaneling of alternate jurors.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Except in cases in which jury selection and selection of alternate jurors is governed by rules promulgated by the Mississippi Supreme Court, whenever, in the opinion of a circuit judge or chancellor presiding in a case in which a jury is to be used, the trial is likely to be a protracted one, such circuit judge or chancellor, in his discretion, may direct that one (1) or two (2) jurors in addition to the regular panel be called and impaneled to sit as alternate jurors. Alternate jurors in the order in which they are called shall replace jurors who, prior to the time the jury retires to consider its verdict, become unable or disqualified to perform their duties. Alternate jurors shall be drawn in the same manner, shall have the same qualifications, shall be subject to the same examination and challenges for cause, shall take the same oath and shall have the same functions, powers, facilities and privileges as the regular jurors. An alternate juror who does not replace a regular juror shall be discharged at the time the jury retires to consider its verdict. In capital cases the defendant and the state shall each be allowed two (2) peremptory challenges to alternate jurors in addition to those otherwise provided by law. In all other cases each party shall be allowed one (1) peremptory challenge to alternate jurors in addition to those otherwise provided by law. In any criminal case all peremptory challenges by the state shall be made before the alternate juror is presented to the defendant. The additional peremptory challenges provided for herein may be used against an alternate juror only, and other peremptory challenges allowed by law may not be used against an alternate juror.

       Defendant’s allegation on appeal that a juror should have been stricken was procedurally barred because defendant failed to object to the juror’s competency at trial. Wright v. State, 9 So.3d 447, 2009 Miss. App. LEXIS 243 (Miss. Ct. App. 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       At the hearing on defendant’s motion for a new trial, the juror testified that she did not know why she did not respond when asked if anyone knew defendant, adding that she did not know defendant, only that she knew of him from seeing him around the community and was aware he had dated her daughter some 10 years earlier. The juror testified that she held no bias or hard feelings towards defendant, and the trial court properly found incredible defendant’s testimony that he was unaware of the juror’s presence on the jury until after trial, and found it more likely that defendant believed the juror would have been a favorable juror, and therefore he did not challenge her; thus, the denial of defendant’s motion for a new trial on the alleged basis that the juror withheld information and precluded defendant from having an impartial jury was not an abuse of discretion. Doss v. State, 906 So. 2d 836, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 1150 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant’s murder conviction was proper where the denial of defendant’s motion for a mistrial was permissible, even though a juror failed to disclose certain information during voir dire, because the jury panel was untainted; the juror stated that she never discussed the case with other jurors, and she was removed from the panel. Ables v. State, 850 So. 2d 172, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 635 (Miss. Ct. App. 2003).

       Where a driver sued a utility company for negligence after the driver drove into utility poles stacked in a trailer parked off a highway, on voir dire, the jurors did not conceal material information that denied the driver the right of a fair and impartial jury.

       It was harmless error for trial judge to allow an alternate juror to retire to the deliberation room with the rest of the jury after the close of the trial because the alternate juror did not contribute to the deliberations in any way and the trial judge actually polled the jurors to be certain that no harm was done. Maldonado v. State, 796 So. 2d 247, 2001 Miss. App. LEXIS 298 (Miss. Ct. App. 2001).

       The mere presence of an alternate juror during jury deliberation, without evidence that the deliberation was affected by it, does not constitute reversible error. Department of Human Servs. v. Moore, 632 So. 2d 929, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 110 (Miss. 1994).
      </p>

       A trial judge in a murder prosecution did not err in refusing to exclude a juror after she had been accepted, even though the juror’s daughter had been murdered six years earlier, where the attorneys inadvertently failed to ask the juror during voir dire whether a member of her family had been a victim of a crime, and therefore the juror neither withheld nor misrepresented information. Spivey v. Mowdy, 617 So. 2d 999, 1992 Miss. LEXIS 688 (Miss. 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       It was error for a trial court to excuse a juror and replace her with an alternate after the jury had retired to deliberate a sentencing verdict, since substitution of a juror with an alternate must occur prior to the time the jury retires to consider its verdict. Balfour v. State, 598 So. 2d 731, 1992 Miss. LEXIS 131 (Miss. 1992).

   In civil jury trial in Federal District Court, equal protection component of Fifth Amendment due process clause prohibits private litigant from using peremptory challenge to exclude prospective jurors on account of race because such race-based exclusion violates equal protection rights of excluded jurors; opposing litigant has third-party standing to raise excluded jurors’ rights in opposing litigant’s own behalf; and, while role of litigants in determining jury’s composition may provide one reason for wide acceptance of jury system and its verdicts, if race stereotypes are price for acceptance of jury panel, price is too high to meet standard of constitution.

       A trial court erred when it seated an alternate juror after the alternate jurors had been dismissed from jury service and after the jury had been in deliberations for almost 2 hours, where the alternate juror had been neither sequestered nor instructed regarding the case for the period beginning when the jury retired and until he was placed on the jury panel. Folk v. State, 576 So. 2d 1243, 1991 Miss. LEXIS 57 (Miss. 1991).

   In determining whether a juror is “disqualified” within the meaning of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t13c05s13-5-67" target="_self">13-5-67</a></cite> when he or she has withheld information or misrepresented material facts on voir dire examination, the test is whether the juror withheld substantial information or misrepresented material facts in the face of a clearly worded question which was relevant to the case at bar. Voir dire examination is often the most crucial crucible in forging the primary instrument of justice-the fair and impartial jury. When offering challenges for cause and challenges peremptory, parties and their lawyers must rely on the objective candor and responsiveness of prospective jurors, and nothing turns on who asks the question, so long as it was clearly worded. Following a jury’s verdict, where a party shows that a juror withheld substantial information or misrepresented material facts, and where a full and complete response would have a provided a valid basis for challenge for cause, the trial court must grant a new trial; prejudice is presumed. Where, as a matter common experience, a full and correct response would have provided the basis for a peremptory challenge, not rising to the dignity of a challenge for cause, the courts have greater discretion, though a discretion that should always be exercised against the backdrop of the duty to secure to each party trial before a fair and impartial jury. Thus, in a prosecution for felony sale of alcoholic and intoxicating beverages, the circuit court’s action in removing a juror was within the scope of its authority where the juror failed to respond on 3 separate occasions during voir dire to defense counsel’s questions as to whether any prospective juror or any “relative or member of the juror’s immediate family” had been involved in a criminal proceeding, and the juror’s husband had 2 liquor-related criminal convictions. Myers v. State, 565 So. 2d 554, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 294 (Miss. 1990).

   Section<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t13c05s13-5-67" target="_self">13-5-67</a></cite> is read against the backdrop of the general rule that a party who fails to object to the jury’s composition before it is impaneled waives any right to complain thereafter. The word “disqualified” in §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t13c05s13-5-67" target="_self">13-5-67</a></cite> has breadth considerably beyond that of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t13c05s13-5-1" target="_self">13-5-1</a></cite>’s initial qualifications for jury service.

       It was harmless error for trial judge to allow 2 alternate jurors to retire with jury where there was no showing of any resulting prejudice, although action of trial judge was clearly in violation of statute and alternate jurors are to be discharged and not be present or participate in deliberations under any circumstances not prescribed by statute. Luster v. State, 515 So. 2d 1177, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2912 (Miss. 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial judge who chose to hear matter concerning dismissal of juror for good cause, and replacement of her with an alternate, in chambers should have informed counsel for both sides and given opportunity for them to be present, or at least to object and make record; however, counsel cited no actual prejudice to defendant arising out of substitution of jurors, and court assumed that juror was excused for good cause. Stevens v. State, 513 So. 2d 603, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2834 (Miss. 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       Fact that a juror subpoenaed to appear before a county court had been placed onto a circuit court jury panel, which panel tried a homicide case did not require reversal of panel’s verdict, although when the error was discovered and defendant’s motion made, after both sides had rested but before the case was submitted to the jury, however, the juror mistakenly sitting should have been replaced with an alternate juror. Porter v. State, 492 So. 2d 970, 1986 Miss. LEXIS 2534 (Miss. 1986).

       When bailiff excuses juror on last day of murder trial on basis of death of juror’s grandmother, rather than escorting juror back to court and informing trial judge of situation so judge can determine whether juror is unable to perform duty and order excusal, and trial court subsequently impanels alternate juror without objection by defense, and defendant fails to show prejudice resulting from impaneling of alternate, conviction is not subject to reversal on basis of improper excusal of original juror. Fuller v. State, 468 So. 2d 68, 1985 Miss. LEXIS 2055 (Miss. 1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a prosecution for capital murder, the trial court erred in permitting the state to peremptorily challenge on juror after the panel had been accepted on the grounds that the juror’s son was under indictment in a criminal matter where the record did not show that the juror was incompetent to serve and where the challenged juror could not be presumed to be incompetent merely because her son had been indicted; the trial court further erred by denying defendant’s peremptory challenge to the alternate juror, where it seemed to discriminate against defendant in favor of the state. Fairness required that defendant be granted a new trial. Caldwell v. State, 381 So. 2d 591, 1980 Miss. LEXIS 1862 (Miss. 1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       Absent a showing that the defendant was prejudiced thereby, the fact that it was discovered during the course of a misdemeanor trial in circuit court one of the jurors had served upon the jury which heard the case in justice of the peace court, was thereby removed, and replaced with an alternate juror, such did not constitute error. Russell v. State, 220 So. 2d 334, 1969 Miss. LEXIS 1457 (Miss. 1969).

       While a juror’s note-taking, which resulted in a communication to an attorney, may not have been intentional misconduct, the juror’s notes indicated that he had made up his mind about the case before all evidence had been presented by both sides, and therefore could not be impartial. The trial judge acted within his discretion in excusing the juror and replacing him with an alternate juror. Young v. State, — So.3d —, 2018 Miss. App. LEXIS 209 (Miss. Ct.

   Seating of an alternate juror during the sentencing phase did not violate Mississippi’s capital sentencing scheme, Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.99.html#t99c19s99-19-101" target="_blank">99-19-101</a></cite>, as this section allowed the substitution of alternative jurors in capital cases.

      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant made no assertion that his Sixth Amendment right to an impartial jury was violated due to the jury-selection process because he did not claim the jury was composed of incompetent jurors; defendant failed to show how the departure from that statute and rules regarding peremptory challenges affected his fundamental, substantive rights or otherwise led to a manifest miscarriage of justice. Carr v. State, 190 So.3d 1, 2015 Miss. App. LEXIS 605 (Miss. Ct. App. 2015).
      </p>
      <p>
       Misallocation of defendant’s peremptory challenges did not affect a fundamental, substantive right because so long as the jury that sat was impartial, the fact that defendant had to pool his regular and alternate peremptory challenges to achieve that result did not mean his Sixth Amendment rights were violated; despite being selected in an irregular manner, the jury was a legal jury with the authority to render a verdict against defendant. Carr v. State, 190 So.3d 1, 2015 Miss. App. LEXIS 605 (Miss. Ct. App. 2015).

       Defendant’s convictions for manslaughter and rape were proper because there was no error in the trial court’s dismissal of a juror. The trial court specifically found on the record that the particular juror had failed to follow clear instructions given numerous times during the trial not to speak to outside persons; the trial court further noted that the failure to follow basic instructions demonstrated additional concern that the juror might be unable to follow other, more important instructions to the jury concerning the law in the case. Brown v. State, 999 So. 2d 853, 2008 Miss. App. LEXIS 320 (Miss. Ct. App. 2008), cert. denied, 999 So. 2d 852, 2009 Miss. LEXIS 44 (Miss. 2009).

   Defendant’s conviction for aggravated assault was appropriate because a juror’s statement that she could not sit in judgment of another person properly led to her excuse for cause; additionally, she was excused immediately following the impaneling of the jury, which was within the time frame allotted in Miss.

   Defendant was not denied opportunity to intelligently use peremptory challenges when trial court conducted voir dire itself; trial court asked venire whether anyone would automatically vote for death penalty regardless of mitigating circumstances, counsel for both sides stated they were satisfied with voir dire, and defendant did not ask trial court to further voir dire jurors and did not ask that she be allowed to do so.

       While it is error to refuse to allow party to question prospective jurors to determine whether they are biased, prejudiced or have any interest in outcome of case, counsel is not free of limits during voir dire; rather, voir dire examination is subject to reasonable limitations, especially in insurance cases.

   A trial court in a capital murder prosecution did not err by allowing the prosecutor to question potential jurors first in individual sequestered voir dire or by allowing the prosecutor to use leading questions during voir dire.

   A trial court in a capital murder prosecution did not abuse its discretion by refusing to grant the defendant’s motion for individual sequestered voir dire of the entire venire where the court asked the collective venire about the effect of pretrial publicity or information received about the case, and the court later asked if there was any reason that a juror felt that he or she could not be fair and impartial, and anyone who responded affirmatively was questioned individually in chambers.

       United States Supreme Court has found that, in civil case, use of peremptory challenge based on race violates Fifth Amendment; however, where at time of trial Fifth Circuit operated under rule that such holding did not apply to civil trials, failure to object on voir dire to counsel’s use of challenge against black prospective juror foreclosed post trial objection.

   Batson claim of racial discrimination in exercise of peremptory challenge to juror requires 3-step process: party claiming discrimination must make prima facie showing that challenge was on basis of race; burden then shifts to striking party to articulate race-neutral explanation; and ultimately trial court must determine whether claimant has proven purposeful discrimination.

   In determining peremptory challenge was unlawfully exercised on racial grounds in contravention of Batson, District Court has discretion to fashion procedure necessary to evaluate counsel’s race-neutral explanation; trial court’s decision on ultimate question of discriminatory intent is finding of fact usually accorded great deference on appeal, because of inherent credibility assessment.

   In determining race-neutrality for purposes of assessing peremptory challenge to jurors, neutral explanation being one “based upon something other than race of juror,” legitimate reasons undergirding court’s allowing trial counsel to exercise challenge relying upon counsel’s intuitive assumptions, include age, appearance, familial relationships, responsiveness to questions, and background knowledge that raised possibility of bias; explanation “need not be quantifiable” provided the intent is not race-based.

   Disproportionate exclusion from jury of members of certain race, while not itself prohibited, may nevertheless constitute evidence that counsel’s stated reason for exercising challenge was mere pretext for racial discrimination.

       In action against insurance company in which verdict and judgment were rendered in favor of defendant company, and plaintiffs raised claim charging that court erred in refusing to require defense counsel to indicate non-racial motive for exercising 2 of its peremptory challenges, case would be remanded to District Court to determine whether plaintiffs presented prima facie case of racial discrimination in exercise of peremptory challenges; if District Court determines such case is presented, it shall afford defendant opportunity to show challenges were made for non-racial reasons, failing which, court shall grant plaintiffs new trial.

       Defendant’s conviction for manslaughter was appropriate because he had, or should have had, actual knowledge that a juror was untruthful during voir dire in regard to knowing defendant’s mother, yet, defendant remained silent; further, the trial court clearly found that defendant’s mother’s affidavit lacked credibility.

   It is perfectly proper for counsel to ask questions during voir dire that are beyond court’s inquiries reasonably necessary to assure himself and court that jurors selected will give his client benefit of every right to which he is entitled under the law, as well as to reveal or signify particular antipathies that could prejudice his client before any proposed juror.

       Trial court’s questioning and dismissal of 6 venire members who expressed opposition to the death penalty was adequate, even though defense counsel was not allowed to repeat questions in his own words to prospective jurors during court’s voir dire, where trial court rephrased questions as requested, defense did not request permission to ask further questions, and there was no showing that further questioning would have rehabilitated dismissed venire members.

      <p>
       Trial court erred by refusing to allow medical malpractice plaintiff to ask questions during voir dire to determine if prospective jurors had been exposed to and/or affected by media campaign on tort reform; however, error was harmless, as advertisements in question were geared towards reducing amount of damages and did not suggest that jurors should find defendants not liable, and plaintiff was allowed to ask jurors whether they belonged to any tort reform group, whether they had personal feelings that there were too many lawsuits, whether they felt medical doctors should not be sued, and whether they should give large damages if they were justified by proof.

       <p>
   A prosecutor’s request of jurors during individual voir dire to give the particular circumstances that each would require in order to return a death sentence were not improperly designed to extract a promise from the jurors that they would certainly vote in favor of the death penalty given a specific set of circumstances, and therefore did not violate the defendant’s constitutional rights.

      <p>
       Personal opposition to capital punishment is not a constitutional impediment to juror service so long as the juror is able to set aside his or her personal belief and fairly consider all sentencing options under the law; it was therefore error for a trial court to refuse defense counsel an opportunity to further voir dire potential jurors who had expressed reluctance to vote for the death penalty.

   In civil jury trial in Federal District Court, equal protection component of Fifth Amendment due process clause prohibits private litigant from using peremptory challenge to exclude prospective jurors on account of race because such race-based exclusion violates equal protection rights of excluded jurors; opposing litigant has third-party standing to raise excluded jurors’ rights in opposing litigant’s own behalf; and, while role of litigants in determining jury’s composition may provide one reason for wide acceptance of jury system and its verdicts, if race stereotypes are price for acceptance of jury panel, price is too high to meet standard of constitution.

   Prospective jurors in a capital murder prosecution who had stated their opposition to the death penalty were improperly excluded without allowing the defense counsel the opportunity to question them. However, this error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt where the answers the jurors gave were substantially clear, it was reasonably certain that the jurors were “Witherspoon-excludable,” and it was unlikely that voir dire examination by the defense counsel would have rehabilitated the jurors sufficient to take them out of Witherspoon.

       A defendant was not denied his right to use a peremptory challenge on a juror who failed to answer the defense attorney’s question during voir dire as to whether any of the jurors knew either attorney in the case, even though the juror had been injured when the defense attorney collided with him during a softball game 3 years earlier, where the juror did not recognize the defense attorney at the time of voir dire and only sometime thereafter recognized him as being the person who had collided with him at the ball game, the juror had not seen the defense attorney since that time, and the juror said that he felt no ill will toward the attorney for the injury he received and that the incident did not color his judgments during trial.

       A juror’s failure to respond to a voir dire question asking whether any of the potential jurors were related by blood or marriage to the victim was proper, where the juror was the aunt of a man who had at one time lived with the victim and had 2 children with the victim, but had never been married to the victim.

      <p>
       Although an attorney may probe the prejudices of prospective jurors to the end that all will understand the juror’s thoughts on matters directly related to the issues to be tried, it is impermissible for an attorney to attempt to secure from the juror a pledge that, if a certain set of facts occur or are presented, the juror will vote a certain way. There may well be other facts which would require a conscientious juror to do otherwise even though the assumed hypothetical fact comes to pass. Furthermore, in the course of deliberation a juror should be encumbered by his or her oath, the evidence and the instructions from the trial court, and nothing more. Baker v. Baker, 553 So. 2d 8, 1989 Miss. LEXIS 537 (Miss. 1989).

   In a capital murder prosecution, the court’s failure to excuse for cause a potential juror who stated during voir dire that in order for him not to impose the death penalty the defendant would have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he should not be executed, was not reversible error where defense counsel used his twelfth peremptory challenge to remove the juror, defense counsel had not exhausted his peremptory challenges and did not challenge anyone else for cause or ask for more peremptory challenges.

       A trial judge properly sustained the state’s objections to a defense counsel’s voir dire questions which particularized what the facts would show and then asked the jurors if they would return a verdict of not guilty. Harris v. State, 532 So. 2d 602, 1988 Miss. LEXIS 502 (Miss. 1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       A potential juror, who is a member or customer of a co-operative electrical power association, is not per se disqualified from sitting as a juror in a lawsuit to which the co-operative is a party. Garcia v. Coast Elec. Power Ass'n, 493 So. 2d 380, 1986 Miss. LEXIS 2576 (Miss. 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       When asked on voir dire examination whether any juror had a close relative who was involved in law enforcement, the failure of one juror to disclose that his brother was one of the police officers who was involved in the investigation of the burglary being prosecuted gave rise to a reasonable inference of prejudice to the defendant in selecting the jury. Odom v. State, 355 So. 2d 1381, 1978 Miss. LEXIS 2006 (Miss. 1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the prosecution, on voir dire, asked a prospective juror in effect if he would return a verdict of guilty if the state should prove that the prosecutrix was a female child under the age of 12 and that the defendant attempted forcibly to have carnal knowledge of her and that her body was thereby torn or lacerated, and the question was not objected to by the defendant, the question was harmless or was waived by the defendant’s failure to object, and its allowance not an abuse of discretion, particularly in view of later proper instructions defining the crime. South Mississippi Electric Power Ass'n v. Pryor, 246 So. 2d 920, 1971 Miss. LEXIS 1431 (Miss. 1971).

   The statutory scheme embodied in Code 1942, §§ 1202, 1803, 1832, 1839, 2435, 2535, and 3915 clearly embraces sufficient safeguards for fair jury trials in justice of the peace courts, composed of a fair cross-section of the citizens of the community, completely without regard to race or sex, and the justice must conform his judgment to the verdict of such a jury. Shaffer v. Bridges, 295 F. Supp. 869, 1969 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8348 (S.D. Miss. 1969), dismissed, Hall v. Baum, <cite class="us_code">397 U.S. 93</cite>, <cite class="s_court">90 S. Ct. 818</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">25 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 79, 1970 U.S. LEXIS 2741 (U.S. 1970), dismissed, <cite class="us_code">397 U.S. 94</cite>, <cite class="s_court">90 S. Ct. 818</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">25 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 80, 1970 U.S. LEXIS 2742 (U.S. 1970).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where funds to pay special prosecutor, in prosecution for murder, were raised by public subscription, court stated it would have been better to grant defendant’s request for list of contributors to aid in selection of jury, but added it was not reversible error to refuse since each prospective juror could have been asked if he had contributed. Seals v. State, 208 Miss. 236, 44 So. 2d 61, 1950 Miss. LEXIS 242 (Miss. 1950).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a capital case, trial judge must ask every juror tendered on trial panel whether he has any conscientious scruples against infliction of capital punishment and must exclude any juror who has such scruples. Phenizee v. State, 180 Miss. 746, 178 So. 579, 1938 Miss. LEXIS 39 (Miss. 1938).
      </p>
      <p>
       If the juror has not understood meaning of question as to “conscientious scruples” against capital punishment, trial judge should explain it to him in simple form by asking whether juror is opposed to hanging, etc. Phenizee v. State, 180 Miss. 746, 178 So. 579, 1938 Miss. LEXIS 39 (Miss. 1938).
      </p>
      <p>
       District attorney may examine jurors as to “conscientious scruples” against death penalty, although jury has passed judge’s examination. Phenizee v. State, 180 Miss. 746, 178 So. 579, 1938 Miss. LEXIS 39 (Miss. 1938).
      </p>
      <p>
       District attorney’s examination as to “conscientious scruples” against death penalty should be in the abstract and must not go to extent of forcing a committal with respect to what juror or jury would do in the particular case, nor should examination create impression juror would be looked upon with displeasure unless he returned death verdict. Phenizee v. State, 180 Miss. 746, 178 So. 579, 1938 Miss. LEXIS 39 (Miss. 1938).
      </p>
      <p>
       District attorney’s statements to jury on voir dire that state was going to ask death penalty, and anyone opposed to death penalty would be excused, held erroneous, but error was cured by statements of trial judge and district attorney that it was for jury to say whether capital punishment should be inflicted, and by instruction for state that if guilty verdict was returned, jury could fix punishment at death or life imprisonment. Phenizee v. State, 180 Miss. 746, 178 So. 579, 1938 Miss. LEXIS 39 (Miss. 1938).
      </p>
      <p>
       Error, if any, in sustaining objection to question to jurors, on voir dire examination held not to warrant reversal, where question was in form of statement of principle of law. Roney v. State, 167 Miss. 532, 142 So. 475, 1932 Miss. LEXIS 196 (Miss. 1932).
      </p>
      <p>
       Sustaining objection to question pertaining to reasonable doubt in mind of any one juror was not error. Roney v. State, 167 Miss. 532, 142 So. 475, 1932 Miss. LEXIS 196 (Miss. 1932).

     </h3>
     <p>
      Petit jurors shall be sworn in the following form:
     </p>
     <p>
      “You, and each of you, do solemnly swear (or affirm) that you will well and truly try all issues and execute all writs of inquiry that may be submitted to you, or left to your decision by the court, during the present term, and true verdicts give according to the evidence. So help you God.”
     </p>
     <p>
      The oath shall authorize the jury to try all issues and execute all writs of inquiry which may be submitted to it during that term of the court. Talesmen, if any be summoned or retained, shall in like manner be sworn to try all issues and execute all writs of inquiry which may be submitted to them during the day for which they are summoned or the time for which they are retained.

      </h4>
      <p>
       Defendant argued that a trial judge failed to swear in a jury during defendant’s trial for kidnapping, sexual battery, and aggravated assault; however, while the record did not explicitly reflect a reading of the oath, the record did include references to the oath. The trial judge was presumed to have performed his duties. Moore v. State, 996 So. 2d 756, 2008 Miss. LEXIS 601 (Miss. 2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       There was no plain error because defendant did not overcome the presumption that the jury was sworn since the sole mention in the record of the administration of the oath reflected that the jury was sworn, counsel never objected to a failure to swear the jury, and counsel did not object to the giving of a jury instruction that acknowledged that the jury was sworn. Holbrook v. State, 4 So.3d 382, 2008 Miss. App. LEXIS 573 (Miss. Ct. App. 2008), cert. denied, 11 So.3d 1250, 2009 Miss. LEXIS 115 (Miss. 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Transcript did not indicate the actual giving of the oath under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t13c05s13-5-71" target="_self">13-5-71</a></cite>, but the cover page of the transcript stated that the jury was duly impaneled and an instruction stated that the jury took an oath, and defendant’s assertion that the jury was not properly sworn was insufficient to overcome the established presumption that the trial court properly performed its duties; however, because this issue causes concern to members of court, the court urges the lower courts to place in every official record evidence that the trial jury took the official oath to well and truly try the issues. Wilson v. State, 990 So. 2d 798, 2008 Miss. App. LEXIS 572 (Miss. Ct. App. 2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the trial court administered an oath different than that mandated by the Legislature, defendant failed to raise a contemporaneous objection; because the trial judge did not have an opportunity to pass on the question, this issue was not preserved for appellate review. Debrow v. State, 972 So. 2d 550, 2007 Miss. LEXIS 647 (Miss. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a drug case, defendant did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel because (1) he offered no evidence to rebut the presumption that the jury had been properly sworn, so no objection by counsel was required; (2) defense counsel was not required to request an instruction regarding an accomplice because the State’s evidence did not rest upon the testimony of two others involved; (3) defense counsel’s failure to request an additional instruction when mention was made of defendant’s prior incarceration was not deficient where an objection was made immediately and a curative instruction was given; and (4) the failure to object to defendant’s criminal record was not deficient since the testimony of a correctional department custodian was permissible to authenticate such under Miss. R. Evid. 901. Vardaman v. State, 966 So. 2d 885, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 706 (Miss. Ct. App. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   In a prosecution of defendant for exploitation of a minor, defendant’s assertion that the petit jury was not properly sworn as required by Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t13c05s13-5-71" target="_self">13-5-71</a></cite> was insufficient to overcome the established presumption that the trial court properly performed its duties. Allen v. State, 945 So. 2d 422, 2006 Miss. App. LEXIS 677 (Miss. Ct. App. 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a drug case, defendant failed to present sufficient evidence to overcome the presumption that the trial judge administered the oath to the jury because, although the record did not explicitly reflect a reading of the oath, the record did reveal references made by the court to the oath; furthermore, the court’s judgment of conviction stated that “a trial before a jury has been duly sworn,” and therefore it could be presumed that the jury was sworn. Carlisle v. State, 936 So. 2d 415, 2006 Miss. App. LEXIS 481 (Miss. Ct. App. 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Court rejected defendant’s claim that his conviction for felony shoplifting should be reversed due to the lack of evidence in the record that the petit jury was sworn in as required by Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t13c05s13-5-71" target="_self">13-5-71</a></cite> because the record did not indicate that the jury was not sworn and there was no objection by trial counsel to the failure to administer the oath. The sole mention of the oath in the record indicated that the oath was administered. Biggs v. State, 942 So. 2d 185, 2006 Miss. App. LEXIS 1 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 942 So. 2d 164, 2006 Miss. LEXIS 715 (Miss. 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant did not present evidence sufficient to overcome the presumption that the judge properly performed his duties by placing the jury under oath where a boilerplate warning was present and there were references throughout the record by the judge, prosecutor, and even defense counsel to an oath being given. Lawrence v. State, 928 So. 2d 894, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 745 (Miss. Ct. App. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Defendant’s conviction for three counts of armed robbery was proper where the failure to administer a second oath to the jurors, as set out in Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t13c05s13-5-73" target="_self">13-5-73</a></cite>, was not reversible error; the oath administered under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t13c05s13-5-71" target="_self">13-5-71</a></cite> was sufficient. Boggans v. State, 867 So. 2d 279, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 190 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Recital in the judgment and sentence that the jury was specially sworn is conclusive of the fact. Ratcliff v. State, 201 Miss. 259, 29 So. 2d 321, 1947 Miss. LEXIS 396 (Miss. 1947).
      </p>
      <p>
       In the absence of evidence to the contrary, it will be presumed that the jury were sworn. Waddell v. Magee, 53 Miss. 687, 1876 Miss. LEXIS 134 (Miss. 1876).
      </p>
      <p>
       If the record recite that the jury were “impaneled and sworn to sit as jurors in the case,” it will be presumed that they were legally sworn. Furniss v. Meredith, 43 Miss. 302, 1870 Miss. LEXIS 39 (Miss. 1870).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the jury appeared to have been sworn “truly to try the issue joined between the parties,” it was held sufficient. Windham v. Williams, 27 Miss. 313, 1854 Miss. LEXIS 51 (Miss. 1854).
      </p>
      <p>
       It is not necessary to swear the jury for the week in each case, and talesmen will be presumed to have been duly sworn unless the record shows the contrary. Pierce v. Tate, 27 Miss. 283, 1854 Miss. LEXIS 45 (Miss. 1854).

   In a prosecution for forcible rape of a female adult, the failure to administer to the jury the special oath in capital cases required by §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t13c05s13-5-73" target="_self">13-5-73</a></cite> was not error where the jury received the oath of petit jurors prescribed by §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t13c05s13-5-71" target="_self">13-5-71</a></cite> which is substantially equivalent to the special oath, the defendant refused any attempt by the trial judge to cure the omission, the defendant was not taxed by the jury with the maximum sentence of life imprisonment, and a special venire was neither requested nor empaneled in the trial of the case, but rather the jury was selected and accepted from the regular panel for the week.

       Defendant failed to present sufficient evidence to overcome the presumption that the trial judge administered the oath to the jury. Although the record did not expressly reflect a reading of the oath, the record did reveal, however, that the trial court made two references to an oath during trial; the appellate court had to presume that the trial judge properly performed his duties, and it failed to find reversible error or harm that would have warranted a reversal of defendant’s conviction under the plain error doctrine.

      </p>

       Although the record in a murder prosecution did not reflect that the jury had been specially sworn, as required by statute, such omission was not reversible error where the rebuttable presumption that the trial judge properly performed his duty had not been overcome.

    Special venire facias to issue in certain criminal cases.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      When any person charged with a capital crime, or with the crime of manslaughter, shall have been arraigned and the plea of not guilty entered, the accused or the district attorney in any such case shall, upon demand, be entitled to a special venire. If at a term of court a special venire has been demanded for any case or cases, it shall be the duty of the court to cause to be drawn, in open court, from the jury box as many names as the judge in his discretion may direct, not to be less than forty (40) for each special venire as the judge in his discretion may direct to be called, and it shall be the duty of the clerk to issue a special venire facias, commanding the sheriff to summon the persons whose names are so drawn, to attend the court on a particular day to be named in the writ. It shall not be necessary that a separate special venire be drawn for each case in which a special venire is demanded. Those persons summoned pursuant to the issuance of a special venire facias shall attend the court on the day named in the writ and shall serve as the court may direct on any case for which a special venire has been demanded; provided, however, no juror summoned as a special venireman shall be impaneled or serve on more than one (1) case. In the event a special venire be exhausted in a case without a jury being impaneled from those summoned and in attendance, the court shall proceed to make up the jury for the trial of the case from the regular panel and tales jurors who may have been summoned for the day. If, after exhausting said regular panel and tales jurors, a competent jury be not obtained, the court shall direct the sheriff to summon forthwith as many tales jurors as shall be sufficient to complete the jury.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the event that there should be no such box, or the same should be mislaid, or the names therein have been exhausted, then the court may order a special venire facias to be issued by the clerk, directing the sheriff to summon as many jurors as may be necessary, not less than forty (40) for each special venire as the judge in his discretion may direct to be called and, after exhausting a special venire in any case, to impanel the jury as hereinbefore directed. The slips containing the names of all jurors drawn or summoned on a special venire, and not impaneled on a jury, shall be returned to the box from which they were drawn immediately after a jury shall be impaneled. If a special venire be not demanded, the jury in each case shall be composed of the regular venire for the week and as many talesmen and bystanders as may be required, to be summoned under the order of the court.

   Supreme Court will not overrule lower court’s denial of motion for special venire except upon showing of abuse of discretion. Davis v. State, 684 So. 2d 643, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 292 (Miss. 1996), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">520 U.S. 1170</cite>, <cite class="s_court">117 S. Ct. 1437</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">137 L.

       In a prosecution for murder in which defendant moved for a special venire, the trial court committed reversible error where, instead of filling the panel with members of that week’s regular jury panel who were in the courtroom, it presented defendant with 11 jurors who had been accepted by the State, and, over objection, required the defense to make its peremptory challenges to the 11 accepted jurors, in violation of statute mandating that in capital cases the defendant must be presented a full panel before being called upon to make his 12 peremptory challenges. Sellen v. State, 374 So. 2d 781, 1979 Miss. LEXIS 2346 (Miss. 1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       Under this section, which permits the jurors to be impaneled from those “summoned and in attendance” under the special venire, the trial judge in an armed robbery prosecution did not err in sua sponte excusing the husband of a prospective juror named in the venire facias, where the mistake of serving the husband for jury service rather than his wife was not discovered until after the jury and an alternate juror had been accepted and impaneled, where the trial judge initially offered the defense an extra challenge as to the husband following such discovery, where the defense rejected such offer and moved for a new panel, and where the trial judge placed the alternate juror on the panel following the excusing of the husband from service. Thorne v. State, 348 So. 2d 1011, 1977 Miss. LEXIS 2113 (Miss. 1977).
      </p>

   A fairer trial was assured the defendant in a murder prosecution by the court’s overruling a motion, made after the case had been called for trial and while the jury was being selected, to call additional jurors from the jury box after the regular panel and special venire had both been exhausted, leaving the defendant with only two peremptory challenges which he immediately expended, than would have been by drawing from the general jury box which was so nearly depleted that many jurors would have had to be drawn from the box of the district where the homicide occurred.

       Procedure for special venire is available to persons accused of certain serious crimes as matter of right, and such persons are entitled to have sheriff proceed in good faith and with due diligence to end that all persons listed upon special venire in fact be served and summoned for jury duty; it is not within sheriff’s authority to decide unilaterally that there will be enough jurors at trial and make no further effort to summon unserved jurors after certain number of persons have been served.

However, the case would be remanded for resentencing where the defendant at the time of his indictment in the present cause had not served terms of one year or more for his prior convictions dated March 14 and April 4, 1980, and subsequent to the date of the present offense before the court: September 1979.

   Capital murder defendant was not entitled to special venire without making timely request before trial, notwithstanding that state made such request. Davis v. State, 684 So. 2d 643, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 292 (Miss. 1996), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">520 U.S. 1170</cite>, <cite class="s_court">117 S. Ct. 1437</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">137 L.

      </p>
      <p>
       Although a special venire could have been demanded in an armed robbery prosecution if the demand had been timely made, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in overruling the defendant’s motion for a special venire where the motion was made just prior to the start of trial. Williams v. State, 590 So. 2d 1374, 1991 Miss. LEXIS 801 (Miss. 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       A motion for a special venire was properly denied where the motion was not filed until approximately one week before the start of trial, even though the court had announced that the case was ready for trial some two weeks earlier, and where the motion was not called to the court’s attention until the day of trial. Sharplin v. State, 357 So. 2d 940, 1978 Miss. LEXIS 2519 (Miss. 1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       It is not necessary that a special venire, if desired, be requested immediately upon the entry of a plea of not guilty, the purpose of the statute being accomplished if such request be made when the court ascertains and announces that the case is ready for trial. Porter v. State, 193 Miss. 774, 10 So. 2d 377, 1942 Miss. LEXIS 143 (Miss. 1942).
      </p>
      <p>
       When court in a capital case announced ready for trial, the request for a special venire became due without reference to the time then set for trial, and, counsel for the accused having failed at that time to request a special venire or to obtain permission from the court to make such request at a later date, denial of counsel’s request for special venire, when the case was called for trial, was proper, notwithstanding counsel stated to the court, when the case was set for trial, that he would decide later whether he wanted a special venire, in the absence of any understanding to that effect on the part of the court or of its doing anything to mislead counsel into thinking the contrary. Porter v. State, 193 Miss. 774, 10 So. 2d 377, 1942 Miss. LEXIS 143 (Miss. 1942).

      <p>
       Upon exhaustion of special venire, the lower court did not abuse its discretion in overruling defendant’s motion for continuance and that another special venire be drawn, since it could properly resort to the regular venire to complete the jury. McBride v. State, 492 So. 2d 581, 1986 Miss. LEXIS 2539 (Miss. 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where all except about twelve of special venire were found disqualified on voir dire, court properly disallowed second special venire. Harrison v. State, 168 Miss. 699, 152 So. 494, 1934 Miss. LEXIS 380 (Miss. 1934).

       Second special venire is allowed only when first has been quashed for reasons which so completely dislodge first special venire that it never became special venire. Harrison v. State, 168 Miss. 699, 152 So. 494, 1934 Miss. LEXIS 380 (Miss. 1934).

       Capital murder defendant’s absence during the drawing of a special venire was not reversible error and did not support a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel where no prejudice resulted. Burns v. State, 813 So. 2d 668, 2001 Miss. LEXIS 252 (Miss. 2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   While it would be the better practice to have the accused present when a special venire is drawn, the drawing of a special venire for a robbery prosecution, in the absence of the defendant and his counsel, was not reversible error, particularly where the defendant did not claim that he was prejudiced or that his case was not heard by an impartial jury, the drawing of a special venire not being a part of the actual trial. Kendall v. State, 249 So. 2d 657, 1971 Miss. LEXIS 1171 (Miss. 1971), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">404 U.S. 1040</cite>, <cite class="s_court">92 S. Ct. 725</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">30 L.

      </p>
      <p>
       In selecting the members of a special venire, pursuant to the court’s order because the jury box was empty, it was proper for the sheriff’s office deputy to make that selection from the registration list with the view of obtaining only qualified electors who were not exempt from jury service. Dampier v. State, 31 So. 2d 115 (Miss. 1947).
      </p>
      <p>
       In homicide prosecution, where court ordered special venire from first district of county, refusal to order one from second district held not error, statutes being directory. Taylor v. State, 148 Miss. 621, 114 So. 390, 1927 Miss. LEXIS 48 (Miss. 1927).

       The sheriff is not required to furnish a list of those who would be summoned to the clerk before summoning them but it is sufficient to furnish their names after they are summoned. Walford v. State, 106 Miss. 19, 63 So. 316, 1913 Miss. LEXIS 101 (Miss. 1913).
      </p>

       It is not reversible error in a capital case to refuse, both before and after exhausting the regular venire, to receive as a juror a member of the special venire who was absent on the call thereof but present when offered by the defense, and who thereupon ordered talesmen to be summoned where the whole record shows that the accused was not thereby prejudiced.

      <p>
       Under this section [Code 1942, § 1795], requiring that where a special venire is ordered, the jury shall be impaneled from those “examined and in attendance,” it is not error to refuse accused compulsory process for a venireman summoned and not in attendance.

       A special venire will not be quashed because only eleven of the forty called are available. Smith v. State, 242 Miss. 728, 137 So. 2d 172, 1962 Miss. LEXIS 586 (Miss. 1962).
      </p>

       Special venire will not be quashed except for fraud or a total departure from procedure laid down by the statute. Riley v. State, 208 Miss. 336, 44 So. 2d 455, 1950 Miss. LEXIS 252 (Miss. 1950); Smith v. State, 242 Miss. 728, 137 So. 2d 172, 1962 Miss. LEXIS 586 (Miss. 1962).

       Special venire will not be set aside merely because sheriff did not follow court’s recommended procedure in selecting panel where time was short and fair and impartial panel was summoned. Riley v. State, 208 Miss. 336, 44 So. 2d 455, 1950 Miss. LEXIS 252 (Miss. 1950).

       Drawing of special venire in capital case where regular jury box was exhausted from jury list made up by board of supervisors for succeeding year, although thirty days had not yet elapsed since making up of list as required by statute before persons on list became eligible as jurors, held mere irregularity only and not to warrant quashing of panel. Arnold v. State, 171 Miss. 164, 157 So. 247, 1934 Miss. LEXIS 217 (Miss. 1934).
      </p>

       A special jury properly summoned under this statute will not be quashed unless fraud is shown. Bond v. State, 128 Miss. 792, 91 So. 461, 1922 Miss. LEXIS 167 (Miss. 1922).
      </p>
      <p>
       A special venire will not be quashed because the trial judge caused the sheriff to submit to him before the service of the writ the names of the deputies selected to execute it, that they might be shown to the attorneys in the case with a view of receiving objections to them, or because on objection by the state’s attorney two of the persons named were not appointed, the sheriff appointing two unobjectionable persons in their place. If such a proceeding be irregular, it is cured by Code 1906, § 2718 (Code 1942, § 1798) providing that juries irregularly summoned shall be deemed legal after being impaneled and sworn. Lipscomb v. State, 76 Miss. 223, 25 So. 158, 1898 Miss. LEXIS 130 (Miss. 1898).
      </p>
      <p>
       It is no ground to quash a special venire that one of the jurors was not a citizen of the United States. Durrah v. State, 44 Miss. 789, 1871 Miss. LEXIS 38 (Miss. 1871).

    When opinion as to guilt or innocence will not render one incompetent in a criminal case.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Any person, otherwise competent, who will make oath that he is impartial in the case, shall be competent as a juror in any criminal case, notwithstanding the fact that he has an impression or an opinion as to the guilt or innocence of the accused, if it appear to the satisfaction of the court that he has no bias or feeling or prejudice in the case, and no desire to reach any result in it, except that to which the evidence may conduct. Any juror shall be excluded, however, if the court be of opinion that he cannot try the case impartially, and the exclusion shall not be assignable for error.

       This section [Code 1942, § 1763] is not in violation of Const. 1890 § 26, securing the right of an accused person to an “impartial jury.” Alfred v. State, 37 Miss. 296, 1859 Miss. LEXIS 19 (Miss. 1859); Green v. State, 72 Miss. 522, 17 So. 381, 1895 Miss. LEXIS 16 (Miss. 1895).

       The intention of the laws is that the juror shall be unaffected by any previous judgment, opinion or bias, either as respects the parties or the subject-matter in controversy. Brown v. State, 57 Miss. 424, 1879 Miss. LEXIS 96 (Miss. 1879).

       Before any juror is excused from service, he or she must be found to be unable to decide the case fairly and impartially on the merits and the reason, whatever it may be, should always be noted on the record. Brown v. State, 763 So. 2d 189, 2000 Miss. App. LEXIS 118 (Miss. Ct. App. 2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       A judge has broad discretion to determine whether a prospective juror can be impartial, notwithstanding the juror’s admission under oath that he or she can be impartial. Coverson v. State, 617 So. 2d 642, 1993 Miss. LEXIS 168 (Miss. 1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court did not abuse its discretion in excluding for cause a potential juror who was a double first cousin to a defendant charged with uttering a forgery, and with whom defendant had discussed the case prior to trial, despite the juror’s testimony that she could still be fair and impartial. Burt v. State, 493 So. 2d 1325, 1986 Miss. LEXIS 2490 (Miss. 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       One may not complain of exclusion of jurors by trial judge, if those selected were fair and impartial. Sherman v. State, 234 Miss. 775, 108 So. 2d 205, 1959 Miss. LEXIS 554 (Miss. 1959).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where qualification of prospective juror is a close question but he is held to be qualified and defendant peremptorily excuses such juror, there is no legal duty on the court to grant an extra peremptory challenge to the defendant. Shimniok v. State, 197 Miss. 179, 19 So. 2d 760, 1944 Miss. LEXIS 289 (Miss. 1944).
      </p>
      <p>
       If a doubt arises as to the competency of a juror he should be excluded. The court has the discretion to do this at any time before evidence is submitted. Mabry v. State, 71 Miss. 716, 14 So. 267, 1893 Miss. LEXIS 76 (Miss. 1893).
      </p>
      <p>
       The court always has power to impanel an impartial jury, and when it is apparent that such only is the effect of its ruling, the same will be sustained. Smith v. State, 61 Miss. 754, 1884 Miss. LEXIS 159 (Miss. 1884).
      </p>
      <p>
       The court may discharge from the panel a juror who has been accepted and sworn before testimony is introduced, if it be discovered that he is incompetent. Williams v. State, 32 Miss. 389, 1856 Miss. LEXIS 223 (Miss. 1856).
      </p>
      <p>
       The court must examine into the sufficiency of every objection to a juror. The consent of the other party to the objection does not deprive the court of the power. McCarty v. State, 26 Miss. 299, 1853 Miss. LEXIS 93 (Miss. 1853).
      </p>
      <p>
       The court may set aside a juror who has not been challenged by either party. Lewis v. State, 17 Miss. 115, 1847 Miss. LEXIS 95 (Miss. 1847);

       Defendant cited no authority for his proposition that the trial judge’s actions during voir dire were inappropriate, nor did he cite any evidence in the record that indicated the jury was prejudiced against him. Neal v. State, 15 So.3d 388, 2009 Miss. LEXIS 272 (Miss. 2009), dismissed, — So.3d —, 2016 Miss. LEXIS 340 (Miss. 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   A trial court in a capital murder prosecution did not abuse its discretion by refusing to grant the defendant’s motion for individual sequestered voir dire of the entire venire where the court asked the collective venire about the effect of pretrial publicity or information received about the case, and the court later asked if there was any reason that a juror felt that he or she could not be fair and impartial, and anyone who responded affirmatively was questioned individually in chambers. Carr v. State, 655 So. 2d 824, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 56 (Miss. 1995), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">516 U.S. 1077</cite>, <cite class="s_court">116 S. Ct. 783</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">133 L.

       Ruling out defendant’s questions to jurors as to effect on them of federal government’s participation in prosecution held not prejudicial error. Eaton v. State, 163 Miss. 130, 140 So. 729, 1932 Miss. LEXIS 23 (Miss. 1932).

       In personal injury for punitive damages plaintiff may inquire of jurymen whether they would impose punitive damages if so instructed. Yazoo & M. V. R. Co. v. Roberts, 88 Miss. 80, 40 So. 481, 1906 Miss. LEXIS 108 (Miss. 1906).
      </p>
      <p>
       A man’s conception of a reasonable doubt is not a proper subject of inquiry when he is presented as a juror in a criminal case and examined on his voir dire. Fugitt v. State, 85 Miss. 86, 37 So. 557, 1904 Miss. LEXIS 117 (Miss. 1904).
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether a juror would believe certain witnesses for the state on oath is not a proper subject of inquiry upon his voir dire examination in a criminal case. Fugitt v. State, 85 Miss. 86, 37 So. 557, 1904 Miss. LEXIS 117 (Miss. 1904).
      </p>
      <p>
       It is the duty of the court to see that an impartial jury is impaneled and it may in a murder case ask each juror if he is opposed to capital punishment. White v. State, 52 Miss. 216, 1876 Miss. LEXIS 202 (Miss. 1876).

      <p>
       Court rejected defendant’s argument that the jury panel was tained by the foreperson, who was a retired law enforcement officer who had previously had a civil conflict with defendant’s father, because, although the juror did not provide any information about a prior relationship or interaction with defendant’s father during the voir dire, the juror took an oath to be fair and impartial. Jordan v. State, 995 So. 2d 94, 2008 Miss. LEXIS 489 (Miss. 2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       If a juror on his voir dire conceals facts which render him incompetent and serves upon the jury, a verdict of conviction will be set aside and a new trial granted. Sheppric v. State, 79 Miss. 740, 31 So. 416 (Miss. 1901).
      </p>
      <p>
       A juror who on his voir dire conceals the fact from the court that he has formed and expressed such an opinion, is not rendered competent by this section [Code 1942, § 1763], and a verdict of guilty found by a jury of which he is a member should be set aside. The juror must disclose all of the facts, and then the court, under the statute, must pass upon his competency. Jeffries v. State, 74 Miss. 675, 21 So. 526, 1897 Miss. LEXIS 45 (Miss. 1897).

       In a thirteen-year-old defendant’s trial for murder, the trial court properly excluded jurors that it determined would be influenced by defendant’s age. Edmonds v. State, 2006 Miss. App. LEXIS 88 (Miss. Ct. App. Jan. 31, 2006), op. withdrawn, sub. op., 955 So. 2d 864, 2006 Miss. App. LEXIS 311 (Miss. Ct. App. 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       The trial court did not err in failing to dismiss a juror whose sister-in-law was in some manner (unknown by the juror) related to the victim’s nephew by marriage. Langston v. State, 791 So. 2d 273, 2001 Miss. App. LEXIS 206 (Miss. Ct. App. 2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   A murder defendant was not denied a fair trial by virtue of the fact that 9 of the 42 members of the regular and special venire panels had relatives who had been murdered where 7 of the members of the venire who had had relatives murdered did not serve on the jury and the defense had sufficient peremptory challenges remaining to remove the other 2 jurors if they so desired. Shell v. State, 554 So. 2d 887, 1989 Miss. LEXIS 492 (Miss. 1989), rev'd, in part, <cite class="us_code">498 U.S. 1</cite>, <cite class="s_court">111 S. Ct. 313</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">112 L.

       Where a venireman, contrary to the trial judge’s instructions at the beginning of the voir dire examination, volunteered in the presence of others that in his opinion the accused was automatically guilty of rape, whereupon the trial court sent the offending juror to jail and interrogated the other veniremen as to whether they could disregard the expressed opinion and base a verdict solely upon the evidence of the case, and the court’s instructions, which was answered in the affirmative by all of the veniremen, the trial court did not err in overruling the accused’s motion to enter a mistrial and quash the venire. Cameron v. State, 233 Miss. 404, 102 So. 2d 355, 1958 Miss. LEXIS 397 (Miss. 1958).

       In action against city for damages, error in excusing prospective jurors from city on ground that being taxpayers, of itself, disqualified them did not require reversal, where it did not appear that the jurors who were impaneled and before whom case was tried were not fair and impartial.

       Trial court properly failed to strike prospective jurors for cause because there was no showing that either juror had a close personal relationship with the victim’s son, but rather, there was only a showing that the jurors and the son had worked together and that the brother of one of the jurors was friends with the son; the relationships disclosed were insufficient to disturb the trial court’s judgment that both prospective jurors on their oaths could be impartial in defendant’s trial. Patton v. State, 248 So.3d 763, 2018 Miss. LEXIS 62 (Miss. 2018).

      <p>
       That a juror in an armed robbery case knew the victim and had herself been a robbery victim did not disqualify her from serving as a juror and did not require the trial court to sua sponte disqualify her because the juror affirmatively indicated that neither her relationship with the victim nor her prior circumstance as a robbery victim would prevent her from being fair and impartial and would not affect her ability to render a judgment based solely on the evidence presented. Archer v. State, 986 So. 2d 951, 2008 Miss. LEXIS 345 (Miss. 2008).
      </p>

Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t13c05s13-5-79" target="_self">13-5-79</a></cite>. The juror did not have a close personal relationship with the witnesses, but only knew them as members of the community; the juror confirmed that she could be fair and impartial. Smith v.

Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t13c05s13-5-79" target="_self">13-5-79</a></cite> for going off on a tangent during questioning; inter alia, the juror started asking about when it would be permissible to hit a woman, such as in a case of self-defense, and this issue was totally irrelevant to the case.

       A trial court in a robbery prosecution did not err in excusing a juror where the juror indicated extra-judicial knowledge concerning the person with whom the defendant was living at or near the time of the robbery, his statements were confusing concerning the effect of this knowledge, and it was not clear whether this knowledge would affect his verdict.

       While a prospective juror is not per se precluded from serving on the jury where the juror or a member of his or her family has been represented by an attorney who is involved in the case, a trial judge should carefully consider those instances in which a prospective juror or a family member has been represented by one of the attorney’s involved in the matter before him or her; despite a prospective juror’s honest and sincere belief that he or she can be completely fair and impartial, that person may find it very difficult to return a verdict against the client of an attorney to whom that person or a family member has turned for legal counsel in the past.

   Trial court’s refusal to excuse for cause jurors who stated on voir dire that they had read newspaper articles or seen television newscasts about the case after being admonished by trial court not to do so was not prejudicial error in murder prosecution; upon questioning, none of these jurors said that his or her opinion would be affected by anything they had read or seen.

       Under Code 1892, § 2355 (Code 1942, § 2177), jurors who have an opinion based on rumors which they have heard, which may be removed by evidence, and who have not talked to witnesses, have no prejudice against accused, and state that they can give him a fair trial on the evidence, uninfluenced by the rumors, are competent.

      <p>
       A juror who had heard rumors but had never heard any of the witnesses and who had an opinion from what he had heard, but could give defendant a fair trial, or a juror who had heard nothing from anyone who personally knew the facts, but who had formed an opinion from what he had seen in the newspapers and could give defendant a fair trial, is competent.

      </p>
      <p>
       If a juror states that he had formed and expressed an opinion but that it was not fixed and would not affect his verdict, and the accused, without having exhausted his peremptory challenges, does not offer to challenge him either for cause or peremptorily, he will not, after conviction, be granted a new trial because the juror had expressed the opinion that he ought to be convicted.

      </p>
      <p>
       Under this section [Code 1942, § 1763] one is not incompetent merely because on his voir dire he states that he lives in the immediate neighborhood where the crime was committed, had heard it discussed and had formed an opinion as to the guilt or innocence of accused of such a fixed character that it would require evidence to remove it, provided that he makes oath that he can try the case fairly and impartially according to the evidence.

If a juror indicates that if he or she was convinced of the guilt of the defendant and the circumstances warranted a verdict of guilty, he or she could return a verdict of guilty although that verdict could result in the death penalty, then the juror may not be struck from the jury venire for cause, despite his or her objections and concerns. A prospective juror may be struck if the juror indicates that he or she cannot consider and decide the facts impartially or cannot conscientiously apply the law or the court’s instructions. The juror need not expressly state that he or she absolutely refuses to consider the death penalty; an equivalent response made in any reasonable manner which indicates that the juror’s position is firm will suffice. Willie v. State, 585 So. 2d 660, 1991 Miss. LEXIS 454 (Miss. 1991).

   “Death qualification” of jurors prior to the guilt phase in a capital murder prosecution did not deprive the defendant of a jury composed of a fair cross section of the community. Minnick v.

   The exclusion of jurors who would not consider the death penalty under any circumstances was not error. Cole v. State, 525 So. 2d 365, 1987 Miss.

      </p>
      <p>
       Although excusing a prospective juror who would not vote to impose the death penalty under any facts or circumstances may have been error, it was harmless error where the defendant was indicted for murder but convicted of manslaughter. Wash v. State, 241 So. 2d 155, 1970 Miss. LEXIS 1326 (Miss. 1970).

       A juror is not rendered incompetent who when asked if he had conscientious scruples against capital punishment replied that he “would not like for a man to be hung.” Smith v. State, 55 Miss. 410, 1877 Miss. LEXIS 150 (Miss. 1877).

   Trial court could excuse prospective juror from serving on panel hearing capital murder case, on grounds that prospect was mother of 8-year-old boy and that she would feel apprehensive and be distracted if required to be away from child in event jury was sequestered. Walker v. State, 671 So. 2d 581, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 494 (Miss. 1995), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">519 U.S. 1011</cite>, <cite class="s_court">117 S. Ct. 518</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">136 L.

      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Trial court did not improperly excuse prospective juror from service in capital murder case; prospect tailored her response to question whether she could follow the law at both phases of trial to whichever counsel was questioning her, and she indicated she did not want to be involved in jury service and only “guessed” that she would “try” to listen to evidence and be fair to both sides. Walker v. State, 671 So. 2d 581, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 494 (Miss. 1995), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">519 U.S. 1011</cite>, <cite class="s_court">117 S. Ct. 518</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">136 L.

      </p>
      <p>
       A capital murder defendant was not denied a fair trial because he was forced to use his last peremptory challenge to remove a juror who was allegedly potentially biased since the loss of a peremptory challenge does not constitute a violation of the constitutional right to an impartial jury so long as the jury that sits is impartial, and the defendant did not show that an incompetent juror was forced to sit on the jury. Mettetal v. State, 615 So. 2d 600, 1993 Miss. LEXIS 96 (Miss. 1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       A murder defendant was not denied a fair trial on the ground that the trial court refused to accept his challenges for cause to 3 potential jurors where the defendant used peremptory challenges to remove those jurors, since the loss of a peremptory challenge does not constitute a violation of the constitutional right to an impartial jury; so long as the jury that sits is impartial, the fact that the defendant had to use peremptory challenges to achieve that result does not mean that the defendant was denied his or her constitutional rights. Mettetal v. State, 602 So. 2d 864, 1992 Miss. LEXIS 413 (Miss. 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       A prerequisite to presentation of a claim of a denial of constitutional rights due to denial of a challenge for cause is a showing that the defendant had exhausted all of his or her peremptory challenges and that the incompetent juror was forced to sit on the jury due to the trial court’s erroneous ruling. Mettetal v. State, 602 So. 2d 864, 1992 Miss. LEXIS 413 (Miss. 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   The denial of a challenge for cause is not error where it is not shown that the defense has exhausted peremptory challenges and is thus forced to accept the juror. Thus, a trial court’s refusal to remove 6 jurors for cause did not deprive the defendant of a fair trial where only one of the 6 actually served on the jury and she was not challenged at a time when the defense had 12 peremptory challenges, the defense still had one challenge left as well as an alternate challenge at the completion of the selection process, and the defense counsel never raised any objection to the other 5 jurors. Berry v. State, 575 So. 2d 1, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 849 (Miss. 1990), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">500 U.S. 928</cite>, <cite class="s_court">111 S. Ct. 2042</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">114 L.

      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   In a capital murder prosecution, the court’s failure to excuse for cause a potential juror who stated during voir dire that in order for him not to impose the death penalty the defendant would have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he should not be executed, was not reversible error where defense counsel used his twelfth peremptory challenge to remove the juror, defense counsel had not exhausted his peremptory challenges and did not challenge anyone else for cause or ask for more peremptory challenges. Minnick v. State, 551 So. 2d 77, 1988 Miss. LEXIS 612 (Miss. 1988), rev'd, <cite class="us_code">498 U.S. 146</cite>, <cite class="s_court">111 S. Ct. 486</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">112 L.

   Although defendant argued the circuit court erred in instructing potential jurors regarding the fact that defendant was 14 years old at the time he was accused of murder, the circuit court was bound by Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t13c05s13-5-79" target="_self">13-5-79</a></cite> to exclude potential jurors who stated they would be influenced by defendant’s age and could not try the case impartially. Evans v. State, 109 So.3d 1056, 2011 Miss. App. LEXIS 343 (Miss. Ct. App. 2011), rev'd, 109 So.3d 1044, 2013 Miss. LEXIS 31 (Miss. 2013).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Trial court did not abuse its discretion when it dismissed two jurors for cause based on the prosecution’s representation that the jurors were under investigation by a grand jury because defendant’s claim of error was procedurally barred by Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t13c05s13-5-79" target="_self">13-5-79</a></cite>, which provided that where the trial court was of the opinion that the prospective juror could not try the case impartially, the exclusion would not be assignable for error. Defendant failed to cite any authority for his proposition that the trial court’s acceptance of the representations of the prosecutor as to the two jurors was an abuse of discretion; and the trial court properly recognized that matters that have been or would be presented to the grand jury are uniquely known to the prosecutor. Burnside v. State, 912 So. 2d 1018, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 204 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 921 So. 2d 344, 2005 Miss. LEXIS 679 (Miss. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       The defendant was barred from challenging the trial court’s dismissal of a venire member who heard impermissible comments made by another venire member, but indicated that she could nevertheless keep a fair and open mind and render a fair verdict in the case, as the end result was a jury composed of fair and impartial jurors. Puckett v. State, 737 So. 2d 322, 1999 Miss. LEXIS 122 (Miss. 1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       On appeal, a defendant may not challenge the dismissal of a juror for cause. Edwards v. State, 723 So. 2d 1221, 1998 Miss. App. LEXIS 959 (Miss. Ct. App. 1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       Once a judge has exercised his or her discretion and determined that a juror probably could not be impartial, that determination may not be assigned on appeal as error. Coverson v. State, 617 So. 2d 642, 1993 Miss. LEXIS 168 (Miss. 1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a burglary prosecution, although a prospective juror who expressed uncertainty as to her ability to be a fair juror because of her sympathy for the elderly victim should have been excused for cause, the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt where the defendant suffered no actual prejudice. Carr v. State, 555 So. 2d 59, 1989 Miss. LEXIS 505 (Miss. 1989).
      </p>
      <p>
       Under statute, the excusing of prospective juror by trial judge, in exercise of discretion vested in him, is final. City of Jackson v. McFadden, 181 Miss. 1, 177 So. 755, 1937 Miss. LEXIS 130 (Miss. 1937).
      </p>
      <p>
       After jury had been accepted, but before evidence is introduced, court may examine juror as to alleged disqualification not previously known, and if examination leaves juror’s qualification in doubt, may stand him aside or sustain challenge for cause, and such action does not require reversal in absence of abuse of discretion. Sullivan v. State, 155 Miss. 629, 125 So. 115, 1929 Miss. LEXIS 354 (Miss. 1929).
      </p>
      <p>
       Exclusion by court, of own motion, of juror who heard part of former trial held not reversible error. Barnett v. State, 146 Miss. 893, 112 So. 586, 1927 Miss. LEXIS 255 (Miss. 1927).
      </p>
      <p>
       On appeal the finding of the circuit court as to a juror’s qualifications is prima facie correct. Donahue v. State, 142 Miss. 20, 107 So. 15, 1926 Miss. LEXIS 55 (Miss. 1926).
      </p>
      <p>
       The action of the court in setting aside a juror of its own motion is not assignable for error and neither is its action in sustaining a challenge on the ground that there is a criminal case pending against the challenged juror. Lewis v. State, 85 Miss. 35, 37 So. 497, 1904 Miss. LEXIS 129 (Miss. 1904).
      </p>
      <p>
       It is nonreversible error to sustain the state’s challenge of a juror for the cause that there was a criminal case pending against him in the courts, since if the court had set him aside of its own motion, it could not have been assigned for error. Lewis v. State, 85 Miss. 35, 37 So. 497, 1904 Miss. LEXIS 129 (Miss. 1904).

   Under the Batson test, the prosecutor satisfied the burden of articulating a nondiscriminatory reason for striking a black juror where he explained that he struck the juror because the juror had long unkempt hair, a mustache and a beard, since the wearing of beards and long unkempt hair are not characteristics that are particular to any race. Purkett v. Elem, <cite class="us_code">514 U.S. 765</cite>, <cite class="s_court">115 S. Ct. 1769</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">131 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 834, 1995 U.S. LEXIS 3181 (U.S. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a prosecution for capital murder and conspiracy to commit capital murder, the trial court committed reversible error in failing to place the initial burden on the State to establish a prima facie case of racial discrimination in the defendant’s use of his peremptory challenges, before concluding that the defendant failed to offer a race-neutral reason for challenging one of the jurors, since the defendant was arbitrarily and erroneously denied the use of one of his peremptory challenges, and the composition of the jury was directly altered as a result. Colosimo v. Senatobia Motor Inn, 662 So. 2d 552, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 479 (Miss. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   A prosecutor’s race-neutral explanation for peremptorily striking a potential juror need not rise to the level of justifying the exercise of a challenge for cause. Davis v. State, 660 So. 2d 1228, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 287 (Miss. 1995), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">517 U.S. 1192</cite>, <cite class="s_court">116 S. Ct. 1684</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">134 L.

      <p>
       <p>
   In a capital murder prosecution in which a black defendant was convicted and sentenced by an all-white jury for the murders of 4 white victims, the trial court did not err by allowing the State to peremptorily strike the sole potential black juror, since the reason stated by the prosecution for the peremptory challenge-that the juror indicated she would have difficulty finding suitable child care during the trial-was sufficiently race-neutral. Carr v. State, 655 So. 2d 824, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 56 (Miss. 1995), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">516 U.S. 1077</cite>, <cite class="s_court">116 S. Ct. 783</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">133 L.

       The trial court in a capital murder prosecution erred by not requiring the State to give racially-neutral reasons for exercising peremptory challenges against 7 out of 13 black jurors on the venire, even though there was no showing that the defendant was of a minority class, and therefore the case would be remanded for a hearing on whether the Batson criteria were violated by the State’s exercise of its peremptory challenges. Thorson v. State, 653 So. 2d 876, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 600 (Miss. 1994).

      <p>
       In a personal injury action against an automobile manufacturer arising out of a one-vehicle accident, the automobile manufacturer was not afforded the fair and impartial jury to which it was entitled where a substantial number of the jurors had in the past been represented by the attorney for the plaintiff, or had a family member who was represented by the attorney; due to the number of persons on the venire and the jury who had been represented by the plaintiff’s attorney or whose family members had been clients of the attorney, there was a “statistical aberration” in the make-up of the venire and the jury, so that the opportunity for these jurors to exercise their influence over the remainder of the jury was too great a risk to be taken. Toyota Motor Corp. v. McLaurin, 642 So. 2d 351, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 320 (Miss. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       The reasons proffered by the State for using 5 of its 7 peremptory challenges against black jurors were sufficient to withstand a Batson challenge where the reasons given were (1) the juror had a brother in the penitentiary; (2) the juror had attended high school with the defendant; (3) the juror wore dark glasses in the courtroom; (4) the juror was employed in a company in which there had been a riot which was quelled by the police; and (5) the juror shared a last name with many persons in the penitentiary and the prosecutor believed he was related to an inmate, and the defense made no attempt to show that the reasons proffered were pretextual, of disparate impact, or not true. Henderson v. State, 641 So. 2d 1184, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 374 (Miss. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Some acceptable race-neutral reasons for challenging a juror are: (1) involvement in criminal activity; (2) unemployment; (3) employment history; (4) relative of juror involved in crime; (5) low income occupation; (6) juror wore gold chains, rings and watch; and (7) dress and demeanor. Foster v. State, 639 So. 2d 1263, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 670 (Miss. 1994), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">514 U.S. 1019</cite>, <cite class="s_court">115 S. Ct. 1365</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">131 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 221, 1995 U.S. LEXIS 2061 (U.S. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       The State’s reasons for using 4 of its 5 peremptory challenges against black jurors were sufficiently race-neutral where the first juror had a pending civil lawsuit, the second juror had worked with a defense witness and the prosecution objected to his age and demeanor, the third juror had previously sat on 2 criminal juries which resulted in one “not guilty” verdict and one mistrial, and the prosecutor was unable to make eye contact with the fourth juror while the juror continuously made eye contact with the defendant. Harper v. State, 635 So. 2d 864, 1994 Miss. LEXIS 201 (Miss. 1994), limited, Flowers v. State, 947 So. 2d 910, 2007 Miss. LEXIS 24 (Miss. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       A trial judge is required to make an on-the-record factual determination that each reason proffered by the State for exercising a peremptory challenge is, in fact, race neutral; this requirement is to be prospective in nature. Hatten v. State, 628 So. 2d 294, 1993 Miss. LEXIS 522 (Miss. 1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       The State successfully rebutted a black defendant’s Batson challenge to the State’s exercise of peremptory challenges to eliminate four black venire members where 2 of the venire members were challenged because they were of an age to be employed and had no occupation, and the other 2 were challenged because they were acquainted with the defendant or her family. Porter v. State, 616 So. 2d 899, 1993 Miss. LEXIS 115 (Miss. 1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Batson rule applies to both a prosecutor’s and a defendant’s peremptory challenges. Griffin v. State, 610 So. 2d 354, 1992 Miss. LEXIS 749 (Miss. 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       A defendant may make a prima facie showing of purposeful racial discrimination in selection of the venire by relying solely on the facts concerning its selection in the defendant’s case; a defendant may establish a prima facie case of purposeful discrimination in selection of the jury solely on evidence concerning the prosecutor’s exercise of peremptory challenges at the defendant’s trial. Griffin v. State, 607 So. 2d 1197, 1992 Miss. LEXIS 603 (Miss. 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       A white defendant had standing to object to the State’s use of 5 of its 6 peremptory challenges to strike black jurors; however, the defendant failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination where the State offered race neutral reasons for striking each individual black juror and the defendant’s attorney offered no evidence to rebut the State’s reasons for striking the jurors. Green v. State, 597 So. 2d 656, 1992 Miss. LEXIS 206 (Miss. 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       A defendant failed to establish a prima facie case of racial discrimination in jury selection, even though the defendant was black and the prosecution exercised preemptory challenges to eliminate 3 black jurors, where the jurors were excluded because they were acquainted with the defendant; while excluding jurors on the ground that they were acquainted with the defendant might have had a discriminatory effect since the defendant’s acquaintances were primarily black, the law does not proscribe the mere incidental exclusion of blacks from a jury. Govan v. State, 591 So. 2d 428, 1991 Miss. LEXIS 836 (Miss. 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       A county’s jury venire selection did not systematically exclude blacks in violation of a black defendant’s constitutional equal protection rights, even though there were only 2 blacks out of 12 on the jury which rendered a verdict against the defendant when 37 percent of the county was black, where the jury selection was based upon voter registration lists of the county without regard to race. Harris v. State, 576 So. 2d 1262, 1991 Miss. LEXIS 121 (Miss. 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       The reasons given by a district attorney for exercising a peremptory challenge to excuse a black juror were sufficiently race-neutral where the district attorney stated that the juror was a truck driver “which may or may not mean he’s a transient,” the juror wore overalls with a black T-Shirt in the courtroom, and he was unmarried and did not have children “which shows that he doesn’t have a stake in the community like somebody that’s established.” Bradley v. State, 562 So. 2d 1276, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 267 (Miss. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       A murder defendant’s argument that the jury was patently flawed because the jury was white and the defendant was black was without merit. The mere fact that a jury is white and a defendant is black does not violate Batson, but rather it is the racially discriminatory exercise of peremptory challenges to strike black jurors from the jury that violates the Batson rule. Sudduth v. State, 562 So. 2d 67, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 235 (Miss. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       A defendant’s motion to quash the array of jurors was properly denied where nothing in the record indicated that the sheriff, his deputies, or any other person tampered with the jury or purposely evaded serving jurors in order to stack the jury, even though 100 jurors were summoned and 53 of them were not found or marked “out of the county.” Avery v. State, 555 So. 2d 1039, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 7 (Miss. 1990), overruled,
   Mayfield v. State, 612 So. 2d 1120, 1992 Miss. LEXIS 861 (Miss. 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       No prima facie case of racial discrimination was shown in the prosecution’s use of peremptory challenges, even though the prosecutor exercised 5 of his 7 peremptory challenges against black jurors, where the victim of the crime charged and the defendant were black, the prosecutor and the defendant had several challenges left, numerous potential black jurors were left uncalled, and one black juror was in the jury box. Dennis v. State, 555 So. 2d 679, 1989 Miss. LEXIS 465 (Miss. 1989).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   A murder defendant was not denied a fair trial by virtue of the fact that 9 of the 42 members of the regular and special venire panels had relatives who had been murdered where 7 of the members of the venire who had had relatives murdered did not serve on the jury and the defense had sufficient peremptory challenges remaining to remove the other 2 jurors if they so desired. Shell v. State, 554 So. 2d 887, 1989 Miss. LEXIS 492 (Miss. 1989), rev'd, in part, <cite class="us_code">498 U.S. 1</cite>, <cite class="s_court">111 S. Ct. 313</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">112 L.

      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   After the State has supplied a neutral nonracial explanation for peremptory challenges, in the absence of an actual proffer of evidence by the defendant concerning this issue, the Supreme Court may not reverse on this point. It is incumbent upon the defendant to come forward with proof when given the opportunity for rebuttal. Davis v. State, 551 So. 2d 165, 1989 Miss. LEXIS 364 (Miss. 1989), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">494 U.S. 1074</cite>, <cite class="s_court">110 S. Ct. 1796</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">108 L.

      </p>
      <p>
       A plaintiff in a medical malpractice case was denied her right to an impartial jury where there were over 40,000 persons in the county from which a jury could have been drawn and the plaintiff was limited to a jury pool of 25, 48 percent of which were connected in some way to the defendant doctor, because of the “statistical aberration” of the makeup of the venire and the strong likelihood that the opportunity for undue influence over other jurors in the case was too great. Hudson v. Taleff, 546 So. 2d 359, 1989 Miss. LEXIS 299 (Miss. 1989).
      </p>
      <p>
       A defendant established a prima facie case of purposeful discrimination in the selection of a petit jury where he showed that he was a black person and that the district attorney had exercised peremptory challenges to remove 5 black persons from the jury. The fact that the prosecution used all of the peremptory strikes necessary to remove all but one black person from the jury satisfied the requirement of raising an inference of racial discrimination. Conerly v. State, 544 So. 2d 1370, 1989 Miss. LEXIS 265 (Miss. 1989).
      </p>
      <p>
       When a criminal defendant establishes a prima facie case of the impermissible exclusion of black jurors through the use of peremptory challenges, the burden of proof shifts to the state to come forward with a racially neutral explanation for each of the challenges that must be related to the particular case being tried. Dedeaux v. State, 519 So. 2d 886, 1988 Miss. LEXIS 48 (Miss. 1988).
      </p>

       The provisions of the law in regard to the listing, drawing, summoning or impaneling of juries are directory merely. Smith v. State, 242 Miss. 728, 137 So. 2d 172, 1962 Miss. LEXIS 586 (Miss. 1962).
      </p>
      <p>
       The trial court did not commit reversible error in overruling defendant’s motion for a mistrial, or that a new panel of jurors be tendered to the defendant, where, after ten jurors had been finally accepted to try the defendant for murder, the court, out of the presence of defendant or his counsel, excused one of the jurors because illness required the juror’s presence at home, where the court had allowed the defendant one additional peremptory challenge. Upshaw v. State, 231 Miss. 158, 94 So. 2d 337, 1957 Miss. LEXIS 500 (Miss. 1957).
      </p>
      <p>
       In prosecution for contributing to delinquency of minor under 18 years of age, failure to quash jury panel is not error when trial judge in sentencing defendant in case immediately preceding trial of defendant, involving similar circumstances, stated as reason for imposing fine and jail sentence that he was interested in protection of boys and girls, though statement was in presence of prospective jurors, since degree of punishment is matter with which trial jury has no concern. Broadstreet v. State, 208 Miss. 789, 45 So. 2d 590, 1950 Miss. LEXIS 299 (Miss. 1950).
      </p>
      <p>
       Special venire will not be set aside merely because sheriff did not follow court’s recommended procedure in selecting panel where time was short and a fair and impartial panel was summoned. Riley v. State, 208 Miss. 336, 44 So. 2d 455, 1950 Miss. LEXIS 252 (Miss. 1950).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Denial of motion to quash special venire in homicide prosecution against Negro defendant because under the voir dire examination there appeared only one member of the Negro race did not constitute error where there was no showing how many other, if any, Negroes were summoned and failed to respond. Patton v. State, 207 Miss. 120, 40 So. 2d 592, 1949 Miss. LEXIS 322 (Miss.), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">338 U.S. 855</cite>, <cite class="s_court">70 S.

      <p>
       Special venire will not be quashed except for fraud or total departure from procedure laid down. Moon v. State, 176 Miss. 72, 168 So. 476, 1936 Miss. LEXIS 127 (Miss. 1936); Riley v. State, 208 Miss. 336, 44 So. 2d 455, 1950 Miss. LEXIS 252 (Miss. 1950).
      </p>
      <p>
       Motion to quash special venire on ground that it should have been summoned from new jury list held properly overruled where new list had been in jury box less than thirty days before special venire was granted and trial had. Moon v. State, 176 Miss. 72, 168 So. 476, 1936 Miss. LEXIS 127 (Miss. 1936).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where trial was had during second week of term, overruling defendant’s motion to quash jury panel summoned for first week held harmless. Mississippi & S. V. R. Co. v. Brown, 160 Miss. 123, 132 So. 556, 1931 Miss. LEXIS 124 (Miss. 1931).
      </p>
      <p>
       Panel should not be quashed except for fraud and unless there was total departure from course described by statute. Harris v. State, 155 Miss. 794, 125 So. 253, 1929 Miss. LEXIS 359 (Miss. 1929).

       No one of the twelve jurors can impeach the verdict where the verdict was reached by only nine. Ulmer v. Pistole, 115 Miss. 485, 76 So. 522, 1917 Miss. LEXIS 222 (Miss. 1917).
      </p>

       The testimony must show that fraud was committed or flagrant violations of the jury laws that constitute fraud in law before the court is authorized to quash a jury box. Cook v. State, 90 Miss. 137, 43 So. 618, 1907 Miss. LEXIS 84 (Miss. 1907).

       In prosecution for rape, new trial was not required by fact that during progress of trial, two jurors were inadvertently separated from the others for a period of approximately 15 or 20 minutes, where there was no suggestion that the separated jurors were contacted by anyone. Lampley v. State, 291 So. 2d 707, 1974 Miss. LEXIS 1736 (Miss. 1974).
      </p>
      <p>
       No new trial was warranted on grounds that a deputy sheriff without court authorization drove a bus and ate in the same room with the jurors where the deputy did not testify as a witness in the case on its merits, he did not even appear in the courtroom at any time in the course of the trial, his function was to assist in the process of making it possible for the jurors to eat, his only activity was to respond to the sheriff’s direction that he drive the members of the jury, together with the two bailiffs, to the restaurant in the bus, and at all times complained of the jurors were in the protective custody of the bailiff; however, it would have been better policy for the bus driver to receive in open court detailed instructions from the trial judge in the presence of jurors, bailiffs, counsel, and the defendant. Bickcom v. State, 286 So. 2d 823, 1973 Miss. LEXIS 1324 (Miss. 1973).
      </p>
      <p>
       A conversation between a juror and a material witness in a prosecution, the witness being a deputy sheriff and jailer, and having served as a courtroom deputy, just after the witness had testified for the state, was reversible error, where the defendant had, prior to the introduction of evidence, moved the court to direct police officers, including the instant witness, to remove themselves from close proximity to the jury box, and had moved for a mistrial immediately after the observed conversation, both of which requests were denied. Perkins v. State, 244 So. 2d 414, 1971 Miss. LEXIS 1336 (Miss. 1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       Undue pressure upon jury to reach verdict is not shown by fact that court ordered jury to retire to jury room at 6 p. m. and kept them in room until almost 8 p. m., without supper, or without asking them if they desired supper, where record is silent as to existence of any of the facts upon which this contention is predicated. Broadstreet v. State, 208 Miss. 789, 45 So. 2d 590, 1950 Miss. LEXIS 299 (Miss. 1950).

       One who attempts to bribe or influence decision of juror is guilty of contempt of court, regardless of whether act which constitutes contempt is committed in or out of presence of court, or whether juror is actually sworn on particular case or is only member of panel from which trial jury is to be selected. Jones v. State, 208 Miss. 762, 45 So. 2d 576, 1950 Miss. LEXIS 294 (Miss. 1950).

      <p>
       Person is guilty of contempt of court when he approaches prospective juror, who has been summoned for trial of murder case, at juror’s home and advises juror that there are some things in favor of defendant that court will not permit to go to jury, that deceased had been running over defendant, but that fact would be kept from jury and if it wasn’t brought out juror should give defendant a break.

       Inquiries or requests made of bailiff by jury after it has retired to consider case should be reported to trial judge, and bailiff should never give opinion about anything involved in case. Passons v. State, 208 Miss. 545, 45 So. 2d 131, 1950 Miss. LEXIS 273 (Miss. 1950), overruled,

      </p>
      <p>
       No meddling with, or intent to influence, jury is shown which could cause any harm by fact that after jury had retired for deliberation, one asked bailiff if judge would further instruct them if liquor had any legal property value, bailiff stated that he did not think judge would give further instructions and that jury had their instructions, and door was shut and jury said nothing further.

       It is not error for a jury to be retired pending argument to the court on the competency of a witness. Lewis v. State, 85 Miss. 35, 37 So. 497, 1904 Miss. LEXIS 129 (Miss. 1904).

     </h3>
     <p>
      In Harrison County, a county having two judicial districts, the law in relation to the selection and liability to jury service of grand and petit juries shall be applicable to each of the two judicial districts of the county in the same manner as if each district were a separate county, so far as the same may be made to apply. No person shall be made to serve as a grand or petit juror except in the district in which he resides. Lists of persons subject and liable to jury duty shall be made and grand and petit jurors shall be selected and empaneled in each of said districts in the same manner as if each were a separate county, except in such cases where it is otherwise provided by law.

       Trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying a doctor’s motion to quash the jury panel—when the doctor contended that the doctor was denied a fair trial in a medical malpractice action because the doctor, who was Caucasian, had an all-African-American venire in a county that was 25 percent Caucasian—because the appellate court found no evidence showing any actual fraud, prejudice, or such a flagrant violation of duty as to amount to fraud. Kronfol v. Johnson, — So.3d —, 2019 Miss. App. LEXIS 183 (Miss. Ct. App. Apr. 30, 2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       Misallocation of defendant’s peremptory challenges did not affect a fundamental, substantive right because so long as the jury that sat was impartial, the fact that defendant had to pool his regular and alternate peremptory challenges to achieve that result did not mean his Sixth Amendment rights were violated; despite being selected in an irregular manner, the jury was a legal jury with the authority to render a verdict against defendant. Carr v. State, 190 So.3d 1, 2015 Miss. App. LEXIS 605 (Miss. Ct. App. 2015).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial judge’s questioning of circuit clerk established that clerk had complied, or substantially complied, with statute with respect to random selection of jurors to try defendant charged with attempting to obtain controlled substance by misrepresentation or fraud. Griffin v. State, 494 So. 2d 376, 1986 Miss. LEXIS 2651 (Miss. 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a prosecution for robbery by assault, there was no reversible error in impaneling the juries where the system used consisted of a court administrator’s shuffling information cards filled out by prospective jurors and arranging those cards in groups of 12, with the groups designated as Juries 1, 2 and 3. Harris v. State, 406 So. 2d 823, 1981 Miss. LEXIS 2437 (Miss. 1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   The method of selecting a jury is ordinarily within the sound judicial discretion of the trial judge, except in those circumstances where the jury selection method is set forth by statute. Peters v. State, 314 So. 2d 724, 1975 Miss. LEXIS 1683 (Miss.), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">423 U.S. 1019</cite>, <cite class="s_court">96 S. Ct. 457</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">46 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 392, 1975 U.S. LEXIS 3639 (U.S. 1975).
      </p>
      <p>
       It was within the sound discretion of the trial judge as to how many jurors would be submitted to the litigant for their voir dire. Bright v. State, 293 So. 2d 818, 1974 Miss. LEXIS 1814 (Miss. 1974).
      </p>
      <p>
       The statutory method of selecting a jury is discretionary and not mandatory. Henry v. State, 209 So. 2d 614, 1968 Miss. LEXIS 1454 (Miss. 1968).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Considered as a whole, the statutes providing for the selection of jurors are not void for vagueness. Reed v. State, 199 So. 2d 803, 1967 Miss. LEXIS 1309 (Miss. 1967), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">390 U.S. 413</cite>, <cite class="s_court">88 S. Ct. 1113</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">19 L. Ed. 2</cite>d 1273, 1968 U.S. LEXIS 2174 (U.S. 1968).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   The jury laws of Mississippi are directory and the selection of the jury list in an informal or irregular manner does not render it illegal. Shinall v. State, 199 So. 2d 251, 1967 Miss. LEXIS 1290 (Miss.), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">389 U.S. 1014</cite>, <cite class="s_court">88 S. Ct. 590</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">19 L.

      </p>
      <p>
       The jury laws are merely directory, and a jury drawn informally or in an irregular manner is legal “after it shall have been impaneled and sworn.” Ladner v. State, 197 So. 2d 257, 1967 Miss. LEXIS 1524 (Miss. 1967).
      </p>
      <p>
       The provisions of the law in regard to the listing, drawing, summoning or impaneling of juries are directory merely. Smith v. State, 242 Miss. 728, 137 So. 2d 172, 1962 Miss. LEXIS 586 (Miss. 1962); Williams v. State, 220 So. 2d 325, 1969 Miss. LEXIS 1455 (Miss. 1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       Petitioner’s allegation in an application for writ of habeas corpus that his conviction constituted a deprivation of his liberty without due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution because of the systematic exclusion of members of his race from the lists from which grand and petit juries were selected in the county where he was indicted ad convicted, and that because of his ignorance and circumstances of his arrest and incarceration, and as a consequence of the law of Mississippi, he was not able to challenge the competency of the grand jury, together with a showing of the speed in which the petitioner was tried following his indictment, were sufficient to entitle the petitioner to a hearing on the question of whether he had adequately safeguarded his constitutional rights during his trial for murder. United States ex rel. Goldsby v. Harpole, 249 F.2d 417, 1957 U.S. App. LEXIS 4002 (5th Cir. Miss. 1957).
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the laws with reference to the impaneling of jurors are directory, the trial court did not commit reversible error in overruling defendant’s motion for a mistrial, or that a new panel be tendered him, where, after ten jurors had been finally accepted to try defendant for murder, the court, out of the presence of the defendant or his counsel, excused a juror because illness required the juror’s presence at home, but allowed defendant one additional peremptory challenge. Upshaw v. State, 231 Miss. 158, 94 So. 2d 337, 1957 Miss. LEXIS 500 (Miss. 1957).
      </p>
      <p>
       A Negro convicted of feloniously receiving stolen property was not entitled to a new trial upon the ground of unproven allegations of prejudice against members of his race by the jurors trying him, where no objection had been made to the qualifications of the jurors before the jury had been impaneled and sworn. Walker v. State, 229 Miss. 540, 91 So. 2d 548, 1956 Miss. LEXIS 638 (Miss. 1956).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section [Code 1942, § 1798] in relation to the listing, drawing, summoning, and impaneling of juries is directory merely and not mandatory. Wiggins v. State, 224 Miss. 414, 80 So. 2d 17, 1955 Miss. LEXIS 505 (Miss. 1955).
      </p>
      <p>
       The trial court in a prosecution for murder did not err in denying defendant’s motion to quash a jury panel for the reason that the names of the jurors in the compartment of the jury box representing a particular supervisor’s district had been exhausted and the jury was selected from other supervisors’ districts. Wiggins v. State, 224 Miss. 414, 80 So. 2d 17, 1955 Miss. LEXIS 505 (Miss. 1955).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the statute provides that not less than twenty names nor more than forty names are to be drawn for a jury box for each week of county term, the statute is mandatory as to the minimum number but only directory as to the maximum number. Adams v. State, 220 Miss. 812, 72 So. 2d 211, 1954 Miss. LEXIS 500 (Miss. 1954).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the statute provides that a maximum of forty names should be drawn from the jury box for week of term, a defendant was not prejudiced by the drawing of sixty names. Adams v. State, 220 Miss. 812, 72 So. 2d 211, 1954 Miss. LEXIS 500 (Miss. 1954).
      </p>
      <p>
       Under this section [Code 1942, § 1798] jury laws are directory and not mandatory and case will not be reversed unless there is radical departure from statutory scheme of summoning and impaneling juries. Kouvarakis v. Hawver, 208 Miss. 697, 45 So. 2d 278, 1950 Miss. LEXIS 288 (Miss. 1950).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Motion to quash indictment against Negro on ground that there were no Negro names listed or placed in jury box from which grand jury was drawn is properly overruled when it appears that there were only two Negroes in the county who were qualified electors and who could have served on either grand or petit juries at time juries were impaneled. Flowers v. State, 209 Miss. 86, 41 So. 2d 352, 1949 Miss. LEXIS 473 (Miss. 1949), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">339 U.S. 946</cite>, <cite class="s_court">70 S. Ct. 800</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">94 L. Ed. 1360</cite>, 1950 U.S. LEXIS 2045 (U.S. 1950).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Manner in which lists of jurors is selected by board of supervisors and placed in jury box involves solely question of state procedure and trial court is not in error in overruling motion to quash indictment on that ground when objections to qualification of grand jurors is not made before they are impaneled and defendant was at time represented by able lawyer and had reason to believe his case would be investigated by grand jury and he could have obtained information as to venire from which grand jury would be drawn. Flowers v. State, 209 Miss. 86, 41 So. 2d 352, 1949 Miss. LEXIS 473 (Miss. 1949), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">339 U.S. 946</cite>, <cite class="s_court">70 S. Ct. 800</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">94 L. Ed. 1360</cite>, 1950 U.S. LEXIS 2045 (U.S. 1950).
      </p>
      <p>
       It is duty of circuit and chancery clerks, board of supervisors and sheriff to comply strictly with all of requirements of statutes in manner of listing, drawing and selecting jurors, compiling jury lists, and summoning and impaneling juries, but since statutes on the subject are merely directory, judgment will not be reversed where there was no radical departure from statutory scheme of selecting and impaneling jury and jury selected was fair and impartial. Lott v. State, 204 Miss. 610, 37 So. 2d 782, 1948 Miss. LEXIS 394 (Miss. 1948).
      </p>
      <p>
       On motion to quash jury list from which grand and petit juries were to be chosen, for alleged reason that board of supervisors had not selected names of jurors in manner required by law governing selection of qualified electors, placing names in jury box, and subsequent drawing of juries, it is competent to show by testimony of chancery and circuit clerks manner in which statutory requirements were compiled with. Lott v. State, 204 Miss. 610, 37 So. 2d 782, 1948 Miss. LEXIS 394 (Miss. 1948).
      </p>
      <p>
       Custom in selecting grand and petit jurors by clerks of circuit and chancery courts and the sheriff, pursuant to direction by a circuit judge, gathering together and taking slips out of the jury box and spreading them face up on a table so that they could see the names of the prospective jurors, and laying aside the names of those whom they did not think would make good jurors or who would be unable to serve, condemned as improper, since such action in effect constitutes a purging or revision of the board of supervisors’ list regularly selected pursuant to law. Reynolds v. State, 199 Miss. 409, 24 So. 2d 781, 1946 Miss. LEXIS 211 (Miss. 1946).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section [Code 1942, § 1798] and other statutory provisions relating to listing, drawing, summoning, and impaneling juries are directory merely, and jury listed, drawn, summoned, and impaneled in irregular manner constitutes legal jury after it has been impaneled and sworn. Wampold v. State, 170 Miss. 732, 155 So. 350, 1934 Miss. LEXIS 170 (Miss. 1934).

      </p>
      <p>
       In view of the directory character of the jury laws, the court, where the public interest requires, has the power to reassemble the grand jury during the term. Haynes v. State, 93 Miss. 670, 47 So. 522 (Miss. 1908).

       Even conceding that the trial judge should have adopted some other and different mode of procuring additional members for a grand jury, still, after the jury was sworn and impaneled, it was by the law deemed a legal jury, and any error of the court was cured by the express terms of the statute.

   Section<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t13c05s13-5-9" target="_self">13-5-9</a></cite> is directory only and the selection of a jury under the section does not render the jury illegal. Polk v.

      </p>
      <p>
       In the absence of a showing of fraud on the rights of the accused in a criminal case, it was not reversible error for the trial court to excuse from jury service, for good cause, before the case was called for trial and in chambers without notice to the accused, 26 of the 74 persons who appeared in response to an order for a special venire of 90 persons. Parker v. State, 201 Miss. 579, 29 So. 2d 910, 1947 Miss. LEXIS 423 (Miss. 1947).
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that the trial judge required inquires as to challenges for cause to be directed to eighteen men instead of twelve men did not make the impanelment of the jury improper. Smith v. State, 190 Miss. 24, 198 So. 562, 1940 Miss. LEXIS 180 (Miss. 1940).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant in capital case not objecting to manner of drawing special venire at time of drawing, waived objection. Arnold v. State, 171 Miss. 164, 157 So. 247, 1934 Miss. LEXIS 217 (Miss. 1934).
      </p>

       Where regular jury box exhausted, drawing special venire from jury list prepared for succeeding year, held mere irregularity. Arnold v. State, 171 Miss. 164, 157 So. 247, 1934 Miss. LEXIS 217 (Miss. 1934).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where regular jury panel was exhausted and the court directed the sheriff to fill the panel, which he did by summoning bystanders, rather than from the jury box, the court order not requiring this to be done, it was too late for defendant to complain of such procedure after the trial was over in view of the provisions of this section [Code 1942, § 1798]. Wampold v. State, 170 Miss. 732, 155 So. 350, 1934 Miss. LEXIS 170 (Miss. 1934).

       Error, if any, in proceedings for making up grand jury list pursuant to order directing issuance of special venire facias held mere irregularity, cured when jury was impaneled and sworn. Nelson v. State, 160 Miss. 401, 133 So. 248, 1931 Miss. LEXIS 159 (Miss. 1931).
      </p>

       Error, if any, in not keeping jury box locked and sealed and prematurely preparing jury list was cured where jury was impaneled and sworn to try case in view of this section [Code 1942, § 1798]. Wells v. State, 160 Miss. 298, 133 So. 227, 1931 Miss. LEXIS 153 (Miss. 1931).
      </p>

       Where trial was had during second week of term, overruling defendant’s motion to quash jury panel summoned for first week held harmless. Mississippi & S. V. R. Co. v. Brown, 160 Miss. 123, 132 So. 556, 1931 Miss. LEXIS 124 (Miss. 1931).
      </p>
      <p>
       In homicide prosecution, where court ordered special venire from first district of county, refusal to order one from second district held not error, statutes being directory. Taylor v. State, 148 Miss. 621, 114 So. 390, 1927 Miss. LEXIS 48 (Miss. 1927).
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that the board of supervisors failed to select the jury from the districts in proportion to the qualified persons therein does not authorize the quashing of the venire in the absence of proof that the grand jury was composed of impartial and fair men. Atkinson v. State, 137 Miss. 42, 101 So. 490, 1924 Miss. LEXIS 195 (Miss. 1924).
      </p>
      <p>
       In the absence of proof that the jury was not fair and impartial a mere irregularity in summoning the jury does not constitute reversible error. Ferguson v. State, 107 Miss. 559, 65 So. 584, 1914 Miss. LEXIS 118 (Miss. 1914).
      </p>
      <p>
       After the impaneling of a grand jury certain members having been excused, the court directed that bystanders (designating them) serve as grand jurors, though such persons were not among those listed by the supervisors for jury service and though their names were not on the venire drawn for service during the term, defendant made no direct challenge and took no exception at the time. In the absence of any showing that the grand jury was not fair and impartial, there was no ground for reversal of a conviction on an indictment found by it. Posey v. State, 86 Miss. 141, 38 So. 324, 1905 Miss. LEXIS 35 (Miss. 1905).
      </p>
      <p>
       If an impartial jury be obtained in a murder case the defendant cannot, after conviction, predicate error of an irregularity in drawing a special venire, the statutes on the subject being directory. Buchanan v. State, 84 Miss. 332, 36 So. 388, 1904 Miss. LEXIS 44 (Miss. 1904).
      </p>

       A special venire will not be quashed because the trial judge caused the sheriff to submit to him before the service of the writ the names of the deputies selected to execute it, that they might be shown to the attorneys in the case with a view of receiving objections to them, or because on objection by the state’s attorney two of the persons named were not appointed, the sheriff appointing two unobjectionable persons in their place. If such a proceeding be irregular, it is cured by this section [Code 1942, § 1798], declaring that juries irregularly summoned shall be deemed legal after being impaneled and sworn. Lipscomb v. State, 76 Miss. 223, 25 So. 158, 1898 Miss. LEXIS 130 (Miss. 1898).

       Where a special venire is ordered without application by the district attorney or defendant, it may be quashed on motion, but, after the jury is impaneled, the irregularity is cured by the statute. Gavigan v. State, 55 Miss. 533, 1878 Miss. LEXIS 5 (Miss. 1878).

   Although persons over 65 years of age and persons who have served on a jury within 2 years are exempt from jury service under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t13c05s13-5-25" target="_self">13-5-25</a></cite>, neither the circuit court nor the deputy circuit clerk have authority to act unilaterally and strike such persons from the jury list. Such persons are eligible for jury service and have every lawful right and authority to serve if called and selected. When their names are drawn, such persons must be summoned the same as other prospective jurors and no one has authority to exempt any such juror from service unless he or she claims the privilege and asks to be excused. Thus, a judgment of conviction and sentence was reversed where the deputy circuit clerk unilaterally struck from the jury list all persons over 65 years of age and all persons who had served on a jury within the 2 preceding years. Adams v. State, 537 So. 2d 891, 1989 Miss. LEXIS 28 (Miss. 1989).

       Statutory provision (Code 1942, § 1794) that if at any term of court it appears that there are not a sufficient number of jurors present to make a jury, the court shall immediately cause the proper number of jurors to be drawn from the jury box and summoned, and, if there be no jury box to be drawn from, the court shall direct the requisite number of persons, qualified as jurors, to be summoned to appear, is mandatory, and is not affected by this section [Code 1942, § 1798].J.

       Where, in a personal injury action, only twelve jurors drawn from the jury box qualified, and, though there was a jury box from which to draw talesman, the tales-jurors were summoned by the constable at the direction of the court, the panel should have been quashed on motion of the defendant.

       Where there was a total departure by the board of supervisors from the provisions of law in selecting a jury list, the jury list was illegal, and it was error, not cured by this section [Code 1942, § 1798], to make up the juries from such list.

       Although the circuit court deviated from a legal rule in the manner in which it selected alternate jurors, there was no proof that the error was prejudicial to defendant. Consequently, the appellate court found no plain error in the manner in which jury was selected that would require reversal of defendant’s fondling conviction. Giles v. State, — So.3d —, 2019 Miss.

       Jury laws held directory; unless there is radical departure from statutory scheme of selecting juries, court will not reverse because trial court excused certain jurors for cause and filled their places with others.

       Where unfairness in the method of securing jurors is shown, a substantial right of a litigant is invaded, and the supreme court will set aside the verdict of such a jury on timely objection being made, notwithstanding this section [Code 1942, § 1798].

      </p>
      <p>
       If a juror on his voir dire disclose facts which render him disqualified, a defendant who declines to object to him for that cause cannot, after verdict, in view of Code 1892 § 4370, (Code 1942, § 1987), complain of the disqualification. West v. State, 80 Miss. 710, 32 So. 298, 1902 Miss. LEXIS 313 (Miss. 1902).

       The supreme court will not interfere with the discretion of the lower court in impaneling the jury unless it appear that there was a gross and injurious exercise of it. Head v. State, 44 Miss. 731, 1871 Miss. LEXIS 34 (Miss. 1871), overruled,

      When, in the opinion of the court, on the trial of any cause, civil or criminal, it is proper, in order to reach the ends of justice, for the court and jury to have a view or inspection of the property which is the subject of litigation, or the place at which the offense is charged to have been committed, or the place or places at which any material fact occurred, or of any material object or thing in any way connected with the evidence in the case, the court may, at its discretion, enter an order providing for such view or inspection as is herein below directed. After such order is entered, the whole organized court, consisting of the judge, jury, clerk, sheriff, and the necessary number of deputy sheriffs, shall proceed, in a body, to such place or places, property, object or thing to be so viewed or inspected, which shall be pointed out and explained to the court and jury by the witnesses in the case, who may, at the discretion of the court, be questioned by the court and by the representative of each side at the time and place of such view or inspection, in reference to any material fact brought out by such view or inspection. The court on such occasion shall remain in session from the time it leaves the courtroom till it returns thereto, and while so in session outside the courtroom it shall have full power to compel the attendance of witnesses, to preserve order, to prevent disturbance and to punish for contempt such as it has when sitting in the courtroom. In criminal trials all such views or inspections must be had before the whole court and in the presence of the accused, and the production of all evidence from all witnesses or objects, animate or inanimate, must be in his presence.

       Statute providing for view of premises must be interpreted so that view is allowable only when the necessity therefor in order to reach ends of justice bears some fair relation by way of equivalency, in that interest, to the right which otherwise would be unhampered and unimpaired to have verdict reviewed on record evidence. Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co. v. Davis, 177 Miss. 562, 171 So. 550, 1937 Miss. LEXIS 139 (Miss. 1937).

       A motion for a jury view should never have been made in the presence of the jury and the order should have been entered upon the minutes instead of merely being dictated into the record, but since no objections were made to any of the proceedings and apparently agreed thereto, there was no reversible error committed by the trial court. Mississippi State Highway Com. v. Williamson, 227 Miss. 580, 86 So. 2d 670, 1956 Miss. LEXIS 729 (Miss. 1956).

       In a murder prosecution where there was a request to permit the jury to view the scene of the homicide and this request came more than a month after the occurrence of the crime and there was nothing to show that the condition at the scene of the homicide remained the same, the trial court did not err in refusing the request.

       Where a party is about to make request for a view of premises by jury he must first request court to retire jury, and if such request is made in presence of jury judge should then and there overrule it without waiting for an objection from other side, and, if not immediately overruled, and if the other side does not immediately announce whether he will or will not join in the request, the judge should, of his own motion, retire the jury.

      </p>
      <p>
       Motion to view and inspect must set out the grounds therefor with opportunity to adverse party to controvert and disprove them, and the granting, over objection, of such a motion which fails to set out any grounds or reasons therefor other than “in order to reach the ends of justice,” constitutes reversible error, even though prior testimony taken on the merits showed justifiable reasons for such view and inspection.

       Request for view of premises may be made orally, in absence of jury, and transcribed into court reporter’s record, but request must state facts which show that view would be of essential aid, and, if other party objects or challenges facts, court must hear evidence or sworn statements touching those facts which must be reported in transcript.

       The trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to allow the jury to view the scene of the murder at issue, notwithstanding the assertion that a view was necessary for the jury to see the conditions under which a witness made her identification of the defendant; the defendant had the opportunity to cross-examine the witness about her ability to make an identification and stated at the pretrial hearing that he intended to present at least one witness who would give testimony that would contradict the witness’s testimony that she was able to make an identification from the distance and under the lighting conditions that existed at the time of the crime.

   Circuit Court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to allow jury to view scene of accident where scene was established by photographs, diagrams, and testimony at trial, and over 3 years had elapsed since incident had occurred, and therefore there was reasonable probability that there had been material change in physical characteristics of scene. Tolbert v. State, 511 So. 2d 1368, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2681 (Miss. 1987), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">484 U.S. 1016</cite>, <cite class="s_court">108 S. Ct. 723</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">98 L.

       In a suit by property owners to recover damages against operator of an adjacent paint shop on the ground that the vegetables, flowers and shrubbery were ruined and that the odors made them sick and prevented them from enjoying the peaceful occupancy and habitation of their premises, the court did not abuse its discretion in refusing a view by the jury of the premises.

       Permitting jury to view premises damaged by surface water allegedly diverted by city onto plaintiff’s lot, over plaintiff’s objection, was error under this section [Code 1942, § 1800] where defendant made request in presence of jury, conditions had since changed, no order was entered providing for such view, no witnesses were produced at scene to make explanation to jury, and no showing was made that a view would promote ends of justice.

       Request for jury to view premises should not be granted unless it appears reasonably certain that it will be of essential aid, and not merely of some aid, to the jury in reaching a correct verdict, and that it is distinctly impracticable and inefficient to present the material elements to the jury by photographs, diagrams, maps, measurements, and the like. Floyd v. Williams, 198 Miss. 350, 22 So. 2d 365, 1945 Miss. LEXIS 205 (Miss. 1945).

       Trial court did not abuse its discretion in not permitting jury to view the premises where ornamental trees reserved in timber deed had been cut and removed from the land, in action to recover actual damages and statutory penalties therefor, where diagrams, photographs, and testimony were sufficient to enable the jury to understand the respective contentions of the parties, notwithstanding that the photographs could not accurately disclose the number of trees cut and even though the plaintiffs joined with the defendant in the request for a view.

      <p>
       Granting in murder prosecution, over defendant’s objection, of motion to view and inspect scenes of crime, setting out no ground or reason therefor other than “in order to reach the ends of justice,” constituted reversible error, even though prior testimony taken on the merits showed justifiable reasons for such view and inspection, where scenes were about 20 miles from the courthouse and ranged over distance of quarter of mile, and evidence at scenes consisted almost entirely of appearances of nature in July whereas trial took place in September. Leflore v. State, 196 Miss. 632, 18 So. 2d 132, 1944 Miss. LEXIS 244 (Miss. 1944).

       Error, if any, in permitting the jury to view premises, and taking testimony thereat, in a county other than that in which trial was in progress for recovery of damages resulting from a railroad’s digging a ditch along its right of way and causing overflow on the lands of an adjoining owner, was not prejudicial where there was no evidence that the work done by the railroad could have been accomplished by another method, equally safe, convenient and inexpensive without damage to the adjoining landowner. Miller v. Ervin, 192 Miss. 712, 6 So. 2d 910, 1942 Miss. LEXIS 50 (Miss. 1942).

       The granting of a request for a view by the court and jury of the place at which the crime was committed, rests in the discretion of the trial judge. Gordon v. State, 188 Miss. 708, 196 So. 507, 1940 Miss. LEXIS 78 (Miss. 1940).
      </p>
      <p>
       Denial of a view of the scene of the crime, requested by defendant to demonstrate that deceased was not struck by a bullet from defendant’s pistol, was not an abuse of discretion where such a view could not have given the jury any more definite information in the matter than did an engineer’s diagram introduced in evidence. Gordon v. State, 188 Miss. 708, 196 So. 507, 1940 Miss. LEXIS 78 (Miss. 1940).
      </p>
      <p>
       The court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to grant a view of the defendant’s plant in an action to recover damages for injury sustained from the presence of a fly in a bottle of Coca Cola, where the evidence was very full and complete of the precautions taken by defendant to prevent any contamination in the process of bottling the Coca Cola and putting it upon the market.

       In action for death of truck driver killed in automobile collision, permitting jury to view scene of accident was within court’s discretion, notwithstanding changes in situation since time of accident, which were not such as to interfere with jury’s determining at what point drivers of colliding automobiles could see each other.

       It is permissible to question jurors, with respect to their verdict, as to any extraneous prejudicial information which was improperly brought to the jury’s attention or whether any outside influence was improperly brought to bear upon any juror. Schmiz v. Illinois C. G. R. Co., 546 So. 2d 693, 1989 Miss. LEXIS 320 (Miss. 1989).
      </p>

       Defendant in a personal injury action did not waive his right to be tried before 12 jurors when, after the jury was reduced to 11 members, he made only a general objection and did not move for a mistrial. Brame v. Garwood, 339 So. 2d 978, 1976 Miss. LEXIS 1679 (Miss. 1976).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial judge’s conduct in going to jury room during deliberation and speaking to jury on inquiry by jury whether nine members of jury could sign verdict, there being no showing on what was said, is not reversible error when an instruction had been given authorizing nine members of jury to agree upon and bring in verdict, and verdict, when brought in, was signed by all members of jury. Stevenson v. Robinson, 37 So. 2d 568 (Miss. 1948).
      </p>
      <p>
       Instruction that verdict of nine jurors should be verdict of jury held harmless, where it did not appear instruction was acted on. Reith v. Ansley, 162 Miss. 886, 140 So. 521, 1932 Miss. LEXIS 176 (Miss. 1932).

      <p>
       When requested the jury should be polled but if not polled before it becomes impossible to do so the court has power to render judgment on the verdict rendered. Archer v. State, 140 Miss. 597, 105 So. 747, 1925 Miss. LEXIS 295 (Miss. 1925).

       Although a trial judge was unable to instruct a jury regarding a compromise verdict before the jury returned with a verdict, the failure to give the instruction did not warrant reversal because on both occasions the jury was polled, at least nine members of the jury found a subcontractor was entitled to damages in its breach of contract action against a general contractor, and on both occasions, the jury awarded $41,500, and, as such, the jury’s conclusion that the subcontractor was entitled to damages both times indicated no compromise was needed.

       The jurisdiction of a state grand jury impaneled under this chapter extends throughout the state. The subject matter jurisdiction of a state grand jury in all cases is limited to offenses involving any and all conduct made unlawful by the Mississippi Uniform Controlled Substances Law or any other provision of law involving narcotics, dangerous drugs or controlled substances, or any crime arising out of or in connection with a crime involving narcotics, dangerous drugs or controlled substances, and crimes involving any attempt, aiding, abetting, solicitation or conspiracy to commit any of the aforementioned crimes if the crimes occur within more than one (1) circuit court district or have transpired or are transpiring or have significance in more than one (1) circuit court district of this state.

      <li id="t13c07s13-7-7ol12">
       Whenever the Attorney General considers it necessary, and normal investigative or prosecutorial procedures are not adequate, the Attorney General may petition in writing to the senior circuit court judge of any circuit court district in this state for an order impaneling a state grand jury. For the purposes of this chapter, such judge shall be referred to as the impaneling judge. The petition must allege the following:
       <ol type="a">
        <li id="t13c07s13-7-7ol12a">

       If, at any time within the original term of any state grand jury or any extension thereof, the impaneling judge determines that the state grand jury is not conducting investigative activity within its jurisdiction or proper investigative activity, the impaneling judge may limit the investigations so that the investigation conforms with the jurisdiction of the state grand jury and existing law or he may discharge the state grand jury. An order issued pursuant to this subsection or under subsection (5) of this section shall not become effective less than ten (10) days after the date on which it is issued and actual notice given to the Attorney General and the foreman of the state grand jury, and may be appealed by the Attorney General to the Supreme Court.

      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      After the impaneling judge orders a term for the state grand jury on petition of the Attorney General, the impaneling judge shall order that the circuit clerk for each county shall proceed to draw at random from the jury box as provided by Section 13-5-26, the name of one (1) voter of such county for each two thousand (2,000) voters or fraction thereof registered in such county and shall place these names on a list. The circuit clerk shall not disqualify or excuse any individual whose name is drawn. When the list is compiled, the clerk of the circuit court for each county shall forward the list to the clerk of the state grand jury. Upon receipt of all the lists from the clerks of the circuit courts, the clerk of the state grand jury shall place all the names so received upon a list which shall be known as the master list.
     </p>
     <p>
      The impaneling judge shall order the clerk of the state grand jury to produce the master list and shall direct the random drawing of the names of one hundred (100) persons from the master list. The names drawn shall be given to the clerk of the state grand jury who shall cause each person drawn for service to be served with a summons either personally by the sheriff of the county where the juror resides or by mail, addressed to the juror at his usual residence, business or post office address, requiring him to report for state grand jury service at a specified time and place as designated by the impaneling judge. From the one hundred (100) persons summoned, a state grand jury shall be drawn for that term consisting of twenty (20) persons. State grand jurors must be drawn in the same manner as jurors are drawn for service on the county grand jury.
     </p>
     <p>
      All qualified persons shall be liable to serve as state grand jurors, unless excused by the court for one (1) of the following causes:
     </p>
     <p>
      When the juror is ill, or when on account of serious illness in the juror’s family, the presence of the juror is required at home;
     </p>
     <p>
      When the juror’s attendance would cause a serious financial loss to the juror or to the juror’s business; or
     </p>
     <p>
      When the juror is under an emergency, fairly equivalent to those mentioned in the foregoing paragraphs (a) and (b).
     </p>
     <p>
      An excuse of illness under paragraph (a) may be made to the state grand jury clerk outside of open court by providing the clerk with either a certificate of a licensed physician or an affidavit of the juror, stating that the juror is ill or that there is a serious illness in the juror’s family. The test of an excuse under paragraph (b) shall be whether, if the juror were incapacitated by illness or otherwise for a week, some other persons would be available or could reasonably be procured to carry on the business for the week, and the test of an excuse under paragraph (c) shall be such as to be the fair equivalent, under the circumstances of that prescribed under paragraph (b). In cases under paragraphs (b) and (c) the excuse must be made by the juror, in open court, under oath.
     </p>
     <p>
      It shall be unlawful for any employer or other person to persuade or attempt to persuade any juror to avoid jury service, or to intimidate or to threaten any juror in that respect. So to do shall be deemed an interference with the administration of justice and a contempt of court and punishable as such.
     </p>
     <p>
      Every citizen over sixty-five (65) years of age shall be exempt from service if he claims the privilege. No qualified juror shall be excluded because of such reason, but the same shall be a personal privilege to be claimed by any person selected for state grand jury duty. Any citizen over sixty-five (65) years of age may claim this personal privilege outside of open court by providing the clerk of court with information that allows the clerk to determine the validity of the claim.
     </p>
     <p>
      The state grand jurors shall be charged by the impaneling judge as to their authority and responsibility under the law and each juror shall be sworn pursuant to Section 13-5-45. Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting the right of the Attorney General or his designee to request that a potential state grand juror be excused for cause. The jury selection process shall be conducted by the impaneling judge. Jurors of a state grand jury shall receive reimbursement for travel and mileage as provided for state employees by Section 25-3-41 and shall be paid per diem compensation in the amount provided by Section 25-3-69. All compensation and expenses for meals and lodging of state grand jurors shall be paid out of any available funds appropriated for that purpose.

    Subpoenas and subpoenas duces tecum; contempt [Repealed effective July 1, 2024].

     </h3>
     <p>
      The clerk of the state grand jury, upon request of the Attorney General or his designee, shall issue subpoenas, or subpoenas duces tecum to compel individuals, documents or other materials to be brought from anywhere in the state or another state to a state grand jury. In addition, a state grand jury may proceed in the same manner as is provided for by law in relation to the issuance of subpoenas and subpoenas duces tecum; however, the provisions of such law shall not be considered a limitation upon this section, but shall be supplemental thereto. The subpoenas and subpoenas duces tecum may be for investigative purposes and for the retention of documents or other materials so subpoenaed for proper criminal proceedings. Any investigator employed by the Attorney General or any law enforcement officer with appropriate jurisdiction is empowered to serve such subpoenas and subpoenas duces tecum and receive such documents and other materials for return to a state grand jury. Any person violating a subpoena or subpoena duces tecum issued pursuant to this chapter, or who fails to fully answer all questions put to him before proceedings of the state grand jury whenever the response thereto is not privileged or otherwise protected by law, including the granting of immunity as authorized by this chapter, or any other law, may be punished by the impaneling judge for contempt provided the response is not privileged or otherwise protected by law. The Attorney General or his designee may petition the impaneling judge to compel compliance by the person alleged to have committed the violation or who has failed to answer. If the impaneling judge considers compliance is warranted, he may order compliance and may punish the individual for contempt, as provided in Section 9-1-17, where the compliance does not occur. The clerk of the state grand jury may also issue subpoenas and subpoenas duces tecum to compel individuals, documents or other materials to be brought from anywhere in the state to the trial of any indictment returned by a state grand jury or the trial of any civil forfeiture action arising out of an investigation conducted by a state grand jury.

Upon indictment by a state grand jury, the indictment shall be returned to the impaneling judge. If the impaneling judge considers the indictment to be within the authority of the state grand jury and otherwise in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, he shall order the clerk of the state grand jury to certify the indictment and return the indictment to the county designated by the impaneling judge as the county in which the indictment shall be tried.

     <p>
      If any person asks to be excused from testifying before a state grand jury or from producing any books, papers, records, correspondence or other documents before a state grand jury on the ground that the testimony or evidence required of him may tend to incriminate him or subject him to any penalty or forfeiture and such person, notwithstanding such ground, is directed by the impaneling judge to give the testimony or produce the evidence, he shall comply with this direction, but no testimony so given or evidence produced may be received against him in any criminal action, investigation or criminal proceeding. No individual testifying or producing evidence or documents is exempt from prosecution or punishment for any perjury committed by him while so testifying, and the testimony or evidence given or produced is admissible against him upon any criminal action, criminal investigation or criminal proceeding concerning this perjury; however, any individual may execute, acknowledge and file a statement with the appropriate court expressly waiving immunity or privilege in respect to any testimony given or produced and thereupon the testimony or evidence given or produced may be received or produced before any judge or justice, court tribunal, grand jury or otherwise, and if so received or produced, the individual is not entitled to any immunity or privilege on account of any testimony he may give or evidence produced.
