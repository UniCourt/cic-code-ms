       Laws of 2005, 5th Ex Sess, ch. 8, § 1, effective October 6, 2005, provides as follows:
      </p>
      <p>
       “SECTION 1. (1) As a result of the catastrophic impact of Hurricane Katrina, the statute of limitations applicable to any action not filed in any state or federal court or administrative forum as of August 29, 2005, for which venue was proper in a county located in the Second (Southern) Supreme Court District as defined by
   Section 9-3-1, Mississippi Code of 1972, is extended as follows:
      </p>
      <p>
       “(a) If the statute of limitations expired on or after Monday, August 29, 2005, but before the effective date of this act, then the time for filing a claim shall be extended to Friday, December 30, 2005.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(b) If the statute of limitations expires on or after the effective date of this act, but before Tuesday, November 29, 2005, then the time for filing a claim shall be extended to Friday, December 30, 2005.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(2) For any action not filed in any state or federal court or administrative forum as of August 29, 2005, in which venue was proper only in a county located in either the First (Central) or Third (Northern) Supreme Court Districts as defined by
   Section 9-3-1, Mississippi Code of 1972, the plaintiff may file a motion asserting that, but for the catastrophic effects of Hurricane Katrina, the action would have been timely filed. If the court or administrative hearing officer grants the motion, the statute of limitations applicable to that action is extended as follows:
      </p>
      <p>
       “(a) If the statute of limitations expired on or after Monday, August 29, 2005, but before the effective date of this act, then the time for filing a claim shall be extended to Friday, December 30, 2005.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(b) If the statute of limitations expires on or after the effective date of this act, but before Tuesday, November 29, 2005, then the time for filing a claim shall be extended to Friday, December 30, 2005.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(3) For purposes of the motion referred to in subsection (2), the plaintiff shall have the burden of proof.”

       Prenuptial agreements were enforced by the State but the agreement had to be in writing; however, although the oral agreement between the husband and wife could not be enforced as a valid prenuptial agreement, it was not entirely meaningless as, whether intentionally or unintentionally fraudulent, it had to be considered by the chancellor when determining the equities of the case.

   Loans that were the subject of the individuals’ complaint were all made in or before 1994, and yet the individuals filed suit on February 2, 2002, well over three years after the date of the last loan to any of the individuals, in violation of Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-3" target="_self">15-1-3</a></cite>.

   The 2-year statute of limitations set forth in §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-36" target="_self">15-1-36</a></cite>, rather than the general 6-year limitation period of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-49" target="_self">15-1-49</a></cite>, applied to a medical malpractice action against a nurse and a company that supplied nursing personnel, where the company’s sole basis for liability was the fact that it was the nurse’s employer; since §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-36" target="_self">15-1-36</a></cite> specifically names nurses among those covered and the company’s liability was predicated solely upon the doctrine of respondeat superior, the bar of the suit against the nurse likewise barred the action as to the company. Under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-3" target="_self">15-1-3</a></cite>, §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-3" target="_self">15-1-3</a></cite>6 barred both the right of action against the nurse and the company and also barred any remedy against both parties.

       Trial court did not err in ruling that a purchaser’s garnishment action against a seller was time-barred because it was filed months after the statute had run, and the purchaser failed to take advantage of the many procedural mechanisms available to him to extend the life of his judgment; thus, the judgment had been extinguished, and the purchaser could not bring a valid garnishment action.

   In an action by a debtor against a bank to cancel the principal and interest in a promissory note and a deed of trust securing the note, the trial court properly considered a defunct judgment which had been obtained by the bank against the debtor and her husband in determining the debtor’s liability to the bank where the defunct judgment was a sufficient basis to form the consideration for a component part of a new obligation entered into by the debtor; however, the trial court erred in computing the amount of consideration to include interest on the principal of the judgment debt beyond the seven years after the rendition of the judgment as provided in §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-43" target="_self">15-1-43</a></cite>. Under the provisions of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.75.html#t75c17s75-17-7" target="_blank">75-17-7</a></cite> interest should have been charged at the rate of eight percent per year for seven years to determine the amount of the former legal obligation where the note leading to the earlier judgment had provided for interest of eight percent per year.

       Three-year statute barring open accounts destroys right as well as remedy; debt of child to father, barred by statute before his death, cannot be set off against child’s share in estate; where only remedy is barred by statute of limitations, and debt is unaffected, debt of child to father, although barred by limitations, may be set off against child’s share in father’s estate.

       The execution of a renewal note after the statute of limitations has run does not operate to revive a deed of trust securing it. Temples v. First Nat'l Bank, 239 Miss. 446, 123 So. 2d 852, 1960 Miss. LEXIS 305 (Miss. 1960).

       In deciding whether the landowner is estopped to plead or obtain the benefit of the statute of limitations as a defense to an action to foreclose a deed of trust the question is resolved by the conduct of the landowner rather than the conduct of the grantee of deed of trust.

       Where grantee of a trust deed which was given as security for a debt, purchased at a foreclosure sale but never was in possession of the land, the grantee could not invoke the rule that a mortgagee in possession under void foreclosure sale may retain possession until the mortgage is paid despite the fact that the statute of limitations has run against the debt.

       Where in 1931 a deed of trust on certain land was issued to a bank as security for a loan, and later that land was sold at a tax sale and not redeemed, in 1939 the bank’s remedy at law to recover the debt was barred by statute of limitations and direct remedy in equity was likewise barred. State v. Magnolia Bank, 212 Miss. 47, 53 So. 2d 79, 1951 Miss. LEXIS 426 (Miss. 1951).

       An insurer which issued a medical malpractice policy to certain doctors on a “claims made basis” was not liable to an injured patient who had not, as required by the policy, made a timely claim against the doctor where such policy limitations were valid conditions precedent to the insurer’s liability and were not impermissible attempts to shorten the applicable six-year statute of limitations.

   Where on former appeals, terminating in a decision by the Federal Supreme Court, the point raised by demurrer to insurer’s plea involved the question whether a provision in a fidelity bond requiring any claim thereunder to be made within 15 months after the termination of the suretyship was subject to the law of Tennessee where the contract was made at a time when the insured was then located in Tennessee, or subject to the laws of Mississippi, to which insured had removed and where the defalcation occurred, and resulted in a determination that the laws of Tennessee governed, such determination did not preclude subsequent litigation as to the effect of such provision under Tennessee decisions as being a condition precedent to liability of the insurer or merely a postponement of the right to sue.

       Mississippi Supreme Court would not enforce a contractually created time limitation on suits, as modifications to the statute of limitations could not be accomplished by contract, and any attempt to do so would be void; accordingly, the admissions contract between the decedent and nursing home which attempted to modify the statute of limitations was properly struck as unconscionable.

   Provision of contract for extermination of pests which limited homeowner’s remedy for breach of express warranty to reinspection and refumigation in event of reinfestation, was enforceable under Mississippi law. Facts did not fall within protections afforded by §§<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.11.html#t11c07s11-7-18" target="_blank">11-7-18</a></cite> or<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.75.html#t75c02s75-2-315.1" target="_blank">75-2-315.1</a></cite>, and litigation not involve claim for breach of implied warranties. Moreover, even if defendant had attempted to limit implied warranties, plaintiff did not seek remedies based thereon. In addition, contract was one primarily for service, whereas prohibition on limitation of express warranties applies only to manufacturer of consumer goods, thus there was nothing in Mississippi statutes forbidding limitation of remedies for breach of express warranty provided in service contract.

    Limitations applicable to actions to recover land.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      A person may not make an entry or commence an action to recover land except within ten years next after the time at which the right to make the entry or to bring the action shall have first accrued to some person through whom he claims, or, if the right shall not have accrued to any person through whom he claims, then except within ten years next after the time at which the right to make the entry or bring the action shall have first accrued to the person making or bringing the same. However, if, at the time at which the right of any person to make an entry or to bring an action to recover land shall have first accrued, such person shall have been under the disability of infancy or unsoundness of mind, then such person or the person claiming through him may, notwithstanding that the period of ten years hereinbefore limited shall have expired, make an entry or bring an action to recover the land at any time within ten years next after the time at which the person to whom the right shall have first accrued shall have ceased to be under either disability, or shall have died, whichever shall have first happened. However, when any person who shall be under either of the disabilities mentioned, at the time at which his right shall have first accrued, shall depart this life without having ceased to be under such disability, no time shall be allowed, by reason of the disability of any other person, to make an entry or to bring an action to recover the land beyond the period of ten years next after the time at which such person shall have died.

   Since accrued royalties were personal property and not an interest in land, Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-7" target="_self">15-1-7</a></cite> was inapplicable; there being no specific statute of limitations for actions seeking recovery of accrued royalties, the general, three-year statute of Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-49ol11" target="_self">15-1-49(1)</a></cite> required the trustee to bring the action against the oil companies within three years next after the cause of such action accrued.

   Statute of limitations argument was waived on appeal because it was not raised in the answer; the bank customers’ possession of the property was never adverse to that of the bank’s lien interest at any time prior to the 1997 renewal, and the bank did not seek reformation of the 1988 deed of trust, but rather the 1997 deed of trust, such that there would be no statute of limitations issue even if the defense had been raised. Whitefoot v. BancorpSouth Bank, 856 So. 2d 639, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 591 (Miss. Ct. App. 2003), cert. denied, 866 So. 2d 473, 2004 Miss.

       Ten-year statute of limitation for actions to recover land did not start to run when the beneficiary took possession of the elderly widow’s property in 1982 as part of his long-term plan and scheme to obtain her property through fraud and undue influence, but instead began to run when the elderly widow’s heirs had notice of the existence of an attempted deed, which did not occur until 1997 when the widow died, especially since the widow was not in possession in the interim.

       The 10-year limitation provided for in the statute did not apply to an action by a judgment creditor in which it alleged that the judgment debtor fraudulently conveyed real property to his son as the judgment creditor had no possessory interest in the subject property.

       In an action to quiet title based on a 1934 deed, the statute of limitations was properly invoked in defense to a cross-bill seeking to cancel the claim for failure of consideration because the conveyance was at most voidable and actions to set aside voidable conveyances are subject to limitation. Covington v. Butler, 242 So. 2d 444, 1970 Miss. LEXIS 1381 (Miss. 1970).
      </p>
      <p>
       A conveyance of land executed to a corporation in violation of the Mississippi Blue Sky Law (Laws 1916, Ch 97) was utterly void and imparted no notice to subsequent purchasers, nor did it set in motion the running of the 10-year statute of limitations. Mississippi State Highway Com. v. Smith, 197 So. 2d 212, 1967 Miss. LEXIS 1503 (Miss. 1967).

       The statute requiring commencement of action to recover land ten years after right to do so accrues, did not apply to a suit to cancel as cloud on title claim asserted by husband who pleaded guilty to manslaughter in the death of his wife. Henry v. Toney, 217 Miss. 716, 64 So. 2d 904, 1953 Miss. LEXIS 484 (Miss. 1953).

      <p>
       Purpose and intent of Code 1942, §§ 710 and 711, and this section [Code 1942, § 709], is to guarantee good title to one purchasing land in good faith from another, where such other went into possession under recorded deed, valid on its face, and continued in uninterrupted possession for period of 31 years or more. Boyd v. Entrekin, 209 Miss. 51, 45 So. 2d 848, 1950 Miss. LEXIS 360 (Miss. 1950).

       Save as to easements, licenses or mere equities, abandonment is not effective to divest title to real estate, and fee simple titles are lost only by estoppel or by adverse possession or by maintainable tax sale. Walker v. Polk, 208 Miss. 389, 44 So. 2d 477, 1950 Miss. LEXIS 256 (Miss. 1950).
      </p>
      <p>
       The principle upon which the statute rests is not that the party in whose favor it is evoked has set up an adverse claim for the period prescribed, but that the adverse claim is accompanied by such an invasion of the rights of the opposite party as to give him a cause of action.

   Summary judgment was properly granted to a trustee in a prior owner’s action to set aside a warranty deed transfer and a trust six years later because the three-year statute of limitations in Miss.

       Bank’s claim for equitable subrogation was barred by the statute of limitations based on the date of payment of the balance of a line of credit, since the bank’s lien did not create a possessory interest in the liened property to support an action to recover land subject to a longer limitations period.

       In an action by a widow to recover 50 percent of various mineral rights purchased by her deceased husband in a joint venture with defendant’s deceased husband in which the theory of recovery was an implied trust or right to a partnership accounting, the chancery court erroneously granted judgment for plaintiff, where the cause of action was barred by the applicable ten year statutes of limitation at least as early as 1962, which was 10 years after the death of defendant’s husband.

       Adverse possession was established by evidence that possessors cleared land and planted grass, grazed cattle on land, repaired damage caused by hurricane, built and repaired fish pond, paid taxes in all but 2 years, frequently visited property, and made other improvements; titleholder’s nonpayment of taxes coupled with awareness that grass was planted and cattle were grazed on pastures gave rise to notice of adverse claim.

       This section [Code 1942, § 709] and Code 1942, § 710 are limitation statutes which may be used defensively only, as distinguished from Code 1942, § 711, which provides that 10 years’ adverse possession vests full title, and which accordingly may be used affirmatively and defensively. Neal v. Teat, 240 Miss. 35, 126 So. 2d 124, 1961 Miss. LEXIS 423 (Miss. 1961).

       This provision [Code 1942, § 709] does not apply except where the person invoking it has been in adverse possession of land against the true owner. Continental Oil Co. v. Walker, 238 Miss. 21, 117 So. 2d 333, 1960 Miss. LEXIS 371 (Miss. 1960).

       Where minerals had been severed from the surface, and defendants, claiming under color of title of a void tax deed, although exercising acts of ownership of which the surface was susceptible, had never taken actual possession of any of the minerals, they did not acquire rights to the minerals by adverse possession, so that plaintiffs, who held mineral rights to the land through inheritance from the grantor of the surface rights, did not lose their rights to the minerals by limitations or laches. White v. Merchants & Planters Bank, 229 Miss. 35, 90 So. 2d 11, 1956 Miss. LEXIS 583 (Miss. 1956).

       The statutes of limitation do not begin to run against one in actual or constructive possession of lands until an adverse entry has been made. Leech v. Masonite Corp., 219 Miss. 176, 68 So. 2d 297, 1953 Miss. LEXIS 379 (Miss. 1953).
      </p>
      <p>
       To acquire land by adverse possession, for possession must not only continue for the statutory period but it must be exclusive and hostile. Grantham v. Masonite Corp., 218 Miss. 745, 67 So. 2d 727, 1953 Miss. LEXIS 599 (Miss. 1953).
      </p>
      <p>
       To acquire land by adverse possession, the adverse possessor must have had the intention to appropriate and use the land as his own to the exclusion of all others, irrespective of any semblance or shadow of actual title or right. Grantham v. Masonite Corp., 218 Miss. 745, 67 So. 2d 727, 1953 Miss. LEXIS 599 (Miss. 1953).
      </p>
      <p>
       When it is clear that there is no intention to claim against the true owner, the possession will not be adverse, and however long continued will not bar his right of entry. Grantham v. Masonite Corp., 218 Miss. 745, 67 So. 2d 727, 1953 Miss. LEXIS 599 (Miss. 1953).

      <p>
       In application of this section [Code 1942, § 709], mere lapse of time does not suffice, but possession relied upon by claimant of land must exist to support plea of limitation the same as if he were claiming land under and by virtue of possession held under Code 1942, § 711. Walker v. Polk, 208 Miss. 389, 44 So. 2d 477, 1950 Miss. LEXIS 256 (Miss. 1950).

      <p>
       Complainant entering under invalid tax deed failed to meet burden of proof to establish ten years adverse possession where evidence disclosed that no use was made of the land after tax sale except cultivation of small patches, that land was unimproved, and that there was no actual occupancy of the land by anyone. Walker v. Polk, 208 Miss. 389, 44 So. 2d 477, 1950 Miss. LEXIS 256 (Miss. 1950).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the description of land sold at a tax sale did not cover all of the land on which the taxes had been levied, a purchaser from the state, who occupied the entire tract had no valid claim, as against the original owners, to that portion of the land not included in such description, and title thereto would not be lost to the original owner through any doctrine of laches short of the ten-year statute of limitations. Johnson v. Carter, 193 Miss. 781, 11 So. 2d 196, 1943 Miss. LEXIS 8 (Miss. 1943).

       Title need not be recorded to bind bona fide purchasers from the original owner; purchaser from record owner must ascertain existence of adverse possession hostile thereto. Lowi v. David, 134 Miss. 296, 98 So. 684, 1924 Miss. LEXIS 255 (Miss. 1924).
      </p>

       Defense of adverse possession held sufficient, although occupation was under erroneous survey. Evans v. Harrison, 130 Miss. 157, 93 So. 737, 1922 Miss. LEXIS 194 (Miss. 1922); Schuler v. McGee, 127 Miss. 873, 90 So. 713, 1921 Miss. LEXIS 291 (Miss. 1921); Greer v. Pickett, 127 Miss. 739, 90 So. 449, 1921 Miss. LEXIS 277 (Miss. 1921).

       Actual, open, and notorious possession may be shown by the acts of the occupant to have been adverse. Davis v. Bowmar, 55 Miss. 671, 1878 Miss. LEXIS 29 (Miss. 1878).
      </p>
      <p>
       The adverse possession, to be available, must have been continuous. Nixon v. Porter, 38 Miss. 401, 1860 Miss. LEXIS 13 (Miss. 1860); Tegarden v. Carpenter, 36 Miss. 404, 1858 Miss. LEXIS 111 (Miss. 1858).

       What constitutes adverse possession is a question of law, but the intention of the possessor, which is always material in determining, is a fact to be ascertained by the jury. Magee v. Magee, 37 Miss. 138, 1859 Miss. LEXIS 10 (Miss. 1859).
      </p>
      <p>
       Visible and notorious occupation, with intent to claim against the world, constitutes adverse possession. So will any visible acts of ownership exercised over land, which, from their nature, indicate notorious claim of property in it, if continued for a long time, with the knowledge of the owner, and without interruption or adverse entry by him. Neither actual occupation, residence, nor cultivation is necessary to constitute adverse possession, where the property is so situated as not to admit of any permanent useful improvement. Ford v. Wilson, 35 Miss. 490, 1858 Miss. LEXIS 50 (Miss. 1858).

   Denial of the mother’s claim of right to the marital home was appropriate because the father’s parents had the legal right to dispossess the father of his enjoyment of the home, and that right would continue for the statutory period of ten years under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-7" target="_self">15-1-7</a></cite>; thus, the father’s continued presence at the marital home was not one of right, but a continuing gift to the father by his parents.

       A mineral deed to homestead which was not signed by the wife of the owner, being void, did not carry with it constructive possession, and therefore the ten-year statute of limitations was inapplicable to an action brought some 31 years after the conveyance to cancel the deed.

       Statute (Laws 1934, ch 250) providing that all mortgagors of real estate located within the state who might have the right to set aside any title to such real estate by reason of the neglect of any trustee to insert in a notice of sale of such real estate, the name of said mortgagor, should commence suit 12 months from the passage of such act, and upon the failure of such mortgagor or other person to commence suit within such time, the right to bring such suit, and the remedy to enforce such right of action should be deemed thereafter to be completely extinguished, if applied so as to restrict the application of the general ten year statute, made applicable by statute (Code 1942, § 888) regulating the sale of lands under mortgages and deeds of trust, was not invalid as being an impairment of contract or as class or private legislation, since the right to sue is distinct from the right sought to be enforced and is remedial in character.

   In an action to cancel as a cloud on title a sale of property to the state in 1948 for 1947 taxes on minerals, the chancellor properly overruled the state’s demurrer where the demurrer admitted the complainant’s allegation that the 1948 tax sale had been invalid for failure to comply with the predecessor statute of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.27.html#t27c41s27-41-59" target="_blank">27-41-59</a></cite> requiring that the tax collector first offer the property in 40-acre tracts. In addition, where the demurrer admitted the allegation that the state had not been in possession of the property since the tax sale, the chancellor properly overruled the special demurrer that the action was barred by the limitations in §§<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-7" target="_self">15-1-7</a></cite>,<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-9" target="_self">15-1-9</a></cite>, and<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-17" target="_self">15-1-17</a></cite> since possession is required to start any of the three statutes into operation.

       § 15-1-9.
    Limitations applicable to suits in equity to recover land.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      A person claiming land in equity may not bring suit to recover the same except within the period during which, by virtue of Section 15-1-7, he might have made an entry or brought an action to recover the same, if he had been entitled at law to such an estate, interest, or right in or to the same as he shall claim therein in equity. However, in every case of a concealed fraud, the right of any person to bring suit in equity for the recovery of land, of which he or any person through whom he claims may have been deprived by such fraud, shall be deemed to have first accrued at and not before the time at which the fraud shall, or, with reasonable diligence might, have been first known or discovered.

       In an action to quiet title based on a 1934 deed to a one-fourth mineral interest, the statute of limitations was properly invoked in defense to a cross bill seeking to cancel the claim for failure of consideration, for the deed was at most voidable and action to set aside such a deed must be brought within 10 years. Covington v. Butler, 242 So. 2d 444, 1970 Miss. LEXIS 1381 (Miss. 1970).
      </p>
      <p>

       The statutes of limitation do not begin to run against one in actual or constructive possession of lands until an adverse entry has been made. Leech v. Masonite Corp., 219 Miss. 176, 68 So. 2d 297, 1953 Miss. LEXIS 379 (Miss. 1953).
      </p>
      <p>
       Purpose and intent of Code 1942, §§ 709 and 711, and this section [Code 1942, § 710], is to guarantee good title to one purchasing land in good faith from another, where such other went into possession under recorded deed, valid on its face, and continued in uninterrupted possession for period of 31 years or more. Boyd v. Entrekin, 209 Miss. 51, 45 So. 2d 848, 1950 Miss. LEXIS 360 (Miss. 1950).
      </p>
      <p>
       The statute [Code 1930, § 2286] applies to a suit in equity to recover land in possession of the defendant, and not to a suit in equity by a complainant in the possession and enjoyment of the land for the purpose of perfecting his title thereto. Newman v. J. J. White Lumber Co., 162 Miss. 581, 139 So. 838, 1932 Miss. LEXIS 148 (Miss. 1932).

      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence showing that complainants entered into possession of parcel of land in 1942, under color of title by virtue of deed executed to them by a bank, and that complainants remained in possession of the land, claiming it as their own, and exercised acts of ownership on the land by cutting timber and pasturing cattle on the land, keeping the fences in state of repair, and paying taxes on the land for a period of 19 years, established complainants’ title by adverse possession.

       The grantees in a deed and their successors in title who had been in actual adverse possession of the entire interest in tract of land for more than ten years acquired title by adverse possession. Farmer v. Runnels, 244 Miss. 525, 142 So. 2d 198, 1962 Miss. LEXIS 472 (Miss. 1962).
      </p>
      <p>
       Code 1942, § 709 and this section [Code 1942, § 710] are limitation statutes which may be used defensively only, as distinguished from Code 1942, § 711, which provides that 10 years’ adverse possession vests full title, and which accordingly may be used affirmatively and defensively.

       Widow’s act in recording deed, valid on its face, to her from purchaser of her deceased husband’s land at foreclosure sale, gave notice to world that she claimed to be owner of land and that act was act of ouster as against anyone else claiming the land, including her six children, whose ages ranged from 1 to 12 years, and warranty deed by her after she had been in uninterrupted possession under this recorded deed for more than 34 years conveyed good title. Boyd v. Entrekin, 209 Miss. 51, 45 So. 2d 848, 1950 Miss. LEXIS 360 (Miss. 1950).
      </p>

       Grantee of life tenant could not maintain suit to quiet title to the land involved based on deed from life tenant and adverse possession, since his holding over after death of the life tenant made him a tenant at sufferance of the remaindermen, and was consistent with their title as such; and he could not, as against them, invoke the ten-year statute of limitations so as to defeat their right to possession of, and title to, the land. Thomasson v. Kinard, 153 Miss. 398, 121 So. 109, 1929 Miss. LEXIS 31 (Miss. 1929).

       Where a bill to avoid a foreclosure sale was brought more than ten years after the sale, and after the purchaser had taken notorious and adverse possession, and there was no allegation that complainants were ignorant of any of the proceedings leading up to the sale or of the claim of the purchaser, nor that the alleged fraud in the sale had been concealed or was unknown to them, the cause of action was barred by limitation.

       Chancellor properly denied a motion to dismiss filed by a mother and her daughter because the brother’s action to set aside the sister’s deed, remove the cloud on his title, and to quiet title to the disputed property was governed by the 10-year statutes of limitations where the daughter knew about the brother’s deed, the brother was a remainderman who did not yet have the present right to possess the property, and the brother had a present cause of action.

       A mineral deed to homestead which was not signed by the wife of the owner, being void, did not carry with it constructive possession, and therefore the ten years statute of limitations was inapplicable to an action by the husband and wife to cancel the deed brought some 21 years after the conveyance.

       Children, whose ages ranged from 1 to 12 years at time of death of their father, who lived on land during lifetime of father and knew that after his death mother claimed it, who knew mother sold land, and who neither inquired nor discovered their interest in land until youngest child was 47 years of age, exercised such complete indifference to, and disregard of, their rights that they should not, in equity and good conscience, be permitted to prevail over purchaser in good faith, for sufficient consideration.

       Where land was sold under a decree in partition, the possession of the interests of two of the owners, who were not parties to the proceeding, remained in them by constructive operation of law as long as possession was not taken by someone in hostility to their interests, unless divested by or as a result of the partition proceedings, and limitation would not affect them even if they let the land lie unoccupied and idle for fifty years or more.

       The statute [Code 1930, § 2286] does not apply to a suit brought by a person in possession of land, and, therefore, person in possession need not bring suit to perfect his title thereto until his title is menaced by the adverse claim of another.

       A mineral deed to homestead which was not signed by the wife of the owner, being void, did not carry with it constructive possession, and therefore the ten-year statute of limitations was inapplicable to an action brought some 31 years after the conveyance to cancel the deed. Furthermore, since their possession of the homestead had not been disturbed or invaded, the husband and wife were not required to take any steps to cancel the deed prior to the institution of the present suit.

   In an action to cancel as a cloud on title a sale of property to the state in 1948 for 1947 taxes on minerals, the chancellor properly overruled the state’s demurrer where the demurrer admitted the complainant’s allegation that the 1948 tax sale had been invalid for failure to comply with the predecessor statute of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.27.html#t27c41s27-41-59" target="_blank">27-41-59</a></cite> requiring that the tax collector first offer the property in 40-acre tracts. In addition, where the demurrer admitted the allegation that the state had not been in possession of the property since the tax sale, the chancellor properly overruled the special demurrer that the action was barred by the limitations in §§<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-7" target="_self">15-1-7</a></cite>,<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-9" target="_self">15-1-9</a></cite>, and<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-17" target="_self">15-1-17</a></cite> since possession is required to start any of the three statutes into operation.

       In an action by a widow to recover 50 percent of various mineral rights purchased by her deceased husband in a joint venture with defendant’s deceased husband in which the theory of recovery was an implied trust or right to a partnership accounting, the chancery court erroneously granted judgment for plaintiff, where the cause of action was barred by the applicable ten year statutes of limitation at least as early as 1962, which was 10 years after the death of defendant’s husband.

       Where a mineral interest is included in a deed by mutual mistake and the grantee does not claim such interest or intend to own or possess it, the grantee does not have constructive possession, and the statute of limitations in a suit for reformation will not begin to run against the grantor until he has notice of some adverse claim thereto or his possession is disturbed in some manner.

       Statute of limitation did not prohibit the chancery court from ruling on relatives’ action to recover land on the ground that it was fraudulently or mistakenly conveyed to a decedent because their cause of action did not accrue until they became aware of the adverse claim to the land, and the decedent took no action to possess and control any tract of land west of a creek; therefore, the cause of action did not accrue until the decedent’s estate sought to enforce the warranty deed.

      <p>
       Chancery court properly dismissed as untimely a brother’s action against his sister to set aside certain deeds and instruments because, while the chancery court erred in inferring that the three-year general statute of limitations was applicable, the error was harmless and the 10-year statute of limitations for claims regarding land recovery in equity applied where the most recently dated deed associated with the transfer was filed and became a public record almost 15 years before brother’s complaint was filed, and even assuming there was concealed fraud in the property’s conveyance, the probate of the life tenant’s estate in 2002 provided a glaring opportunity for the sister’s alleged fraud to come to the brother’s attention. Conley v. Wright, 193 So.3d 663, 2016 Miss. App. LEXIS 340 (Miss. Ct. App. 2016).

      <p>
       Concealed fraud precluded the running of limitations for claiming land in equity where the grantee held the deed from his father without recording it, all the while representing to his family that the land was owned by all of his father’s heirs, and the fraud could not have been discovered with reasonable diligence before the son recorded the deed and contracted for the sale and harvest of timber on the land.

       Testator, an Italian immigrant, after providing a life estate for his widow, devised vested remainder interest in bulk of his property to a sister and his nieces and nephews in equal shares. Where, upon death of widow, her administrator stated in sworn petition filed in court that testator’s sister was dead, that there were no nieces or nephews of testator in Italy, and that administrator’s mother was testator’s sole heir, when in fact he and the widow knew other relatives existed in Italy entitled to share as tenants in common in testator’s estate; such false representations constituted concealed fraud upon court and relatives, and relatives were not barred by adverse possession but were entitled to recover in equity their interests in testator’s property, and for an accounting of rents and profits.

       This clause was held inapplicable to a situation where pursuant to an agreement to exchange lands one of the parties to the agreement went into possession although the other party failed to execute the agreement, in view of the fact that under the statute establishing title by adverse possession of ten years’ knowledge of an open, notorious and adverse possession may be presumed.

   To prevent the running of the statute on the ground of concealed fraud, complainant must allege and prove, first, the fraud and the act or acts constituting it; second, that such acts of fraud were committed by the defendant or someone in privity with him; third, that they were concealed from complainant by defendant or someone in privity with him; fourth, that complainant did not discover or know of the fraud over ten years before instituting suit; and fifth, that reasonable diligence was exercised to discover it sooner, or that complainant could not, by the exercise of reasonable diligence, have discovered it sooner.

     <p>
      Any person who has a right of action for the recovery of land because of any one or more of the following enumerated defects in any instrument, shall institute his suit therefor not later than 10 years next after the date when such instrument has been actually recorded in the office of the clerk of the chancery court of the county in which such real estate is situated and not afterwards:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t15c01s15-1-11ol11">
       where it has not been signed by the proper officer of any corporation;
      </li>
      <li id="t15c01s15-1-11ol12">
       where the corporate seal of the corporation has not been impressed on such instrument;
      </li>
      <li id="t15c01s15-1-11ol13">
       where the record does not show such corporate seal;
      </li>
      <li id="t15c01s15-1-11ol14">
       because the record does not show authority therefor by the board of directors and stockholders (or either of them) of a corporation;
      </li>
      <li id="t15c01s15-1-11ol15">
       where such instrument was executed and delivered by a corporation which had been dissolved or whose charter had expired, or whose corporate franchise had been cancelled, withdrawn or forfeited;
      </li>
      <li id="t15c01s15-1-11ol16">
       where the executor, administrator, guardian, assignee, receiver, master in chancery, agent or trustee, or other agency making such instrument, signed or acknowledged the same individually instead of in his representative or official capacity;
      </li>
      <li id="t15c01s15-1-11ol17">
       where such instrument is executed by a trustee without record of judicial or other ascertainment of the authority of such trustee or of the verity of the facts therein recited;
      </li>
      <li id="t15c01s15-1-11ol18">
       where the officer taking the acknowledgment of such instrument having an official seal did not affix the same to the certificate of acknowledgment;
      </li>
      <li id="t15c01s15-1-11ol19">
       where the notarial seal is not shown of record;
      </li>
      <li id="t15c01s15-1-11ol110">
       where the wording of the consideration may or might create an implied lien in favor of the grantor (by this is not meant an express vendor’s lien retained).
       <p>
        If, at the time at which the right of any person to bring an action for the recovery of land because of any such defects, shall have first accrued, such persons shall have been under the disability of infancy or unsoundness of mind, then such person or the person claiming through him, may, notwithstanding that the period of limitations hereinbefore provided for shall have expired, bring an action to recover the land at any time within the period of limitations provided herein next after the time at which the person to whom the right shall have first accrued shall have ceased to be under either disability, or shall have died, whichever shall have first happened. However, when any person who shall be under either of the disabilities mentioned, at the time at which his right shall have first accrued, shall depart this life without having ceased to be under such disability no time to bring an action to recover the land beyond the period of limitations provided herein next after the time at which such persons shall have died, shall be allowed by reason of the disability of any other person. Moreover, the saving in favor of persons under disability of unsoundness of mind shall never extend longer than thirty-one years.
       </p>

        This section shall not, however, apply to forged instruments.

       In dispute among a brother, a sister-in-law, and another brother who was the husband of the sister-in-law, the chancery court did not err in its decision that use of 2.6 acres by one of the brothers was permissive, the permission was never terminated, and the use never became adverse. Cleveland v. Killen, 966 So. 2d 848, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 675 (Miss. Ct. App. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       Award of two properties to adverse possessors by adverse possession was proper where their occupancy was more than sporadic or intermittent and was easily seen by the true owners. Buford v. Logue, 832 So. 2d 594, 2002 Miss. App. LEXIS 685 (Miss. Ct. App. 2002).
      </p>
      <p>
       Heirs at law did not establish title to a disputed 40-acre tract of land by adverse possession as the possessory acts relied upon by the would be adverse possessors were insufficient to place the record title holder on notice that the lands were under an adverse claim of ownership; while each element of adverse possession was ultimately shown over a 60-year period, the heirs at law failed to prove that all of the elements to claim the property by adverse possession during any continuous 10-year period, as was required under Miss. Code Ann. 15-1-13. Cotton v. Cuba Timber Co., 825 So. 2d 669, 2002 Miss. App. LEXIS 69 (Miss. Ct. App. 2002).
      </p>
      <p>
       In order to show adverse possession, a party must show possession, which is open notorious and visible, hostile, under claim of ownership, exclusive, peaceful, and continuous and uninterrupted for a period of 10 years. The existence of a fence around property for a period of at least 55 years offers a substantial basis for establishing adverse possession. Roy v. Kayser, 501 So. 2d 1110, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2280 (Miss. 1987).

   In an action to quiet title, the chancellor was justified in rejecting the permissive use theory, where plaintiff, claiming ownership against an adverse possessor, constructed a fence which he thereafter regarded as the boundary line of his property, operated his dairy business only on the property to the west of the fence he had constructed, pointed out the fence line to a surveyor as the western boundary of his property, and mortgaged all three tracts of his property on three separate occasions and none of the descriptions contained in those deeds of trust included the property claimed by the adverse possessor; thus, the chancellor was not manifestly wrong in finding that the property had been adversely possessed for the period prescribed in §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-13" target="_self">15-1-13</a></cite>. Hewlett v. Henderson, 431 So. 2d 449, 1983 Miss. LEXIS 2574 (Miss. 1983).

       Ten years’ possession by purchaser on foreclosure of trust deed and successors held, notwithstanding deed on foreclosure was not given, to give title as against grantor of trust deed. American Petrofina, Inc. v. Warren, 247 Miss. 552, 156 So. 2d 729, 1963 Miss. LEXIS 324 (Miss. 1963).

       Where there has been a severance of minerals by an adverse possessor, the continued adverse possession of the surface by the severor or severee inures to the benefit of the severed mineral estate as against a true owner.

      <p>
       In a proceeding by alleged realty owners to be declared true owners of certain realty, where road running through the land in question has been maintained for twelve years or more, and the road has been regarded as a public one and traveled by many persons, a decree enjoining realty possessors from using the road was erroneous, despite the fact that evidence was insufficient to establish claim of ownership of realty by adverse possession. Ball v. Martin, 217 Miss. 221, 63 So. 2d 833, 1953 Miss. LEXIS 425 (Miss. 1953).

       Purpose and intent of §§ 709 and 710, Code of 1942, and this section [Code 1942, § 711] is to guarantee good title to one purchasing land in good faith from another, where such other went into possession under recorded deed, valid on its face, and continued in uninterrupted possession for period of 31 years or more.

       Save as to easements, licenses or mere equities, abandonment is not effective to divest title to real estate, and fee simple titles are lost only by estoppel or by adverse possession or by maintainable tax sale. Walker v. Polk, 208 Miss. 389, 44 So. 2d 477, 1950 Miss. LEXIS 256 (Miss. 1950).
      </p>
      <p>
       Statute (Laws 1934, ch 250) providing that all mortgagors of real estate located within the state who might have the right to set aside any title to such real estate by reason of the neglect of any trustee to insert it in a notice of sale of such real estate, the name of said mortgagor, should commence suit within 12 months from the passage of such act, and upon the failure of such mortgagor or other person to commence suit within such time, the right to bring such suit, and the remedy to enforce such right of action should be deemed thereafter to be completely extinguished, if applied so as to restrict the application of the general ten-year statute, made applicable by provision of statute (Code 1942, § 888), regulating the sale of lands under mortgages and deeds of trust, was not invalid as being an impairment of contract or as class or private legislation, since the right to sue is distinct from the right sought to be enforced and is remedial in character. Barbour v. Williams, 196 Miss. 409, 17 So. 2d 604, 1944 Miss. LEXIS 207 (Miss. 1944).
      </p>

       A county taking a fifty-foot right of way about twenty-six miles long and constructing a concrete sea wall on the south fifteen feet thereof and an earthen fill on the remaining thirty-five feet acquired title by adverse possession under the ten-year statute.

       Mere claim of title unaccompanied by adverse possession will not bar true owner. Leavenworth v. Reeves, 106 Miss. 722, 64 So. 660, 1914 Miss. LEXIS 12 (Miss. 1914).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where adverse occupant conveyed land to another but shortly thereafter resumed possession, sale being verbally rescinded, there was no break in adverse possession so as to render it unavailing against one claiming under verbally rescinded title of vendee.

      <p>
       Chancery court did not err in finding that landowners adversely possessed the disputed property because the evidence clearly established each element of adverse possession; the landowners’ activities provided sufficient notice to the prior owners of the property that they staked a proper claim of ownership, and the landowners’ possessory acts of hunting, fishing, running cattle, leasing the property, and planting on it were sufficiently hostile. Revette v. Ferguson, 271 So.3d 702, 2018 Miss. App. LEXIS 635 (Miss. Ct. App. 2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancery court did not err in finding that landowners adversely possessed property because the evidence clearly established each element of adverse possession; the landowners’ actions were open, notorious, and visible because they unfurled their flag on adjoining owners’ land and kept it flying such that the adjoining owners would have actual or constructive knowledge of the landowners’ presence, they hunted and fished on the disputed land, grazed cattle on the land, and erected fences. Revette v. Ferguson, 271 So.3d 702, 2018 Miss. App. LEXIS 635 (Miss. Ct. App. 2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       There was substantial evidence to support the chancery court’s finding that landowners’ possessed disputed property continuously and uninterruptedly for ten years because their possession of the property was continuous and without interruption well in excess of the ten-year period required by the statute. Revette v. Ferguson, 271 So.3d 702, 2018 Miss. App. LEXIS 635 (Miss. Ct. App. 2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancery court did not err in finding that landowners adversely possessed the disputed property because the evidence clearly established each element of adverse possession; the landowners presented ample testimony regarding the actions that they, their invitees, and their lessees took on the disputed property, and no evidence was presented establishing a non-peaceful existence between the landowners and adjoining owners or their predecessors in interest. Revette v. Ferguson, 271 So.3d 702, 2018 Miss. App. LEXIS 635 (Miss. Ct. App. 2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court’s finding of adverse possession in favor of appellees was proper; there were several claims of ownership by appellees that were visible for over 10 years, including testimony that appellees’ family had used the property for approximately 60 years prior to appellants’ purchase, and in 1987, boundaries of the family land were marked, and a survey corroborated these markings. Cronier v. ALR Partners L.P., 248 So.3d 861, 2017 Miss. App. LEXIS 676 (Miss. Ct. App. 2017), cert. denied, 247 So.3d 1264, 2018 Miss. LEXIS 308 (Miss. 2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       Appellants did not need to be aware of the occupation for the 10 years, and title ripened in appellees when they completed 10 years of adverse possession, such that appellees’ flagging of the property was not too remote in time; appellants’ predecessors took no action to prevent appellees’ occupation, and thus the evidence established the actual and hostile element. Cronier v. ALR Partners L.P., 248 So.3d 861, 2017 Miss. App. LEXIS 676 (Miss. Ct. App. 2017), cert. denied, 247 So.3d 1264, 2018 Miss. LEXIS 308 (Miss. 2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       Record established decades of open, obvious control of the disputed property, including appellees’ acts over the years in marking corners, creating firebreaks, fencing borders, leasing the property for hunting, and using the area’s road to access other property, such that the adverse possession element of open, notorious, and visible possession was met. Cronier v. ALR Partners L.P., 248 So.3d 861, 2017 Miss. App. LEXIS 676 (Miss. Ct. App. 2017), cert. denied, 247 So.3d 1264, 2018 Miss. LEXIS 308 (Miss. 2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       Appellees possessed the disputed parcel for a continuous period in excess of 10 years; there is no limit regarding remoteness of time, and the continuous and uninterrupted use of the property over a period of ten or more years meets the statutory requirements. Cronier v. ALR Partners L.P., 248 So.3d 861, 2017 Miss. App. LEXIS 676 (Miss. Ct. App. 2017), cert. denied, 247 So.3d 1264, 2018 Miss. LEXIS 308 (Miss. 2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       Appellees had exhibited actions showing dominion and control over the property at issue for decades; the testimony showed that appellees had maintained and marked the boundaries of the property since the 1940s by fences, yellow blazes, and firebreaks, and there was testimony that appellant was told about the corner markers and boundaries. Cronier v. ALR Partners L.P., 248 So.3d 861, 2017 Miss. App. LEXIS 676 (Miss. Ct. App. 2017), cert. denied, 247 So.3d 1264, 2018 Miss. LEXIS 308 (Miss. 2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chancellor properly found the testimony showed that appellees peacefully used and possessed the disputed property for decades, plus appellees and one party were peaceful neighbors for over 10 years, and it was only when appellant purchased the property that a boundary dispute ensued. Cronier v. ALR Partners L.P., 248 So.3d 861, 2017 Miss. App. LEXIS 676 (Miss. Ct. App. 2017), cert. denied, 247 So.3d 1264, 2018 Miss. LEXIS 308 (Miss. 2018).

      <p>
       In an action to quiet title on the basis of adverse possession, plaintiffs’ predecessor in title held peaceful occupation of the land because their was no evidence establishing that he and defendants ever had any conflict regarding use or ownership of the land at issue. Hill v. Johnson, 27 So.3d 426, 2009 Miss. App. LEXIS 448 (Miss. Ct. App. 2009), cert. denied, 27 So.3d 404, 2010 Miss. LEXIS 63 (Miss. 2010).
      </p>
      <p>
       In an action to quiet title on the basis of adverse possession, the possessory acts of plaintiffs’ predecessor in title in bushhogging a field road, leasing the property to others, walking and driving on the road, and using the field road for all farming operations for 50 years were sufficient to establish title by adverse possession where defendants’ use of the roadway was scant at best. It was immaterial that the predecessor in title granted an easement on the property, as possession could be exclusive notwithstanding the land being subject to rights that are no more than mere easements. Hill v. Johnson, 27 So.3d 426, 2009 Miss. App. LEXIS 448 (Miss. Ct. App. 2009), cert. denied, 27 So.3d 404, 2010 Miss. LEXIS 63 (Miss. 2010).

       Lawyer admitted that in 1971, he thought his new building had been built on the adjacent property owner’s lot. He then set out in a deliberate attempt to adversely possess the 17 foot strip of land belonging to the out-of-state property owner, by building a fence, quitclaiming the property to his wife, and vice versa, and utilizing a false survey, before finally contacting the property owner in 1998 regarding his claim of adverse possession; because the lawyer knew he did not own the strip he had no claim of ownership at the beginning of the statutory period and, thus, he could not gain title to the property through adverse possession. Blackburn v. Wong, 904 So. 2d 134, 2004 Miss. LEXIS 1354 (Miss. 2004).

       While, under the ten-year adverse possession statute one may acquire title to land without actually occupying it, either himself or by tenant, but by merely cultivating, pasturing, cutting and selling timber, and other acts of ownership and control over the same, under the three-year statute it is required that there be actual occupancy for three years, and not the mere exercise of acts of ownership and control such as would give title by adverse possession without actual occupation.

       Award of title to a disputed tract of land to the adjoining landowners by virtue of adverse possession proper, in part because evidence that those landowners had constructed a barbed-wire fence encompassing the disputed property some 60 years ago was compelling evidence of adverse possession; the landowners had also planted crops and continually harvested timber.

       If a public road runs through the property of one and deadends on the property of another, and for 10 years the latter landowner (and persons acting on his behalf and with his permission) are the only ones to use the road, no abandonment occurs. It is not necessary that interlopers or sightseers or persons without any ownership interest or business on the latter’s property use the road, for the owner of the land on whose property the road dead-ends is, as much as any other, a member of the general public, and as able in law to interrupt the period of prescription. McNeely v. Jacks, 526 So. 2d 541, 1988 Miss. LEXIS 305 (Miss. 1988).

      <p>
       Chancellor’s order confirming and quieting title in landowner was proper where landowner’s mother had claimed disputed property from 1945 until she deeded it to landowner in 1973; use of this property was exclusive and peaceful, continuous for 41 years, actual, open, and notorious, and under claim of right; evidence showed that disputed property was under fence for purpose of grazing cows from 1942 until mid-1960’s, and fence remained in repair well enough to keep cattle until at least 1972; it does not matter whether land claimed under adverse possession is within “call of the title deeds,” or is in same quarter section or section as land lies which is described in deed; since requirements of adverse possession had been established by fence around disputed property and continued use of property for more than 40 years, once title ripened by adverse possession it was not necessary that fence be standing, or even in existence, when suit was filed.

       Acquisition of one-half interest in property by adverse possession was not established where former wife’s occupancy of premises was not exclusive, being shared with husband; interest of former wife in property was at best homestead interest, her legal relationship with husband regarding title being analogous to that of cotenants, which would have required effective communication of intent and legal ouster of husband from one-half interest in question, neither of which was shown.

       Three years actual occupancy by the complainants’ predecessor was sufficient to begin the running of the statute, and possession was not lost by the adverse claimant when he moved from the land but was continued by his payment of taxes each year either by himself or his descendants, and where the defendants had only slight and sporadic possession of the land and did not protest payments of taxes or possession, title vested in the complainants by the continuous adverse possession subsequent to the ouster of the cotenants.

       While it was undisputed that a person claiming title to a three-acre tract was in continuous, open, and exclusive possession of it for more than 40 years, having fenced it during that time and used it as a garden and for fruit trees, and where he testified that he entered possession without the permission of the corporate landowner, and the landowner’s chairman, although invited to say that he gave the possessor permission to enter the land, declined to say so, title by adverse possession was established, and conversations taking place years after the statutory period of 10 years had elapsed between the chairman and the possessor about the possible buying or swapping some of the possessor’s land for some of the corporation’s land, were insufficient to prevent adverse possession on the theory of permissive use.

       Chancery court did not abuse its discretion in granting a couple’s motion to quiet and confirm title because substantial evidence supported its determination that the couple proved adverse possession by clear and convincing evidence; the couple erected a fence, placed horses within it, and maintained control of the fenced area, and they maintained a level of usage of the property that would have placed the record owner on notice of the occupation.

       The rule which prevents one tenant in common from purchasing an outstanding title to the common property and setting it up against his cotenant is founded upon the confidential relation that is presumed to exist between them, and has no application where the circumstances surrounding them negative any such relation, and show that they, though in law tenants in common, are not such in fact, and are asserting hostile claims against each other with reference to the common property.

       A managing cotenant, in attempting to claim the interest of other cotenants by adverse possession, has the burden of proving ouster by clear and convincing evidence, since a confidential relationship exists between cotenants, and a cotenant who desires to terminate the relationship has a remedy of partition, or sale for division of proceeds in a proper case, and rather than trying to oust his cotenant and claim adversely, he should deal openly and forthrightly with his cotenants and avail himself of such remedy.

      </p>
      <p>
       In establishing that an ouster has occurred between relative cotenants not strangers to the title, followed by the required period of adverse possession, it is not enough to show acts of hostile possession which in other cases might constitute an adverse possession against a stranger, but the possessing cotenant must show actual notice to his cotenant, and the statute of limitations does not begin to run against a cotenant not in possession until the claim of ownership of the other cotenant is brought to his attention.

       In an action to establish that an ouster has occurred between cotenants, the activities of the complainant’s brother on the property of their father from the time he came into possession, namely creating pasture land, building fences, digging ponds, and changing the course of a creek, were entirely consistent with the occupancy of a cotenant, and were in no sense notice to the complainant of adverse possession.

       In an action brought by cotenants to confirm and establish their title to an undivided interest as cotenants in certain land as against claims of the defendant, another cotenant, who had purchased a tax title to the property, the purchasing cotenant could not claim adverse possession as against her cotenants, where there was no ouster of the cotenants such as would give them notice that her claim was adverse to their interest.

       Acts of ownership and continuous adverse possession for more than ten years by purchaser at foreclosure sale during which time purchaser repaired fences, improved houses, built houses, cultivated and used land, and paid taxes, amounted to complete ouster of his alleged cotenants, who, knowing of the foreclosure, moved off premises, and such possession overcame any presumption that title was being held for benefit of cotenants.

       One claiming entire interest in land under recorded instrument purporting to be deed from her father, and whose brothers and sisters, with knowledge of instrument, allowed her to remain in exclusive possession under claim of title without interference for more than fifteen years, is not required, as tenant in common with brothers and sisters, to give them notice of her exclusive claim in order to acquire title by adverse possession, since brothers and sisters had in fact all the notice that was necessary.

       Acquisition of one-half interest in property by adverse possession was not established where former wife’s occupancy of premises was not exclusive, being shared with husband; interest of former wife in property was at best homestead interest, her legal relationship with husband regarding title being analogous to that of co-tenants, which would have required effective communication of intent and legal ouster of husband from one-half interest in question, neither of which was shown. Davis v. Davis, 508 So. 2d 1062, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2527 (Miss. 1987).

      <p>
       A son who entered upon land in 1899 after his marriage, and built a home and thereafter exercised every use over the property to which it was susceptible without any protest by either his father or brother during the father’s lifetime, possessed the land initially by color of right as a result of a presumptive parol gift from his father, which title ripened in him in 1909 by adverse possession, effectively divesting his father who died in 1912, so that the property in question did not descend to the father’s heirs in cotenancy; it is well settled that a claim of title under a parol gift or purchase, accompanied by entry and adverse holding, may ripen into an indefeasible title by the lapse of the statutory period of limitation.

       The actions of a managing cotenant in paying taxes on the property, having the land surveyed and the lines marked, selling timber therefrom, preventing trespass on the land by adjoining landowners, obtaining the services of the state forestry commission regarding the sale of timber, and improving the timber stand by hiring employees and cutting trees for that purpose, were entirely consistent with the legal right of a cotenant upon the land, and were not sufficient to constitute the equivalent of actual knowledge on the part of the other cotenant, so as to start the running of the statute of limitations for adverse possession against the other cotenant. Kennedy v. Bryant, 252 So. 2d 784, 1971 Miss. LEXIS 1200 (Miss. 1971).

      <p>
       Although a tenant in common, who in an action to determine title to land, asserted an interest of one-eighteenth of the whole tract, was chargeable with knowledge that his cotenants were claiming to be the sole owners, and exercising exclusive management and control over the land, the cotenants failed to acquire title as to the plaintiff by adverse possession. 231 Miss. 461, 95 So. 2d 563.

       Even though it was assumed that a lumber company, who acquired a warranty deed to land from the father and brother in which the children had an interest, became a tenant in common with the children, evidence showing that the lumber company upon acquiring the deed went into immediate possession of the land, enclosed it with a fence, had land assessed and paid taxes thereon, had a caretaker to look after it, cut timber thereon, and claimed the land openly as its own, and the children for at least 18 years after they became of age came back and forth to their father’s old homestead just across the highway from the land, indicated that the children knew that the lumber company was in actual possession of the land and claiming full title thereto for a longer period than ten years.

       Co-heir’s purchase of land at tax sale and possession thereafter exclusively, peaceably, continuously, adversely, and notoriously for a period of 52 years established his title by adverse possession as against other coheirs, and verbal protests and objections by coheirs were insufficient to stop the running of the statute of limitations in his favor.

       Title to land by adverse possession cannot be established in 1947, by tax receipts dated from 1931 to and including 1947 containing description of land, when land was sold to State for 1932 taxes and State issued patent to land in 1941 to purchaser other than individual claiming by adverse possession.

       The execution and recording of a warranty deed by several cotenants of land to a stranger to the title set in motion an adverse claim against a cotenant who had not signed the deed, which was thereupon made available to the grantee, who, by implementing such claim by adverse possession through himself and his successors in title for a period beyond the statutory limitation, matured the disseisin into complete ownership.

       Where a grantor claims by adverse possession all or part of the property conveyed, proof of actual notice of that possession by the grantor to the grantee should be stronger than in the normal adverse possession case and should be clear beyond a reasonable doubt; the evidence should reveal that the grantee has been ousted from the property he received under the conveyance.

       Chancellor’s order confirming and quieting title in landowner was proper where landowner’s mother had claimed disputed property from 1945 until she deeded it to landowner in 1973; use of this property was exclusive and peaceful, continuous for 41 years, actual, open, and notorious, and under claim of right; evidence showed that disputed property was under fence for purpose of grazing cows from 1942 until mid-1960’s, and fence remained in repair well enough to keep cattle until at least 1972; it does not matter whether land claimed under adverse possession is within “call of the title deeds,” or is in same quarter section or section as land lies which is described in deed; since requirements of adverse possession had been established by fence around disputed property and continued use of property for more than 40 years, once title ripened by adverse possession it was not necessary that fence be standing, or even in existence, when suit was filed.

       In the absence of an order of the board of supervisors, or other record evidence showing that the roadway had been designated as a public road, public user and working and maintaining of roadway across defendants’ land by public authorities at public expense for 17 years, without objection of defendants was sufficient to put them on notice that public authorities were asserting a right to deal with the road as part of the road system in the district, and to establish an easement for public road purposes by prescription to adverse user for the period prescribed by law, so as to preclude defendants from placing gates across or otherwise obstructing such road.

       Although evidence was conflicting as to whether fence enclosing land adversely claimed was continuously kept up by repairs in such condition as to exclude cattle, it was sufficient to show that fence was amply sufficient during a continuous period of ten years to fly the flag over the land and put the true owner on notice that the land within the fence was being held under an adverse claim of ownership, and when taken in connection with other facts, title by adverse possession was substantiated.

       Tax sale purchaser did not prove adverse possession of the subject land because clear and convincing evidence did not show (1) actual or hostile possession by acts to control the property’s use, (2) open, notorious, and visible occupation sufficient to give the true owner notice, (3) continuous and uninterrupted occupation for ten years when both the purchaser and the true owner claimed to have been on the property regularly, or (4) absence of a breach of the peace.

       Property owner failed to establish, by clear and convincing evidence, each element of his adverse-possession claim because a road was not as obvious as represented in photographs, a “mud pit” had not come into being until after 2006, and the original complaint was filed in 2013, within the prescribed ten-year statutory period to claim adverse possession; though ATV use had been visible, continuous, and uninterrupted, it had not been present for the requisite ten years prescribed by statute.

       Judgment finding that plaintiffs failed to sustain their claim that they had adversely possessed two sections of property was affirmed where (1) simply because plaintiffs purchased property in 1991 did not automatically mean that they held property other than that which was described in the 1991 deed under a claim of ownership; and (2) the mere existence of a fence near the actual boundary line did not establish that the fence was the accepted boundary between the properties.

       The evidence was insufficient to support a finding of ownership of land by adverse possession, even though the alleged adverse possessor claimed that he had stored “junk” consisting of a washing machine, tractor and tractor parts, on the land in question for well over 10 years, where the landowner strongly objected to a fence as soon as it was erected by the alleged adverse possessor.

       The chancellor did not err in dismissing with prejudice a proceeding by a landowner to confirm title to two small parcels of land adjoining his 40-acre tract on the ground that he had acquired title thereto by adverse possession as against the adjoining landowner, where the adverse claimant did not erect any improvements upon the disputed land, or cut the timber on the land, but merely cultivated some portion thereof part of the time, and the zigzag fence, erected by claimant, had been strung on trees, bushes and poles and had not been kept in repair.

       Evidence supported the chancellor’s finding that grantor’s re-entry into land was, in the outset, permissive, and the grantor was a tenant and had paid rent as late as September 10, 1945, and his claim to adverse possession had not equalled the necessary period of ten years before the action was filed by the widow of his grantee.

       Trial court improperly found that siblings did not acquire title to property by adverse possession because it erred in limiting its focus to the period of time after the date of a corporation’s purchase; further inquiry was crucial in determining whether the siblings adversely possessed the disputed property at any point prior to the corporation’s purchase of the land.

       A statement made by a record owner’s predecessor in title to an adverse claimant that he owned the land in question and that he wanted to get the matter settled so that there would be no question about the boundary line was insufficient to negate the claimant’s adverse possession of the property or to establish that his possession was with the permission of the predecessor in title where the claimant never wavered in his position that he owned the land in dispute, and the predecessor in title did nothing to interfere with the claimant’s possession and claim of ownership of the land.

       Neither party claiming ownership to a disputed parcel of land established title by adverse possession where both parties constructively possessed the land by their deeds, but the possession of each party against the other, if adverse, was inexplicably intermittent, or alternated with use by the true owner, so that both parties failed to prove hostile and exclusive possession of the land to which each held record title for a period of 10 years.

       In an action by a husband and a wife to remove clouds upon their property title and for injunctive relief, the trial court erred in concluding that the defendants had failed to plead and prove adverse possession where the defendants had claimed title to the area in question by deed and had testified that they had used the disputed property for 25 years, erecting a storage shed and cultivating a garden thereon; although the defendants did not seek by cross-bill to cancel the claim of the husband and the wife to the property and confirm and quiet title in themselves, the allegations in their answer sufficiently raised the defense of adverse possession.

      <p>
       Sections 716 and 717, Code of 1942, were inapplicable to an action to determine ownership of land in which the plaintiffs claimed an undivided one half interest, and in which defendants, who were successors in interest to a tenant in common who had also acquired tax title to the land, claimed title through adverse possession and laches; but the parties’ rights were to be tested by the ten-year statute of limitations. 231 Miss. 461, 95 So. 2d 563.

      </p>
      <p>
       Any judgment adjudging plaintiff in an action to remove cloud from his title to be the owner of the land as against one claiming by adverse possession is not binding as against a third person not made a party to the suit who might have acquired a good and perfect title by 10 years’ adverse possession.

     <p>
      Actual occupation for three years, after two years from the day of sale of land held under a conveyance by a tax collector in pursuance of a sale for taxes, shall bar any suit to recover such land or assail such title because of any defect in the sale of the land for taxes, or in any precedent step to the sale, saving to minors and persons of unsound mind the right to bring suit within such time, after the removal of their disabilities, and upon the same terms as is provided for the redemption of land by such persons.

       Where the public has enjoyed access to waters for more than 10 consecutive years, those waters belong to the state by adverse possession, to be held in trust for the people. Waters used by the public under a claim of right, openly, notoriously, peacefully, continuously and uninterrupted for more than 10 years become public and, once public, such waters may not be lost by prescription. Dycus v. Sillers, 557 So. 2d 486, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 8 (Miss. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       The 3-year possession statute was intended to cut off the right to assert the invalidity of the tax sale. Yocom v. Patton, 277 So. 2d 110, 1973 Miss. LEXIS 1405 (Miss. 1973).
      </p>
      <p>
       The tax collector’s certified list of lands sold for taxes is a conveyance under this statute. Yocom v. Patton, 277 So. 2d 110, 1973 Miss. LEXIS 1405 (Miss. 1973).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section [Code 1942, § 716] and Code 1942, § 717, were inapplicable to an action to determine ownership of land in which the plaintiffs claimed an undivided one half interest, and in which defendants, who were successors in interest to a tenant in common who had also acquired tax title to the land, claimed title through adverse possession and laches; but the parties’ rights were to be tested by the ten-year statute of limitations. 231 Miss. 461, 95 So. 2d 563.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where minerals had been severed from the surface, and defendants, claiming under a color of title of a void tax deed, although exercising acts of ownership of which the surface was susceptible, had never taken actual possession of any of the minerals, they did not acquire rights to the minerals by adverse possession, so that plaintiffs who held mineral rights to the land through inheritance from the grantor of the surface rights did not lose their rights to the minerals by limitations or laches. White v. Merchants & Planters Bank, 229 Miss. 35, 90 So. 2d 11, 1956 Miss. LEXIS 583 (Miss. 1956).

       The only conveyance which the tax collector executes or is authorized to execute is his certified list of lands sold for taxes. Powe v. Brantley, 210 Miss. 627, 50 So. 2d 229, 1951 Miss. LEXIS 300 (Miss. 1951).
      </p>
      <p>
       The word conveyance as used in § 716, Code of 1942, which provides that three years actual occupation of land held under a conveyance by a tax collector shall bar suit to recover such land, does not necessarily mean a deed of conveyance to be executed by the chancery clerk under § 9958, Code of 1942 providing for execution of deeds of conveyance to individuals purchasing land at tax sales. Powe v. Brantley, 210 Miss. 627, 50 So. 2d 229, 1951 Miss. LEXIS 300 (Miss. 1951).

       Three years of actual occupation by tax title purchaser divests the holder of the legal title of all right, title and interest in the land. Hooper v. Walker, 201 Miss. 158, 29 So. 2d 72, 1947 Miss. LEXIS 381 (Miss. 1947).

   Title and ownership of land does not depend upon the validity or invalidity of the tax sales and the Forfeited Tax Land Patents which were subsequently acquired since if the sales were legally and validly made then the titles that are derived through the Forfeited Tax Land Patents are good under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-15" target="_self">15-1-15</a></cite> and, on the other hand, if one or more of the tax sales was invalid or illegal then title to the lands in question remained in individuals and thereby was subject to acquisition by purchasers through adverse possession under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-13" target="_self">15-1-13</a></cite>.

       Where a party enters into the possession of land under color of title, he is not considered as a mere disseizor, and confined to the part of premises in his actual occupancy, but his claim extends to all the lands embraced in the deed under which he claims. Smith v. Cook, 213 Miss. 876, 58 So. 2d 27, 1952 Miss. LEXIS 437 (Miss. 1952).

      <p>
       Neither this section [Code 1942, § 716] nor the two-year statute of limitations provided by Code 1942, § 717, has any application to a tax title claim by one cotenant against another. Smith v. Smith, 211 Miss. 481, 52 So. 2d 1, 1951 Miss. LEXIS 379 (Miss. 1951).
      </p>

       A conveyance from the chancery clerk is necessary to transfer title to the tax purchaser, where the sheriff and the tax collector’s list of tax sale has been duly made and filed with the clerk. Powe v. Brantley, 210 Miss. 627, 50 So. 2d 229, 1951 Miss. LEXIS 300 (Miss. 1951).
      </p>

       This section [Code 1942, § 716] does not confer title to state lands since they are not subject to taxation, tax deed in such case being wholly void. Penick v.

      <p>
       The statute [Code 1942, § 716] applies only to lands that were taxable when sold for taxes. Mitchell v. Bond, 84 Miss. 72, 36 So. 148, 1904 Miss. LEXIS 13 (Miss. 1904); Hoskins v. Illinois C. R. Co., 78 Miss. 768, 29 So. 518, 1901 Miss. LEXIS 134 (Miss. 1901).
      </p>
      <p>
       The statute [Code 1942, § 716] applies, although the land was not subject to sale and although the assessment roll was not properly returned by the assessor. Carlisle v. Yoder, 69 Miss. 384, 12 So. 255, 1891 Miss. LEXIS 101 (Miss. 1891), overruled,

      <p>
       Section 15-1-15, which affords a 3-year limitation after a 2-year redemption period following a tax sale, cannot lend validity to a tax sale which is void for want of an adequate description. Although possession of the type required by the statute may set at rest an otherwise void sale, it cannot do so where the invalidity is because of the want of an adequate description. Bowser v. Tootle, 556 So. 2d 1373, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 46 (Miss. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where attempted conveyance of mineral and royalty interests in a tract of land by tax deed was void for uncertainty of description, that description could not be cured by occupancy for three years under Code 1942, § 716 irrespective of the degree of such occupancy because the tax purchaser took nothing under this part of the description and there was no color of title which could be perfected under the statute. Wilson v. Clark, 278 So. 2d 250, 1973 Miss. LEXIS 1422 (Miss. 1973).
      </p>

      <p>
       Where the state highway commission condemned a strip of land for highway purposes as against the holder of a tax title thereto, and it went into possession and occupied the same for more than three years, such period of possession without challenge on the part of the original owner destroyed the owner’s right to challenge the commission’s ownership, notwithstanding that the tax sale was void.

      </p>
      <p>
       The statute [Code 1942, § 716] is designed to cure one link in a title; that is, the possession continued for three years under a conveyance makes the sale a valid and legal sale for all purposes after the expiration of such time, but such possession does not cure a defect in a subsequent conveyance; accordingly, possession of a purchaser through conveyance from a municipality of land acquired by the municipality at a tax sale did not operate to cure the defects in the sale where no authority for such conveyance was provided by ordinance.

   Under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-15" target="_self">15-1-15</a></cite>, “actual occupancy” does not mean that one must reside personally upon the property but it does mean possession over the 3-year period which is of such a nature, throughout the 3-year period, that another, believing himself or herself to be the owner of the property, would recognize that someone else was asserting a claim to it because of a clearly visible indicia of occupancy on the property. Bowser v. Tootle, 556 So. 2d 1373, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 46 (Miss. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       The occupancy referred to in Code 1942, § 716, must be by someone claiming under color of title by and through the tax collector’s deed and in the absence of such claim and occupancy, the three-year term proscribed by this section does not begin to run. Wilson v. Clark, 278 So. 2d 250, 1973 Miss. LEXIS 1422 (Miss. 1973).
      </p>
      <p>
       It is not mere adverse possession that gives title under Code 1942, § 716 but it is actual occupation claiming under a conveyance by a tax collector in pursuance of a tax sale. Yocom v. Patton, 277 So. 2d 110, 1973 Miss. LEXIS 1405 (Miss. 1973).
      </p>
      <p>
       The words “actual occupation” under this section [Code 1942, § 716], do not require the tax buyer to go and live upon or use the premises, but he may occupy the land by a tenant and the occupancy of his tenant is the occupancy of the tax buyer. Cox v. Richerson, 186 Miss. 576, 191 So. 99, 1939 Miss. LEXIS 230 (Miss. 1939).

       This section [Code 1942, § 716] applies to those who have actual occupation “under a conveyance by a tax collector”, and the sheriff of the county is the tax collector and the chancery clerk is not a tax collector.

       Law relating to actual possession curing defect in tax sale relates only to sale followed by possession therein described; privity between purchaser at tax sale and person in possession is required for application of law relating to possession curing defects in sale; possession by purchaser through conveyance from municipality of lands acquired by the municipality at tax sale without ordinance authorizing such conveyances did not operate to cure defects in sale.

       The legislature intended by this section [Code 1942, § 716] that the possession of the holders of the tax title should be of such character and evidenced by such change of occupancy and acts of ownership as to leave no doubt as to whether the former owner would be thereby afforded the means of becoming advised that the title was being claimed pursuant to the tax sale. Smith v. Anderson, 193 Miss. 161, 8 So. 2d 251, 1942 Miss. LEXIS 103 (Miss. 1942).

       The purpose of this section [Code 1942, § 716] is to require an actual possession as against a mere constructive possession under a paper title. Cox v. Richerson, 186 Miss. 576, 191 So. 99, 1939 Miss. LEXIS 230 (Miss. 1939).

       In order to show adverse possession, there is a necessity for unequivocal acts showing an occupancy which is actual, continuous, and hostile, especially where such occupancy is by a member of a family against another. Coleman v. L. & M. Land & Mineral Corp., 54 So. 2d 213 (Miss. 1951).

      <p>
       Without color of title, adverse possession gives title only to the land actually and continuously used, cultivated or occupied. Parks v. Simmons, 52 So. 2d 14 (Miss. 1951).
      </p>
      <p>
       The character and type of “adverse possession” required under Code 1942, § 717, limiting the time for attacking validity of tax sale to the state, is that pertaining to ten years adverse possession, and not that under this section [Code 1942, § 716].

      <p>
       While, under the ten years’ adverse possession statute one may acquire title to land without actually occupying it, either himself or by tenant, but by merely cultivating, pasturing, cutting and selling timber, and other acts of ownership and control over the same, under the three-year statute it is required that there be actual occupancy for three years, and not the mere exercise of acts of ownership and control such as would give title by adverse possession without actual occupation.

       A forfeited tax land patent void on its face constitutes color of title to the land therein described and possession for 3 years after 2 years from the date of the tax sale bars any action to invalidate the tax title. Yocom v. Patton, 277 So. 2d 110, 1973 Miss. LEXIS 1405 (Miss. 1973).
      </p>
      <p>
       Possession by mortgagee under void deed of trust and claim of color of title under a tax deed which failed to describe the land, with subsequent possession consisting of occupancy of the premises through the person who owned the land at the time of the purported tax sale, did not sustain defendant’s claim of adverse possession and owner was entitled to decree canceling such claim as cloud upon his title. Heidelberg v. Duckworth, 206 Miss. 388, 40 So. 2d 179, 1949 Miss. LEXIS 269 (Miss. 1949).
      </p>
      <p>
       Claimant to land under void tax title could not invoke the three-year limitation period under this section [Code 1942, § 716] to support his claim of title where he never occupied the land either subsequent or prior to the sale. Thompson v. Reed, 199 Miss. 129, 23 So. 2d 888, 1945 Miss. LEXIS 276 (Miss. 1945).
      </p>
      <p>
       Fact that patentee’s vendee of wild and uncultivated land sold to the state under void tax sale paid taxes on the land continuously for three or four years prior to the filing of suits by the former owners to determine title, gave a deed of trust thereon for each of such years, and went upon such lands in person or by agent and offered to sell some timber therefrom although no timber was actually sold, cut or removed, did not constitute sufficient adverse possession to put the former owners on notice that their constructive possession of such land had been invaded, so that the two-year limitation period under Code 1942, § 717 was not available to the vendee. Thompson v. Reed, 199 Miss. 129, 23 So. 2d 888, 1945 Miss. LEXIS 276 (Miss. 1945).
      </p>
      <p>
       While a claimant under a void tax title may not be required to change the tenants on a farm in order to put the three-year statute in operation, he is not entitled to claim the benefit of the statute where he knows that the alleged change in actual occupation is being successfully and skillfully concealed from the former owners by reason of the fact that the agents or tenants of the former owners are allowed to rent out the land and exercise full management and control of the property in the same manner as they had done prior to the tax sale.

       This section [Code 1942, § 716] does not bar suit by tenant in common against cotenant in possession, as cotenant in possession has duty to pay taxes or to redeem from tax sale for benefit of all tenants in common, he cannot purchase any interest adverse to cotenants, and purchase of outstanding tax title by tenant in common inures to benefit of all tenants, the cost of redemption being common charge against property held in common.

       The effect of eminent domain proceedings against the holder of a tax title to the land in question, is to acquire the right of easement from such tax title holder, and the corporation or body condemning was entitled under the statute to enter and take possession and use the property for the purpose condemned, and was vested with all the rights and privileges that the party having the tax title would have, among which is the right to enter possession if it can peaceably do so, and hold possession for the statutory period under this section [Code 1942, § 716].

      <p>
       The statute [Code 1942, § 716] cannot be availed of where the occupant could not, if his tax title were perfect, assert it against the claimant of the land; its effect is to protect from assailment the tax title of one who, being authorized under the principles of law to claim under a sale for taxes, finds his title, which, if valid, would protect his possession, attacked for irregularities existing in the proceedings of sale.

       Chancellor properly held that the property at issue belonged to a tax sale purchaser because her claim did not arise when she began renting from the former owner in 1993, rather it arose when she bought the property at a tax sale and paid the ad valorem taxes on the property thereafter, the former owner did not redeem the property, and, even if there were defects in the publication of the notice of the tax sale, they were cured by the former tenant’s occupancy of the property for approximately seven years after the tax sale.

       Statute [Code 1942, § 717] held not unconstitutional as impairing contract since it reserves taxpayer full two years after passage in which to assert defects. Russell Inv. Corp. v. Russell, 182 Miss. 385, 178 So. 815, 182 So. 102, 1938 Miss. LEXIS 130 (Miss. 1938).

       Statute [Code 1942, § 717] held not unconstitutional as classification violating equal protection of laws. Russell Inv. Corp. v. Russell, 182 Miss. 385, 178 So. 815, 182 So. 102, 1938 Miss. LEXIS 130 (Miss. 1938).

       Alleged unconstitutionality, on ground statute vested fee simple title in state or patentees before expiration of three-year period of redemption allowed by Laws 1934 c. 383, would not be considered until case presented wherein statute was sought to be applied so as to cut off unexpired portion of redemption period. Russell Inv. Corp. v. Russell, 182 Miss. 385, 178 So. 815, 182 So. 102, 1938 Miss. LEXIS 130 (Miss. 1938).

       The holder of a forfeited tax land patent, which was based upon a void assessment and invalid sale to the state, and his successors in title, could not by mere adverse possession of the surface become vested with title to the minerals, which had been antecedently separated. Wilson v. Eckles, 232 Miss. 577, 99 So. 2d 846, 1958 Miss. LEXIS 305 (Miss. 1958).
      </p>
      <p>
       Under this section [Code 1942, § 717] there must be actual possession by purchaser of tax title. Wall v. Wall, 220 Miss. 642, 71 So. 2d 308, 1954 Miss. LEXIS 480 (Miss. 1954).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where an attack on the validity of a tax sale was made two years after the sale, the action was barred by this section [Code 1942, § 717]. Brown v. Pittman, 211 Miss. 344, 51 So. 2d 732, 1951 Miss. LEXIS 363 (Miss. 1951).
      </p>
      <p>
       Claimant acquired title under § 717, Code of 1942, the two-year tax statute of limitations, where there was an invalid tax sale to the state of three parcels of land which were adjoining and constituted and should have been sold as one tract, but where the claimant exercised ownership over the property, paid taxes, gave a turpentine lease under which visible acts upon trees were performed by the lessee, and where the claimant developed a program of reforestation. Broadus v. Hickman, 210 Miss. 885, 50 So. 2d 717, 1951 Miss. LEXIS 323 (Miss. 1951).
      </p>
      <p>
       The two-year period prescribed by this section [Code 1942, § 717] within which suit may be brought to cancel the title of the state is, in effect, a statute of limitations. Hooper v. Walker, 201 Miss. 158, 29 So. 2d 72, 1947 Miss. LEXIS 381 (Miss. 1947).
      </p>
      <p>
       Neither payment of taxes by patentee or his vendee of land sold to the state under a void tax sale, nor the giving of deeds of trust thereon, or both, constitutes a sufficient invasion of possession which follows legal title of the former owner to require the latter to file suit to set aside the tax sale within the two-year limitation prescribed by this section [Code 1942, § 717]. Thompson v. Reed, 199 Miss. 129, 23 So. 2d 888, 1945 Miss. LEXIS 276 (Miss. 1945).
      </p>
      <p>
       The two-year limitation of this section [Code 1942, § 717] does not apply where the former owner and his vendees have continuously remained in possession from the time of the tax sale. State v. Butler, 197 Miss. 218, 21 So. 2d 650, 1945 Miss. LEXIS 287 (Miss. 1945).
      </p>
      <p>
       The character and type of “adverse possession” required under this section [Code 1942, § 717] is that pertaining to ten years’ adverse possession, and not that under Code 1942, § 716 respecting three-year actual occupation under a tax title. Leavenworth v. Claughton, 197 Miss. 606, 20 So. 2d 821, 1945 Miss. LEXIS 300 (Miss. 1945).
      </p>
      <p>
       Statute does not cure or validate defects, irregularities and illegalities in assessment, levy, and sale of land for taxes, but is purely a statute of limitation. It does not take away vested rights but fixes a reasonable period of time in which they may be asserted, leaving former owner the right to sue and have sale declared void because of such defects, etc. Russell Inv. Corp. v. Russell, 182 Miss. 385, 178 So. 815, 182 So. 102, 1938 Miss. LEXIS 130 (Miss. 1938).
      </p>
      <p>
       Statute [Code 1942, § 717] could be successfully invoked against any suit challenging validity of tax sale to state, embraced within its provisions, on ground of defects, etc., as one of limitation, where effect would be neither to shorten period of redemption, nor divest estate in possession. Russell Inv. Corp. v. Russell, 182 Miss. 385, 178 So. 815, 182 So. 102, 1938 Miss. LEXIS 130 (Miss. 1938).
      </p>
      <p>
       Though a tax sale is subject to be defeated by redemption within time and in manner prescribed by law, if there is no redemption, sale becomes valid, and title relates back to date of sale and takes precedence over any mortgage, deed, or other instrument executed by owner during period of redemption. Russell Inv. Corp. v. Russell, 182 Miss. 385, 178 So. 815, 182 So. 102, 1938 Miss. LEXIS 130 (Miss. 1938).
      </p>
      <p>
       Fact that statute ran concurrently with portion of redemption period was immaterial since effect was not to shorten redemption period, and prior to expiration of limitation, taxpayer could enter suit to cancel claim of state’s patentee as cloud on his title, whether taxpayer was in possession or not or whether he was threatened to be disturbed in his possession. Russell Inv. Corp. v. Russell, 182 Miss. 385, 178 So. 815, 182 So. 102, 1938 Miss. LEXIS 130 (Miss. 1938).

       Where an action was brought in 1945 against the state to confirm a forfeited tax land patent and there was an adjudication of validity of the patent, and that though fraud had been perpetrated, the land commissioner and attorney general properly refused to cancel the tax sale to state and patent issued thereunder in an action brought therefor in 1949 by the heirs of the original owner of forfeited lands. Carney v. Anderson, 214 Miss. 504, 58 So. 2d 13, 1952 Miss. LEXIS 494 (Miss. 1952).
      </p>
      <p>
       Entry of possession by defendant pursuant to patent from state after tax sale to state, with actual knowledge of former owner, and continuance in possession for more than two years with payment of taxes on the land, established adverse possession as against the former owner, notwithstanding that the land was used during such period by neighbors for pasturage with consent of both the former owner and defendants. Webb v. Anderson, 206 Miss. 398, 40 So. 2d 189, 1949 Miss. LEXIS 270 (Miss. 1949).
      </p>
      <p>
       The former owner is not required to actually occupy the land in the meantime by residing thereon to have it in his possession and under his control in order to prevent the running of the two-year limitation against his right to have a tax title canceled. Smith v. Myrick, 201 Miss. 647, 29 So. 2d 924, 1947 Miss. LEXIS 434 (Miss. 1947).
      </p>
      <p>
       So long as the real owner of land is in possession, it would be unconstitutional for the legislature to require him to commence an action against anyone claiming through an invalid tax sale to the state. Hooper v. Walker, 201 Miss. 158, 29 So. 2d 72, 1947 Miss. LEXIS 381 (Miss. 1947).
      </p>
      <p>
       Whenever it is shown that former owner of land remained in possession thereof after sale for taxes, either in person or by tenant, then statute [Code 1942, § 717] does not apply and claim of title and possession of such owner can be defeated only by proof of a valid assessment, levy and sale, coupled with failure to redeem within time allowed by law. Byrd v. Byrd, 193 Miss. 249, 8 So. 2d 510, 1942 Miss. LEXIS 113 (Miss. 1942); Grant v. Montgomery, 193 Miss. 175, 5 So. 2d 491, 1942 Miss. LEXIS 79 (Miss. 1942); Russell Inv. Corp. v. Russell, 182 Miss. 411, 182 So. 102 (1938); White v. Noblin, 183 Miss. 92, 183 So. 914, 1938 Miss. LEXIS 220 (Miss. 1938).
      </p>
      <p>
       This statute of limitations [Code 1942, § 717] is wholly inapplicable to a case where, if the former owner does not remain in actual possession, there has been no adverse occupancy or possession by the purchaser at the tax sale, its patentee or his vendee for the period of limitations prescribed. Grant v. Montgomery, 193 Miss. 175, 5 So. 2d 491, 1942 Miss. LEXIS 79 (Miss. 1942).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where shortly after the first of two sales of property to the state for taxes the former owner moved therefrom, upon destruction of the building thereon by fire, and the property remained vacant, with neither the state nor its patentee taking possession, the statute of limitations did not bar one claiming under the former owner from bringing action more than two years after such sale to cancel as a cloud upon his title the tax sales and subsequent patents from the state because of defects in the tax sales rendering them void. Grant v. Montgomery, 193 Miss. 175, 5 So. 2d 491, 1942 Miss. LEXIS 79 (Miss. 1942).

      </h4>
      <p>
       Neither actual occupation, cultivation, nor residence are necessary to constitute actual possession when the property is so situated as not to admit any permanent useful improvement, and the continued claim of the party has been evidenced by public acts of ownership, such as he would exercise over property which he claimed in his own right, and would not exercise over property which he did not claim. Broadus v. Hickman, 210 Miss. 885, 50 So. 2d 717, 1951 Miss. LEXIS 323 (Miss. 1951).
      </p>
      <p>
       It is the rule that less notorious and obvious acts upon the land are essential to vest title in what are known as wild lands than lands suitable to occupancy by residing thereon and putting them to husbandry and farming. Broadus v. Hickman, 210 Miss. 885, 50 So. 2d 717, 1951 Miss. LEXIS 323 (Miss. 1951).
      </p>
      <p>
       Fact that patentee’s vendee of wild and uncultivated land sold to the state under void tax sale paid taxes on the land continuously for three or four years prior to the filing of suits by the former owners to determine title, gave a deed of trust thereon for each of such years, and went upon such lands in person or by agent and offered to sell some timber therefrom although no timber was actually sold, cut or removed did not constitute sufficient adverse possession to put the former owners on notice that their constructive possession of such land had been invaded, so that the two-year limitation period under this section [Code 1942, § 717] was not available to the vendee. Thompson v. Reed, 199 Miss. 129, 23 So. 2d 888, 1945 Miss. LEXIS 276 (Miss. 1945).

       A person in possession under a void instrument where its description is good, is in possession under a color of title and possession is extended from a part to the whole tract under this section [Code 1942, § 717]. Shepherd v. Mahannah, 220 F.2d 737, 1955 U.S. App. LEXIS 3410 (5th Cir. Miss. 1955).
      </p>
      <p>
       A person in possession of land under color of a tax-forfeited land patent acquires title thereto by the requisite exclusive adverse possession over a period of two years even though the tax deed be void. Shepherd v. Mahannah, 220 F.2d 737, 1955 U.S. App. LEXIS 3410 (5th Cir. Miss. 1955).
      </p>
      <p>
       A void tax deed may serve as color of title and be the basis of an adverse possessory claim. Carney v. Anderson, 214 Miss. 504, 58 So. 2d 13, 1952 Miss. LEXIS 494 (Miss. 1952).

      </p>

       Possession by mortgagee under void deed of trust and claim of color of title under a tax deed which failed to describe the land, with subsequent possession consisting of occupancy of the premises through the person who owned the land at the time of the purported tax sale, did not sustain defendant’s claim of adverse possession and owner was entitled to decree canceling such claim as cloud upon his title.

   In an action to cancel as a cloud on title a sale of property to the state in 1948 for 1947 taxes on minerals, the chancellor properly overruled the state’s demurrer where the demurrer admitted the complainant’s allegation that the 1948 tax sale had been invalid for failure to comply with the predecessor statute of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.27.html#t27c41s27-41-59" target="_blank">27-41-59</a></cite> requiring that the tax collector first offer the property in 40-acre tracts.

       The limitation provided for by this section [Code 1942, § 717] does not begin to run against the owner until his possession is invaded by some act of a claimant which amounts to an actual, hostile, adverse possession of the nature required by Code 1942, § 711, the ten years’ adverse statute.

       The period within which the real owner of land must commence an action against anyone claiming through an invalid tax sale to the state does not begin to run so long as the real owner is in possession either in person or by tenant.

       Adverse possession must be maintained continuously for the prescribed two-year period in order to bar the true owner under this section [Code 1942, § 717]. Leavenworth v. Claughton, 197 Miss. 606, 20 So. 2d 821, 1945 Miss. LEXIS 300 (Miss. 1945).

      <p>
       If this section [Code 1942, § 717] were not construed to require adverse possession on the part of the claimant before the limitation period began to run, but started the period running from the date of the sale, it would be unconstitutional. Leavenworth v. Claughton, 197 Miss. 606, 20 So. 2d 821, 1945 Miss. LEXIS 300 (Miss. 1945).

       The two-year period of limitation under this section [Code 1942, § 717] does not begin to run until possession of the true owner, whether actual or constructive, is invaded or disturbed by or through claimant under the alleged invalid tax sale by an invasion which amounts to actual, adverse possession.

       Where patentee of uncultivated, unenclosed, cut-over land sold to the state under an invalid tax sale, did nothing to arrest owner’s attention until she had the land surveyed less than two years prior to the filing by the owner of cross-bill challenging the tax sale, there was not sufficient adverse possession for two years necessary to extinguish owner’s right and title to the land under this section [Code 1942, § 717].

       Where a tax sale was void because the minutes of the Board of Supervisors were not read and approved when the board adjourned, the defect could have been cured under this section [Code 1942, § 717] by taking and holding possession of the land for two years. Parks v. Simmons, 52 So. 2d 14 (Miss. 1951).
      </p>

       The two-year limitation in this section [Code 1942, § 717] does not apply where the sale to the state is utterly void for want of description and consequently no tax deed to the land exists. Meyerkort v. Warrington, 19 So. 2d 433 (Miss. 1944).

       This section [Code 1942, § 717] is more than a mere statute limiting the time within which to bring an action to cancel the title of the state to land sold to it for taxes; for, on the expiration of the time limit in ¶ 1 hereof, it extinguishes all the rights in and to the land of any and all persons whatsoever.

      </h4>
      <p>
       This section [Code 1942, § 717] in no way affects the right of redemption as to land sold prior to its enactment; it simply limits the time within which an action can be brought by an owner of land sold to the state for taxes “to cancel the title of the state, or its patentees, or to recover said land from the state, or its patentees on account of any defect, irregularity or illegality in the assessment, levy or sale of such land for delinquent taxes” to two years after the statute became effective on April 4, 1934. Lee v. Smith, 189 Miss. 636, 198 So. 296, 1940 Miss. LEXIS 141 (Miss. 1940).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where § 3 of chapter 196, Laws 1934, approved April 4th, 1934, if applied to a case where a tax sale, had prior to the enactment thereof, on September 18, 1933, was void and at that time the owner had three years from the day of the sale in which to redeem, would extinguish such right of redemption at the expiration of two years from the date of sale, thereby cutting off five months, fourteen days from the time in which the owner could redeem it, and would be unconstitutional, such section is inoperative to that extent so that the right of the owner to redeem the land from the tax sale would be unaffected thereby; a constitutional defect in such section, as applied to such circumstances, does not render it wholly void but simply requires that its operation be so restricted as to preserve the right of redemption that existed when the land was sold for taxes. Lee v. Smith, 189 Miss. 636, 198 So. 296, 1940 Miss. LEXIS 141 (Miss. 1940).

       When the owner of land sold for taxes redeemed it therefrom, the chancery clerk, through whom the redemption must be made, was required to execute to him a release of all claim or title of the state or purchaser to such land, by virtue of which the tax sale from which the land was regained is without further efficacy and the owner’s title and right to possession do not rest on defects in the assessment or sale of the land so that the necessity for an action to cancel the title of the purchaser at the sale no longer exists.

      <p>
       The principle that only the state is entitled to have a patent canceled on the sole ground of the fraud committed upon its land commissioner in the procurement thereof, does not preclude the former owners of the land from having the patent canceled in their own right as a cloud upon their title on the separate ground that the tax sale to the state is void as having been made on a date not authorized by law; nor are such former owners prevented from proving the fraud and the notice thereof furnished in the application of the patentee or from emphasizing the grossly inadequate price paid to the state, as disclosed in the reported patent, in answer to a subsequent vendee’s contention that he is an innocent purchaser for value without notice. E. L. Bruce Co. v. Smallwood, 188 Miss. 771, 196 So. 227, 1940 Miss. LEXIS 67 (Miss. 1940).
      </p>
      <p>
       In an action by the owners of land to set aside a patent from the state based upon a sale for delinquent taxes and to cancel a conveyance from the patentee to another, the latter could not successfully maintain that it occupied the position of an innocent purchaser for value without notice, even in the absence of any notice, actual or constructive, of the fraud committed upon the state in procurement of the patent, where the tax sale itself, made on a date not authorized by law, disclosed that the state had acquired no title, and could not convey any by the patent issued to such purchaser’s vendor. E. L. Bruce Co. v. Smallwood, 188 Miss. 771, 196 So. 227, 1940 Miss. LEXIS 67 (Miss. 1940).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where land was sold for delinquent taxes on August 1st, 1932, the court would not inquire into the validity of the tax sale in an action to cancel the sale brought in 1939, since such inquiry would necessitate a decision on the merits, which was the very thing the statute intended to cut off, the only exceptions thereto recognized by the statute being the actual payment of the taxes on the land prior to its sale therefor.

      When a mortgagee, after condition broken, shall obtain the actual possession or receipt of the profits or rent of land embraced in his mortgage, the mortgagor, or any person claiming through him, may not bring a suit to redeem the mortgage except within ten years next after the time at which the mortgagee obtained such possession or receipt, unless in the meantime an acknowledgment of the title of the mortgagor, or of his right of redemption, shall have been given in writing, signed by the mortgagee, or the person claiming through him. In such case a suit may not be brought except within ten years next after the time at which such acknowledgment, or the last of such acknowledgments, if more than one, was given. Such acknowledgment shall be effectual only as against, and to the extent of the interest of the party signing it.

       Where mortgagee was in possession of realty for more than ten years but did not invade the actual and constructive possession of his wife in order to create duty on her part to commence an action for protection of her rights as owner during the occupancy of the mortgagee, the mortgagee acquired no title under this section.

       An instrument executed by a debtor was an assignment, rather than an equitable mortgage barred by the statute of limitations, where there was no note secured by the mortgage which could be barred by the statute of limitations. Gillis v. Case, 574 So. 2d 692, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 810 (Miss. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the father remained in possession of land, which he had conveyed by warranty deed to a son in 1937 allegedly as security for an indebtedness, and exercised complete dominion over the land until his death, and thereafter the father’s heirs retained possession of the land, and dealt with it as part of the father’s estate until 1951, an action by the heirs in 1956 against the son to establish a resulting trust for the benefit of the heirs was not barred by the statutory limitations imposed by this section [Code 1942, § 719] and §§ 709 and 718, Code of 1942. Trigg v. Trigg, 233 Miss. 84, 101 So. 2d 507, 1958 Miss. LEXIS 360 (Miss. 1958).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where in 1931 a deed of trust on certain land was issued to a bank as security for a loan, and later that land was sold at a tax sale and not redeemed, in 1939 the bank’s remedy at law to recover the debt was barred by statute of limitations and direct remedy in equity was likewise barred. State v. Magnolia Bank, 212 Miss. 47, 53 So. 2d 79, 1951 Miss. LEXIS 426 (Miss. 1951).
      </p>
      <p>
       The rule that even where the debt secured by a mortgage is barred by the statute of limitations, the mortgagee cannot be deprived of possession by the mortgagor until the debt is paid does not apply in an action by a bank against the state to quiet title where the rights of the bank under a deed of trust were barred by the statute of limitations at the time the bank acquired a tax forfeited land patent and the patent was void. State v. Magnolia Bank, 212 Miss. 47, 53 So. 2d 79, 1951 Miss. LEXIS 426 (Miss. 1951).

       The limitation period for the enforcement of a deed of trust was not tolled by the fact that the defendant continued to make 74 monthly payments after the balloon payment on the promissory note became due since such payments did not unequivocally acknowledge when the balance was due, to whom the balance was due, and for what the balance was due, and, moreover, such payments did not contain a specification of the debt referred to and a promise to pay a fixed amount.

       The most reasonable interpretation of the statute was that the sale of all property securing a note had to be completed to trigger the statute of limitations; accordingly, where the notes’ cross-collateralization clause ensured that all eight notes were secured by all eight trucks, the statutory one-year limitations period began only after the creditor sold all the trucks, and thus, the creditor’s suit seeking a deficiency judgment was timely filed. Volvo Fin. Servs. v. Williamson, 910 F.3d 208, 2018 U.S. App. LEXIS 34290 (5th Cir. Miss. 2018).

   The emphasis of the one-year statute of limitations for actions brought against “any installment note” under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-23" target="_self">15-1-23</a></cite>, is on notes secured by a mortgage or deed of trust which has been foreclosed. The import of the statute’s language, “upon any installment note, or a series of notes three or more, whether due or not,” is that the statute of limitations begins to run after the foreclosure and not on the due date of any portion of the note or the due date of any note of a series of 3 or more.

      <p>
       The words “series of notes” as employed in this section, mean multiple notes given in a single transaction and for the same consideration, and without regard for their several maturity dates. Thus, in an action by a bank against the makers and endorsers of a note in the amount of $300,000, the trial court erred in dismissing the action upon a plea of the statute of limitations where the action involved two separate notes of $150,000 each given at different times and two other notes, one for $150,000 to renew the first note and one for $300,000 to renew and consolidate both original notes. Peoples Bank & Trust Co. v. Kinsey, 385 So. 2d 615, 1980 Miss. LEXIS 2026 (Miss. 1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section [Code 1942, § 720] was not applicable to an action which involved only two notes, neither of which was an installment note. Rivervalley Co. v. Deposit Guaranty Nat'l Bank, 331 F. Supp. 698, 1971 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12606 (N.D. Miss. 1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       A replevin action asserted by a vendor under a conditional sales contract is not a foreclosure and thus does not set the one year statute of limitations in motion. Paul O'Leary Lumber Corp. v. Mill Equipment, Inc., 332 F. Supp. 1144, 1970 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11009 (S.D. Miss. 1970), aff'd, 448 F.2d 536, 1971 U.S. App. LEXIS 8001 (5th Cir. Miss. 1971).

       A suit for a deficiency judgment on a promissory note instituted more than one year after the date of the sale of the property securing the same was barred by this section [Code 1942, § 720]. Guthrie v. Merchants Nat'l Bank, 254 Miss. 532, 180 So. 2d 309, 1965 Miss. LEXIS 964 (Miss. 1965).
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that the contract from which the suit for a deficiency judgment arose was executed in another state by residents of that state and that the subject property was located there was immaterial; for the lex fori controlled rather than lex loci contractus, and the applicable limitations statute was that of Mississippi. Guthrie v. Merchants Nat'l Bank, 254 Miss. 532, 180 So. 2d 309, 1965 Miss. LEXIS 964 (Miss. 1965).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section [Code 1942, § 720] is not applicable to bar an action to collect on a deficiency judgment where the judgment was obtained before the passage of this act and the case involved an action based on that judgment and not upon a note. Roebke v. Love, 186 Miss. 609, 191 So. 122, 1939 Miss. LEXIS 238 (Miss. 1939).

       The purpose of this section [Code 1942, § 720] was to alleviate distressed mortgage debtors and to discourage foreclosure of mortgages during the depression. Lewis v. Simpson, 176 Miss. 123, 167 So. 780, 1936 Miss. LEXIS 115 (Miss. 1936).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section [Code 1942, § 720] is applicable only to suit on note secured by mortgage which has been foreclosed and is not applicable to suit on a note secured by another mortgage on the same realty which has not been foreclosed. Lewis v. Simpson, 176 Miss. 123, 167 So. 780, 1936 Miss. LEXIS 115 (Miss. 1936).

   Section<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-25" target="_self">15-1-25</a></cite>, which specifically states that a suit against an executor or administrator must be filed within 4 years of the qualification of the executor or administrator, is an example of the legislature carving out a specific statute of limitations period in order to preempt the general 6-year limitations, and therefore the specific statute of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-25" target="_self">15-1-25</a></cite> preempts the general statute of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-49" target="_self">15-1-49</a></cite>. Townsend v. Estate of Gilbert, 616 So. 2d 333, 1993 Miss. LEXIS 112 (Miss. 1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 15-1-25 is not unconstitutional as violative of equal protection in that it provides only 4 years in which to file a claim against an estate while other tort victims have the benefit of the general 6-year statute of limitations, since the legislature’s interest in finality with respect to estates is a legitimate governmental interest and the statute of limitations is a rational means of serving that specific interest. Townsend v. Estate of Gilbert, 616 So. 2d 333, 1993 Miss. LEXIS 112 (Miss. 1993).

       The statute [Code 1942, § 725] runs without regard to the publication for creditors to probate their claims. Sivley v. Summers, 57 Miss. 712, 1880 Miss. LEXIS 44 (Miss. 1880).

       This section [Code 1942, § 725], and not the one-year period fixed by Code 1942, § 610, governs an action against an estate for decedent’s negligence. Jones v. Evans, 247 Miss. 285, 156 So. 2d 742, 1963 Miss. LEXIS 299 (Miss. 1963).

       Statute of limitations, whether general or special, does not run in favor of executor or administrator with respect to claims for legacies or distributive shares until there is a final settlement or at least a disavowal of the trust. Bailey v. Sayle, 206 Miss. 757, 40 So. 2d 618, 1949 Miss. LEXIS 298 (Miss. 1949).
      </p>
      <p>
       Legatee’s suit for accounting, brought more than 27 years after testatrix’ death, was not barred by statute of limitations as against executor named in will, who took charge of estate without issuance of letters or notice to creditors and who had never filed any inventory, report, account, or other paper or pleading in court, and had never been discharged from his trust.

       A proceeding to subject a decedent’s estate to the payment of the balance due on funeral expenses is not barred by the four-year statute of limitations, since such statute applies only to obligations incurred by the decedent in his lifetime, and the statute of limitations does not run against funeral expenses which are a part of the cost of the administration of the estate as long as the estate is open. Tom E. Taylor Undertaking Co. v. Smith's Estate, 183 Miss. 45, 183 So. 391, 1938 Miss. LEXIS 214 (Miss. 1938).

       Statute of limitations did not prevent the chancery court from correcting a fraud upon the court because a guardian’s initiation of a suit to reopen the guardianship in order to investigate an attorney and determine the whereabouts of guardianship money was sufficient to toll the statutes of limitations; the guardian’s petition to reopen the guardianship and to be reappointed the guardian was also an act by the ward since it was on his behalf, and i twas filed within the five-year period.

   After a guardianship account was drained, the twenty-four-year-old ward sued the bank for breaching its duty by allowing the funds on deposit to be converted without a court order; the claim was barred by the three-year statute of limitations set forth in Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-49" target="_self">15-1-49</a></cite>, because it was not filed three years after he turned twenty-one. The bank was not a surety; therefore, Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-27" target="_self">15-1-27</a></cite> was not the applicable statute of limitations. Williams v.

   In a probate proceeding based upon an oral contract whereby the decedent promised to bequeath to the claimant a parcel of real property in return for a loan of $11,000, the cause of action for breach of the oral contract arising out of the failure of the will to be admitted to probate did not arise until the death of the decedent; therefore, where the claim for probate was filed within three months of the decedent’s death, it was not barred by the three-year statute of limitations for all contracts set forth in §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-29" target="_self">15-1-29</a></cite>.

       Six-year period of limitations applicable to all actions for which no other period is prescribed held applicable to action against stockholders of insolvent bank for their double liability, and not three-year period applicable to actions on unwritten contracts, since double liability of a stockholder is provable by writing, and therefore is not an implied contract, but written contract with an implied promise to pay.

       Mortgagee’s action against parties cashing check on unauthorized indorsement for award in condemnation proceeding was barred by three-year statute, since action was based on the canceled check with the indorsements of the parties on the back thereof, there being no implied promise to pay deducible from the instrument itself.

       Where land subject to mortgage was foreclosed and the former owner induced another to purchase it from the mortgagee who had purchased it at the foreclosure sale under an oral agreement to repurchase, former owner could not, after default, defend action to cancel his claims to the land by setting up either the three- or six-year statutes of limitation, since under the circumstances nothing but adverse possession for ten years could avail him. Gentry v. Gamblin, 79 Miss. 437, 28 So. 809, 1901 Miss. LEXIS 4 (Miss. 1901).

   A statute is penal in character within the purview of this section [Code 1942, § 731] when its controlling purpose is to impose a punishment for violation of its provisions.

   Law of the forum determines whether or not an action or suit is one to recover a “penalty” within the purview of this section [Code 1942, § 731]. Southern Package Corp. v.

       Trial court abused its discretion in determining that an estate waived its statute-of-limitations defense because the estate did not participate actively “all the while” during the delay in the litigation process, and the delay was reasonable, given a will contest.

       Tolling provision of the Mississippi Tort Claims Act (MTCA) statute of limitations does not toll the separate statute of limitations applicable to non-MTCA defamation claims.

   Arrestee’s intentional infliction of emotional distress claim against a police officer was time barred under the one-year limitations period in Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-35" target="_self">15-1-35</a></cite> where the incident underlying the cause of action occurred well over one year before the arrestee filed suit until June 17, 2005.

   Because there was repeated wrongful conduct by defendant attorney, the continuing tort doctrine applied, and the trial court did not err in tolling the statute of limitations until the date of the divorce decree. Therefore, a former husband/client’s claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress for the adulteress affair between the attorney and the husband’s former wife was filed within the applicable one-year statute of limitations under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-35" target="_self">15-1-35</a></cite>. Pierce v. Cook, 992 So. 2d 612, 2008 Miss. LEXIS 398 (Miss. 2008).

      <p>
       Where borrowers signed a loan agreement in 1995 and brought suit against the lender in 2001, claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress, which was subject to the one-year statute of limitations, was time-barred because the intentional act that formed the basis of the claim involved the alleged misrepresentations or omissions made in 1995, at the time of the execution of the loan agreement. CitiFinancial Mortg. Co. v. Washington, 967 So. 2d 16, 2007 Miss. LEXIS 590 (Miss. 2007).

   In a Title VII racial discrimination case in which the complained-of actions took place in 2004 and the employee’s suit was filed in 2006, any intentional infliction of emotional distress claim was barred by the statute of limitations in Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-35" target="_self">15-1-35</a></cite>. Furthermore, any state tort claim grounded in negligence asserted by the employee would be barred by the exclusive remedy provision of the Mississippi Workers’ Compensation Law. Fortenberry v.

       Customer’s claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress related to claims for defamation, invasion of privacy, or fraud; as with his claim for invasion of privacy, the customer alleged his claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress more than a year later, and therefore his claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress was barred. Hudson v. Palmer, 977 So. 2d 369, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 580 (Miss. Ct. App. 2007), cert. denied, 977 So. 2d 343, 2008 Miss. LEXIS 95 (Miss. 2008).

   Employee’s claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress against her supervisor was barred by Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-35" target="_self">15-1-35</a></cite> because the evidence indicated that the last instance of the supervisor’s conduct occurred on September 10, 2001, and the employee did not file her complaint until January 2003.

   Employee’s claim for the intentional infliction of emotional distress was barred by the one-year limitation of the statute of limitations, Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-35" target="_self">15-1-35</a></cite> and the continuing tort doctrine did not apply because the harm alleged reverberated from one wrongful act. Bellum v. PCE Constructors Inc., 407 F.3d 734, 2005 U.S. App. LEXIS 7056 (5th Cir. Miss. 2005), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">546 U.S. 1139</cite>, <cite class="s_court">126 S.

      </p>
      <p>
       The limitation period on actions for assault and battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress is one year and trial court did not err in dismissing action raising claims under those theories where plaintiff’s complaint was not received in the mail by the trial court clerk until more than one year following the incident giving rise to the alleged causes of action. Slaydon v. Hansford, 830 So. 2d 686, 2002 Miss. App. LEXIS 477 (Miss. Ct. App. 2002), overruled,
   Blake v. Estate of Clein, 37 So.3d 622, 2010 Miss. LEXIS 322 (Miss. 2010).
      </p>
      <p>
       Even assuming that the statute applied to the plaintiff’s action for intentional infliction of emotional distress, the action was commenced in a timely manner where the defendant’s wrongful conduct began in August 1994, with the first commitment proceeding, and continued until September 1997, with the culmination of the second commitment proceeding, and the complaint was filed just seven months after the second commitment application was filed; further, though the first commitment hearing and its related subsequent events prior to the second commitment hearing occurred outside the limitation period, the violation was closely related to the violations occurring within the limitation period and recovery was permitted on the theory that all violations were part of one continuing act.

       Administrator’s actions alleging wrongful death, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and civil conspiracy were all barred by the one-year statute of limitations, and the discovery rule did not apply because all three of these actions had prescribed limitations periods.

       Circuit court properly granted an employer’s motion to dismiss–an employee’s action for assault, battery, intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress, and breach of an employment contract as untimely because, while the employee was underage when employer allegedly began to sexually abuse her, she failed to show that, when her employer allegedly sexually abused her, she was of unsound mind, legal infancy, suffered a latent injury, or that there was something secretive or inherently undiscoverable about the alleged acts or wrongdoing, the discovery rule was inapplicable where the alleged wrongful acts were physical and the employee was aware of the wrongdoing when it happened.

       Secretive nature of extra-marital affairs rendered plaintiff wife’s injuries latent such that the discovery rule applied to her alienation of affection and negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress claims against her husband’s extramarital partner so factual issues remained as to the date she discovered the affair.

   In a patient’s negligence action, in granting the motion to amend the complaint four years after the initial suit to add the health care provider as a new party, it appeared obvious that the new “fraudulent concealment” argument was advanced as a “savings” option, because without it the statute of limitation on negligence actions would have barred any action; because the trial court erred in granting the motion to amend the complaint, the issue of whether or not the amended complaint would relate back became moot.

   The 2-year medical malpractice statute of limitations, set forth in §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-36" target="_self">15-1-36</a></cite>, applied to a situation where a nurse failed to raise the rails of a bed for a patient under heavy sedation, resulting in the patient falling out of the bed and being injured. A nurse’s decision as to whether bedrails should be utilized entails a degree of knowledge concerning the patient’s condition, medication, and history. The rails themselves are but another instrumentality by which the safety of patients may be insured. This plainly calls for the rendition of a medical or professional service, thus the medical malpractice statute of limitations applies to such a situation. Bell v.

Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-36" target="_self">15-1-36</a></cite> since the patient was aware of an injury arising out of the prescription of certain drugs after his discharge from a hospital in 2001, and this discovery rule was different than the latent injury focus in Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-49" target="_self">15-1-49</a></cite>. Sutherland v. Estate of Ritter, 959 So. 2d 1004, 2007 Miss. LEXIS 226 (Miss. 2007).

   Circuit court properly denied the doctors’ motion for summary judgment on the wife’s wrongful death claim where, pursuant to the discovery rule, Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-36ol12" target="_self">15-1-36(2)</a></cite>, certain information about the husband’s condition were not given to the wife, and the wife acted diligently by trusting the doctors and waiting over two years before requesting the husband’s medical records.

   Medical malpractice case was not barred by the two-year statute of limitations under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-36" target="_self">15-1-36</a></cite> because the discovery rule applied where a patient visited a physician eight different times after surgery to complain about pain and loss of function in her hand; a subsequent surgery by a specialist revealed a nerve wrapped around a screw in the patient’s arm; the patient’s actions showed that she was diligent in discovering the source of her problem. Flores v. Elmer, 938 So. 2d 824, 2006 Miss. LEXIS 471 (Miss. 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Because a patient knew of her injury the date her exploratory surgery occurred, the discovery rule did not apply to toll the running of the statute of limitations in Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-36" target="_self">15-1-36</a></cite>. Joiner v. Phillips, 953 So. 2d 1123, 2006 Miss. App. LEXIS 649 (Miss. Ct. App. 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a medical malpractice case, the patient’s late knowledge of the “specifics” of his injuries, based on information provided by a subsequent examining doctor, was insufficient to toll running of the two-year statute of limitation, where the record showed he had been well aware of pain, swelling, and numbness at the site of the surgery, and he had failed to engage in due diligence to discover the causative relationship between injury and the operating physician’s conduct. Thus, summary judgment for the physician was proper. Simpson v. Lovelace, 892 So. 2d 284, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 1007 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the plaintiff did not file suit until more than two years after her husband’s death, the statute of limitations was tolled until she was able to secure her husband’s medical records, since she exercised reasonable diligence in getting those records and could not reasonably have been expected to know of the defendant’s tortious conduct without the records.

   The accrual of a medical malpractice action against a surgeon was not affected by the surgeon’s instructing a nurse that her operative record was incorrect and needed changing, or by the surgeon’s failure to inform the plaintiff’s counsel during discovery of this conversation with the nurse, and thus the action was barred by §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-36" target="_self">15-1-36</a></cite>, where there was no showing that the surgeon’s actions prevented the plaintiff’s counsel from discovering all of the surgeon’s conduct in his treatment of the patient.

       Despite the different notice requirements in the statute and the Mississippi Tort Claims Act, a daughter did not have to file different wrongful death lawsuits at different times because she could have waited until the earliest she could have filed all her claims and still comply with the statute’s pre-suit notice requirement and the two-year statute of limitations; the daughter’s notice served to toll the statute of limitations, and she had an additional ninety days to file suit.

       In a medical malpractice suit, the trial court properly denied summary judgment to defendant doctor based on the two-year statute of limitations because defendant’s denial of participation in the patient’s treatment could have constituted fraudulent concealment and ought to have tolled the statute of limitations until plaintiffs learned that an issue of fact existed regarding defendant’s involvement.

   The filing of a medical malpractice complaint within the 2-year limitation period provided in §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-36" target="_self">15-1-36</a></cite> commenced the action and tolled the statute of limitations, even though process was not issued or obtained on the defendants until 105 days later.

       In a medical malpractice action arising from the defendant’s alleged negligence in performing a tubal ligation, an amendment stating a claim for breach of an oral guarantee that the patient would not become pregnant related back to the date of the original complaint and was therefore not barred by the statute of limitations, since her claim sounded in tort, it arose out of the same occurrence, and the defendant was put on notice. Hudson v. Parvin, 582 So. 2d 403, 1991 Miss. LEXIS 363 (Miss. 1991).

       The trial court erred in ruling that the statute of limitations barred a medical malpractice action commenced in March 1980 where the defendant did not diagnose the plaintiff’s cancer until May 1978 and there was nothing in the record to indicate that the plaintiff could have known or discovered her cancer by the exercise of reasonable diligence before that time.

       In a medical negligence case, the trial court erred in denying the employer’s and the employees’ motions to dismiss as the administratix of the decedent’s estate did not comply with the presuit notice requirements in this statute because this statute required each defendant to receive presuit notice, even if there was an employer-employee relationship among defendants; strict compliance with this statute was required, and the failure to satisfy the requirements mandated dismissal without prejudice; and the legislature did not provide an exception that notice to an employer would satisfy the need to notify any employees of the impending suit.

       Even if a daughter’s complaint was timely, it was not preceded by the mandatory sixty days’ pre-suit notice because the daughter filed her pre-suit notice the same day she filed her medical malpractice suit; thus, at a minimum, the daughter’s failure to satisfy the pre-suit notice requirement mandated dismissal without prejudice.

       Where the chancery court approved the sale of the first parcel of the ward’s land in 1994 and approved the sale of the remaining acres of the ward’s land in 1998, and the petition to set aside these deeds was not filed until 2004, after the ward passed away, without question the petition to set aside the deeds fell outside of the statute of limitations; however, both the conservatorship and the subsequent land sales were correctly deemed invalid by the lower court because procedural requirements were not met, and thus the statute of limitations did not apply.

       In a suit to set aside a final decree confirming a sale of land by a special commissioner for division of proceeds in a partition suit, the trial court erred in sustaining both a special demurrer raising the affirmative defenses of limitations of actions, laches and bona fide purchaser for value, and a motion to dismiss raising the affirmative defenses of res judicata, laches and estoppel, where none of the facts upon which the special demurrer and motion to dismiss could dependably rest had been averred in the complaint. Complainants’ affirmative allegations that one or more of them had been in possession since the sale and that none of them had accepted the proceeds of the partition sale also raised a question of fact to be determined upon proof.

       The fact that the widow and adopted daughter of an intestate were not parties to a proceeding against the administratrix to foreclose a deed of trust on realty constituting a part of the estate, did not save them from the bar of the statute, since they were not necessary parties where the estate had been declared insolvent, the realty was in the possession of the administratrix, who was also the widow of the decedent but was made a party only as administratrix, and the daughter advised her regarding the foreclosure matters.

   Beneficiaries’ action was not purely and exclusively equitable and they sought no equitable relief and did not seek to impose a constructive trust; the beneficiaries sought purely legal relief, namely compensatory and punitive money damages, such that the cause of action and the remedy of the case were not purely and exclusively equitable and the chancellor did not err in applying the general six-year statute of limitations of Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-49" target="_self">15-1-49</a></cite>. Winters v. AmSouth Bank, 964 So. 2d 595, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 582 (Miss. Ct. App. 2007).

However, the application of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-39" target="_self">15-1-39</a></cite> is limited in that the cause of action and the remedy of the case must be purely and exclusively equitable or the general 6-year statute of limitations will be applied.

   In an action seeking to compel a perfect inventory, void certain conveyances, partition property, and establish a claim against an estate, the chancellor improperly sustained a plea of the statute of limitations §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-39" target="_self">15-1-39</a></cite> as to a trust, where there was no proof to support the same.

       The delivery by a donor to a bank in trust of certain promissory notes secured by mortgage notwithstanding the bank’s incapacity to act as trustee, and the subsequent assumption by the donor of the note and actions in connection therewith for the benefit of the beneficiary constituted a trust in regard to the notes and their intended security not cognizable by the courts of common law within the purview of the ten-year statute of limitations, so that an action brought within ten years against the donor’s executors for loss of such notes by his unauthorized act was not barred.

       Bequest providing that devisees should deliver to widow annually 1 bale of cotton, was not a trust within this section [Code 1942, § 746], since the implied promise to deliver such cotton constituted a contract, and suit for breach must be brought within 6 years.

       Since a vendor could have brought an action at law for the purchase money, his action to enforce his lien did not rest upon the existence of a trust not cognizable by the courts of the common law, and, accordingly, this section [Code 1942, § 746] was not applicable.

       Where a deceased legal guardian of her son who is non compos mentis used the proceeds from sale of property of the ward, to purchase land in her own name, this did not create an express trust in favor of her ward and a suit commenced more than thirty-one years after the purchase, that being the time when the cause of action arose, was barred by the statute of limitations.

       Where it appeared that on the death of one partner, the surviving partner agreed to hold the shares of two of the decedent’s heirs as an active trust for their benefit until demand was made by them for payment of the principal, that all of the parties to the agreement had died and the estate of the surviving partner had been administered, with due notice given to creditors, a bill by the heirs of the heirs of the first deceased partner, seeking a money decree from the administratrix and beneficiaries of the surviving partner more than twenty-one years after the making of the agreement and more than ten years after the death of the beneficiaries, was barred by this statutory limitation.

       § 15-1-41.
    Limitations applicable to actions arising from deficiencies in constructions, or improvements to real property.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      No action may be brought to recover damages for injury to property, real or personal, or for an injury to the person, arising out of any deficiency in the design, planning, supervision or observation of construction, or construction of an improvement to real property, and no action may be brought for contribution or indemnity for damages sustained on account of such injury except by prior written agreement providing for such contribution or indemnity, against any person, firm or corporation performing or furnishing the design, planning, supervision of construction or construction of such improvement to real property more than six (6) years after the written acceptance or actual occupancy or use, whichever occurs first, of such improvement by the owner thereof. This limitation shall apply to actions against persons, firms and corporations performing or furnishing the design, planning, supervision of construction or construction of such improvement to real property for the State of Mississippi or any agency, department, institution or political subdivision thereof as well as for any private or nongovernmental entity.
     </p>
     <p>
      This limitation shall not apply to any person, firm or corporation in actual possession and control as owner, tenant or otherwise of the improvement at the time the defective and unsafe condition of such improvement causes injury.
     </p>
     <p>
      This limitation shall not apply to actions for wrongful death.
     </p>
     <p>
      The provisions of this section shall only apply to causes of action accruing from and after January 1, 1986; and any cause of action accruing prior to January 1, 1986, shall be governed by Chapter 350, Laws of 1972.

   Six-year limitation of Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-41" target="_self">15-1-41</a></cite> is not affected by the date of accrual, and by extension not tolled by Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-67" target="_self">15-1-67</a></cite>; therefore, summary judgment was properly granted to a builder and a manufacturer in a property damage case arising from leaky roofs on chicken houses where a lawsuit was not filed until 2004, despite the fact that the leaks began shortly after completion in 1995 or 1996. Windham v. Latco of Miss., Inc., 972 So. 2d 652, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 49 (Miss. Ct. App. 2007), rev'd, 972 So. 2d 608, 2008 Miss. LEXIS 44 (Miss. 2008).

       Concealment statute does not affect the statute of repose as the statute of repose operates independently of causes of action and by its nature bars hidden claims and accruals of causes of action are irrelevant to its operation.

Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-41" target="_self">15-1-41</a></cite>; therefore, summary judgment was properly granted to defendant builders because the plaintiff owner’s argument that a roof was a mere repair was without merit.

       Purpose of statute of repose for actions to recover damages for injuries arising out of any deficiency in construction of improvement to real property is to provide repose protection to parties such as architects, contractors, and engineers who are engaged in construction business.

       <p>
   The amended 6-year version of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-41" target="_self">15-1-41</a></cite> did not bar all actions based on injuries occurring after January 1, 1986, if acceptance of the work occurred prior to January 1, 1980, which would have eliminated the then existing exposure for work accepted between January 1, 1976 and December 31, 1979.

   Contention that, even if §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-41" target="_self">15-1-41</a></cite> supported summary judgment, it supported only partial summary judgment because section does not apply to all of party’s claims, lacked merit, as express language of section states that “no action” may be brought more than 6 years after occupancy of building which houses defective product. Trust Co. Bank v. United States Gypsum Co., 950 F.2d 1144, 1992 U.S. App. LEXIS 569 (5th Cir. Miss. 1992).
      </p>

       Section 15-1-41 is much broader than most statutes of repose. Trust Co. Bank v. United States Gypsum Co., 950 F.2d 1144, 1992 U.S. App. LEXIS 569 (5th Cir. Miss. 1992).
      </p>

   Occupancy or acceptance of the building or improvement made thereon is required as the beginning point for the tolling of the statute of limitations set forth in §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-41" target="_self">15-1-41</a></cite>.

       <p>
   Since §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-41" target="_self">15-1-41</a></cite> does not define words “improvement to real property,” they must be given their ordinary meaning, which is permanent addition that increases value of property and makes it more useful; suit by employee injured while attempting to climb down caged ladder was barred by 10-year statute of limitations, where ladder was integral part of building, providing means of moving from one level to another, was permanently affixed, and added value to refinery, and therefore was improvement to real property.

      <p>
       Section 15-1-41, which limits the time within which an action may be brought to recover damages for injuries arising from the design or construction of an “improvement to real property,” does not violate the constitutional guarantee of equal protection, even though it does not apply to actions for wrongful death but applies to all other actions for damages caused by negligent construction.

      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   It is not unconstitutional to allow wrongful death plaintiffs a better statute of limitations than that applied to personal injury plaintiffs under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-41" target="_self">15-1-41</a></cite>.

       Section 15-1-41 does not violate the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment on the basis that it limits actions against architects and contractors but excludes similarly situated persons such as owners and suppliers.

       In a suit brought by appellants against appellees for damages to appellants’ property based on fraudulent concealment of a gully on the property, which began forming sinkholes as a result of the fill material beginning to decay and causing damage to the property, fraudulent concealment was not properly pled and the statute of repose was not tolled because appellees’ act of filling the gully with the material which had been previously taken out of the land was done at the request of the original property owners; there was no subsequent act made in an effort by appellees to conceal any purported wrongdoing; and there was no evidence showing that appellees attempted to mask their actions or prevent discovery of their actions.

Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.83.html#t83c58s83-58-1" target="_blank">83-58-1</a></cite> et seq., was not subject to Miss.

   When homeowners and a builder entered into an agreement purportedly tolling limitations periods applicable to the homeowners’ claims against the builder for structural defects in the homeowners’ home, the homeowners’ common-law claims were time-barred because (1) the claims fell under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-41" target="_self">15-1-41</a></cite>’s statute of repose, and (2) Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-5" target="_self">15-1-5</a></cite> barred contracts to change a limitations period. Townes v. Rusty Ellis Builder, Inc., 98 So.3d 1046, 2012 Miss.

       <p>
   Based on a review of the language of the statute, as well as the direction given by the state supreme court, the statute of repose did not commence until the builder was no longer in possession of the house. The builder sold the home to the homeowners on February 17, 1997, within six years of the filing of the complaint on February 12, 2003; therefore, the homeowners’ claims were not barred by the six-year statute of repose found in Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-41" target="_self">15-1-41</a></cite>. J. Criss Builder, Inc. v. White, 35 So.3d 541, 2009 Miss. App. LEXIS 698 (Miss. Ct.

   In the homeowners’ suit for water damage, the Supreme Court of Mississippi held that a windows manufacturer was not covered by the six-year statute of repose set forth at Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-41" target="_self">15-1-41</a></cite> as an entity which designed or planned the construction of an improvement to real property.

Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-67" target="_self">15-1-67</a></cite>, the application of Miss.

   Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-41" target="_self">15-1-41</a></cite> is not barred if fraudulent concealment is known, or with due diligence could have been discovered, within a six-year repose period. This holding balances the denial of repose protection to architects, contractors, and engineers who engage in fraudulent concealment, while requiring plaintiffs to exercise due diligence in pursuing their causes of action.

      <p>
       Trial court erred in dismissing the homeowners’ claims that the original owners knew of the alleged defects in a home at the time they sold it to the subsequent owners based on the statute of repose as the claim was for misrepresentation as to the home’s condition, not for any defective design, and thus the statute of repose did not apply. Estes v. Bradley, 954 So. 2d 455, 2006 Miss. App. LEXIS 912 (Miss. Ct. App. 2006), overruled in part, Windham v. Latco of Miss., Inc., 972 So. 2d 608, 2008 Miss. LEXIS 44 (Miss. 2008).

   County board of supervisors and engineers were not entitled to dismissal of landowners’ claims for damages allegedly sustained as a result of the board’s and engineers’ negligence more than six years earlier in reviewing and approving the subdivision map for a subdivision that flooded, on the ground that the claims were barred by the statute of repose set forth in Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-41" target="_self">15-1-41</a></cite>, because a subdivision map did not constitute an improvement to real property and, thus, these functions were not covered by the statute of repose.

       Motorist struck by passenger train could not maintain negligence claim based on elevated nature of crossing, as crossing had been in existence for at least 29 years such that statute of repose barred any claim based on negligent design, and even if motorist could not see oncoming vehicular traffic, road had ample room for passing cars to cross tracks simultaneously such that elevated crossing did nothing to prevent motorist from seeing oncoming train.

       For purposes of Mississippi statute of repose related to actions involving improvements to real property, original manufacturer of “calendar” used in tire making process was not entity that performed or furnished “design, planning, supervision of construction, or construction” of improvement to real property, and thus was not entitled to benefit of statute.

   In an action for injuries to a plaintiff employee allegedly caused by the defendant’s negligent design and construction of a walkway at a paper mill sold by the defendant to the plaintiff’s employer, the 10-year statute of repose of former §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-41" target="_self">15-1-41</a></cite> applied, rather than the 6-year limitation of the 1985 amendment to §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-41" target="_self">15-1-41</a></cite>, since the cause of action “accrued” when the employer accepted the mill from the defendant in 1984, not in 1992 when the plaintiff’s injury occurred.

   By express language, §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-41" target="_self">15-1-41</a></cite> extends repose protection to any person furnishing design, planning, supervision of construction or construction of improvement to real property, including manufacturers who furnish design for improvements to real property; thus it protects company in instant case which designed and manufactured fire-proofing materials which contained asbestos, which materials were included in building owned by plaintiff, where plaintiff brought action to recover cost of asbestos abatement program. Trust Co. Bank v. United States Gypsum Co., 950 F.2d 1144, 1992 U.S. App. LEXIS 569 (5th Cir. Miss. 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       Fire-proofing materials, designed and manufactured by defendant, which contained asbestos, and which were incorporated and used in building constructed for plaintiff, constitute improvement to real property within customary meaning of such term; common definitions of term generally refer to permanent addition which increases value of property and makes it more useful, and there is little doubt that fire-proofing materials increased value of bank building and made it more useful. Trust Co. Bank v. United States Gypsum Co., 950 F.2d 1144, 1992 U.S. App. LEXIS 569 (5th Cir. Miss. 1992).

       Heat exchanger unit fell within statutory language of “improvement to real property,” as part of petroleum refinery; although factual considerations may be involved in determining whether article of property is improvement to real property, such considerations did not constitute genuine issue of material fact to preclude summary judgment in this case.

       <p>
   The ten-year limitation period of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-41" target="_self">15-1-41</a></cite> does not apply to a builder/owner of premises in which a defective or unsafe condition is subsequently found, since the builder who is also the owner necessarily has equal access to control over the defective condition.

   A home builder’s potential exposure to a suit for negligence or breach of implied warranty in the construction of a home continues for 10 years under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-41" target="_self">15-1-41</a></cite>, since the removal of the requirement of privity between builder and purchaser to maintain a viable cause of action prevents that statute of limitations from being gratuitously shortened in the case of a first purchaser selling the home to a third party.

       § 15-1-43.
    Limitations applicable to actions founded on domestic judgments or decrees; renewal of judgment or decree; notice of renewal.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      All actions founded on any judgment or decree rendered by any court of record in this state, shall be brought within seven (7) years next after the rendition of such judgment or decree, or last renewal of judgment or decree, whichever is later.
     </p>
     <p>
      A judgment or decree can be renewed only if, at the time of renewal, the existing judgment or decree has not expired. A judgment or decree may be renewed by the filing with the clerk of the court that rendered such judgment or decree a Notice of Renewal of Judgment or Decree substantially in the following form:
     </p>
     <p>
      NOTICE OF RENEWAL OF JUDGMENT OR DECREE
     </p>
     <p>
      Notice is given of renewal of judgment that was rendered and filed in this action as follows:
     </p>
     <p>
      Date that judgment was filed;
     </p>
     <p>
      Case number of such judgment;
     </p>
     <p>
      Judgment was taken against;
     </p>
     <p>
      Judgment was taken in favor of;
     </p>
     <p>
      Current holder of such judgment;
     </p>
     <p>
      Current amount owing of such judgment; and
     </p>
     <p>
      Certification that at the time of the filing of the notice the judgment remains valid and has not been satisfied or barred.
     </p>
     <p>
      If applicable, that a Notice of Renewal of Judgment or Decree has been previously filed with the clerk of the court that rendered such judgment on:
     </p>
     <p>
      The renewal of such judgment is effective as of the date of the filing of the Notice of Renewal with the clerk of the court that rendered such judgment. The renewal of judgment shall be treated in the same manner as the previously rendered judgment. The circuit clerk shall enroll the Notice of Renewal showing the date of the filing of the Notice of Renewal, and the lien of the renewal of such judgment continues from the date of the enrollment of the existing judgment. The right to renew a judgment in any other manner allowed by law instead of using the above Notice of Renewal remains unimpaired.
     </p>
     <p>
      At the time of the filing of the Notice of Renewal of Judgment, the judgment creditor or his attorney shall make and file with the clerk of the court that rendered the judgment an affidavit setting forth the name and last-known post office address of the judgment debtor and the judgment creditor. Promptly upon the filing of the Notice of Renewal of Judgment, the clerk shall mail notice of the filing of the Notice of Renewal of Judgment to the judgment debtor at the address given and shall make a note of the mailing in the docket. The notice shall include the name and post office address of the judgment creditor and the judgment creditor’s attorney, if any, in this state. In addition, the judgment creditor may mail a notice of the filing of the Notice of Renewal of Judgment to the judgment debtor and may file proof of mailing with the clerk. Lack of mailing notice of filing by the clerk shall not affect the validity of the renewal of judgment if proof of mailing by the judgment creditor has been filed.

       The 2010 amendment rewrote the section.

       Chancellor did not err in finding that a former wife’s claim to a prior monetary judgment against a former husband was not yet barred by the statute of limitations because at the time the wife filed her motion for citation for contempt and for modification of alimony, the statute of limitations had not yet expired on her ability to collect the prior judgment; the wife filed her motion within the applicable seven-year statute-of-limitations period and based it on the prior underlying judgment.

       Chancery court was within its discretion to order a full accounting and the statute of limitations did not apply when it appeared that the conservator’s records for the conservatorship were incomplete; a full accounting was necessary where the chancery court could not merely take the conservator at her word that the money was used for the ward’s benefit and ordered the conservator to show proof that the checks and other items were actually used for her ward; the conservator was unable to do so.

       In a child support matter, more than seven years had passed since the eldest child had become 21; therefore, his claim was barred by the statute of limitations, but the claim of his sister was still viable, and the father did not waive the defense by failing to raise it as an affirmative defense in the pleadings when no pleading was required and the defense of laches was inapplicable to the youngest child’s claims.

   In an action by a debtor against a bank to cancel the principal and interest in a promissory note and a deed of trust securing the note, the trial court properly considered a defunct judgment which had been obtained by the bank against the debtor and her husband in determining the debtor’s liability to the bank where the defunct judgment was a sufficient basis to form the consideration for a component part of a new obligation entered into by the debtor; however, the trial court erred in computing the amount of consideration to include interest on the principal of the judgment debt beyond the seven years after the rendition of the judgment as provided in §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-43" target="_self">15-1-43</a></cite>. Under the provisions of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.75.html#t75c17s75-17-7" target="_blank">75-17-7</a></cite> interest should have been charged at the rate of eight percent per year for seven years to determine the amount of the former legal obligation where the note leading to the earlier judgment had provided for interest of eight percent per year.

   Contempt action was timely because the statute of limitations in Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-43" target="_self">15-1-43</a></cite> applied as a spouse’s action sought enforcement of a hold-harmless provision of a property-settlement agreement, which by operation of Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.93.html#t93c05s93-5-2" target="_blank">93-5-2</a></cite> became part of the final judgment of divorce, and the spouse filed for contempt within seven years of learning that a bank was pursuing the spouse for the debt on a car which was assigned to the other spouse and discharged in bankruptcy by the other spouse. Moseley v. Smith, 180 So.3d 667, 2014 Miss. App. LEXIS 689 (Miss. Ct. App. 2014), cert. dismissed, — So.3d —, 2015 Miss. LEXIS 605 (Miss. 2015), cert. dismissed, — So.3d —, 2015 Miss.

   After a guardianship account was drained, the twenty-four-year-old ward sued the bank for breaching its duty by allowing the funds on deposit to be converted without a court order; the claim was barred by the three-year statute of limitations set forth in Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-49" target="_self">15-1-49</a></cite>, because it was not filed three years after he turned twenty-one. The chancery court’s decree did not give the ward any affirmative relief that would make him a judgment creditor; therefore, Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-43" target="_self">15-1-43</a></cite> was not the applicable statute of limitations. Williams v.

      </h4>
      <p>
       Where a party commences a garnishment proceeding when the underlying judgment is still valid, the statute of limitations for actions on judgments is tolled as to that particular party as to funds, due to the judgment debtor, that were in the hands of the garnishee when the garnishment proceeding was initiated and the underlying judgment was valid; a garnisher is not entitled to the funds due to the judgment debtor, which came into the garnishee’s hands only after the underlying judgment lapsed. Quality Diesel Serv. v. Tiger Drilling Co., LLC, 190 So.3d 860, 2016 Miss. LEXIS 2 (Miss. 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court erred in granting a limited liability company’s (LLC) motion to dismiss a garnishment proceeding because a judgment creditor was not required to renew its underlying judgment against the judgment debtor for it to maintain its timely filed garnishment proceeding against the LLC, who was indebted to the debtor; the creditor brought its action within the seven-year period, and the underlying judgment had not lapsed as to its timely issued writs of garnishment and garnishment contest. Quality Diesel Serv. v. Tiger Drilling Co., LLC, 190 So.3d 860, 2016 Miss. LEXIS 2 (Miss. 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court did not err in ruling that a purchaser’s garnishment action against a seller was time-barred because it was filed months after the statute had run, and the purchaser failed to take advantage of the many procedural mechanisms available to him to extend the life of his judgment; thus, the judgment had been extinguished, and the purchaser could not bring a valid garnishment action. Johnson v. Parker Tractor & Implement Co., 132 So.3d 1032, 2014 Miss. LEXIS 31 (Miss. 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       Seller was not estopped from asserting the statute of limitations defense because it never prevailed on the argument that the judgment entered in favor of the purchaser was uneforceable; therefore, if the seller was taking an inconsistent position, the doctrine of estoppel would not apply. Johnson v. Parker Tractor & Implement Co., 132 So.3d 1032, 2014 Miss. LEXIS 31 (Miss. 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court did not err in ruling that a purchaser’s garnishment action against a seller was time-barred because it was filed months after the statute had run; the purchaser’s motion to amend the mandate in the action the seller filed against him did not toll the statute. Johnson v. Parker Tractor & Implement Co., 132 So.3d 1032, 2014 Miss. LEXIS 31 (Miss. 2014).

      </p>

       Writ of garnishment could not be issued on old judgment after seven years, though suit on judgment was commenced before seven years expired, since execution and other process to enforce the lien must be issued on the new judgment.

   Trial court chancellor properly found a petition for contempt was not barred by any statute of limitation because it was not the assertion of a new claim but rather part of an ongoing effort to collect on a six-year-old child support judgment against the father; collecting past due child support and expenses fell within the seven-year period of limitation for enforcement of domestic judgments, Miss.

Lloyd v. Bank of the South, 796 So. 2d 985, 2001 Miss. LEXIS 184 (Miss. 2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Since Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-43" target="_self">15-1-43</a></cite> does not specify where a renewal of judgment suit may be brought, such judgments may be sought by motion in the court where the judgment was originally rendered, or by a separate action wherever venue is proper, including the place where the defendant is residing. Lloyd v. Bank of the South, 796 So. 2d 985, 2001 Miss. LEXIS 184 (Miss. 2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       The only effective method to extend the judgment lien is by filing another suit upon the judgment before the expiration of 7 years from the rendition thereof. Kimbrough v. Wright, 231 Miss. 855, 97 So. 2d 362, 1957 Miss. LEXIS 573 (Miss. 1957).
      </p>
      <p>
       Plaintiff’s action in bringing suits and obtaining process before the lapse of seven years from the date of the rendition of previous successive judgments effectively stopped the running of a statute of limitations. Kimbrough v. Wright, 231 Miss. 855, 97 So. 2d 362, 1957 Miss. LEXIS 573 (Miss. 1957).
      </p>
      <p>
       The lien of a judgment can be extended only by the filing of another suit thereon within seven years. A suit in the name of the assignee of a judgment within the prescribed time is a full compliance with the section [Code 1942, § 733]. Street v. Smith, 85 Miss. 359, 37 So. 837, 1904 Miss. LEXIS 159 (Miss. 1904).
      </p>
      <p>
       If a new lien be sought, a suit must be brought on the judgment within seven years. Stith v. Parham, 57 Miss. 289, 1879 Miss. LEXIS 72 (Miss. 1879); Buckner v. Pipes, 56 Miss. 366, 1879 Miss. LEXIS 130 (Miss. 1879); Locke v. Brady, 30 Miss. 21, 1855 Miss. LEXIS 54 (Miss. 1855).

   Trial court did not err in applying the statute of limitations at Miss.

   Chancery court found that the seven-year statute of limitation, Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-43" target="_self">15-1-43</a></cite>, on enforcing monetary judgments barred recovery of any unpaid alimony amount that accrued seven years prior to the commencement of the contempt action. The ex-husband took no issue with that limitation, but his argument that laches and/or equitable estoppel should have precluded his ex-wife from enforcing any of the 1981 settlement agreement’s financial provisions was rejected, since laches was inapplicable to those claims not barred by limitations, and the ex-husband had unclean hands so that equitable estoppel was not a defense. Nicholas v. Nicholas, 841 So. 2d 1208, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 287 (Miss. Ct. App. 2003).

       Circuit court erred in denying a former wife’s motion to set aside a foreign judgment ordering her to pay a former husband because the statute of limitations had lapsed; the judgment was intended to be a continuation of the divorce proceeding and, therefore, was not enrolled before the statute of limitations lapsed. White v. Taylor, — So.3d —, 2019 Miss. App. LEXIS 261 (Miss. Ct. App. June 11, 2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       Registration of a child support order was timely because the three-year statute of limitations applicable to the father under Mississippi law was tolled while the child remained a minor. The tolling applied to the mother and the State, though neither was under such a disability, and the child was twelve years old in January, 1999. Shelnut v. Dep't of Human Servs., 9 So.3d 359, 2009 Miss. LEXIS 125 (Miss. 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Garnishment proceeding was no longer valid after the lapse of the judgment upon which the garnishment was issued; because more than three years had passed, the statute of limitation in Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-45" target="_self">15-1-45</a></cite> expired before the judgment creditor received its writ of garnishment, such that the garnishment was void ab initio and was unenforceable because it was not timely filed. Nat'l Enters. v. Valsamakis, 879 So. 2d 523, 2004 Miss. App. LEXIS 716 (Miss. Ct. App. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       The statute did not apply to an action by a judgment creditor in which the allegation was that the judgment debtor had fraudulently conveyed real property to his son since the issue was not whether the judgment creditor timely and properly filed its foreign judgment in a Mississippi court, but whether the judgment creditor timely filed its complaint against the judgment debtor and his son for a fraudulent conveyance. O'Neal Steel, Inc. v. Millette, 797 So. 2d 869, 2001 Miss. LEXIS 31 (Miss. 2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       Statute of limitations on mother’s action to enforce foreign judgment against father for child support arrearage was tolled by minority of children, even though mother was not under disability of minority. Vice v. Department of Human Servs., 702 So. 2d 397, 1997 Miss. LEXIS 606 (Miss. 1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Mississippi is required by the United States Constitution, Art. IV, Sec. 1, to give full faith and credit to all final judgments of other states and federal courts unless (1) the foreign judgment was obtained as a result of some false representation without which the judgment would not have been rendered, or (2) the rendering court did not have jurisdiction over the parties or the subject matter; however, in order to challenge a foreign judgment on this ground, it is necessary that the challenge be timely and properly filed in Mississippi pursuant to §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-45" target="_self">15-1-45</a></cite>. Davis v. Davis, 558 So. 2d 814, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 19 (Miss. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       A judgment is not a contract, and the seven years’ limitation cannot be avoided by showing a new promise or acknowledgment in writing, as contemplated by Code 1880, § 2688. Berkson v. Cox, 73 Miss. 339, 18 So. 934, 1895 Miss. LEXIS 120 (Miss. 1895).
      </p>

       The section [Code 1871, § 2154] is subject to the exception in Code 1871, § 2157, as to the defendant’s absence from the state. Kennard use of McGehee v. Alston, 62 Miss. 763, 1885 Miss. LEXIS 140 (Miss. 1885).

       Because the bank enrolled the foreign judgment nearly ten years after it was entered in Texas, almost three years outside the limitations period, the judgment was unenforceable and its enrollment in Mississippi was void because it was not timely filed. N. Dallas Bank & Trust Co. v. Mabry, 271 So.3d 629, 2018 Miss. App. LEXIS 579 (Miss. Ct. App. 2018).

   In a garnishment case in which (1) a lessor obtained a judgment against the lessees in 1990; (2) the lessor did not enroll the judgment in a Mississippi court within the three-year limitations period set forth in Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-45" target="_self">15-1-45</a></cite>; (3) the original judgment was revived as a new judgment under Ind. Code §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.34.html#t34c55s34-55-1" target="_blank">34-55-1</a></cite>-6; and (4) the lessor enrolled the judgment within the three-year limitations period set forth in Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-45" target="_self">15-1-45</a></cite>, the lessees had no viable claim for wrongful garnishment, malicious prosecution, abuse of process, negligence, gross negligence or intentional infliction of emotional distress. Smith v. RJH of Fla., Inc., 520 F. Supp. 2d 838, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 84863 (S.D. Miss. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       Three-year Mississippi statute of limitation for enforcement of foreign judgments governed enforcement in Mississippi of Louisiana judgment ordering father to pay child support arrearage, since father was Mississippi resident at time Louisiana judgment was rendered; ten-year Louisiana statute of limitations for actions to enforce unpaid child support did not apply, even though mother and children resided in Louisiana during time father failed to pay support. Vice v. Department of Human Servs., 702 So. 2d 397, 1997 Miss. LEXIS 606 (Miss. 1997).
      </p>
      <p>

   The language “at the time of the institution of the action” in §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-45" target="_self">15-1-45</a></cite> refers to the action in which the judgment was rendered. Davis v. Davis, 558 So. 2d 814, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 19 (Miss. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although this section did not prohibit a divorced wife from bringing suit for past due child support payments pursuant to a 1969 Louisiana divorce decree, it was applicable only after September 1973, the time at which the husband’s then past due monthly payments were reduced to a final judgment. Hinds v. Primeaux, 367 So. 2d 925, 1979 Miss. LEXIS 2218 (Miss. 1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a judgment was rendered in Alabama against a nonresident of Mississippi on a cause of action which did not accrue in Mississippi, and the defendant thereafter became a resident of Mississippi, the statute of limitations ran from the date of the judgment rather than from the time the defendant became a resident of Mississippi. United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co. v. Ransom, 192 Miss. 286, 5 So. 2d 238, 1941 Miss. LEXIS 38 (Miss. 1941).
      </p>
      <p>
       Three-year limitation statute for bringing action on foreign judgment against citizens residing in state at filing suit held not violative of full faith and credit clause; state may prescribe reasonable statute of limitation for suing on foreign judgment. Bosich v. Skermetti, 146 Miss. 491, 112 So. 385, 1927 Miss. LEXIS 248 (Miss. 1927).
      </p>
      <p>
       Three-year limitation for commencement of action on foreign judgment against judgment debtor, who was resident at time of institution of action, refers to action in which judgment was rendered. Gray v. Valley, 136 Miss. 886, 101 So. 855, 1924 Miss. LEXIS 186 (Miss. 1924).
      </p>
      <p>
       A plea of the statute of limitation of three years is bad if it fails to aver that the defendant was a resident of this state at the time suit was instituted. Marx v. Logue, 71 Miss. 905, 15 So. 890, 1894 Miss. LEXIS 23 (Miss. 1894).

       Chancellor did not err in finding that a former wife’s claim to a prior monetary judgment against a former husband was not yet barred by the statute of limitations because at the time the wife filed her motion for citation for contempt and for modification of alimony, the statute of limitations had not yet expired on her ability to collect the prior judgment; the wife filed her motion within the applicable seven-year statute-of-limitations period and based it on the prior underlying judgment.

   A hospital which was jointly owned by a city and a hospital district, and was governed by a board of trustees jointly appointed by the city council and the county board of supervisors, was a “subdivision [of the state] or municipal corporation thereof” within the meaning and contemplation of Art 4, § 104 of the Mississippi Constitution and §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-51" target="_self">15-1-51</a></cite>. Thus, the 7-year period of limitations governing judgment liens set forth in §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-47" target="_self">15-1-47</a></cite> was inoperative against the hospital.

       Where defendants in ejectment suit had shown that the property involved therein had been sold by order of the chancery court, the purchase money paid and possession taken by the purchaser under such sale, and had testified, without contradiction, as to their good faith, they had thereby sustained their plea of the bar of the statute of limitations unless the plaintiffs could show in rebuttal that the sale was not in good faith.

      <p>
       Where a party commences a garnishment proceeding when the underlying judgment is still valid, the statute of limitations for actions on judgments is tolled as to that particular party as to funds, due to the judgment debtor, that were in the hands of the garnishee when the garnishment proceeding was initiated and the underlying judgment was valid; a garnisher is not entitled to the funds due to the judgment debtor, which came into the garnishee’s hands only after the underlying judgment lapsed. Quality Diesel Serv. v. Tiger Drilling Co., LLC, 190 So.3d 860, 2016 Miss. LEXIS 2 (Miss. 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court erred in granting a limited liability company’s (LLC) motion to dismiss a garnishment proceeding because a judgment creditor was not required to renew its underlying judgment against the judgment debtor for it to maintain its timely filed garnishment proceeding against the LLC, who was indebted to the debtor; the creditor brought its action within the seven-year period, and the underlying judgment had not lapsed as to its timely issued writs of garnishment and garnishment contest. Quality Diesel Serv. v. Tiger Drilling Co., LLC, 190 So.3d 860, 2016 Miss. LEXIS 2 (Miss. 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court did not err in ruling that a purchaser’s garnishment action against a seller was time-barred because it was filed months after the statute had run, and the purchaser failed to take advantage of the many procedural mechanisms available to him to extend the life of his judgment; thus, the judgment had been extinguished, and the purchaser could not bring a valid garnishment action. Johnson v. Parker Tractor & Implement Co., 132 So.3d 1032, 2014 Miss. LEXIS 31 (Miss. 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       Purchaser was not legally enjoined from bringing an enforcement action of his own while a bank’s garnishment action was stayed because no proceeding occurred that operated as an automatic stay of his judgment; the mere circumstance that the enforceability of the purchaser’s final judgment was the subject matter of an appeal in a different party’s garnishment action did not operate to enjoin the purchaser from attempting to collect the judgment. Johnson v. Parker Tractor & Implement Co., 132 So.3d 1032, 2014 Miss. LEXIS 31 (Miss. 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       Seller was not estopped from asserting the statute of limitations defense because it never prevailed on the argument that the judgment entered in favor of the purchaser was uneforceable; therefore, if the seller was taking an inconsistent position, the doctrine of estoppel would not apply. Johnson v. Parker Tractor & Implement Co., 132 So.3d 1032, 2014 Miss. LEXIS 31 (Miss. 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because a purchaser’s circuit court judgment was not the underlying proceeding, it was not stayed by the order granting interlocutory appeal. Johnson v. Parker Tractor & Implement Co., 132 So.3d 1032, 2014 Miss. LEXIS 31 (Miss. 2014).

   A garnishee which failed to file an answer to a writ of garnishment as required by §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.11.html#t11c35s11-35-25" target="_blank">11-35-25</a></cite> and instead paid $10 per week of the judgment debtor’s salary directly to the attorney for the judgment holder was liable to the debtor for monies wrongfully withheld after expiration of the judgment where, although the judgment and execution thereon had expired after seven years as provided in §§<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-3" target="_self">15-1-3</a></cite>,<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-43" target="_self">15-1-43</a></cite> and although the judgment holder had failed to file another suit on the judgment prior to the expiration of the seven years as required by §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-47" target="_self">15-1-47</a></cite> to extend the judgment lien, the garnishee continued to pay the $10 per week to the judgment holder for two years after the judgment had lapsed.

       Where a party appealed and obtained a bond styled “appeal bond with supersedeas” in an amount sufficient to effect supersedeas, and had the benefit of supersedeas in that execution of judgment was stayed, but there was no indication that the bonds were liable for the amount of judgment as required of supersedeas bonds by Code § 1973, such party was estopped, in a suit on the judgment which had been affirmed, from changing his position and contending that the bond did not toll the statute of limitations since it failed to include the conditions imposed by Code § 1163 requiring that the bond be conditioned that the appellant will satisfy the judgment or decree.

       Trial court did not err in ruling that a purchaser’s garnishment action against a seller was time-barred because it was filed months after the statute had run; the purchaser’s motion to amend the mandate in the action the seller filed against him did not toll the statute.

   Where plaintiff did not file his action to recover funds after defendant’s check to him bounced until almost four years after the check was first dishonored, plaintiff’s action was barred by the statute of limitations in Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.75.html#t75c03s75-3-118ol1c" target="_blank">75-3-118(c)</a></cite>, but the trial court’s application of the statute of limitations in Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-49" target="_self">15-1-49</a></cite> achieved the same result. Bryan v. Aron, 941 So. 2d 831, 2006 Miss. App. LEXIS 185 (Miss. Ct.

      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Since there was no specific statute of limitations for claims on written contracts,
   Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-49" target="_self">15-1-49</a></cite> therefore applied; as the determination had been made that the neighbor’s cause of action accrued under contract, not as an action to recover land, §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-49" target="_self">15-1-49</a></cite> and the three year statute of limitations prescribed therein applied; as was correctly found by the chancery court, the neighbor’s claim was time barred by the statute of limitations.

   A conversion action was timely commenced 3 1/2-years after it accrued on May 23, 1989 pursuant to the limitations period in effect when the claim arose (§<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-49" target="_self">15-1-49</a></cite>); the mere failure of the legislature to retain the savings language when amending the statute to shorten the limitations period to 3 years did not express a “clear intent” that a shorter limitations period apply to already-accrued actions. First Bank v. Eastern Livestock Co., 886 F. Supp. 1328, 1995 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7662 (S.D. Miss. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       If no action on an anticipatory breach is brought before the time fixed by the contract for the beginning of the performance by the party who has committed such a breach, the period of statute of limitations begins to run only from the time so fixed by the contract. Old Ladies Home Ass'n v. Hall, 212 Miss. 67, 52 So. 2d 650, 1951 Miss. LEXIS 428 (Miss. 1951).
      </p>
      <p>
       Writing sufficient to take case out of statute providing that actions on open account or stated account not acknowledged by writing shall be commenced within three years must contain an acknowledgment of indebtedness, or promise to pay, in such terms as to render supplementary evidence unnecessary.

      </p>
      <p>
       Action on paid or cancelled check or draft to recover specified amount from payee, is not one on a written instrument, and the six-year statute does not apply. Wally v. L. N. Dantzler Lumber Co., 119 Miss. 700, 81 So. 489, 1919 Miss. LEXIS 47 (Miss. 1919).

      </p>

       A recital in a deed of a consideration proved not to have been paid is a promise in writing only, barred under this section [Code 1942, § 722], as in the case of written promises. Fowlkes v. Lea, 84 Miss. 509, 36 So. 1036, 1904 Miss. LEXIS 83 (Miss. 1904).

   Contempt action was timely because the statute of limitations in Miss.

   In a discriminatory lending suit filed by African American loan recipients against an auto financing corporation, the loan recipients’ state law deceptive trade practices and common law claims were barred by the three-year statute of limitations in Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-49ol11" target="_self">15-1-49(1)</a></cite>, which was not tolled by the fraudulent concealment rule codified in Miss.

       An agreement extending the maturity date of a promissory note was not void on the ground that the plaintiff, seeking a cancelation of a deed of trust securing such note, had signed it only after a casual reading thereof and that it did not reflect his intention, so as to make applicable the six-year statute of limitations.

       This section [Code 1942, § 722] was not applicable to a suit in chancery brought by a bank to confirm its title to real estate and to cancel the former owner’s claim to the land after it had previously foreclosed the deed of trust on such land for default in payment of a note secured thereby and had become the purchaser of the land at foreclosure sale, notwithstanding that the suit was brought more than six years after the due date of the note, where the Chancellor held the foreclosure sale to be valid and did not grant the bank’s alternative prayer for a further foreclosure if such foreclosure sale was valid, since if such sale was valid the purchaser was entitled to the relief granted at any date subsequent to the sale unless such relief should have become barred by some limitation of adverse possession.

       This section [Code 1942, § 722] of the statute is not applicable to a situation where a donor delivered certain promissory notes secured by mortgage to a bank in trust for certain beneficiaries and, the bank being incapable of performing the trust, the donor assumed control of such notes for the benefit of the beneficiaries and through his unauthorized act the notes became valueless giving rise to an action against his executor, since there existed a trust in regard to the notes and their intended security not cognizable by the courts of the common law within the purview of the ten-year statute of limitations.

   A cause of action against four highway patrolmen and their surety, alleging that the plaintiff had been beaten and abused by the highway patrolmen, was essentially an action against a public officer and the surety on his bond, was accordingly an action in contract, and was governed by the six year statutory limitation for written contracts, §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-49" target="_self">15-1-49</a></cite>, and not the one year statutory limitation period for tort actions, §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-35" target="_self">15-1-35</a></cite>.

       The dismissal by a former sheriff and tax collector of his action against the county for compensation for alleged services did not destroy the right of his assignee, who was to obtain a portion of any recovery, and since the assignee’s right was dependent upon the right of his assignor, assignee’s action should have been brought within six years from the date of the expiration of the term of office of the former sheriff and tax collector, and, where it was not, the claim was barred.

       Trial court properly granted summary judgment in favor of a school and its team doctor as to alumni’s claims of invasion of privacy because there was no evidence that the dean of schools watched the alumni while they showered in his home, and thus, there also was no evidence of a latent injury; without a latent injury, the statute of limitations wa not tolled, and the alumni’s claims were time-barred.

       Discovery rule did not toll the statute of limitations for alumni’s claims for invasion of privacy because there was nothing secretive about the monitoring process of drug screens or physicals; all students were aware that they were being monitored by the dean of schools or other male teachers/coaches while specimens were being collected and that physicals were being performed by the dean or the team doctor while the students were undressed.

   In November 1997, plaintiff brought suit for wrongful death, but the record reflected that she failed to properly serve process upon defendant within 120 days. Because process was not served within the 120-day period as provided by Miss. R. Civ.

       This section governed the tort aspect of an action alleging that a television set malfunctioned, causing a fire that destroyed most of plaintiffs’ home, but was inapplicable to their breach of implied warranties claim; plaintiffs’ negligence and strict liability in tort claims were not time-barred under this section, even though the television set had been manufactured and sold more than six years before the action was commenced, where there was no showing that plaintiffs knew or should have known of the alleged defect prior to the fire and the statute of limitations thus did not begin to run until the date of the fire.

       There was a genuine dispute of material fact about whether an alienation of affections case was time barred because it was unclear when a former wife’s affections were alienated; although the couple filed for divorce on May 27, 2010, they moved back in together in July 2010 as the wife recovered from surgery, during which time they allegedly cohabitated and engaged in sexual relations. The trial court failed to consider the sixty-day waiting period before an irreconcilable differences divorce became final, as well as the public policy underlying the waiting period, which sought to foster reconciliation. Anderson v. Ladner, 198 So.3d 381, 2016 Miss. App. LEXIS 15 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 202 So.3d 617, 2016 Miss. LEXIS 364 (Miss. 2016).

   While a husband’s claim for alienation of affection met the liberal notice-pleading requirements of Miss. R. Civ. P. 8(a), in that he set forth factual allegations respecting each material element of the claim, the claim was time-barred as it was not filed within the three-year period in Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-49" target="_self">15-1-49</a></cite> (Rev. 2003).

   Summary judgment was properly granted to a paramour in a husband’s claim for alienation of affection, arising from the paramour’s affair with the husband’s wife, as the suit was not filed within three years of the latest accrual date, which was when the affair ended, pursuant to
   Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-49" target="_self">15-1-49</a></cite>; further, the discovery rule under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-49ol12" target="_self">15-1-49(2)</a></cite> or continuing tort doctrine were not applicable, as a phone call between the paramour and the wife did not constitute a latent injury or continuing conduct that tolled the limitations period.

   Remand was necessary in an alienation of affection case because the limited facts in the record made it impossible to determine if Mississippi or Tennessee law should have applied; the appellate court was also unable to determine when the cause of action accrued under the three-year statute of limitations in Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-49" target="_self">15-1-49</a></cite> since the affair had been over for several years when the husband had discovered it, the wife continued to reside in the marital home during the affair, and she continued a relationship with her husband, including having two other children, after the affair ended.

       An action for alienation of affections was time-barred where (1) the claim accrued on November 4, 1994 when the husband, in open pursuit of a relationship with the defendant, moved out of the marital home and abandoned the marital relationship, and (2) the plaintiff filed her claim on December 2, 1997, approximately one month after the statute of limitations had run on the claim.

   The 2-year statute of limitations set forth in §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-36" target="_self">15-1-36</a></cite>, rather than the general 6-year limitation period of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-49" target="_self">15-1-49</a></cite>, applied to a medical malpractice action against a nurse and a company that supplied nursing personnel, where the company’s sole basis for liability was the fact that it was the nurse’s employer; since §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-36" target="_self">15-1-36</a></cite> specifically names nurses among those covered and the company’s liability was predicated solely upon the doctrine of respondeat superior, the bar of the suit against the nurse likewise barred the action as to the company. Under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-3" target="_self">15-1-3</a></cite>, §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-3" target="_self">15-1-3</a></cite>6 barred both the right of action against the nurse and the company and also barred any remedy against both parties.

   Medical malpractice action was not barred by statute of limitations where alleged negligent act occurred on June 28, 1974, foreign object was discovered in lining of patient’s heart on June 21, 1982, and action was filed on June 14, 1984, because enactment of specific statute of limitations, §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-36" target="_self">15-1-36</a></cite>, dealing with malpractice tort claims, controlled over general statute, §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-49" target="_self">15-1-49</a></cite>; specific statute defined date of accrual of action as being date of alleged act, omission, or neglect, or date injury would or with reasonable diligence might have been first known or discovered, and provided that it applied to claims which accrued on or after July 1, 1976; fact that different definition of accrual may have been accepted with respect to general 6-year statute of limitations was beside point, because that definition had been superseded by specific statute of limitations.

   Where on former appeals, terminating in a decision by the Federal Supreme Court, the point raised by demurrer to insurer’s plea involved the question whether a provision in a fidelity bond requiring any claim thereunder to be made within 15 months after the termination of the suretyship, was subject to the law of Tennessee where the contract was made at a time when the insured was then located in Tennessee, or subject to the laws of Mississippi, to which insured had removed and where the defalcation occurred, and resulted in a determination that the laws of Tennessee governed, such determination did not preclude subsequent litigation as to the effect of such provision under Tennessee decisions as being a condition precedent to liability of the insurer or merely a postponement of the right to sue.

       It is well settled law in Mississippi that a cause of action begins to run from the time of injury and not from the time of its discovery unless the running of the statute of limitations is tolled by the operation of Code 1942, § 742 (fraudulent concealment of a cause of action).

       If no action on an anticipatory breach is brought before the time fixed by the contract for the beginning of the performance by the party who has committed such a breach, the period of statute of limitations begins to run only from the time so fixed by the contract.

      </p>
      <p>
       An immediate action based upon an anticipatory breach is a different cause of action from that based on the nonperformance at the contract time, and limitation period does not begin to run upon nonperformance of contractual duty until the cause of action accrues and they duty of performance continues in spite of repudiation.

       The general rule allows the injured promisee, if he elects after breach of the contract to keep it alive, to compute the statute of limitations, not from the time of the breach by anticipatory repudiation, but from the time when ultimate payment of performance was promised, the death of the promisor.

   Both parties agreed that the general, catch-all three year statute of limitations set forth in Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-49" target="_self">15-1-49</a></cite> (Rev. 2003) should have applied in the case, and the appellate court found that the owner implicitly consented to the association renting out his unit because he never responded to the letters sent to him, and he never voiced his disapproval of the rentals at the board meetings, or at any other time prior to filing his complaint in the present action. Because the owner never objected to the rentals until he filed his complaint in January 2000, even though he knew that the association was entering his unit without his consent as early as 1993, the appellate court found no error in the chancellor’s finding that the owner’s continued-trespass claim was untimely.

Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-49" target="_self">15-1-49</a></cite> since the claim should have been filed three years from the completion of the sale; moreover, there was no fraudulent concealment tolling the limitations period since the purchaser was not precluded from discovering her claim in the language of the policy.

   Where Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-49" target="_self">15-1-49</a></cite>’s three-year statute of limitations applied, the insurer’s motion for summary judgment was granted because the insured’s allegation that the insurer failed to disclose pertinent terms of loan transactions and related contracts of insurance was time barred. Additionally, the insured’s common defense argument may have been well received at the removal/remand stage of the litigation, but it was inapplicable in the court’s summary judgment analysis.

       There was no statute of limitations problem in an action arising from the failure of an insurance company to refund an unearned premium on an installment contract, notwithstanding that the action was not commenced until three years and six days after the installment contract was satisfied, since the insurance company did not have a duty to refund the unearned premium on the date that the contract was satisfied and did not have a duty to refund without notice of satisfaction of the contract.

       Suit to establish heirship was well within 6 year limitation period from event triggering running of statute, which was receipt of notice of heir’s potential interest in property, because statute does not begin to run until heir knows his status has been questioned and is not required to bring suit to establish rights unless and until there is question concerning his status as heir.

The complaint which the client filed with the Mississippi Bar did not toll the statute of limitations or require the client to exhaust administrative remedies before filing suit. Archer v.

       The limitations period for the enforcement of a promissory note was not tolled by the fact that the defendant continued to make 74 monthly payments after the balloon payment on the note became due since such payments did not unequivocally acknowledge when the balance was due, to whom the balance was due, and for what the balance was due, and, moreover, such payments did not contain a specification of the debt referred to and a promise to pay a fixed amount.

       The statute of limitations in a legal malpractice action was not tolled through fraudulent concealment even if the defendant attorney did fraudulently conceal his negligence since the plaintiffs, through the exercise of reasonable diligence, should have been able to discover the attorney’s negligence more than 6 years prior to the date on which the complaint was filed where there was very little that the plaintiffs alleged in their complaint that they did not know 9 years before the malpractice suit was filed.

   An insurer was notified of a claim, which arose from an automobile accident between an insured and an uninsured motorist, well within the applicable 6-year statute of limitations set forth in §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-49" target="_self">15-1-49</a></cite>, even though the insurer was first notified of the accident approximately 6 1/2 years after the date of the accident, where the insured was 17 years old when she was injured in the accident, and therefore, pursuant to §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-59" target="_self">15-1-59</a></cite>, the statute of limitations did not begin to run against her until she reached her 21st birthday. The policy and purpose behind the Uninsured Motorist Act is to provide the same protection to one injured by an uninsured motorist as that individual would have if injured by a financially responsible driver. Thus, since the insured’s cause of action against the uninsured motorist was not barred, her claim against the insurer was viable; since uninsured motorist coverage was purchased, the insurer had an obligation to protect the insured as long as the claim against the uninsured motorist was permitted.

    Limitations of suits by and against the state, counties and municipal corporations.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Statutes of limitation in civil cases shall not run against the state, or any subdivision or municipal corporation thereof, except that any judgment or decree rendered in favor of the state, or any subdivision or municipal corporation thereof, shall not be a lien on the property of the defendant therein for a longer period than seven (7) years from the date of filing notice of the lien, unless an action is brought before the expiration of such time or unless the state or such subdivision or municipal corporation refiles notice of the lien. There shall be no limit upon the number of times that the state, or any subdivision or municipal corporation thereof, may refile such notices of lien.
     </p>
     <p>
      The statutes of limitation shall run in favor of the state, the counties, and municipal corporations beginning at the time when the plaintiff first had the right to demand payment of the officer or board authorized to allow or disallow the claim sued upon. The provisions of this section shall apply to all pending and subsequently filed notices of liens.

   In a case in which a husband and wife argued that an open-account claim by a collection agency for collection in the justice court was barred by a three-year statute of limitations, that argument failed. A circuit court correctly found that their unpaid bills were owed to a governmental entity, a general hospital, the hospital’s accounts were assigned to the collection agency for collection purposes only, and the collection agency’s claim was not time-barred pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-51" target="_self">15-1-51</a></cite>. Laffitte v. Southern Fin. Sys., 30 So.3d 1236, 2009 Miss. App. LEXIS 599 (Miss. Ct.

       Hospital was a subdivision of state for purposes of its suit against doctor for unpaid rent, and was thus not subject to one-year statute of limitations; county board of supervisors and city board of aldermen passed resolutions authorizing purchase and lease of office by hospital for express purpose of recruiting doctors to county and city, and office was purchased and leased pursuant to local and private legislation.

   A hospital which was jointly owned by a city and a hospital district, and was governed by a board of trustees jointly appointed by the city council and the county board of supervisors, was a “subdivision [of the state] or municipal corporation thereof” within the meaning and contemplation of Art 4, § 104 of the Mississippi Constitution and §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-51" target="_self">15-1-51</a></cite>. Thus, the 7-year period of limitations governing judgment liens set forth in §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-47" target="_self">15-1-47</a></cite> was inoperative against the hospital.

   Constitutional amendment prohibiting state from making payment on certain precivil war bonds did not toll statute of limitations for bringing claim on bonds, as enactment did not prohibit bondholder from bringing suit.

       <p>
   Although state procured passage of constitutional amendment prohibiting payment of certain precivil war bonds, state was not equitably estopped from asserting that bondholders’ action to recover on bonds was barred by statute of limitations, as amendment did not prohibit bondholders from bringing claim on bonds and, therefore, state did not induce bondholders to abstain from filing suit to protect their rights and collect duly owed debts. Grant v. State, 686 So. 2d 1078, 1996 Miss. LEXIS 690 (Miss. 1996), cert. denied, <cite class="us_code">520 U.S. 1240</cite>, <cite class="s_court">117 S. Ct. 1844</cite>, <cite class="l_ed">137 L.

   Statute of limitations for filing suit to collect on precivil war bonds began to run in favor of state when bondholders first had right to make demand on officer authorized by state to allow or disallow claims, even though constitutional amendment precluded payment on bonds, and, therefore, there was no state officer who could authorize claims.

   Since bondholders’ action against state to recover on precivil war bonds was barred by statute of limitations, chancellor did not need to rule on constitutionality of constitutional amendment prohibiting payment on bonds, and chancellor’s ruling that amendment was unconstitutional was impermissible advisory opinion.

       The six-year statute of limitations was applicable to the right of a teacher in an agricultural high school to demand payment of salary from the proceeds of bonds to be issued by the county and to compel issuance of such bonds by mandamus upon failure of the board of supervisors (which was not shown to have ever been advised of the existence of the obligation until suit was filed) otherwise to do so.

       The dismissal by a former sheriff and tax collector of his action against the county for compensation for alleged services did not destroy the right of his assignee, who was to obtain a portion of any recovery, and since the assignee’s right was dependent upon the right of his assignor, assignee’s action should have been brought within six years from the date of the expiration of the term of office of the former sheriff and tax collector, and, where it was not, the claim was barred.

       As long as debt is owed to community hospital and is to be paid to community hospital, statute of limitations does not run and debt remains due and payable indefinitely but this favorable treatment cannot be used for benefit of private individual or firm and regular statute of limitations would apply once debt is assigned and statute begins to run from date debt was originally owed, not date of assignment of debt to private entity.

     </h3>
     <p>
      When the legal title to property or a right in action is in an executor, administrator, guardian, or other trustee, the time during which any statute of limitations runs against such trustee shall be computed against the person beneficially interested in such property or right in action, although such person may be under disability and within the saving of any statute of limitations; and may be availed of in any suit or actions by such person.

      <p>
       Mere existence of an aunt as a person with statutory standing to bring a wrongful-death suit did not prevent the application of the statute because the aunt had been neither appointed guardian nor authorized by the chancery court to bring an action on behalf of the deceased’s children; the oldest child did not have a guardian appointed for who had the legal authority to bring a suit on her behalf, and thus, the savings clause remained in operation. Pioneer Cmty. Hosp. of Newton v. Roberts, 214 So.3d 259, 2017 Miss. LEXIS 107 (Miss. 2017).
      </p>
      <p>
       A ward’s disability did not toll the statute of limitations in an action commenced by his guardian where the guardian was appointed some years before the cause of action arose. McCain v. Memphis Hardwood Flooring Co., 725 So. 2d 788, 1998 Miss. LEXIS 272 (Miss. 1998), overruled in part, Stockstill v. Gammill, 943 So. 2d 35, 2006 Miss. LEXIS 624 (Miss. 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 15-1-53 does not apply to action alleging that deed of trust executed by mortgagor and its foreclosure are invalid because mortgagor was mentally incompetent, because by its terms, statute applies only where legal title to property or right in action is in conservator as opposed to ward, and right of action was at all times in mortgagor rather than conservator. Talbert v. Henderson, 688 F. Supp. 250, 1987 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13869 (S.D. Miss. 1987).

   Provisions of Miss. Code Annotated §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-53" target="_self">15-1-53</a></cite> are not applicable where conservator was empowered merely to manage incompetent’s property and affairs, and right of action to challenge execution of deed of trust and foreclosure pursuant to it remained at all times in incompetent. Talbert v. Henderson, 688 F. Supp. 250, 1987 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13869 (S.D. Miss. 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       The statute [Code 1942, § 727] only applies where the legal title or right of action at law or in equity is in the guardian or trustee, and a mere equitable right in the beneficiary. Weir v. Monahan, 67 Miss. 434, 7 So. 291, 1889 Miss. LEXIS 66 (Miss. 1889).

   Savings clause in Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-59" target="_self">15-1-59</a></cite> did not act to toll the statute of limitations regarding a judgment a ward’s conservator obtained in divorce action against the ward’s former husband.

Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.93.html#t93c13s93-13-38" target="_blank">93-13-38</a></cite> the right to pursue the action for money owed was in the conservator not the ward so the statute of limitations ran against conservator.

      </p>
      <p>
       This statute [Code 1942, § 727] has no application to the rights of remaindermen under a devise or grant in trust to take effect only after the termination of a particular estate until the rights of the remaindermen fall into possession.

      </p>
      <p>
       The statute [Code 1942, § 727] begins to run against one to whom land is conveyed in trust for others from the time adverse possession is taken under claim of ownership, and when he is barred the beneficiaries he represents are barred. Nelson v. Ratliff, 72 Miss. 656, 18 So. 487, 1895 Miss. LEXIS 69 (Miss. 1895).

       When a decedent dies in the last year in which a suit may be brought for his injury this provision adds a year after his death within which suit may be brought by his personal representatives. Triplett v. United States, 213 F. Supp. 887, 1963 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7940 (S.D. Miss. 1963).

      </p>
      <p>
       The statute [Code 1942, § 728] allows suit to be brought within one year of the death of the party liable, and not within one year from the date of letters testamentary or of administration, as did § 2612 Code of 1871. Klaus v. Moore, 77 Miss. 701, 27 So. 612, 1900 Miss. LEXIS 16 (Miss. 1900); Hughston v. Nail, 73 Miss. 284, 18 So. 920, 1895 Miss. LEXIS 110 (Miss. 1895).
      </p>
      <p>
       Death of the debtor does not interrupt the running of the statute of limitations, but since the personal representative cannot be sued for six months after grant of letters, this time should not be counted against the creditor. Allen v. Hillman, 69 Miss. 225, 13 So. 871, 1891 Miss. LEXIS 174 (Miss. 1891).
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
       As applying former enactment of this section [Code 1942, § 728] as contained in Code of 1871 wherein the limitation period did not begin to run until issuance of letters testamentary or of administration, see Hambrick v. Jones, 64 Miss. 240, 8 So. 176, 1886 Miss. LEXIS 53 (Miss. 1886); Cook v. Reynolds, 58 Miss. 243, 1880 Miss. LEXIS 116 (Miss. 1880); Sledge v. Jacobs, 58 Miss. 194, 1880 Miss.

      </p>
      <p>
       The statute [Code 1942, § 728] only applies to cases in which the death of the person occurred within the last year of the time limited. Hambrick v. Jones, 64 Miss. 240, 8 So. 176, 1886 Miss. LEXIS 53 (Miss. 1886).

       Statement of claim in a probate proceeding was timely filed because the stay entered by a federal circuit court, prohibiting the creditor from foreclosing on the encumbered property pending the appeal, began the tolling of the filing period as to the promissory note. Avakian v. Wilmington Trust N.A. (In re Estate of Avakian), 231 So.3d 208, 2017 Miss. App. LEXIS 201 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 229 So.3d 122, 2017 Miss. LEXIS 492 (Miss. 2017).

   Summary judgment was granted to an electric company in a property damage case because the statute of limitations was not tolled under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-57" target="_self">15-1-57</a></cite> since, from the date of an alleged incident until the expiration of the three-year statute of limitations, other parties were free to file their own claim or to join in the claim erroneously filed on behalf of a dissolved corporation. Miss. R. Civ. P. 15(c) did not allow for a reprieve from the limitations period because no amended complaint was filed; instead, an entirely new action with new parties was initiated. Funderburg v. Pontotoc Elec. Power Ass'n, 6 So.3d 439, 2009 Miss. App. LEXIS 159 (Miss. Ct. App. 2009).

      <p>
       <p>
   In a dispute involving a promissory note, an issue of which statute of limitations applied was not decided because the creditor never filed suit to foreclose on the note and never filed collection on the note; further, the savings clause, Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-57" target="_self">15-1-57</a></cite>, did not apply because that section applied only when a person was restrained or prohibited from bringing suit.

Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-57" target="_self">15-1-57</a></cite>, the individual’s claim for malpractice against a medical center was timely when it was filed two years and 30 days after the date of injury.

   In an appeal of dismissal of a medical malpractice case due to limitations, the judgment was reversed because it was timely filed within the statute of limitations; the most reasonable interpretation of Miss.

   Constitutional amendment prohibiting state from making payment on certain precivil war bonds did not toll statute of limitations for bringing claim on bonds, as enactment did not prohibit bondholder from bringing suit.

       Because a conservator failed to create a genuine issue of material fact that the conservator’s parent was mentally incompetent at the time when the cause of action for alleged the misappropriation of loan proceeds accrued, the savings clause did not apply. Specifically, a doctor only offered conclusory statements regarding the parent’s health without citation to specific facts showing that the parent was of unsound mind at the time the cause of action accrued. Brown-Howle v. Cmty. Bank, — So.3d —, 2018 Miss. App. LEXIS 527 (Miss. Ct. App. Oct. 23, 2018).

       Trial court properly granted summary judgment in favor of a school and its team doctor because all alleged intentional torts occurred more than one year prior to alumni filing suit; the alumni did not timely file their intentional tort claims because the suit was filed seven years after the last alumnus graduated and more than three years after the last alumnus reached the age of majority.

   Trial court improperly granted summary judgment, pursuant to Miss. R. Civ. P. 56, to a paint company with respect to a child’s claims of injury resulting from ingestion of lead found in paint that the company manufactured because the child’s claims were not barred by the three-year statute of limitations set forth in Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-49" target="_self">15-1-49</a></cite>, as the child was a minor when the claims accrued, and therefore the claims were subject to the savings statute, Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-59" target="_self">15-1-59</a></cite>; because the child’s claims were improperly dismissed, he was denied his right to a jury trial as set forth in Miss. Const. art. III, § 31, but the claims of the child’s mother were properly dismissed as time-barred. Pollard v. Sherwin-Williams Co., 955 So. 2d 764, 2007 Miss. LEXIS 31 (Miss. 2007).

   Where the mother entered into the relationship with the father when the mother was 14 years old and moved in with the father before the mother was 16 years old, the mother was not entitled to protection from the courts, as the mother’s action for an equitable distribution of the property was not brought during the mother’s minority or within three years thereafter pursuant to the savings clause for minors under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-59" target="_self">15-1-59</a></cite>. Nichols v. Funderburk, 881 So. 2d 266, 2003 Miss. App. LEXIS 1036 (Miss. Ct.

   Where plaintiff presented sufficient evidence on the issue of her unsoundness of mind to shift the burden of proof to defendant and a review of the testimony indicated that plaintiff was not in effective control of the day-to-day affairs of her family, the court could not rely on this evidence to support a finding that the tolling provisions of Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-59" target="_self">15-1-59</a></cite> were inapplicable. Hampton v. Gannett Co., 296 F. Supp. 2d 716, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22788 (S.D.

   Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.11.html#t11c07s11-7-13" target="_blank">11-7-13</a></cite>, the minor was governed by the same statute of limitations as the decedent’s administratrix.

   Provisions of the minor’s savings statute,

Thus, the statute of limitations runs against both the personal representative of the deceased and the deceased’s children.

       In a child support matter, more than seven years had passed since the eldest child had become 21; therefore, his claim was barred by the statute of limitations, but the claim of his sister was still viable, and the father did not waive the defense by failing to raise it as an affirmative defense in the pleadings when no pleading was required.

       The statute of limitations was not tolled for unsoundness of mind, notwithstanding evidence that the plaintiff received social security disability for schizophrenia, where the trial judge found that the plaintiff was capable of managing his own affairs, managed his own money, hired an attorney to file three lawsuits, and testified very coherently and competently at his discovery depositions.

      </p>
      <p>
       Unadjudicated unsoundness of mind can be sufficient to trigger the savings statute; a legal adjudication of incompetency is not necessary to toll the statute of limitations if sufficient evidence exists to show that the victim was mentally incompetent at the time the cause of action accrued.

   An insurer was notified of a claim, which arose from an automobile accident between an insured and an uninsured motorist, well within the applicable 6-year statute of limitations set forth in §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-49" target="_self">15-1-49</a></cite>, even though the insurer was first notified of the accident approximately 6 1/2 years after the date of the accident, where the insured was 17 years old when she was injured in the accident, and therefore, pursuant to §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-59" target="_self">15-1-59</a></cite>, the statute of limitations did not begin to run against her until she reached her 21st birthday.

       Although plaintiff alleged in this medical malpractice action that she had been of unsound mind since she was a child and that the circuit court erred in finding the evidence insufficient to establish that her mental condition tolled the statute of limitations, there was no evidence that plaintiff suffered from any kind of mental illness or that she had been found to be permanently disabled because of a mental illness.

       Plaintiff’s tort action based on events that occurred when he was 19 years old was timely as it was filed less than three years after his 21st birthday; removal of the disability of minority did not arise automatically upon the occurrence of specified events except for reaching the age of 21, and thus, plaintiff’s emancipation did not trigger the automatic removal of disability of minority.

       Registration of a child support order was timely because the three-year statute of limitations applicable to the father under Mississippi law was tolled while the child remained a minor. The tolling applied to the mother and the State, though neither was under such a disability, and the child was twelve years old in January, 1999. Shelnut v.

   Chancery court did not err in granting a wife an interest in a husband’s retirement account to secure child support; thus, the statute of limitations on the wife’s action based on a domestic judgment under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-43" target="_self">15-1-43</a></cite> was tolled by the child support exception of Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-59" target="_self">15-1-59</a></cite> because the retirement funds, though put in the wife’s name, were child support payments. Carlson v.

   Son was still a minor when the mother initiated the contempt action; thus, pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-59" target="_self">15-1-59</a></cite>, the statute of limitations had not run on the father’s child support obligations. It therefore followed that even if the father had obtained a ruling on his affirmative defense of laches, it would have availed him naught. Durr v. Durr, 912 So. 2d 1033, 2005 Miss.

   In a contempt proceeding for the husband’s failure to pay child support, the affirmative defense of statute of limitations was not waived because, although the husband filed an answer, no such pleading was required under Miss. R. Civ. P. 12(b) and 81(d)(2), (4); thus, the husband had the right to raise the defense at any stage and the statute of limitations would bar any claims filed seven years after the youngest child reached the age of 21 pursuant to Miss.

   Under the holding in Pioneer Community Hospital of Newton v. Roberts, the appellate court found the minor savings statute, Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-59" target="_self">15-1-59</a></cite>, tolled the statute of limitations and prevented the dismissal of a minor’s wrongful-death complaint against a psychiatrist who treated the minor’s father. Irby v. Madakasira, 252 So.3d 614, 2018 Miss. App. LEXIS 277 (Miss. Ct. App.), cert. denied, 250 So.3d 1271, 2018 Miss. LEXIS 375 (Miss. 2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       Only when someone who is qualified to bring a wrongful-death suit actually files a wrongful-death suit on the minor beneficiaries’ behalf will the minors savings clause not apply, because, once the suit is filed, the running of the statute of limitations is immaterial.

       To the extent the supreme court held in Curry v. Turner, 832 So. 2d 508 (Miss. 2002), that the mere existence of a person of majority age with statutory standing to file a wrongful-death suit prevents the application of the minors savings clause, the supreme court explicitly overrules this holding; instead, Curry should be limited to its facts.

   To the extent Curry v. Turner, 832 So. 2d 508 (Miss. 2002), held that the mere existence of someone qualified to bring a wrongful-death suit created an irreconcilable conflict between Miss.

Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-59" target="_self">15-1-59</a></cite> and precluded the application of the latter statute, the supreme court explicitly overrules this part of its holding.

       Circuit court properly denied a hospital and a doctor summary judgment because the minors savings statute applied, and thus, the deceased’s oldest child had two years from when she reached the age of majority to file a wrongful-death suit based on medical negligence; the deceased’s two minor children could rely on the application of the minors savings clause to toll the running of the two-year statute of limitations, and the oldest child timely filed her complaint within two-year period.

       Circuit court erred in dismissing a driver’s personal injury complaint with prejudice because the driver exhibited good cause for not timely serving process on the insured where the record clearly showed that over a period of almost two years, the driver unsuccessfully attempted to locate the insured, the Secretary of State attempted to forward the summons to the insured, but it was returned unclaimed, the insured could not be located by the driver, the courts, or his own insurance carrier, and the circuit court failed to consider that the statute of limitations could be tolled. Darville v. Mejia, 184 So.3d 312, 2016 Miss. App. LEXIS 3 (Miss. Ct. App. 2016).
      </p>

       <p>
   A plaintiff seeking to benefit from §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-63" target="_self">15-1-63</a></cite> must have been unable to effect service on the defendant during the period for which it is claimed the statute is tolled-i.e., the defendant must have left the state and not be amenable to service under a long-arm statute or other means because, for example, his or her whereabouts are unknown; the statute of limitations is not tolled where the plaintiff knew or should have known of the defendant’s whereabouts. Sullivan v. Trustmark Nat'l Bank, 653 So. 2d 930, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 196 (Miss. 1995).

   Under §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-63" target="_self">15-1-63</a></cite>, the burden of proving that the defendant was absent and not amenable to service is on the plaintiff. Sullivan v. Trustmark Nat'l Bank, 653 So. 2d 930, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 196 (Miss. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       If a plaintiff can obtain process on a non-resident defendant, in a suit filed under the long arm statute, he will not be excused for his failure to sue and will not be entitled to claim that the statute of limitations is tolled during the absence of the defendant from the state; if a plaintiff makes such a claim, the burden is on him to show the duration of the defendant’s absence from the state and to show that defendant cannot be served with process under any of the ways provided by the long arm statute.

       A suit on a credit memorandum issued to plaintiff in 1958 was barred by the 6 year statute of limitations where the period for demand was not indefinite, where plaintiff made no attempt to use the credit between 1958 and 1972, and where it did not communicate with defendant at all concerning the credit between 1963 and 1972; nor was the statute of limitations tolled until defendant’s successor corporation first qualified to do business in Mississippi where such contention was raised for the first time on appeal and there was no showing that consideration of such issue was necessary to prevent a miscarriage of justice. Valley Cement Industries, Inc. v. Midco Equipment Co., 570 F.2d 1241, 1978 U.S. App. LEXIS 11819 (5th Cir. Miss. 1978).

       Tolling provision has never been applied to a defendant who was amenable to service of process simply because the defendant’s alleged wrongful conduct was not known to the plaintiff; rather, the statute of limitations is tolled because, and only if, the defendant has removed himself or herself from the State and the reach of service of process.

       Where an action on a promissory note was instituted in Mississippi and the note had been executed in Alabama, this statute [Code 1942, § 740] tolling the statute of limitations where there is an absence from the state was not applicable, for the absence relied on was from Alabama and not from Mississippi.

       The doctrine of forum non conveniens will never be applied to dismiss a case if it is barred elsewhere by a statute of limitations, unless or until the defendant is willing to stipulate that he or she will waive the statute of limitations defense.

       In action brought in District Court in Mississippi, fact that statute of limitations of another state, which state has most significant relationship to occurrence and parties, is deemed procedural does not preclude application of Mississippi’s “following statute”, so as to make other state’s one year limitations period applicable to products liability in negligence claims against seller of cash register.

       Where a cause of action arising in Kansas which would have been barred by the Kansas statute of limitations had the action been brought in Kansas was timely filed in Mississippi under Mississippi’s statute of limitations against a defendant who was a nonresident of Mississippi, the Mississippi statute of limitations was appropriate where the Kansas statute of limitations was considered procedural rather than substantive by Kansas courts.

     <p>
      If a person liable to any personal action shall fraudulently conceal the cause of action from the knowledge of the person entitled thereto, the cause of action shall be deemed to have first accrued at, and not before, the time at which such fraud shall be, or with reasonable diligence might have been, first known or discovered.

       Where lenders made a sufficient showing of affirmative acts by a borrower to conceal a fraud in the inducement claim, it was a matter for the jury to consider whether the claim was fraudulently concealed from the lenders until discovered. Whitaker v. Limeco Corp., 32 So.3d 429, 2010 Miss. LEXIS 182 (Miss. 2010).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Trial court erred in granting summary judgment to a manufacturer of poultry houses and a general contractor, in a suit brought by farmers, because, under either an equitable-estoppel theory or the fraudulent-concealment exception of Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-67" target="_self">15-1-67</a></cite>, the application of Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-41" target="_self">15-1-41</a></cite> could be barred. Windham v. Latco of Miss., Inc., 972 So. 2d 608, 2008 Miss. LEXIS 44 (Miss. 2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       Clients’ claim of fraudulent concealment was hollow where they presented no evidence to satisfy the test for fraudulent concealment; they offered no evidence to back up their bare assertion that the attorneys fraudulently concealed their alleged negligence, and the clients made no offering of any affirmative act designed to conceal a cause of action. Channel v. Loyacono, 954 So. 2d 415, 2007 Miss. LEXIS 223 (Miss. 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Six-year limitation of Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-41" target="_self">15-1-41</a></cite> is not affected by the date of accrual, and by extension not tolled by Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-67" target="_self">15-1-67</a></cite>; therefore, summary judgment was properly granted to a builder and a manufacturer in a property damage case arising from leaky roofs on chicken houses where a lawsuit was not filed until 2004, despite the fact that the leaks began shortly after completion in 1995 or 1996. Windham v. Latco of Miss., Inc., 972 So. 2d 652, 2007 Miss. App. LEXIS 49 (Miss. Ct. App. 2007), rev'd, 972 So. 2d 608, 2008 Miss. LEXIS 44 (Miss. 2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       Concealment statute does not affect the statute of repose as the statute of repose operates independently of causes of action and by its nature bars hidden claims and accruals of causes of action are irrelevant to its operation. Estes v. Bradley, 954 So. 2d 455, 2006 Miss. App. LEXIS 912 (Miss. Ct. App. 2006), overruled in part, Windham v. Latco of Miss., Inc., 972 So. 2d 608, 2008 Miss. LEXIS 44 (Miss. 2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trustee alleged no specific affirmative act by the company to conceal the true amount of royalties owed the trust; thus, his claim of fraudulent concealment had no merit, and the statute of limitations was not tolled. Nygaard v. Getty Oil Co., 918 So. 2d 1237, 2005 Miss. LEXIS 422 (Miss. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Insureds simply made vaguely referenced misrepresentations and concealment attributable to the insurer without specifying any factual basis for those assertions. Therefore, the fraudulent concealment doctrine did not apply to the their fraud claims and summary judgment for the insurer was proper. Robinson v. Southern Farm Bureau Cas. Co., 915 So. 2d 516, 2005 Miss. App. LEXIS 967 (Miss. Ct. App. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       To toll the limitation period, a plaintiff must prove that the defendant engaged in affirmative acts of concealment, that the plaintiff acted with due diligence in attempting to discover the claim, and that the plaintiff was unable to do so. Frye v. Am. Gen. Fin., Inc., 304 F. Supp. 2d 876, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8489 (S.D. Miss.), amended, 307 F. Supp. 2d 836, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19108 (S.D. Miss. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       To avail themselves of the doctrine of fraudulent concealment to toll the running of the limitations period, plaintiffs have a twofold obligation to demonstrate that (1) some affirmative act or conduct was done and prevented discovery of a claim, and (2) due diligence was performed on their part to discover it. Anderson v. City Fin. Co., 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25226 (S.D. Miss. July 11, 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       Action by plaintiff against former employer for slander was time-barred where publication took place more than one year prior to institution of action, despite fact that plaintiff did not discover defamatory statements until more than one year after they were made. EEOC v. Southern Pub. Co., 732 F. Supp. 682, 1988 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17306 (S.D. Miss. 1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       A cause of action for malpractice does not accrue, so as to set the statute of limitations to running while the doctor concealed the facts from the patient. Sheets v. Burman, 322 F.2d 277, 1963 U.S. App. LEXIS 4269 (5th Cir. Miss. 1963).
      </p>
      <p>
       The liability of an attorney for breach of duty attaches immediately upon the breach, and the statute of limitations begins to run then, unless there is fraudulent concealment of the cause of action, in which case it begins to run from its discovery, or from the time when reasonable diligence would have led to its discovery. Hudson v. Kimbrough, 74 Miss. 341, 20 So. 885, 1896 Miss. LEXIS 131 (Miss. 1896).

Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-67" target="_self">15-1-67</a></cite> because there was no evidence that the State affirmatively concealed its protocol governing the manner in which it carried out executions or that the inmates were unaware that a 42 U.S.C.S. § 1983 action was the proper method for challenging the State’s lethal injection protocol. Walker v. Epps, 587 F. Supp. 2d 763, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 53793 (N.D. Miss.), aff'd, 550 F.3d 407, 2008 U.S. App. LEXIS 25327 (5th Cir. Miss. 2008).

       Growers failed to demonstrate any affirmative act on the part of the farm to conceal any information and did not provide any details of how the farm concealed its alleged fraudulent actions; merely alleging that the other side had complete control of the data would not suffice; the growers did not demonstrate any action by them to obtain any of the allegedly concealed information. Sanderson Farms, Inc. (Prod. Div.) v. Ballard, 917 So. 2d 783, 2005 Miss. LEXIS 660 (Miss. 2005).

Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-49" target="_self">15-1-49</a></cite> and the statute was not tolled because the borrower received, but did not read, copies of all pertinent documents, which clearly stated that credit insurance was optional. Bell v. Am. Gen. Fin., Inc., 267 F. Supp. 2d 582, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10718 (S.D. Miss. 2003).

       Any reliance plaintiffs may have placed on the oral statements of the loan agents regarding credit life insurance that were contradicted by the express language of the loan agreements was per se unreasonable, and such oral statements could not constitute fraudulent concealment.

Ross v. Citifinancial, Inc., 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 26733 (S.D. Miss. Mar. 18, 2002), amended, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 26740 (S.D. Miss.

       In order for a particular misrepresentation to constitute fraud which would toll the statute of limitations, it must be made under such circumstances, and be of such nature, that a reasonably prudent person would act thereon.

       Tolling provision in this statute had no application because the causes of action for wrongful death, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and civil conspiracy were not concealed from an administrator; an attempt to beat a murder charge based on the actions alleged in the instant case did not prevent the administrator from discovering potential civil claims.

       Although a buyer alleged that a software seller tried to conceal integration problems by blaming the buyer for customizing the software, and by trying to convince the buyer to upgrade to a newer version of the software, the buyer failed to demonstrate how the seller’s alleged conduct could and did prevent the buyer from discovering its claim. Buyer could not reasonably rely on the representations it cited, and the record was simply absent of any evidence that it did. Peavey Elecs. Corp. v. Baan U.S.A., Inc., 10 So.3d 945, 2009 Miss.

       Where, there being no administration of a decedent’s estate, the decedent’s brother collected payment on a mortgage, owned by the decedent, and paid the amount received to the decedent’s widow and son, the limitation statute applicable to cases of concealed fraud was not available in an action by the daughters of the decedent to recover from the brother’s estate their share of the amount paid over by him to the wife and son, since there was no proof of any fraud and concealment, the mortgage had been recorded on the day of its execution, which was sufficient to put the daughters on notice of its existence, and everything that was thereafter done about it was at all times easily ascertainable by the daughters upon the exercise of any reasonable diligence.

   In a medical malpractice case in which the first action filed by the survivors and heirs of the deceased was clearly filed within the two-year statute of limitations found in Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-36ol12" target="_self">15-1-36(2)</a></cite>, but was dismissed pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-36ol115" target="_self">15-1-36(15)</a></cite> because they had not provided the required notice to the hospital and the healthcare provider prior to filing and the hospital and the healthcare provider filed a motion for summary judgment to dismiss the second medical malpractice suit as untimely, the Saving Statute, Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-69" target="_self">15-1-69</a></cite>, applied to the second filing, and it was not untimely. The first case had been duly commenced. Herrington v. Promise Specialty Hosp., 665 F. Supp. 2d 708, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 90509 (S.D. Miss. 2009).

   Savings statute, Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-69" target="_self">15-1-69</a></cite>, is designed as remedial legislation intended to protect the good-faith efforts of plaintiffs who make a simple mistake; the statute is not designed to penalize plaintiffs and bar the continuation of an ongoing suit because the drafters of the law surely did not intend that a suit automatically abate or be dismissed upon the death of a party. Harris v. Darby, 17 So.3d 1076, 2009 Miss. LEXIS 447 (Miss. 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Trial court erred in granting a doctor and a medical practice summary judgment in an executrix’s medical malpractice action on the ground that the executrix’s motion to substitute parties pursuant to Miss. R. Civ. P. 25 was barred by Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-69" target="_self">15-1-69</a></cite> because §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-69" target="_self">15-1-69</a></cite> was inapplicable when the action was never abated or dismissed in any manner; had the trial court dismissed the case without prejudice, the savings statute would have applied, and the executrix would have had a full year from that dismissal to re-file the suit, but since the trial court granted summary judgment, it did not trigger the statute. Harris v. Darby, 17 So.3d 1076, 2009 Miss. LEXIS 447 (Miss. 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a plaintiff has been defeated by some matter not affecting the merits, some defect or informality, which he can remedy or avoid by a new process, the statute of limitations shall not prevent him from doing so, provided he follows it promptly, by suit within a year; Mississippi’s savings statute is highly remedial, and it ought to be liberally construed. However, the plaintiff must have exercised good faith in filing the first action in the wrong court. Estate of Boles v. Nat'l Heritage Realty, Inc., 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 55825 (N.D. Miss. June 23, 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although an appellate court rendered void ab initio a wrongful death action because the administratrix lacked standing to file a wrongful death action as a result of the chancery court’s lack of subject matter jurisdiction over the estate, regardless of whether the estate’s first complaint tolled the statute of limitations, the savings statute applied to save the cause of action, and Tolliver did not address the application of the savings statute. The savings statute saved the otherwise time-barred cause of action. Estate of Boles v. Nat'l Heritage Realty, Inc., 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 55825 (N.D. Miss. June 23, 2009).

Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-69" target="_self">15-1-69</a></cite> did not apply to the MTCA, and it is worth noting that non-tort claims act cases are not controlling as to the applicability of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-69" target="_self">15-1-69</a></cite>, and because the MTCA has a one-year statute of limitation that is significantly shorter than the catchall three-year statute of limitation, the one-year statute of limitation found in Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.11.html#t11c46s11-46-11" target="_blank">11-46-11</a></cite> is controlling; thus, the court rejected the parents’ claim that Miss. Code Ann. § 15-1-69 applied to the MTCA to toll the statute of limitation under Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.11.html#t11c46s11-46-1" target="_blank">11-46-1</a></cite>1. Stockstill v. State, 854 So. 2d 1017, 2003 Miss. LEXIS 449 (Miss. 2003).

       This section is applicable to orders dismissing suits for lack of jurisdiction, and thus operated to save a personal injury action which was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction and refiled a few days beyond six years after plaintiff had reached majority, but within one year from the date of dismissal.

Because the action was not abated upon husband’s death, Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-69" target="_self">15-1-69</a></cite> was inapplicable. Carlisle v.

       Defendants argued that there was substantial ground for difference of opinion as courts in other jurisdictions have come to contrary conclusions as to the application of their own states’ savings statutes in similar circumstances; however, it was of no consequence to the case that Missouri, Kansas, Utah, Colorado, or any other state would choose not to apply its own savings statute in the circumstances. The issue was whether Mississippi would apply its savings statute, and defendants did not present any evidence that there was substantial ground for a difference of opinion as to that issue.

   While the wrongful death beneficiaries’ first lawsuit against a railway in federal court when their relative was killed in a railroad crossing accident was timely commenced, and the instant state action was for the same cause of action, dismissal of their state action was proper as their voluntary dismissal of the first federal lawsuit without prejudice did not fall within the protection of Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-69" target="_self">15-1-69</a></cite>; a voluntary withdrawal did not constitute the “accidental” or “inadvertent” failure of an action, nor were the beneficiaries “defeated” within the meaning of the savings statute when they were nonsuited upon their own request.

   In November 1997, plaintiff brought suit for wrongful death, but the record reflected that she failed to properly serve process upon defendant within 120 days. Because process was not served within the 120-day period as provided by Miss. R. Civ. P. 4(h), the running of the statute of limitations resumed; further, the statute of limitations ran in March, 2000, some 14 months prior to defendant’s motion to dismiss and some 19 months prior to plaintiff’s filing of a second identical wrongful death action, and therefore, when plaintiff filed her second action, the three year statute of limitation set forth in Miss.

       Mississippi Supreme Court’s analysis as to whether a dismissal is for a matter of form focuses on the content or substance of the record to determine the purpose or reason for the dismissal; within the context of the savings statute, avoidance or defeat for lack of subject matter jurisdiction is avoidance or defeat for a matter of form. Furthermore, standing is an aspect of subject matter jurisdiction. Estate of Boles v. Nat'l Heritage Realty, Inc., 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 55825 (N.D. Miss. June 23, 2009).

       Chancery court properly ruled that a teacher’s claim for relief was barred by the statute of limitations because she failed to refile her complaint in chancery court until she again alleged a breach of contract and sexual discrimination as an original complaint; since the teacher failed to properly perfect an appeal of the school district’s decision affirming her termination and to obtain federal ancillary jurisdiction over her state-law claim, no tolling of the statute of limitations occurred.

   In a case in which plaintiff filed a petition to perpetuate testimony in a circuit court, the matter was then removed to federal court, wherein plaintiff sought dismissal, and plaintiff filed a complaint in the circuit court raising the same claims against the same parties before the federal court had dismissed the matter, the circuit court erred in dismissing plaintiff’s post-dismissal complaint because the record supported a finding that the federal court’s dismissal was based upon a “matter of form” not affecting the merits–namely, a lack of jurisdiction due to the absence of a complaint–as its order stated that no “civil action” yet existed. Plaintiff had inadvertently found himself in a procedural quagmire, but he made a good-faith effort to preserve his claim, at no time envincing an intent to abandon his claim, and, accordingly, application of the savings statute, Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-69" target="_self">15-1-69</a></cite>, to his post-dismissal complaint was appropriate and consistent with the purposes of the statute because he filed the complaint within one year of the federal court’s dismissal.

     <p>
      All the provisions of this chapter shall apply to the case of any debt or demand on the contract, alleged by way of setoff on the part of a defendant. The time of limitation of such debt or demand shall be computed in like manner as if an action had been commenced therefor at the time when the plaintiff’s action was commenced. The fact that a setoff is barred shall not preclude the defendant from using it as such if he held it against the debt sued on before it was barred.

       Contract between corporation and holder of notes and salary claims against it whereby notes were to be held in escrow for two years to abide payment of a new note given by the corporation to such creditor, payment of which would liquidate the original claims but if the lieu note was not paid at maturity, the original notes would be redelivered and the entire account made current, constituted an acknowledgment in writing of the debt removing the claims from the bar of the respective statutes of limitation.

       Even though partial payment on a note executed and delivered in Alabama might operate in substance as a new promise under the Alabama law, the Mississippi statute relating to the remedy would be applicable in case of an attempt to enforce the obligation in Mississippi, and therefore such payments in Alabama would not toll the running of the limitation period, in view of a statutory provision that in actions founded upon contracts the case would not be taken out of the operation of the limitation statute, unless an acknowledgment or promise of the indebtedness should be made in writing signed by the party chargeable therewith.

       An action to enforce the obligations of a party to pay a nonnegotiable promissory note payable at a definite time must be commenced within six (6) years after the due date or dates stated in the promissory note, or if a due date is accelerated, within six (6) years after the accelerated date.
      </li>
      <li id="t15c01s15-1-81ol12">
       If demand for payment is made to the maker of a nonnegotiable promissory note payable on demand, an action to enforce the obligation of a party to pay the promissory note must be commenced within six (6) years after the demand. If no demand for payment is made to the maker, an action to enforce the promissory note is barred if neither principal nor interest on the promissory note has been paid for a continuous period of ten (10) years.
      </li>
      <li id="t15c01s15-1-81ol13">
       For purposes of this section, a “nonnegotiable promissory note” is an unconditional written undertaking to pay absolutely and in any event a fixed amount of money signed by the person undertaking to pay the money that is not an “instrument” under Section 75-3-104(b). Nonnegotiable promissory notes for purposes of this section include, but are not limited to, promissory notes that: (a) bear a variable rate of interest or provide for interest by reference to information not contained in the promissory note; (b) provide for interest after default; (c) are nonrecourse to the person undertaking to pay the money; or (d) qualify as “instruments” under Section 75-9-102(a)(47).

       This section shall not apply to negotiable promissory notes, drafts, checks, certificates of deposit or any other instrument or item for which Section 75-3-118 provides the applicable statute of limitations. Neither a lease nor a security agreement is a promissory note for purposes of this section. A promissory note is not investment property as defined in Section 75-9-102(a)(49), a letter of credit, or writings that evidence a right to payment arising out of the use of a credit or charge card or information contained on or for use with the card. It is the intention of this section that a “note,” as defined in Section 75-3-104(e), and nonnegotiable promissory notes, as defined in this section, shall have the same statutes of limitations.
      </li>
      <li id="t15c01s15-1-81ol15">
       This section shall not apply to obligations arising from retail installment contracts. For purposes of this section, a “retail installment contract” is a contract for the sale of goods under which the buyer makes periodic payments and the seller retains a security interest in the goods. For the purposes of this section, “goods” have the same meaning as the definition of “goods” in Section 75-9-102(a)(44).

      <li id="t15c01s15-1-81ol16">
       This section takes effect on July 1, 2012, and shall apply to all nonnegotiable promissory notes for which the statute of limitations in effect immediately prior to that date has not run. This section shall have no application to promissory notes for which the statute of limitations has run prior to July 1, 2012.

       Even if there was no enforceable contract, a seller was estopped from denying the deal he struck with a purchaser because the purchaser detrimentally relied on seller’s inducements, most notably selling his home. Swartzfager v. Saul, 213 So.3d 55, 2017 Miss. LEXIS 67 (Miss. 2017).
      </p>
      <p>
       Constructive trusts are not subject to the statute of frauds. Allred v. Fairchild, 785 So. 2d 1064, 2001 Miss. LEXIS 143 (Miss. 2001).

       A party may waive the protection of the Statute of Frauds. Canizaro v. Mobile Communications Corp. of Am., 655 So. 2d 25, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 138 (Miss. 1995).

       Security agreements relating to collateral in possession of secured party are not required to be in writing, subject to applicability of the statute of frauds. In re Viscount Furniture Corp., 133 B.R. 360, 1991 Bankr. LEXIS 1630 (Bankr. N.D. Miss. 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where plaintiff, recipient of certain scholarship funds as financial assistance for medical school costs and tuition, was required to fulfill 4 year service obligation at approved health care facility, and signed private practice assignment agreement with health care facility, with such agreement stating that it would be “negotiable at the end of one year”, and accepted employment there, but was terminated 10 months later with the termination being memorialized as a non-renewal of employment agreement, claim by plaintiff regarding alleged unwritten contract for 4 years is barred by statute of frauds. Regarding one year contract of employment: duration of plaintiff’s contract of employment was not to be confused with existence of an adequate writing to satisfy statute of frauds, and employment agreement relied upon by the plaintiff constitutes sufficient written evidence of a one year contract of employment to satisfy requirement of statute of frauds. Robinson v. Coastal Family Health Center, Inc., 756 F. Supp. 958, 1990 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18728 (S.D. Miss. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       Statute of frauds does not represent proper basis for dismissal of complaint for wrongful termination prior to end of first year of employment, but conversely, neither does it bar any claim that plaintiff had oral 4 year contract of employment with defendant. Robinson v. Coastal Family Health Center, Inc., 756 F. Supp. 958, 1990 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18728 (S.D. Miss. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       A contract to devise or bequeath property by will is enforceable, but must be in writing pursuant to the statute of frauds. Although a party may satisfy the court of the existence of an unwritten agreement to devise, the statute of frauds precludes specific performance as a remedy, even where the promisee has done all he or she was expected to do under the agreement. Williams v. Mason, 556 So. 2d 1045, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 34 (Miss. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       The statute of frauds does not bar an action for damages based on fraud even though the promise underlying the fraud is itself unenforceable under the statute of frauds. Crystal Springs Ins. Agency, Inc. v. Commercial Union Ins. Co., 554 So. 2d 884, 1989 Miss. LEXIS 490 (Miss. 1989).
      </p>
      <p>
       The doctrine of equitable estoppel may be pled as an exception in any case where the statute of frauds is asserted as a defense. Bowers Window & Door Co. v. Dearman, 549 So. 2d 1309, 1989 Miss. LEXIS 433 (Miss. 1989).
      </p>
      <p>
       Statute of frauds does not apply to claim arising from negligent misrepresentation made in letter by bank written to importer regarding financial arrangements made by bank with manufacturer purchasing material from importer; even if statute did apply, doctrine of equitable estoppel would take case outside statute. Shogyo International Corp. v. First Nat'l Bank, 475 So. 2d 425, 1985 Miss. LEXIS 2180 (Miss. 1985).

   Equitable estoppel is exception to §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c03s15-3-1" target="_self">15-3-1</a></cite>. PMZ Oil Co. v. Lucroy, 449 So. 2d 201, 1984 Miss. LEXIS 1676 (Miss. 1984).

   Even though §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c03s15-3-1ol1c" target="_self">15-3-1(c)</a></cite> provides that no contract for the conveyance of an interest in land is binding unless signed by the party to be charged, equitable estoppel is a well-established exception to the statute of frauds. PMZ Oil Co. v. Lucroy, 449 So. 2d 201, 1984 Miss. LEXIS 1676 (Miss. 1984).
      </p>
      <p>
       Grantee under deed attempted by interlineation to make his wife additional grantee by writing her name into deed following his signature; such addendum was written without knowledge of original grantor, was not signed by grantee, and was not acknowledged; held, interlineation was ineffective to convey title from either original grantor or from original grantee, as it was in conflict with this section. Perkins v. Kerby, 308 So. 2d 914, 1975 Miss. LEXIS 1857 (Miss. 1975), overruled in part, PMZ Oil Co. v. Lucroy, 449 So. 2d 201, 1984 Miss. LEXIS 1676 (Miss. 1984).
      </p>
      <p>
       The written authorization to enter into a contract may be found in a partnership agreement whereby one of the parties or corporations under his control were empowered to contract in the name of the latter. Morgan v. Jackson Ready-Mix Concrete, 247 Miss. 863, 157 So. 2d 772, 1963 Miss. LEXIS 365 (Miss. 1963).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where trust will result in absence of express agreement, fact that such agreement is made will not prevent trust from arising. Pitchford v. Howard, 208 Miss. 567, 45 So. 2d 142, 1950 Miss. LEXIS 275 (Miss. 1950).
      </p>
      <p>
       The statute of frauds is a personal privilege of the contracting parties sought to be charged, and is not available to anyone else in a collateral proceeding. Wirtz v. Gordon, 187 Miss. 866, 184 So. 798, 1938 Miss. LEXIS 321 (Miss. 1938); Grisham v. Lutric, 76 Miss. 444, 24 So. 169, 1898 Miss. LEXIS 73 (Miss. 1898).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where defendant’s testimony was objected to on ground it was effort to vary terms of note, but objections not ruled on, finding for plaintiff did not constitute holding that agreement had not been made, but indicated such issue was not decided. Southern Package Corp. v. Beall, 181 Miss. 740, 180 So. 789, 1938 Miss. LEXIS 114 (Miss. 1938).
      </p>
      <p>
       Fact that contract of sale was within statute did not relieve carrier from liability for damages caused by negligent delay. Parish & Co. v. Yazoo & M. V. R. Co., 103 Miss. 288, 60 So. 322, 1912 Miss. LEXIS 171 (Miss. 1912).

      <p>
       Statute of frauds did not bar claim by purported partners because the partners’ claims did not involve a dispute over a contract for the sale of lands, but a dispute over partnership profits and assets. An otherwise enforceable verbal partnership agreement did not constitute a contract for the sale of lands under the statute of frauds simply because the purpose of the partnership included the purchase of real estate. Latham v. Johnson, 262 So.3d 569, 2018 Miss. App. LEXIS 314 (Miss. Ct. App. 2018), cert. denied, 260 So.3d 798, 2019 Miss. LEXIS 48 (Miss. 2019).

       If the mobile home purchaser were seeking damages for the breach of debtor’s agreement to sell the mobile home in January 2007 then the Statute of Frauds would apply. But he was seeking to recover damages for fraud, and, therefore, the Statute of Frauds did not preclude his claim. Thomas v. Rice (In re Rice), 526 B.R. 631, 2015 Bankr. LEXIS 527 (Bankr. N.D. Miss. 2015).
      </p>
      <p>
       Insurance agent’s assertion that claims by intended insurance beneficiaries were barred by the statute of frauds because the change of beneficiary was not done in writing and approved, as required, lacked merit because the statute of frauds only affected matters prior to the execution of the contract or policy; as the issue involved the change of beneficiaries after the execution of the policy, the statute was inapplicable. Strait v. McPhail, 145 So.3d 696, 2013 Miss. App. LEXIS 768 (Miss. Ct. App. 2013), rev'd, 145 So.3d 664, 2014 Miss. LEXIS 422 (Miss. 2014).

Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="gov.ms.code.title.77.html#t77c09s77-9-715" target="_blank">77-9-715</a></cite>, the constructive license did not violate the statute of frauds, Miss. Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c03s15-3-1" target="_self">15-3-1</a></cite>, because the statute of frauds did not apply given that the telephone company’s rights arose by operation of law and did not come from a contract. Marlow, LLC v. BellSouth Telecomms., Inc., 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 54309 (S.D. Miss. May 18, 2011), aff'd in part and rev'd in part, 686 F.3d 303, 2012 U.S. App. LEXIS 13425 (5th Cir. Miss. 2012).
      </p>

       Where an amendment to a building purchase and sale agreement, stipulating that the inspection period had expired and the buyers had no further right to terminate the agreement, was signed by the buyers, and then delivered to the sellers, one of whom assented by his signature and the other two communicated their assent to the buyers via email from their agent, the amendment was enforceable against the buyers; the statute of frauds did not require that each of the sellers sign the document in order to enforce it, much less that they had to sign it in order to manifest assent to its terms.

       Trial court’s grant of an injunction that prohibited a city from providing water to areas outside the city that had recently been annexed was reversed as the utility company’s predecessor in interest had granted the city the right to provide such service. Even though the original agreement was not produced, the agreement was not subject to the statute of frauds as it was not a contract for the sale of land or a lease that ran for longer than a year, and its terms could have been proven by parole evidence.

       The statute of frauds did not bar a broker’s breach of contract action arising from an oral brokerage agreement, under which the broker undertook to secure a particular corporation as a customer of another corporation for the purchase of its products, where the broker had secured the corporation as a customer for those products and had therefore fully performed its part of the agreement.

       Although an action to enforce an oral agreement to devise real property in return for a loan would be unenforceable under the statute of frauds, the claim would be upheld against the estate of the deceased debtor where the claimant did not seek enforcement of the agreement, but probated the agreement for recovery of the indebtedness, which was a consideration for it.

       If in a suit on a promissory note the defendants set up by way of set-off and testify to the terms of a parol contract between the parties and services rendered thereunder, it is competent for the plaintiff to state in evidence his version of the contract, even though the terms thereof, as testified to by plaintiff, make the contract within the statute.

      </h4>
      <p>
       Nothing in the statute of frauds requires that the contract itself be in writing. The statute is satisfied so long as there is “some memorandum or note thereof.” For the prevention of frauds, the statute merely prescribes the form a part of the evidence must take. Oral testimony regarding the fact is admissible as well. Where the writing has been destroyed or is presently unavailable, the parties may employ parol evidence to prove “both its existence and contents.” The “memorandum or note” serves but to show a basis for believing that the offered oral evidence rests on a real action, and that a contract to sell has been made between the parties. Putt v. Corinth, 579 So. 2d 534, 1991 Miss. LEXIS 178 (Miss. 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   When a writing or memorandum is lost or destroyed, both its existence and contents may be proven by parol evidence; the loss or destruction of a memorandum does not deprive it of effect under the Statute of Frauds. Thus, §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-29" target="_self">15-1-29</a></cite>, §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c01s15-1-73" target="_self">15-1-73</a></cite> and the Statute of Frauds (§<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c03s15-3-1" target="_self">15-3-1</a></cite>) did not bar an action to enforce a loan agreement which was allegedly destroyed in a fire where the plaintiff sufficiently proved the existence and contents of the destroyed memorandum. Williams v. Evans, 547 So. 2d 54, 1989 Miss. LEXIS 335 (Miss. 1989).
      </p>
      <p>
       The rule that a written contract cannot be changed or modified by parol evidence of what was said and done by the parties at the time of making of the contract does not preclude the subsequent parol modification of the written contract, provided the contract is not one which under the statute is required to be in writing. Nason v. Morrissey, 218 Miss. 601, 67 So. 2d 506, 1953 Miss. LEXIS 576 (Miss. 1953).

       When grantee or devisee obtains possession and title to land intended for another by actual fraud, on proof of the fraud a trust will be raised in favor of the latter, and the trust may be established by parol.

       The minutes of a city’s public utility commission, which were signed by the president and secretary of the utilities commission, were approved at a subsequent meeting, and evidenced an intent to buy land, identify the land, and set out the purchase price, were sufficient to constitute a “memorandum or note” satisfying the statute of frauds.

Code Ann. §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c03s15-3-1" target="_self">15-3-1</a></cite> to avoid liability under a guaranty contract because there remained genuine issues of material fact as to whether the guarantor promised to pay the seller’s customer’s entire debt; there remained genuine issues of fact as to whether the seller relied to its detriment on the guarantor’s signing of a guaranty where the evidence showed that although the seller did not do any further business with the customer, the seller asserted that in reliance on the guaranty, it did not repossess the equipment and materials that the customer had in her possession; and it could not be held as a matter of law that the guarantor could not reasonably have expected that the seller would rely on his alleged promise in this way.

       Summary judgment was properly awarded to a mortgagee in a mortgagor’s action for wrongful foreclosure because an alleged agreement between the mortgagor and a bank teller that the mortgagor’s two payments on the loan would stop foreclosure proceedings was barred by the statute of frauds; there was no additional consideration for the alleged forbearance by the mortgagee.

       Trail court did not err by rejecting a seller’s notion that a writing was merely an undelivered gift inter vivos because the purchaser could have asserted equity rights, certainly more than a mere “dispute or controversy” between himself and the seller over the property; the seller’s own hand-picked wording in the writing acknowledged that the contract was made after the seller received good and valuable consideration.

       In an action by a homeowners’ association to enforce a lien on defendant’s property after defendant had failed to pay an annual assessment to the association for maintenance of common areas, the chancery court properly ruled that the assessment was a covenant running with the land and that defendant was liable, despite defendant’s contentions that the action was barred by the statute of frauds since there was no signed writing binding defendant to pay the fee, and since the amount of the assessment was not set forth in the deed; the deed provided that defendant was required to pay an assessment, and defendant could not claim the benefit conferred by the deed and renounce the covenant. The statute of frauds has no application to a covenant running with the land even though the covenant imposes a burden on the land. William W. Bond, Jr. & Associates, Inc. v.

       In suits involving alleged oral agreements assertedly made by agents for the renewal or extension of written leases, the burden of proof is on the person asserting such an agreement not only to establish agency, but he must establish the agent’s authority as well. Stilley v. Illinois C. R. Co., 209 Miss. 414, 47 So. 2d 840, 1950 Miss. LEXIS 406 (Miss. 1950).

       Where written ten-year lease gave lessee option of renewal for additional five years on same terms, was assigned and lessee’s assignee remained in possession after expiration of original term, exclusion of lease and assignment from evidence in action for rent by lessor’s successor in interest held error, since original parties to lease did not contemplate execution of new lease as necessary for renewal, and therefore original lease included the renewal term as covenant running with the land and satisfied statute of frauds after oral renewal.

       Transfer not fraudulent under statute where conveyance was to satisfy antecedent debts and advancements; to induce wife to put up money for husband’s bail and lawyer in murder case; [to settle property rights related to divorce,] where wife had filed for divorce earlier with property settlement unresolved, and as result of signing over property this removed any such issue from dispute concerning divorce, it having been held that transfer of money or property in good faith between husband and wife as settlement of property rights and in lieu of alimony in contemplation of divorce proceedings is not without sufficient consideration where divorce is subsequently obtained. Barbee v. Pigott, 507 So. 2d 77, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2475 (Miss. 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       When immediate family member is preferred as creditor, clear and satisfactory proof of valid and subsisting debt which would be enforced and payment exacted regardless of fortune or misfortune of debtor must be shown. Barbee v. Pigott, 507 So. 2d 77, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2475 (Miss. 1987).
      </p>

       Fraudulent conveyance with sole purpose of cheating creditors is void as to such creditors whether supported by consideration or not. Barbee v. Pigott, 507 So. 2d 77, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2475 (Miss. 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       If a bank withholds deed to it from record by agreement with its president, the grantor, to give him a fictitious credit, it is fraudulent in fact as against the president’s creditors who became such without notice of the deed, and the bank’s claim thereunder will be postponed to the rights of such creditors. Robertson & Co. v. Columbus Ins. & Banking Co., 85 Miss. 234, 38 So. 100 (Miss. 1904).
      </p>

       It has been held that this section [Code 1942, § 267] applies only to Code 1942, § 265 being inconsistent with Code 1942, § 266. Jennings v. Wilson, 71 Miss. 42, 14 So. 259, 1893 Miss. LEXIS 159 (Miss. 1893).

       A trial court properly dismissed a former wife’s fraudulent conveyance claim against her former husband, based upon the former husband’s conveyance of 15.2 acres of farm property to his father for inadequate consideration, where the husband had tendered the amount of the child support judgment owed to the former wife. However, since the matter was to be remanded for a determination of an additional amount of child support owed by the former husband, the judgments would be vacated to the extent necessary to provide the lower court with the opportunity to consider the need for security with regard to the child support arrearage or any of the father’s further obligations to and for the benefit of his children. McPhail v. McPhail, 564 So. 2d 839, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 163 (Miss. 1990).

       Debtor has right to prefer one creditor over another, even if creditor is wife, and conveyance to satisfy pre-existing debt which equals value of property conveyed is valid over claim of other creditors. Barbee v. Pigott, 507 So. 2d 77, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2475 (Miss. 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       Conveyance was not fraudulent where, when deed was executed, husband and wife did not have close family relationship, but were instead hostile and adverse, and wife was creditor trying to protect interest; while joint tenant or tenant in common could violate fraudulent conveyance statute in conveyance to remaining owner, this was not classic case of harried debtor transferring all of this property to third party, but was case where husband transferred his interest in their property to wife. Barbee v. Pigott, 507 So. 2d 77, 1987 Miss. LEXIS 2475 (Miss. 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   Deeds which were executed without consideration were not fraudulent conveyances within the meaning of §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t15c03s15-3-5" target="_self">15-3-5</a></cite>, where they were executed before the date on which debtor-creditor relationships arose, and where they were clearly not executed with the intent to defraud the creditors in question.

      </p>
      <p>
       Where a husband conveyed real estate to his father, to whom he was indebted, allegedly for the purpose of placing the property beyond the ordinary process of the court, and for the purpose of withholding from the wife and her two minor children the property rights therein under the law, and the deed was executed only a few days before, and not recorded until a few days after, wife filed a bill for divorce and maintenance, the chancellor could set aside the conveyance without incorporating in the decree a specific finding that the value of the property conveyed was substantially in excess of the amount of the indebtedness actually owing by the grantor to the grantee. Blount v. Blount, 231 Miss. 398, 95 So. 2d 545, 96 So. 2d 232, 97 So. 2d 240, 1957 Miss. LEXIS 525, 1957 Miss. LEXIS 526, 1957 Miss. LEXIS 527 (Miss. 1957).

       A transfer by a husband to his wife, with intent to defraud existing creditors, is valid as to a subsequent creditor of the husband who had knowledge of the transaction and consented thereto, and dealt with the wife as the real owner for several years before the debt with the husband was contracted.

     <p>
      If a person shall transact business as a trader or otherwise, with the addition of the words “agent,” “factor,” “and company,” or “& Co.,” or like words, and fail to disclose the name of his principal or partner by a sign in letters easy to be read, placed conspicuously at the house where such business is transacted, or if a person shall transact business in his own name without any such addition, all the property, stock, money and choses in action used or acquired in such business shall, as to the creditors of such person, be liable for his debts, and be in all respects treated in favor of his creditors as his property. However, the provisions of this section shall not apply to a refrigerated box, vending machine or other container when placed by a person, firm, or corporation in a store, mercantile establishment, or other place of business to be used therein, where said refrigerated box, vending machine, or other container is plainly marked with a sign, painted on or attached to and prominently displayed on such property, showing said property to be the property of the person, firm, or corporation, placing the same therein.

       Trustee of debtor corporation held title to all equipment in debtor’s store premises, free and clear of any interest claimed therein by debtor’s incorporators, who had never conveyed the equipment to the corporation, where incorporators failed to comply with statute by posting a sign on debtor’s premises indicating such ownership, and there was nothing on record in Mississippi Secretary of State’s office or chancery clerk’s office showing such claim to ownership.

       The exception made by the courts from the operation of this statute [Code 1942, § 273] of liens created by duly recorded instruments presupposes that the description in such instrument must have been such as to enable a third person to identify the property to the exclusion of all other property without the assistance of external evidence.

       The mere permissive possession of property by a trader, where he has no right to use it in his business, does not bring him within the operation of the sign statute, and therefore, upon the default of purchasers of automobiles under conditional sales contracts held by a foreign credit corporation, the permissive possession of the automobiles by a dealer did not bring him within the operation of the statute.

       The intent of the legislature and the force and effect of this section [Code 1942, § 276] is to freeze the proceeds of the insurance in the hands of the insurance companies until creditors of the holder of the insurance have had an opportunity to protect themselves in regard to the loss.

     <p>
      For the purposes of this article:
     </p>
     <p>
      A transfer is made:
     </p>
     <p>
      With respect to an asset that is real property other than a fixture, but including the interest of a seller or purchaser under a contract for the sale of the asset, when the transfer is so far perfected that a good-faith purchaser of the asset from the debtor against whom applicable law permits the transfer to be perfected cannot acquire an interest in the asset that is superior to the interest of the transferee; and
     </p>
     <p>
      With respect to an asset that is not real property or that is a fixture, when the transfer is so far perfected that a creditor on a simple contract cannot acquire a judicial lien otherwise than under this article that is superior to the interest of the transferee;
     </p>
     <p>
      If applicable law permits the transfer to be perfected as provided in paragraph (a) and the transfer is not so perfected before the commencement of an action for relief under this article, the transfer is deemed made immediately before the commencement of the action;
     </p>
     <p>
      If applicable law does not permit the transfer to be perfected as provided in paragraph (a), the transfer is made when it becomes effective between the debtor and the transferee;
     </p>
     <p>
      A transfer is not made until the debtor has acquired rights in the asset transferred;
     </p>
     <p>
      An obligation is incurred:
     </p>
     <p>
      If oral, when it becomes effective between the parties; or
     </p>
     <p>
      If evidenced by a writing, when the writing executed by the obligor is delivered to or for the benefit of the obligee.
