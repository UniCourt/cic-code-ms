       The language in Section 33-1-7 is very limited in scope in that it only goes to immediate or on the spot arrest and not to misdemeanor prosecutions. Therefore, military personnel, while exempt from immediate arrest, are not exempt from misdemeanor prosecutions which are to be tried at a later date. Kirschten, February 1, 1995, A.G. Op. #95-0063.

      </p>
      <p>
       “WHEREAS, the 1065th Transportation Company of the Mississippi Army National Guard was ordered to active duty during the height of the ‘Berlin Crisis’ in 1961; and
      </p>
      <p>
       “WHEREAS, the personnel of the 1065th Transportation Company were stationed at Fort Polk, Louisiana, and upon release from active duty and while in convoy en route home, a tragic accident occurred on August 6, 1962, that ended the lives of two (2) young Mississippi soldiers and burned the records of the entire unit; and

       “WHEREAS, the Legislature of the State of Mississippi is desirous of correcting the injustices resulting from the loss of those records; NOW, THEREFORE,

       “BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI:
      </p>
      <p>
       “SECTION 1. (1) The Adjutant General of the State of Mississippi immediately after the passage of this act shall take such action as may be necessary to reconstruct reasonably accurate medical records of all those individuals who were members of the 1065th Transportation Company and whose records were destroyed in an accident occurring on August 6, 1962, while the company was in convoy en route back to Mississippi following mobilization during the ‘Berlin Crisis.’ In reconstructing such records, the Adjutant General shall accept sworn affidavits and statements from persons who were involved in the August 6, 1962, accident, persons who witnessed the accident and persons having actual knowledge of any facts relevant to the accident to the individuals involved in the accident or to the medical records destroyed in the accident.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(2) The Adjutant General shall give written notice by United States mail to all persons whom he knows or believes to have suffered the loss of medical records in the accident described in subsection (1) of this section. The notice shall inform such persons that they must make application with the Adjutant General if they wish to reconstruct or correct their medical records destroyed in the August 6, 1962, accident, but that the failure of any such person to provide information or documentation of his medical records as they existed before or after August 6, 1962, shall not be construed by the Adjutant General as insufficient evidence of any illness or injury that the person actually suffered from or was treated for during the period of service from October 1, 1961, through August 15, 1962.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(3) Within forty-five (45) days of receipt of an application from any person under subsection (2) of this section, the Adjutant General shall complete a review of all medical records of such person on file with the Mississippi National Guard. If the Adjutant General, following such review, finds that the medical records of such person are not accurate or do not properly reflect that such person served during the period of October 1, 1961, through August 15, 1962, as evidenced by affidavits, statements and the person’s application file in his office, he shall order that the medical records of such person be amended by the appropriate military record agency so as to properly reflect all illnesses and injuries that the person suffered and was treated for during the period of time he served on active duty with the 1065th Transportation Company of the Mississippi Army National Guard.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(4) Any person whose medical records are reconstructed or amended under subsection (3) of this section shall be entitled to require copies of such records to be provided to any federal or state agency for the purpose of determining if the person qualifies for veterans’ benefits.
      </p>

      The Governor, when ordering out the unorganized militia, shall designate the number and classes to be called. He may order them out either by calling for volunteers or by draft. He may attach them to the several organizations of the National Guard or the Mississippi State Guard, as may be best for the service, provided that no additional organization or unit shall be created from the unorganized militia until the units of the National Guard are brought to their full authorized strength. During the absence of organizations of the National Guard in the service of the United States, their state designations shall not be given to new organizations.

     <p>
      If the unorganized militia is ordered out by draft, the Governor may appoint the number by draft according to the population of the several counties of the state, or otherwise, and shall notify the sheriff of each county, from which any draft is so required, of the number of persons his county is to furnish. Upon the requisition of the Governor being received by the sheriff, the sheriff shall immediately notify the clerk of the circuit court of the county, or in the absence of the said clerk or his inability to act, then his legally authorized deputy or deputies, who shall repair to the office of said clerk and in public copy from the most recent enrollment those persons liable for service under such draft of the unorganized militia, by name or number, the persons shown thereon. Such names or their corresponding numbers shall be placed on slips of paper of the same size and appearance, as nearly as practicable, which slips shall be placed in a box suitable for the purpose and the number required to fill such draft drawn therefrom by the clerk or his legally authorized deputy. The sheriff shall serve upon the persons so drafted a written order from the Governor specifying at what time and at what place they shall appear and report to the officer specified by the Governor. The sheriff shall make return to the clerk of all persons drawn who could not be found, and the clerk shall then draw as many additional names as may be required to complete the draft or to replace those, who, having been drawn, have been rejected by the military authorities for disability, and continue in like manner until the draft is completed and accepted by the military authorities. The Governor may prescribe rules and regulations for conducting the draft and may designate additional officers to assist the respective clerks and sheriffs conducting the same.

      The Governor is hereby authorized to organize, equip, train and maintain, in such strength and in such organized branches of the service as he may deem advisable, a military force similar to the National Guard and organized for the same purposes, to be known as the Mississippi State Guard, to be utilized in aid to or in lieu of the Mississippi National Guard upon its mobilization. The Governor may accept volunteers for the Mississippi State Guard in accordance with regulations promulgated by him and may use the provisions of Sections 33-5-1 through 33-5-17, Mississippi Code of 1972, for the purpose of providing personnel for such Mississippi State Guard. No person under the age of sixteen (16) years shall be eligible for service in the Mississippi State Guard. No person shall by reason of membership therein be exempt from military service under any federal law. The Mississippi State Guard shall be governed by the same laws and regulations so far as applicable, and shall be entitled to the same privileges, immunities and allowances, as may be now or hereafter provided for the Mississippi National Guard. When requested by the Adjutant General, the Legislature may appropriate funds for the support and operation of the Mississippi State Guard. If authorized by the federal laws such state guard shall be organized, maintained and trained under the provisions of any laws of the United States now or hereafter enacted for the organization, training and maintenance of state forces other than those of the National Guard.

     <p>
      For the purpose of coordinating and making more effective the field and similar classes of instruction and training in organizations of the National Guard jointly maintained by Mississippi and any other state or states during periods of field or similar training, as provided under the National Defense Act, the units and personnel of the Mississippi National Guard may, if authorized by the federal government, be placed under the supervision and command of higher organization commanders, who are now or may hereafter be appointed from other states, and whose appointments have the approval of this state, and the states concerned, and such officer is federally recognized. This requirement shall not be carried out unless and until the state or states jointly interested in a National Guard organization with Mississippi shall have enacted a similar law. The objects of this section may be carried out with the consent of the Governor, without regard to similar laws enacted by other states, with the advice and approval of the ranking officer of the Mississippi National Guard present at the place of training and instruction and in command of the Mississippi troops concerned. For the purpose of fixing the time limits of the periods mentioned in this section, the periods of training shall begin when units have cleared their armories or bases and are en route to training assembly areas and shall end when units have returned to their armories or bases from field training period. Mississippi troops shall not be required to yield authority and supervision of matters concerning transportation in or out of the camp or other military area, finance, and supply which concern Mississippi only in her relations with the federal government and for which the state is directly responsible to the federal government. The commanding officer appointed from another state, and such other officers of his command as he may designate, who are members of organizations in which Mississippi has joint interest in other states, and who are appointed and recognized in accordance with laws, rules and regulations prescribed by the federal government may, with the approval of the Governor, make tours of inspection and policy visits with the units of their organizations of the National Guard of Mississippi at their home stations or at other places, at such times as are mutually agreeable, it being understood that the state is not responsible or liable for any expenses incident to such visits.

However, the Governor shall have the power to grant an officer a leave of absence for any reasonable length of time without prejudice to his commission or warrant.

      In any case in which the Adjutant General shall have grounds to believe an officer unfit, incompetent, or incapable of performing his duties, he may be dismissed or transferred to the reserve list or honorary National Guard, if appropriate, without reference to an efficiency or medical examining board, unless the officer so dismissed or transferred shall, within thirty (30) days after being notified thereof, serve upon the Adjutant General notice in writing demanding a hearing and examination before an appropriate board.

       Adjutant General of Mississippi Air National Guard is not prohibited by Mississippi Constitution from appointing state senator to position of major general; however, senator may be prohibited from accepting appointment. Roberts v. Troutt, 475 So. 2d 421, 1985 Miss. LEXIS 2143 (Miss. 1985).

       Adjutant General of Mississippi Air National Guard may dismiss major general when adjutant general has issued orders placing major general in excess status, and that authority has been recognized by United States Air National Guard, thereby effectively withdrawing federal recognition of major general; major general’s unilateral expectation of being retained in position creates no due process property right in position.

       There shall be a retired list of officers and enlisted men who have served with honor or distinction on the active list of the Mississippi National Guard, and all officers and enlisted men placed on the retired list shall remain thereon unless returned to the active list by the Governor or dismissed by a sentence of a court-martial. No officer or man on the retired list shall be required to perform any military duty whatsoever, but the Governor may, with their consent, detail officers and men on the retired list for recruiting duty, for duty on courts-martial, or for such other duty as they may be qualified. Officers and men on the retired list will be entitled to wear uniforms of their grade, and they shall be amenable to military laws and regulations and may be tried by courts-martial for military offenses as if on the active list.

However, no officer or enlisted man shall be so placed upon the retired list because of physical disabilities which are the result of intemperance or improper habits or conduct upon his part.

        For the purposes indicated under the preceding paragraph of this section, the Commander in Chief may appoint retiring boards, which shall be constituted and have cognizance of the same subjects and possess like powers as similar boards organized under the laws of the Armed Forces of the United States.

However, if his latest service in the active militia or in the organized reserves of any component of the Armed Forces of the United States was in a grade higher than that with which he was originally retired, he may be given such higher grade. An officer who has been retired with the increased rank under this article will not be returned to the active list with his increased rank, but with the same rank held on the active list at the time of retirement.

      Before using military forces in the dispersion of any riot, tumult, mob, or other lawless or unlawful assembly, or combination mentioned in this chapter, it shall be the duty of the civil officer calling out such military force, or some other conservator of the peace, of if none be present, then of the officer in command of the troops, or some person by him deputed to command persons composing such riotous, tumultuous, or unlawful assemblage or mob, to disperse and retire peacefully to their respective abodes and businesses; but, in no case, shall it be necessary to use any set or particular form or words in ordering the dispersion of any riotous, tumultuous or unlawful assembly; nor shall any such command be necessary where the officer or person, in order to give it, would necessarily be put in imminent danger of loss of life, or great bodily harm, or where such unlawful assembly or riot is engaged in the commission or perpetration of any forcible and atrocious felony, or in assaulting or attacking any civil officer, or person lawfully called to aid in the preservation of the peace, or is otherwise engaged in actual violence to any person or property.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any person or persons, composing or taking part in any riot, tumult, mob or lawless combination or assembly, mentioned in this chapter, who, after being duly commanded to disperse as hereinbefore provided in this section, wilfully and intentionally fails to do so, is guilty of a felony, and must, on conviction, be imprisoned in the penitentiary for not less than one (1), nor more than two (2) years.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any person who unlawfully assaults or fires at, or throws any missile at, against, or upon any member or body of the militia or National Guard, or civil officer, or other person lawfully aiding them, when assembling or assembled for the purpose of performing any duty under the provision of this section, must, on conviction, be imprisoned in the penitentiary for not less than two (2) years, nor more than five (5) years.
     </p>
     <p>
      If any portion of the militia or National Guard, or person lawfully aiding them in the performance of any duty under the provisions of this section, are assaulted, attacked, or are in imminent danger thereof, the commanding officer of such militia or National Guard need not await any orders from any civil magistrate, but may at once proceed to quell such attack, and take all other needful steps for the safety of his command.
     </p>
     <p>
      Whenever any shot is fired, or missile thrown, at or upon any body of the National Guard or militia in the performance of any duty under the provisions of this section it shall forthwith be the duty of every person in the assemblage from which the shot is fired, or missile thrown, immediately to disperse or retire therefrom, without awaiting orders to do so. Any person knowing or having reason to believe that a shot has been fired, or missile thrown, from any assemblage of which such person forms a part, or where he is present, and failing, without lawful excuse to retire immediately from such assemblage, is guilty of a misdemeanor, and must on conviction be imprisoned in the county jail for not less than one (1) month, nor more than one (1) year, and any person so remaining in such assemblage after being duly commanded to disperse, is guilty of a felony, and must, on conviction, be imprisoned in the penitentiary for not less than one (1) year, nor more than two (2) years.

     <p>
      In addition to the prerequisites of Section 33-7-405, the following requirements must be met:
     </p>
     <p>
      The active member must have completed basic training, be a commissioned officer, be a cadet or be an officer candidate.
     </p>
     <p>
      He must be a member in good standing with the active Mississippi National Guard, as prescribed by regulations promulgated by the Department of the Army, the Department of the Air Force and the Military Department of Mississippi, at the time of application and during the entire semester/quarter for which benefits are received.
     </p>
     <p>
      The active member must not be eligible for veterans’ educational assistance pursuant to 38 USCS Sections 1601 through 1643 or pursuant to 38 USCS Sections 1651 through 1698.

The Adjutant General is authorized and empowered, in his discretion, to waive the disqualifications for assistance, or any one of them, established in items (i) and (ii) of this paragraph upon a determination by him that all monies appropriated to fund the National Guard Educational Assistance Law will not be expended to provide benefits for eligible active members and that it would be in the best interests of the Mississippi National Guard to assist other active members who, but for the disqualifications established in this paragraph, would be eligible to receive assistance pursuant to this article.

     <p>
      ARTICLE IV.
     </p>
     <p>
      RESPONSIBILITIES
     </p>
     <p>
      A. Nothing in this compact shall be construed as a waiver of any benefits, privileges, immunities or rights otherwise provided for National Guard personnel performing duty pursuant to Title 32 of the United States Code nor shall anything in this compact be construed as a waiver of coverage provided for under the Federal Tort Claims Act. In the event that National Guard personnel performing counter-drug activities do not receive rights, benefits, privileges and immunities otherwise provided for National Guard personnel as stated above, the following provisions shall apply:
     </p>
     <p>
      1. Whenever National Guard forces of any responding state are engaged in another state in carrying out the purposes of this compact, the members thereof so engaged shall have the same powers, duties, rights, privileges and immunities as members of National Guard forces of the requesting state. The requesting state shall save and hold members of the National Guard forces of responding states harmless from civil liability except as otherwise provided herein, for acts or omissions which occur in the performance of their duty while engaged in carrying out the purposes of this compact, whether responding forces are serving the requesting state within the borders of the responding state or are attached to the requesting state for purposes of operational control.
     </p>
     <p>
      2. Subject to the provisions of paragraphs 3, 4 and 5 of this article, all liability that may arise under the laws of the requesting state or the responding states, on account of or in connection with a request for assistance or support, shall be assumed and borne by the requesting state.
     </p>
     <p>
      3. Any responding state rendering aid or assistance pursuant to this compact shall be reimbursed by the requesting state for any loss or damage to, or expense incurred in the operation of, any equipment answering a request for aid, and for the cost of the materials, transportation and maintenance of National Guard personnel and equipment incurred in connection with such request, provided that nothing herein contained shall prevent any responding state from assuming such loss, damage, expense or other cost.
     </p>
     <p>
      4. Unless there is a written agreement to the contrary, each party shall provide, in the same amounts and manner as if they were on duty within their state, for pay and allowances of the personnel or its National Guard units while engaged without the state pursuant to this compact and while going to and returning from such duty pursuant to this compact.
     </p>
     <p>
      5. Each party state providing for the payment of compensation and death benefits to injured members and the representatives of deceased members of its National Guard forces in case such members sustain injuries or are killed within their own state shall provide for the payment of compensation and death benefits in the same manner and on the same terms in the event such members sustain injury or are killed while rendering assistance or support pursuant to this compact. Such benefits and compensation shall be deemed items of expense reimbursable pursuant to paragraph 3 of this article.
     </p>
     <p>
      B. Officers and enlisted personnel of the National Guard performing duties subject to proper orders pursuant to this compact shall be subject to and governed by the provisions of their home state code of military justice whether they are performing duties within or without their home state. In the event that any National Guard member commits, or is suspected of committing, a criminal offense while performing duties pursuant to this compact without his or her home state, he or she may be returned immediately to his or her home state and such home state shall be responsible for any disciplinary action to be taken. However, nothing in this section shall abrogate the general criminal jurisdiction of the state in which the offense occurred.
     </p>
     <p>
      ARTICLE V.
     </p>
     <p>
      DELEGATION
     </p>
     <p>
      Nothing in this compact shall be construed to prevent the Governor of a party state from delegating any of his or her responsibility or authority respecting the National Guard, provided that such delegation is otherwise in accordance with law; for purposes of this compact, however, the Governor shall not delegate the power to request assistance from another state.
     </p>
     <p>
      ARTICLE VI.
     </p>
     <p>
      LIMITATIONS
     </p>
     <p>
      Nothing in this compact shall:
     </p>
     <p>
      1. Authorize or permit National Guard units or personnel to be placed under the operational control of any person not having the National Guard rank or status required by law for the command in question.
     </p>
     <p>
      2. Deprive a properly convened court of jurisdiction over an offense or a defendant merely because of the fact that the National Guard, while performing duties pursuant to this compact, was utilized in achieving an arrest or indictment.
     </p>
     <p>
      ARTICLE VII.
     </p>
     <p>
      CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY
     </p>
     <p>
      This compact shall be liberally construed to effectuate the purposes thereof. The provisions of this compact shall be severable; and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this compact is declared to be contrary to the Constitution of the United States or any state or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If this compact shall be held contrary to the Constitution of any state participating herein, the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining party states and in full force and effect as to the state affected as to all severable matters.

      Federal Property. — The Adjutant General shall direct the USPFO to audit and effect annual settlements with responsible officers having federal property accounts. The USPFO shall cause the responsible officer to prepare and submit proper adjustment documents to cover any discrepancies discovered during such audit. When it is determined by duly appointed reviewing authority that losses were incurred due to fault or negligence of the responsible officer, he shall be held pecuniarily liable. When the responsible officer has been held pecuniarily liable, the Adjutant General shall make demand on the responsible officer for payment to the treasurer of the United States for the specified amount. The Adjutant General shall enter or cause to be entered a suit on the bond of such officer upon failure to comply with demand for payment.

      State Property. — All property of a nonconsumable nature procured by the Adjutant General from state appropriated funds and like property purchased from unit maintenance funds shall be accounted for as state property. Property donated from any sources for National Guard use shall be considered state owned property. The Adjutant General shall maintain state property lists for all units and activities of the Mississippi National Guard. The Adjutant General shall cause state property accounts to be audited as he deems necessary. If the audit reflects shortages, the Adjutant General will cause an investigation to be made and take appropriate action. If such shortages are found to be due to the fault or negligence of the responsible officer, the Adjutant General shall make demand on the responsible officer for payment to the military fund of Mississippi for the specified amount. The Adjutant General shall enter or cause to be entered a suit on the bond of such officer upon failure to comply with demand for payment.

       The Adjutant General is authorized and empowered to sell such trees, timber, stumps, naval stores faces or other forest products on state-owned lands in the military reservation at Camp Shelby, Mississippi, as shall be recommended by the state forestry commission and to secure the services of the state forestry commission in the reforestation and use of planting, cutting and practices recommended by the state forestry commission. The Adjutant General, however, is empowered to cut timber to provide clearing for military purposes and for rights-of-way without recommendation of the state forestry commission, and is authorized to sell such timber at the prevailing scale without advertising for bids, when the value thereof is estimated at less than One Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($1,500.00) by the state forestry commission. Based on the recommendation and value estimate of the state forestry commission, the Adjutant General is authorized to sell at the prevailing price, without advertising for bids, timber which has been damaged by storm, fire, insect, disease or otherwise. Based on recommendations by the state forestry commission, as provided by the timber management program, the Adjutant General may dispose of nonmarketable timber that is diseased or has been deadened by the state forestry commission, authorizing noncommercial public cutting when considered in the best interest of the state. Provided, however, that before any other sale of timber may be made as herein authorized, the Adjutant General shall advertise for bids on said timber in a newspaper of general circulation in the State of Mississippi at least once each week for three (3) consecutive weeks prior to the date upon which bids are to be received.
       <p>
        The Adjutant General is hereby authorized to pay all of the funds derived from any timber and other forest product sales on state-owned lands in said reservation into a special fund in the state treasury, which shall be a revolving fund, to be used for the maintenance, development and improvement of said military reservation at Camp Shelby, Mississippi, and out of which the Adjutant General may pay the state forestry commission the cost incurred by the state forestry commission in selecting and cutting trees, tree planting, elimination of undesirable trees and shrubs, construction of fire lanes, control of insect and disease outbreaks, and other desirable aspects of forest management practices on this military reservation for the benefit of this military reservation.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Adjutant General of Mississippi, with concurrence of the commission of budget and accounting, may pay from available Camp Shelby timber funds, restitution for timber and/or minerals cut and/or removed without permission, by employees or authorized agents of the state military department, from private property whose sales, use or damage shall have enriched and/or benefited the state military department.
       </p>
       <p>
        The funds derived from any timber and other forest product sales as herein provided shall be paid by the state treasurer upon warrants issued by the state auditor of public accounts and the said auditor shall issue his warrant upon requisitions signed by the proper person, officer or officers in the manner provided by law for funds appropriated for support of the Mississippi National Guard.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Adjutant General shall make an annual report to the legislature on receipts and disbursements in connection with all funds derived from minerals, timber and other forest product sales on state-owned lands at the Camp Shelby military reservation.

      <p>
       The 2011 amendment deleted “the applicability of this section to an accused who demands trial by court-martial and the kinds of court-martial to which the case may be referred upon such a demand. However, except in the case of a member attached to or embarked in a vessel, punishment may not be imposed upon any member of the state military forces under this section if the member has, before the imposition of such punishment, demanded trial by court-martial in lieu of such punishment” at the end of the first sentence in (1); and in (2), deleted “without the intervention of a court-martial” at the end of the introductory paragraph.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 2019 amendment, in (2)(a), redesignated (a)(ii)A through D as (a)(ii)1 through 4, and in (a)(ii)2, substituted “Two Hundred Twenty-five dollars ($225.00)” for “Seventy-five Dollars ($75.00)”; in (2)(b), substituted “One Hundred Seventy-five Dollars ($175.00)” for “Ten Dollars ($10.00)” in (b)(iii), redesignated (b)(viii)(A) through (G) as (b)(viii)1 through 7, and in 3, substituted “Two Hundred Twenty-five dollars ($225.00)” for “Seventy-five Dollars ($75.00)”; and substituted “Two Hundred Twenty-five dollars ($225.00)” for “Seventy-five Dollars ($75.00)” in (5)(c).

       No charge or specification may be referred to a general court-martial for trial until a thorough and impartial investigation of all the matters set forth therein has been made. This investigation shall include inquiry as to the truth of the matter set forth in the charges, consideration of the form of charges and a recommendation as to the disposition which should be made of the case in the interest of justice and discipline.
      </li>
      <li id="t33c13s33-13-255ol12">
       The accused shall be advised of the charges against him and of his right to be represented at that investigation by counsel. Upon his own request, he shall be represented by civilian counsel if provided by him, or military counsel of his own selection if such counsel is reasonably available, or by counsel detailed by the officer exercising general court-martial jurisdiction over the command. At that investigation, full opportunity shall be given to the accused to cross-examine witnesses against him if they are available and to present anything he may desire in his own behalf, either in defense or mitigation, and the investigating officer shall examine available witnesses requested by the accused. If the charges are forwarded after the investigation, they shall be accompanied by a statement of the substance of the testimony taken on both sides and a copy thereof shall be given to the accused.
      </li>
      <li id="t33c13s33-13-255ol13">
       If an investigation of the subject matter of an offense has been conducted before the accused is charged with the offense, and if the accused was present at the investigation and afforded the opportunities for representation, cross-examination and presentation prescribed in subsection (2) of this section, no further investigation of that charge is necessary under this section unless it is demanded by the accused after he is informed of the charge. A demand for further investigation entitles the accused to recall witnesses for further cross-examination and to offer any new evidence in his own behalf.

      Where there is an apparent error or omission in the record or where the record shows improper or inconsistent action by a court-martial with respect to a finding or sentence which can be rectified without material prejudice to the substantial rights of the accused, the convening authority may return the record to the court for appropriate action. In no case, however, may the record be returned:
     </p>
     <p>
      For reconsideration of a finding of not guilty, or a ruling which amounts to a finding of not guilty;
     </p>
     <p>
      For consideration of a finding of not guilty of any charge, unless the record shows a finding of guilty under a specification laid under that charge which sufficiently alleges a violation of some section of this code; or
     </p>
     <p>
      For increasing the severity of the sentence unless the sentence prescribed for the offense is mandatory.

      If the convening authority disapproves the finding and sentence of a court-martial he may, except where there is lack of sufficient evidence in the record to support the findings, order a rehearing. In such a case he shall state the reasons for disapproval. If he disapproves the findings and sentence and does not order a hearing, he shall dismiss the charges.

      At any time within two (2) years after approval by the convening authority of a court-martial sentence, the accused may petition the state judge advocate for a new trial on ground of newly discovered evidence or fraud on the court-martial. If the accused’s case is pending before the Mississippi Court of Military Appeals when this petition is filed, the appeal will not proceed until the state judge advocate has made a decision on the request. If the petition is granted, the appeal will be dismissed. If the petition is denied, the court of military appeals will continue its proceedings on the case.

       Whenever complaint is made to any commanding officer that willful damage has been done to the property of any person or that his property has been wrongfully taken by members of the state military forces, he may, subject to such regulations as the Governor may prescribe, convene a board to investigate the complaint. The board shall consist of from one (1) to three (3) commissioned officers, and for the purpose of that investigation, it has power to summon witnesses and examine them upon oath or affirmation, to receive depositions or other documentary evidence, and to assess the damages sustained against the responsible parties. The assessment of damages made by the board is subject to the approval of the commanding officer, and the amount approved by him shall be charged against the pay of the offenders. The order of the commanding officer directing charges herein authorized is conclusive, except as provided in subsection (3), on any disbursing officer for the payment by him to the injured parties of the damages so assessed and approved.
      </li>
      <li id="t33c13s33-13-607ol12">
       If the offenders cannot be ascertained, but the organization or detachment to which they belong is known, charges totaling the amount of damages assessed and approved may be paid to the injured parties from the military funds of the units of the state military forces to which the offenders belonged.
      </li>
      <li id="t33c13s33-13-607ol13">
       Any person subject to this code who is accused of causing willful damage to property has the right to be represented by counsel, to summon witnesses in his behalf, and to cross-examine those appearing against him. The counsel mentioned herein will be military counsel, provided by the commanding officer instituting this injury. The accused may also employ civilian counsel of his own choosing at his own expense. He has the right of appeal to the next higher commander.

       Based on Section 47-1-9, as a general rule, county inmates may not be worked on private property, even if such work benefits the public. However, the Mississippi Emergency Management Law, codified at 33-15-1, et. seq., is an exception to the general rule if the governing authorities determine that an emergency exists and there is a need to use the services of prisoners to protect life or property.

       If a board of supervisors finds and determines, consistent with fact, that a local emergency, as defined by Section 33-15-5(g) exists, then the board has the authority to declare a state of emergency and invoke the provisions of Section 33-15-1, et. seq.

       The Legislature finds and declares that the state is vulnerable to a wide range of emergencies, including natural, technological and man-made disasters, all of which threaten the life, health and safety of its people; damage and destroy property; disrupt services and everyday business and recreational activities; and impede economic growth and development. The Legislature further finds that this vulnerability is exacerbated by the growth in the state’s number of persons with special needs. This growth has greatly complicated the state’s ability to coordinate its emergency management resources and activities.
      </li>
      <li id="t33c15s33-15-2ol12">
       It is the intent of the Legislature to reduce the vulnerability of the people and property of this state; to prepare for efficient evacuation and shelter of threatened or affected persons; to provide for the rapid and orderly provision of relief to persons and for the coordination of activities relating to emergency preparedness, response, recovery and mitigation among and between agencies and officials of this state, with similar agencies and officials of other states, with local and federal governments, with interstate organizations and with the private sector.
      </li>
      <li id="t33c15s33-15-2ol13">
       It is further the intent of the Legislature to promote the state’s emergency preparedness, response, recovery and mitigation capabilities through enhanced coordination, long-term planning and adequate funding. State policy for responding to disasters is to support local emergency response efforts. In the case of a major or catastrophic disaster, however, the needs of residents and communities will likely be greater than local resources. In these situations, the state must be capable of providing effective, coordinated and timely support to communities and the public. Therefore, the Legislature determines and declares that the provisions of this article fulfill an important state interest.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Because of the existing and increasing possibility of the occurrence of disasters or emergencies of unprecedented size and destructiveness resulting from enemy attack, sabotage or other hostile action, and from natural, man-made or technological disasters, and in order to insure that preparations of this state will be adequate to deal with, reduce vulnerability to, and recover from such disasters or emergencies, and generally to provide for the common defense and to protect the public peace, health and safety, and to preserve the lives and property of the people of this state, it is hereby found and declared necessary: (1) To create a state emergency management agency, and to authorize the creation of local organizations for emergency management in the municipalities and counties of the state, and to authorize cooperation with the federal government and the governments of other states; (2) to confer upon the Governor, the agency and upon the executive heads or governing bodies of the municipalities and counties of the state the emergency powers provided herein; (3) to provide for the rendering of mutual aid among the municipalities and counties of the state, and with other states, and with the federal government with respect to the carrying out of emergency management functions and responsibilities; (4) to authorize the establishment of such organizations and the development and employment of such measures as are necessary and appropriate to carry out the provisions of this article; and (5) to provide the means to assist in the prevention or mitigation of emergencies which may be caused or aggravated by inadequate planning for, and regulation of, public and private facilities and land use.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is further declared to be the purpose of this article and the policy of the state that all emergency management functions of this state be coordinated, to the maximum extent, with the comparable functions of the federal government, including its various departments and agencies, of other states and localities, and of private agencies of every type, to the end that the most effective preparation and use may be made of the nation’s manpower, resources, and facilities for dealing with any disaster or emergency, or both, that may occur as enumerated in this section.

       It would be inconsistent and counterproductive with policy of emergency management law for local agencies to develop plans for emergencies without approval of state emergency management agency; such “independent” plans could easily be inefficient and even antagonistic without some review process.

     <p>
      The agency is authorized to provide, within or without the state, such support from available personnel, equipment and other resources of state agencies and the political subdivisions of the state as may be necessary to reinforce emergency management agencies in areas stricken by emergency.

       <p>
        All personnel of emergency management support forces shall, while on duty, be subject to the operational control of the authority in charge of emergency management activities in the area in which they are serving, and shall be reimbursed for all actual and necessary travel and subsistence expenses, and for death, disability or injury to such personnel while on such emergency duty as a member of an emergency management support force, the state shall pay compensation to the heirs in event of death or the individual in event of injury or disability in accordance with payment schedules contained in the Mississippi Workers’ Compensation Law.

      The state shall reimburse a political subdivision for the actual and necessary travel, subsistence and maintenance expenses of employees of such political subdivision while serving as members of an emergency management support force, and for all payments for death, disability or injury of such employees incurred in the course of such duty, and for all losses of or damage to supplies and equipment of such political subdivision resulting from the operation of such emergency management support force. The state may also reimburse a political subdivision for employees’ overtime while deployed as members of an emergency management support force and backfill of deployed forces when determined by the director to be necessary to avoid serious financial consequences for the political subdivision providing support and when requested by the chief elected official of the political subdivision stating the circumstances for the request.
     </p>
     <p>
      Whenever an emergency management support force of another state shall render aid in this state pursuant to the orders of the governor of its home state and upon the request of the Governor of this state, the personnel thereof shall have the powers, duties, rights, privileges and immunities of emergency management personnel serving in similar capacities in this state, except compensation, and this state shall reimburse such other state for the compensation paid and actual and necessary travel, subsistence and maintenance expenses of the personnel of such emergency management support force while rendering such aid, and for all payments for death, disability or injury of such personnel incurred in the course of rendering such aid, and for all losses of or damage to supplies and equipment of such other state or a political subdivision thereof resulting from the rendering of such aid; provided, that the laws of such other state contain provisions substantially similar to this section.
     </p>
     <p>
      No personnel of emergency management support forces of this state shall be ordered by the Governor to operate in any other state unless the laws of such other state contain provisions substantially similar to this section.

      The governing body of a municipality or county of the state is authorized to participate in the Statewide Mutual Aid Compact (SMAC) established by the agency as a mechanism to standardize mutual aid arrangements between jurisdictions within the state. The agency is authorized to present the SMAC to the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians’ Tribal Council for its consideration and approval. SMAC provides guidelines for requesting and receiving mutual aid, liability protection and reimbursement procedures for providing such aid. The governing body of each political subdivision of the state is strongly encouraged to sign and ratify the SMAC for mutual aid between their jurisdiction and other cities or counties within the state as well as the Mississippi Band of the Choctaw Indians. A copy of this agreement must be signed by the senior elected official of the jurisdiction and the director and will be maintained on file by the agency.

      In the event an impending enemy attack, an enemy attack, or a man-made, technological or natural disaster occurs within the state or within any portion of it and a proclamation is issued by the governing authorities of the county, the governing authorities of the municipality, the office of the Governor of the state or the President of the United States declaring such affected areas to be disaster areas, the governing authorities of any county or municipality adversely affected by such disaster may:

     <p>
      If the governing authorities of such adversely affected counties or municipalities are unable to perform such necessary and needed functions with their own equipment and personnel, they may request aid from other counties and municipalities not adversely affected by such impending enemy attack, enemy attack, or man-made, technological or natural disaster, and capable and willing to furnish needed services.
     </p>
     <p>
      Provided, however, if the Governor determines that the governing authorities of such adversely affected counties or municipalities still lack sufficient equipment and personnel under such circumstances to perform such functions, any state agency or instrumentality, when directed by the Governor, is authorized to enter upon publicly or privately owned land or water and to use state-owned equipment and state employees as necessary to clear or remove debris and wreckage. Whenever the Governor provides for clearance of debris or wreckage pursuant hereto, employees of the designated state agencies or instrumentalities are authorized to enter upon private or public land or water and perform any tasks necessary to the removal or clearance operation. Except in cases of willful misconduct, gross negligence or bad faith, any state employee or agent complying with and performing duties pursuant hereto shall not be liable for death or injury to persons or damage to property.

     </h3>
     <p>
      When temporary housing assistance is provided based on the guidelines outlined in Section 33-15-217, the following conditions are imposed:
     </p>
     <p>
      An applicant is expected to expend the grant proceeds to secure adequate temporary housing for purposes stated in their application for assistance. Refusal by the applicant to abide by this provision shall result in his forfeiture of eligibility for additional temporary housing assistance.
     </p>
     <p>
      Temporary housing assistance proceeds shall not be provided for nor expended for providing minimal home repairs or replacing lost or damaged personal property.
     </p>
     <p>
      Temporary housing assistance shall not be made available to those individuals, families or households with insurance coverage which provides full cost of alternate living arrangements except when, as determined by the appropriate authority, adequate alternate housing is not readily available or the receipt of insurance benefits are uncertain or inadequate to meet temporary housing needs. Individuals, families or households who qualify for and accept state assistance under the exception shall repay or pledge to repay to the state government, from any insurance proceeds for temporary housing to which they are entitled, an amount equivalent to the fair market value of the housing provided by the state. Temporary housing assistance shall not be made available to any individual, family or household for use as a vacation or recreational residence.

     <p>
      It is the intention of the Legislature that whenever the Director of the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency determines that funds are immediately needed in the Disaster Assistance Trust Fund to provide for disaster assistance under this section, he shall notify the Executive Director of the Department of Finance and Administration of his determination and shall requisition the amount of funds from the Working Cash-Stabilization Reserve Fund (Fund No. 3992) and/or the Budget Contingency Fund (Fund No. 3177) that are needed in the trust fund, which shall be subject to the limitations set forth below in this section. At the same time he makes the requisition, the director shall notify the Lieutenant Governor, the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the respective Chairmen of the Senate Appropriations Committee, the Senate Finance Committee, the House Appropriations Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee of his determination of the need for the funds and the amount that he has requisitioned. Upon receipt of such a requisition from the director, the Executive Director of the Department of Finance and Administration shall ascertain if the amount requisitioned is available in the Working Cash-Stabilization Reserve Fund (Fund No. 3992) and/or the Budget Contingency Fund (Fund No. 3177) and is within the limitations set forth below in this section and, if it is, he shall transfer that amount from the Working Cash-Stabilization Reserve Fund (Fund No. 3992) and/or the Budget Contingency Fund (Fund No. 3177) to the trust fund. If the amount requisitioned is more than the amount available in the Working Cash-Stabilization Reserve Fund (Fund No. 3992) and/or the Budget Contingency Fund (Fund No. 3177) or above the limitations set forth below in this section, the executive director shall transfer the amount that is available within the limitations. The maximum amount that may be transferred from the Working Cash-Stabilization Reserve Fund (Fund No. 3992) and/or the Budget Contingency Fund (Fund No. 3177) to the trust fund for any one (1) disaster occurrence shall be Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000.00) and the maximum amount that may be transferred during any fiscal year shall be One Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00).
     </p>
     <p>

     </h3>
     <p>
      The Legislature finds and declares the following: When a major natural disaster such as Hurricane Katrina occurs in Mississippi, there are various types of assistance that are available to individuals and public entities through the federal and state governments to help them recover from the disaster. The majority of that assistance comes from the federal government, and most of the federal assistance is provided through the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). At the state level, most of the assistance is provided through the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency (MEMA). However, there are also programs in other federal and state agencies that provide assistance and benefits to disaster victims, as well as disaster assistance programs run by public and private entities and disaster-related in-kind donations made by private entities and individuals. Because these other disaster assistance programs and in-kind donations are spread out among a number of agencies and entities, disaster victims sometimes are not aware of the existence of these programs and in-kind donations other than those provided through FEMA and MEMA. After a disaster has occurred, it would be very beneficial for the victims of the disaster to have a single entity in the state, one point of contact, where individuals and public entities would be able to obtain information about those other disaster assistance programs and disaster-related in-kind donations, obtain all of the forms and materials necessary in order to receive the benefits of those programs and in-kind donations, and receive assistance in completing and filing the applications for those programs and in-kind donations.
