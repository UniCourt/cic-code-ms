       “SECTION 8. The Veterans Affairs Board, in accordance with applicable rules and regulations of the State Fiscal Officer, is authorized to escalate the total number of full time and part time time-limited positions to not more that two hundred two (202) positions above the total number of time-limited positions that are authorized in House Bill No. 3047, 2011 Regular Session.” The reference to “House Bill No 3047” in this section should probably be to “Senate Bill No. 3047,” which was chaptered as Chapter 2.

       § 35-3-21.
    County veteran service offices and officers.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      In order to maintain offices and pay personnel for the purpose of assisting all residents of the State of Mississippi who served in the military or naval forces of the United States during any war, their relatives, beneficiaries or dependents, to receive from the United States any and all compensation, hospitalization, insurance or other aid or benefits to which they may be entitled under existing or hereafter enacted laws of the United States, the boards of supervisors in the various counties in the state are hereby authorized and empowered, in their discretion, to expend out of the general county fund, or special veterans’ fund herein authorized to be set up, or from both of such funds, such monies necessary to defray the office operating expenses and salary of the county veteran service officers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Two (2) or more counties may, upon resolution duly adopted by the board of supervisors of each of such counties, agree to establish one (1) veteran service office for all of such counties. When two (2) or more counties enter into such an agreement, each county shall pay such amount mutually agreed upon and duly adopted by resolution of the respective boards of supervisors.
     </p>
     <p>
      County veteran service officers shall be (a) honorably discharged or honorably released veterans of any war or police action in which the Armed Forces of the United States have been, are or shall be committed for action; (b) the surviving spouse or child of any such deceased veteran; or (c) any person employed as a county veteran service officer in any county of this state on March 30, 1990. From and after July 1, 1990, county veteran service officers shall be certified by the Mississippi State Veterans’ Affairs Board which, among any other criteria it may establish, shall require such officers to (a) attend at least one (1) of the two (2) annual training programs provided for such officers and (b) successfully complete a written examination each year on the duties and responsibilities of and assistance available to such officers and veterans. The programs shall be developed by the State Veterans’ Affairs Board. The program shall include a period of instruction which shall be not more than three (3) days for veteran service officers receiving initial certification, and not more than two (2) days for veteran service officers being recertified. County veteran service officers who annually receive and complete such instruction in a manner satisfactory to the Veterans’ Affairs Board and in accordance with this section shall be certified by the board. No county veteran service officer shall be entitled to receive any compensation for his services, to which he is otherwise entitled by law, unless he is annually certified by the board.
     </p>
     <p>
      County veteran service officers may be employed, in the discretion of the boards of supervisors, either full time or part time.
     </p>
     <p>
      The boards of supervisors of the various counties are further authorized and empowered to pay all necessary and actual expenses of county veteran service officers who attend a school of instruction within the State of Mississippi for such county veteran service officers.
     </p>
     <p>
      It shall also be the duty of the boards of supervisors to aid the United States to defeat all unjust claims for aid or benefit therefrom.
     </p>
     <p>
      Such expenditures may be made by the several counties acting alone, or in cooperation with other counties, and in cooperation with any federal or state agency carrying out such purposes.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the event that the general revenues of the county levied under and within the limits of existing taxing statutes are not sufficient to pay the expenses authorized herein, the board of supervisors may, in its discretion, levy an additional tax not to exceed one (1) mill on all taxable property in the county to defray such expenses or any part thereof. Any tax levy made under authority of this chapter shall not be considered in refunding homestead exemption losses under Title 27, Chapter 33, Mississippi Code of 1972.

     <p>
      Before making an appointment under the provisions of this chapter the court shall be satisfied that the guardian whose appointment is sought is a fit and proper person to be appointed. Upon the appointment being made the guardian shall execute and file a bond to be approved by the court in an amount not less than the sum then due and estimated to become payable during the ensuing year. The said bond shall be in the form and be conditioned as required of guardians appointed under the guardianship laws of this state. The court shall have the power from time to time to require the guardian to file an additional bond.
     </p>
     <p>
      Where a bond is tendered by a guardian with personal sureties, such sureties shall file with the court a certificate under oath which shall describe the property owned, both real and personal, and that they are each worth the sum named in the bond as the penalty thereof over and above all their debts and liabilities and exclusive of property exempt from execution.

In annual or partial accounts the court or chancellor may allow a guardian a reasonable commission for his services based upon the amount of disbursements, or, in proper cases where the amount based on disbursements would be inadequate, on the amount received or invested, or the total value of the estate as in other cases of guardianship, but not to exceed the maximum hereinabove provided for, except that in any event the court or chancellor in vacation, in its discretion may allow a minimum commission of One Hundred Dollars ($100.00) per annum. The guardian may be allowed from the estate of his ward reasonable premiums paid by him to any corporate surety upon his bond. The guardian’s attorney may be allowed from the estate of the ward a reasonable attorney’s fee for legal services to the estate or to the ward, if the court be of the opinion that the services were proper and rendered in good faith, the amount of the fee to be in the discretion of the court.

       Whenever, in any proceeding under the laws of this state for the commitment of a person alleged to be a person with mental illness, person with an intellectual disability, or otherwise of unsound mind, or otherwise in need of confinement in a hospital or other institution for his proper care, it is determined after the adjudication of the status of the person as may be required by law that commitment to a state psychiatric hospital or institution or other institution is necessary for safe-keeping or treatment, and it appears that the person is eligible for care or treatment by the Veterans Administration or other agency of the United States government, the court, upon receipt of a certificate from the Veterans Administration or such other agency showing that facilities are available and that the person is eligible for care or treatment in those facilities, may commit the person to the Veterans Administration or other agency. The person whose commitment is sought shall be personally served with notice of the pending commitment proceeding in the manner provided by the law of this state; and nothing in this section shall affect his right to appear and be heard in the proceedings. Upon commitment, the person, when admitted to any facility operated by the Veterans Administration or other agency within or without this state shall be subject to the rules and regulations of the Veterans Administration or other agency. The chief officer of any facility of the Veterans Administration or institution operated by any other agency of the United States to which the person is so committed shall, with respect to the person, be vested with the same powers as superintendents of state psychiatric hospitals or institutions within this state with respect to retention of custody, transfer, parole or discharge. Jurisdiction is retained in the committing or other appropriate court of this state at any time to inquire into the mental condition of the person so committed, and to determine the necessity for continuance of his restraint, and all commitments under this section are so conditioned.
      </li>
      <li id="t35c05s35-5-31ol12">
       The judgment or order of commitment by a court of competent jurisdiction of another state or of the District of Columbia, committing a person to the Veterans Administration or other agency of the United States government for care or treatment, shall have the same force and effect as to the committed person while in this state as in the jurisdiction in which is situated the court entering the judgment or making the order, and the courts of the committing state or of the District of Columbia shall be deemed to have retained jurisdiction of the person so committed for the purpose of inquiring into the mental condition of the person and of determining the necessity for continuance of his restraint, as is provided in subsection (1) of this section with respect to persons committed by the courts of this state. Consent is given to the application of the law of the committing state or District of Columbia in respect to the authority of the chief officer of any facility of the Veterans Administration or of any institution operated in this state by any other agency of the United States to retain custody, or transfer, parole or discharge the committed person.
      </li>
      <li id="t35c05s35-5-31ol13">
       Upon receipt of a certificate of the Veterans Administration or such other agency of the United States that facilities are available for the care or treatment of any person committed to a state psychiatric hospital or institution or for the care or treatment of persons similarly afflicted, and that the person is eligible for care or treatment, the superintendent of the state psychiatric hospital or institution may cause the transfer of the person to the Veterans Administration or other agency of the United States for care or treatment. Upon effecting any such transfer, the committing court or proper officer of the court shall be notified of the transfer by the transferring agency. No person shall be transferred to the Veterans Administration or other agency of the United States if he is confined because of conviction of any felony or misdemeanor or if he has been acquitted of the charge solely on the ground of insanity, unless before transfer, the court or other authority originally committing the person enters an order for the transfer after appropriate motion and hearing.
       <p>
        Any person transferred as provided in this section shall be deemed to be committed to the Veterans Administration or other agency of the United States under the original commitment.

      </h4>
      <p>
       The 2008 amendment, throughout the section, substituted “state psychiatric hospital or institution” for references to “hospital for mental disease,” and “state insane hospital or any other hospital or other institution for the care of the insane,” and made minor stylistic changes; and in (1), substituted “person with mental illness, person with mental retardation” for “lunatic, insane person, idiot, fool.”
      </p>
      <p>
       The 2010 amendment substituted “persons with an intellectual disability” for “persons with mental retardation” in the first sentence of (1).

     </h3>
     <p>
      The administration of the provisions hereof is vested in a Veterans’ Home Purchase Board consisting of six (6) members who shall be appointed, or reappointed, by the Governor, with the advice and consent of the Senate. Members appointed to the board shall be veterans of either World War II, the Korean Conflict, the Southeast Asia Conflict, the Persian Gulf Conflict or have served in active duty for at least one hundred eighty (180) days during a time of war or a conflict in which a campaign ribbon or medal was issued and shall possess a background in business, banking, real estate or the legal profession which enables them to carry out the duties of the board. No state/department commander of any federally recognized veterans organization, no national officer of any federally recognized veterans organization and no member of the Mississippi Council of Veterans Organizations shall be eligible for appointment to the board until the expiration of a period of three (3) years after the termination of his service in such disqualifying positions. Appointments shall be staggered, with each Governor appointing or reappointing two (2) members in the first year of his administration; one (1) member in the second year, two (2) members in the third year, and one (1) member in the fourth year. Appointments for terms that expire in 1988 shall be made as follows: one (1) shall be made for a term ending on July 1, 1989; one (1) shall be made for a term ending on July 1, 1991; and two (2) shall be made for a term ending on July 1, 1992. Persons appointed to succeed the two (2) members whose terms expired in 1986, or any such member holding over after 1986 because no successor was appointed, shall serve until July 1, 1990. After the expiration of the foregoing terms, all appointments shall be for a term of four (4) years from the expiration date of the previous term. From and after July 1, 1988, one (1) appointee shall be selected from each of the five (5) congressional districts of this state as such districts are composed on May 1, 1987, and one (1) appointee shall be selected from the state at large. Any vacancy occurring during a term shall be filled by appointment of a member for the unexpired portion of the term.
     </p>
     <p>
      The board is hereby authorized and empowered to make and promulgate such reasonable rules and regulations under this chapter as it shall deem to be necessary or advisable and to enforce the same. The board shall have authority to render the final decision on the purchase application process, approval of purchases, funding of purchase commitments, servicing loans and default, property security, management, resale, release from security, and all other matters relating to the purchases and loans made under this law. The board shall likewise, by an order spread on its minutes, elect a chairman and vice chairman to serve for one-year terms, and all such officers are eligible to succeed themselves in such offices. The chairman may appoint a three-member loan committee from the membership of the board and shall specify the conditions, responsibilities and authority of such committee.
     </p>
     <p>
      Each member of the board and his successor shall be reimbursed all of his actual and necessary traveling and other expenses incurred in the attendance of the meetings of the board or in the performance of other duties in connection with the business of the board as provided for state officers and employees in Section 25-3-41, and shall be allowed a per diem as provided in Section 25-3-69 for such attendance; provided that the number of days per diem shall not exceed sixty-six (66) days for the chairman and fifty (50) days for other members of the board during any one (1) fiscal year. The above limitation of days per year shall not apply to board members appointed on a full-time basis to the loan committee.
     </p>
     <p>
      The director, or other executive officer employed by the board, shall execute a surety bond in the sum of One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000.00), conditioned upon the faithful performance of his duties and upon his accounting for all monies coming into his hands; and each employee handling funds shall execute a like bond in the sum of Fifteen Thousand Dollars ($15,000.00), and the premiums thereon shall be paid from the funds provided for administering this chapter.
     </p>
     <p>
      The board may designate one (1) of its employees as the acting director or executive officer by a vote of the majority of the members of the board, officially recorded in the minutes of a regular or special meeting, and such acting director shall be vested with all the authority conferred upon the director by the provisions of this chapter; but such acting director may not serve for a continuous period of time in excess of six (6) months, and the acting director, when so designated, will be required to furnish surety bond in the same amount and under the same conditions as the director. The purpose of this provision is to designate an executive officer during any temporary illness, absence or incapacity of the regularly designated director.
     </p>
     <p>
      The board may designate one (1) of its employees by a vote of the majority of the members of the board, officially recorded in the minutes of a regular or special meeting, to be authorized to sign a Deed of Conveyance or other closing documents necessary as to not delay the closing or settlement of a home purchase during the absence or unavailability of the director.
     </p>
     <p>
      The board may select and employ such expert, technical and clerical assistance as in its judgment may be necessary in the proper administration of said board and fix the salaries of such employees.
     </p>
     <p>
      The board is empowered to employ auditors and accountants to examine the books, accounts and records of the board if it so desires, and the board is also authorized to employ legal counsel if it deems such a course necessary in the proper administration of its affairs.

     <p>
      Any person deeming himself a veteran, and desiring to benefit under the provisions of this chapter, shall submit to the board information, in such form as may be prescribed, that will enable the board to determine his eligibility and qualifications. The board may make such further inquiries and investigations as it deems proper and necessary in order to determine such eligibility and qualifications. Applicant priority for processing shall be in accordance with the order in which the fully completed application forms are received and verified as eligible for consideration in the board’s Pearl, Mississippi, office. Once accepted, the qualified and eligible applicant will retain his priority on a waiting list until the time that funds are available to fully process his application, or until it is ascertained that the applicant is no longer eligible or qualified for the loan, or until the applicant withdraws himself from consideration. The board may suspend the taking of applications from time to time based on availability of funds. The board shall not maintain applications which are projected to exceed one (1) year before final processing. In each instance of suspension, the board will project a date in the future when applications will be again accepted in order that persons inquiring for application may know to do so after such date.
     </p>
     <p>
      The board may act upon any purchase loan application or related matter by telephone poll of the board members taken by the executive director, or his designee, in order to facilitate an applicant’s loan request before the next meeting of the board. Action taken upon such a poll may be taken only upon majority vote of the entire board. The action of the board taken by telephone poll shall be placed in the minutes of the board at its next meeting.
     </p>
     <p>
      Veterans who are otherwise qualified and who have a service connected, permanent disability, as verified by the Veterans’ Administration or a branch of the United States Armed Forces, rating fifty percent (50%) or greater, will receive priority over other applicants waiting for consideration. Veterans who have not purchased a single family, permanent home since their honorable discharge from active duty and have not owned a single-family residence in the State of Mississippi while serving in the armed services may be given priority over other veterans waiting to make application. This priority will be second only to those veterans given priority due to a service-connected disability of fifty percent (50%) or greater. Such returning veterans must meet all other eligibility and qualification criteria, including Mississippi residence requirements. This priority will apply only during the first five (5) years following the veteran’s discharge and will apply to veterans who served in Vietnam regardless of time since discharge.
     </p>
     <p>
      The board shall establish rules and procedures to provide a waiting system, limitations on waiting, and the priority preference given to disabled and other special veteran groups when the number of veterans desiring to apply for a purchase at any time exceeds the funds available in the revolving fund for purchases or the number of applications that can be reasonably processed.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is the intent of the Legislature that access to the revolving fund be available on an equitable basis to all eligible veterans throughout the state. The board is, therefore, authorized to travel, conduct and attend meetings, advertise and announce through public service and commercial media, prepare and distribute audio/visual and printed publications, and otherwise announce and promote among veterans the provisions of this law.
     </p>
     <p>
      The board shall monitor application and purchase distribution throughout the state based upon available information concerning veteran population in certain geographic units such as districts, counties and major metropolitan areas, and is authorized to halt, limit or place temporary moratoriums on further purchase applications from areas determined by the board to have excess purchases in relation to the veteran population of that area. At the same time, the board shall have the authority to employ discriminatory announcement and promotion activities in areas determined to have a shortage of purchases. The board shall not set quotas or other inflexible limits on any geographic unit nor shall the board solicit purchase applications from any veteran, group of veterans or geographic unit.

       § 35-7-17.
    Acquisition of homes for resale to veterans; refinancing of permanent mortgage loans; limitations as to applications for purchase.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <ol>
      <li id="t35c07s35-7-17ol11">
       The board may acquire for sale to a veteran a home situated in the State of Mississippi, provided that the cost of such home to the board does not exceed the maximum loan limit as provided in 38 USCS Section 3703 by application of the housing loan guaranty for housing loans to veterans as defined in 38 USCS Section 3701. A veteran purchasing such home may advance a sum of money on the purchase price of the home. In addition to the home acquisition, the board may also provide the funds for any funding fee charged by the Department of Veterans Affairs for any loan contract underwritten or guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs even if the home acquisition cost and the funding fee together exceed the maximum loan amount.
       <p>
        Nothing contained in this chapter shall prevent the acquisition for sale to a veteran by the Veterans’ Home Purchase Board of the State of Mississippi of a home, the title to which has, prior to the date of such purchase, been vested in such veteran if title thereto is vested in such veteran due to (a) the veteran previously owning the land and the purpose of the application is to finance a home on the land; (b) the veteran having taken title to the land for the purpose of obtaining construction financing or otherwise constructing or making a major renovation of a home on the land; or (c) the veteran having previously taken title to the land and home under a nonpermanent purchase money lien to secure his ability to purchase the property while awaiting processing, approval and closing of his application with the board.
       </p>
       <p>
        The proceeds of the purchase approved may be applied toward the liquidation of a purchase money lien, contractor’s or materialman’s lien, or temporary construction loan outstanding against the property if the board should determine that the indebtedness secured by such liens or loan is not adequately financed on a permanent basis.
       </p>
      </li>
      <li id="t35c07s35-7-17ol12">
       The limit provided above on the cost of property to the board may be exceeded in the case of a veteran who has been certified for the purchase of a home under Public Law No. 782 of the 80th Congress, by Public Law No. 286 of the 81st Congress, and other amendments thereto, which provides special benefits to veterans who have lost the use of both legs. In such cases where the federal government donates half of the cost of a dwelling for such a disabled veteran, as provided by Public Law No. 286, and, further, where the Department of Veterans Affairs guarantees half of the remainder of the purchase price, the board may increase the amount of money to be advanced for such a purchase to the maximum loan limits, as provided above.
      </li>
      <li id="t35c07s35-7-17ol13">
       Except as otherwise provided in subsection (5) of this section, the board shall not consider an application to refinance a home with adequate permanent financing with a lending institution, individual or other entity, or the refinancing of the veteran’s equity in a home to which he has title. The board will consider, on a case-by-case basis, the adequacy of financing when a veteran has title to the property and financing with variable rates, terms or payments where the board can ascertain that the loan was made with temporary intent on either the part of the veteran or lender, or where the veteran is in jeopardy of losing the financing due to no fault of his own. In such cases, the board shall ascertain that the present lender has no objection to the early payoff of the loan and that the veteran has not obtained and continued any form of temporary financing for the purpose of waiting for financing by the board when he could have previously obtained adequate, permanent financing.
      </li>
      <li id="t35c07s35-7-17ol14">
       The board shall not consider applications for purchase that would provide the veteran with a second home, or provide funds to be used either directly or indirectly for investment purposes. The veteran must divest himself of any personal residence before being eligible to close the board purchase on a new property. Divestment may be accomplished by sale which transfers title to another individual, or by an irrevocable lease/purchase contract, or land contract where title passes after the prescribed payment. This requirement that the veteran divest himself may be waived by the board in cases where the board can ascertain that the ownership of such property was originally intended as a temporary residence or a condominium or mobile home, or that the veteran’s present residence is inadequate for his needs; and in cases where the requirement to sell on short notice will cause a financial hardship or loss to the veteran in the market place; and in cases where the sale of the present residence is not necessary to free the veteran of obligations to qualify financially for the new loan. When such waiver is granted, the veteran must agree in writing (a) not to reside in the former residence for a period of ten (10) years, (b) that the rent proceeds in excess of mortgage payments and cash expenses on the old home will be paid to the board as a reduction to the loan balance on the new home, and (c) that, at the sale of the old home within a period of ten (10) years, a full disclosure of the sale shall be made to the board and proceeds of the sale in excess of mortgage payoff and actual cost of the sale will be paid to the board as a reduction to the balance of the existing loan with the board.
      </li>
      <li id="t35c07s35-7-17ol15">

        <li id="t35c07s35-7-17ol15a">
         Funds are available to the board from the issuance of its notes or bonds in amounts in excess of the funds required for applicants on a waiting list for their first loan from the board.

        <li id="t35c07s35-7-17ol15c">
         The terms and conditions of the refinance loan complies with the Department of Veterans Affairs guaranteed loan program guidelines for refinance.
        </li>
        <li id="t35c07s35-7-17ol15d">
         The refinance loan shall be limited to the payoff of existing mortgages plus the closing costs of the transaction and further limited to eighty percent (80%) of the property value or amount of the Department of Veterans Affairs guaranty available on the refinance loan.

     </h3>
     <p>
      In addition to and supplemental to any other authority vested in the Veterans Home Purchase Board, the board is authorized and empowered to purchase a leasehold interest in sixteenth section lands, and leasehold interests in other lands owned by the state or a department thereof, for resale of such interest in land to a qualified veteran for a home when the duration of such leasehold interest exceeds the amortization period of the board’s loan by not less than fourteen (14) years or contains automatic renewal to the leaseholder and lienholders. The purchase price of the leasehold interest in the sixteenth section lands and leasehold interest in other lands owned by the state or a department thereof shall not exceed the maximum purchase price as otherwise provided by law. However, the veteran acquiring a home under the provisions of this chapter shall be given the right to advance a sum of money on the total purchase price of the leasehold interest of the home above the maximum purchase price to the board. Wherever applicable, all other provisions of statutes governing said board shall apply, and the board may prescribe and adopt needful and necessary rules and regulations to administer this section.

       When a veteran has been authorized by the board to select the home he desires, he shall submit his selection in such form as may be prescribed by the board. If the board is satisfied of the desirability of the property submitted and if such veteran has agreed with the board to actually reside upon such property within sixty (60) days from the date of purchase by the board, and if the price of said property to the board does not exceed the maximum provided in Section 35-7-17, then the board shall be empowered to purchase said property from the owner thereof, including the veteran under the provisions of Section 35-7-17(1), upon such terms as may be by them agreed upon. The board, in its discretion, is authorized to enter into a contract with the veteran for the sale and to consummate the sale of said property to said veteran. The board shall fix the selling price of such property by adding to the purchase price of said property or to the value of said property as determined by the board when such property is acquired by the board in a manner other than by purchase, as in foreclosure or repossession, all expenses incurred and estimated to be incurred by the board in relation thereto, inclusive of interest, administration, appraisals, examination of title, incidental expenses and such sum as shall be deemed necessary to meet unforeseen contingencies. The purchaser shall make an initial payment of at least twenty percent (20%) of the selling price of the property; however, the board may reduce or waive said initial payment for any veteran provided the loan contract is underwritten or guaranteed by the Veterans’ Administration in accordance with the terms of the Servicemen’s Readjustment Act of 1944, as amended. The balance of said selling price may be amortized over a period to be fixed by the board, but not exceeding thirty (30) years, together with interest thereon at a rate which shall be fixed by the board, which shall in no case be less than two and one-half percent (2 1/2%) per annum, and which shall in no case be higher than the rate of interest authorized and permitted by the Veterans’ Administration for loans guaranteed under the provisions of Title III of the Servicemen’s Readjustment Act of 1944, as amended. The purchaser shall have the right at any time to pay any or all installments still remaining unpaid. In any individual case, the board may for good cause postpone from time to time, upon such terms as the board may deem proper, the payment of the whole or any part of any installment of the selling price or interest thereon. The board is empowered in each individual case to specify the terms of the contract entered into with the purchaser, not contrary to the provisions of this chapter.

       Before the purchase of any property by the board, there must be filed with said board an appraisement of the fair and reasonable value of such property by a qualified appraiser. Each appraisement shall state, among other things, that it is made in good faith and that the valuation is honestly determined and represents the bona fide opinion of the maker.

     <p>
      When a purchaser shall have paid as much as twenty percent (20%) on such home, or when the purchaser shall cause the amount due on such purchase to be underwritten by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs under the provisions of the Servicemen’s Readjustment Act of 1944, the board may determine the amount of the initial payment to be made by the veteran, if any, and the board is hereby authorized and empowered to execute to the purchaser a deed to the property and to take back from such purchaser a trust deed to secure the balance due the board on such transaction, payable over a period of not exceeding thirty (30) years on such amortization plan as the board may determine. Such trust deed and evidence of debt shall run in favor of the Veterans’ Home Purchase Board of the State of Mississippi.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is the intent of the Legislature that the benefits of this purchase permitting home ownership be enjoyed by the eligible veteran. Although it is recognized that many events may cause transfer of title or habitation during the term of the loan, the veteran is encouraged to retain permanent ownership of, and to reside in, the home; therefore, a veteran desiring to transfer his property should provide at least thirty (30) days’ advance notice to the board. Upon notice, he or his designated agent shall be provided a current accounting on his loan, instruction on transfer procedures established by the board, and information concerning the impact of a transfer to him and the new owner.
     </p>
     <p>
      All loans secured by deed of trust, except those guaranteed by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs, shall be made under a deed of trust providing an acceleration clause (due on sale) when the title is transferred from the original veteran. The board may waive the execution of such clause by specific majority decision of the board and shall establish procedures and criteria for consideration of such waiver.

      All funds collected as escrow items for the benefit of the veteran as insurance premiums, taxes, appraisal fees, and other funds belonging to the veteran, and not the state revolving fund, shall be maintained and accounted for separately from the special revolving fund, although the receipt of such funds may be commingled with installment payments or other payments to the board. The board shall establish separate accounts and trusteeships for this purpose exclusive of requirements that agencies of the state commingle funds into one (1) state treasury account. Interest earned on such deposits shall accrue to the state revolving fund of the board, and shall be paid to the revolving fund annually.

      If a veteran dies after filing his or her application for a home as provided in this chapter, and his or her application is subsequently approved, his or her unremarried spouse may, in the discretion of the board, succeed to his or her rights, privileges and benefits under this law that would have been his or hers but for his or her death. The contract or purchase which the board otherwise would or might have entered into with such veteran may be entered into with his or her unremarried spouse.

     <p>
      Any money previously appropriated to the revolving fund of the board or that may be hereinafter appropriated shall be commingled, exclusive of escrow funds provided for in Section 35-7-31, into a general revolving fund for carrying out the provisions of this chapter. The expense of administering this chapter shall be paid from the revolving fund within the limitations provided by Section 35-7-9. The revolving fund of the board will constitute a trust fund and shall be segregated from all other funds in the State Treasury. All interest earned by the State Treasury on any investment of the Veterans’ Home Purchase Board Revolving Fund shall be placed to the credit of such fund. The State Fiscal Management Board is authorized and directed to draw warrants upon such funds from time to time upon requisition of the board executed by its executive officer, and the State Treasurer is hereby authorized and directed to pay such warrants.
     </p>
     <p>
      The money repaid by the purchaser shall be deposited in the board’s revolving fund and shall be available under the same conditions as the original appropriation. The board shall have continuing authority to expend funds up to the maximum amount received into the special revolving fund, limited to the discretionary best judgment of the board as to reserve. The board shall submit to the State Fiscal Management Board, the Legislative Budget Office, legislative appropriation committees, and other such authority as may arise or be deemed necessary, an annual budget, using the standard general fund budget format as a model, but modified to reflect an accurate and management-oriented view of the revolving fund, and an annual report reflecting a detailed analysis of all revenue and expenditures. All funds in the revolving fund in excess of the one percent (1%) administrative expense allowance shall be expended or committed for new loans with the exception of the reserve judged necessary by the board.
     </p>
     <p>
      The board, with the advice and consent of the State Bond Commission, may also sell or hypothecate its mortgage loans to the Reconstruction Finance Corporation of the United States Government or to any subsidiary agency thereof, or to any other agency, private or public, when a sale of such mortgage loans would be to the advantage of the board. However, no mortgage loans may be sold for less than the prevailing market value, which may include sale at a discount from book value when discounted to present value to equate to market yields, of said loans as determined by the State Bond Commission. The provisions of this section may also include the discounting to present value of lower interest rate loans to the mortgagor to encourage early payoff of the loan.
     </p>
     <p>
      The board may issue its notes in such amounts and for such terms as the board may deem advisable to provide additional funds for purchase of veterans’ homes, and such notes shall be eligible for purchase by any agency of the State of Mississippi. The repayment of such notes shall be guaranteed by the board, and any and all income to the board from the repayments of the principal and interest on its purchases by veterans shall be first pledged to repayment of any maturing notes. The maturity dates, denomination or amount, and rate of interest of such notes shall be determined by the board; however, such notes shall in no event exceed a term of thirty (30) years nor bear a higher rate of interest than one percent (1%) below that received by the board on its mortgages and deeds of trust. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, the board may apply the proceeds from the issuance of its notes under this section or the issuance of its bonds under any other applicable law, as follows:
     </p>
     <p>
      Refinancing of permanent mortgage loans, subject to the conditions specified in Section 35-7-17(5).
     </p>
     <p>
      Increasing the purchase limit on homes as provided in Section 35-7-17(1).
     </p>
     <p>
      The board shall have the authority to sell outright its mortgages and deeds of trust at market value, or discounted to present value, as hereinabove provided and to service said mortgages for the purchaser, collecting the principal and interest due the owner of such mortgages, and to charge therefor a reasonable service fee to be mutually agreed upon by the purchaser of such mortgages and the board.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any notes issued by the board must be approved at a regular meeting of the board, upon favorable vote by a majority of four (4) members of the board, who shall authorize the chairman and the executive director of said board to issue and sign such notes as the official deed and act of the whole board.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any additional monies appropriated or obtained to extend the benefits of this chapter shall be commingled with and become an integral part of the revolving fund provided by this section, and the method of accounting therefor shall be the same as used with respect to any other monies in the revolving fund.

      All personal information, including financial and credit information, provided to the board for the purpose of obtaining and servicing a loan, shall be held in strict confidence by the board, and used only by the board and its authorized employees for the purpose of processing and servicing the subject loan.
