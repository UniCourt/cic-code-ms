       Except as otherwise provided in subsections (7), (8), (9) and (13) of this section, the title to all lands held by any agency of the State of Mississippi shall appear on all deeds and land records under the name of the “State of Mississippi.” A deed may also recite the name of the agency for whose benefit and use the land is acquired, but the recital shall not be deemed or construed to be a limitation on the grant or an impairment of title held by the State of Mississippi. Use and possession of the land may be reassigned by act of the Legislature or by interagency conveyance where each agency has statutory authority to acquire and dispose of land. For the purpose of this section, the term “agency” shall be defined as set forth in Section 31-7-1(a). The provisions of this section shall not affect the authority of any agency to use any land held by the agency. No assets or property of the Public Employees’ Retirement System of Mississippi shall be transferred in violation of Section 272A of the Mississippi Constitution of 1890. Each state agency shall inventory any state-held lands which are titled in the name of the agency. The agency shall execute quitclaim deeds and any other necessary documents to transfer the name and title of the property to the State of Mississippi. State agencies shall furnish to the Secretary of State certified copies of the quitclaim deeds and all other deeds whereby the state agency acquires or disposes of state-held land.

The Secretary of State, with the approval of the Governor, acting on behalf of the state, may accept gifts or donations of land to the State of Mississippi.

       In accordance with Sections 7-11-11 and 7-11-13, the Secretary of State shall be required to sign all conveyances of all state-held land. For purposes of this section, the term “conveyance” shall mean any sale or purchase of land by the State of Mississippi for use by any agency, board or commission thereof. Failure to obtain legislative approval pursuant to subsection (4) of this section and the signature of the Secretary of State on any conveyance regarding the sale or purchase of lands for the state including any agency, board or commission thereof, shall render the attempted sale or purchase of the lands void. Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize any state agency, board, commission or public official to convey any state-held land unless this authority is otherwise granted by law. The Secretary of State shall not withhold arbitrarily his signature from any purchase or sale authorized by the Mississippi State Legislature. Except for those lands forfeited to the state for the nonpayment of taxes, conveyed to another state agency or entity as provided in subsection (11) of this section or acquired by the Mississippi Transportation Commission under Section 65-1-123, no state-held land shall be sold for less than the fair market value as determined by two (2) professional appraisers selected by the State Department of Finance and Administration, who are certified general appraisers of the State of Mississippi. The proceeds from any sale by an agency, board, commission or public official of state-held lands shall be deposited into the State General Fund unless otherwise provided by law.

If no agency of the state expresses in writing to the Secretary of State by the end of the thirty-day period a desire to use the land, then the Secretary of State, with the prior approval of the Mississippi Legislature to sell the state-held land, may offer the land for sale to any individual or private entity. Such notice to state agencies is given in aid of internal management of the real property inventory of the state, and this notice requirement shall not be applied to challenge or defeat any title heretofore or hereafter granted by the state under any law authorized by the Mississippi Legislature providing for the sale or disposal of property.

The agency shall determine if such land accommodates its needs and shall determine whether to make an official request to the proper authorities to have the use of the land.

      <p>
       “SECTION 1. The Legislature finds that in 2004 several state parks were requiring substantial subsidies from the General Fund, and the Mississippi Commission on Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks was directed to promptly dispose of those parks through closure, lease, sale or transfer. The Nanih Waiya State Park was one of those state parks to be promptly disposed of by the commission. Nanih Waiya is the site of a sacred mound of the Choctaw Nation and on lands ceded to the United States by the Choctaw Nation under the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek. The Nanih Waiya Mound is venerated by the Choctaws and the site is considered to be the birthplace of the Choctaws. The Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians desires to have this site of great historical significance to the Choctaws returned to them. The Legislature finds that it is in the public interest to return this historical site of the Choctaw Indians to the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians.

       In an action to quiet title to tax forfeited land which plaintiff had obtained by patent from the state, the validity of which had been confirmed by an action against the state, defendant, claiming title under a quitclaim deed from the record owner and by adverse possession, could not challenge the validity of such patent on the ground of grossly inadequate consideration, since the validity of a patent from the state can be challenged only in a proceeding instituted for that purpose by the state land commissioner on behalf of the state. Comfort v. Landrum, 52 So. 2d 658, 1951 Miss. LEXIS 531 (Miss. 1951).
      </p>
      <p>
       The validity vel non of a patent from the state can be challenged under this section [Code 1942, § 4102] and Code 1930, § 6019 (Code 1942, § 4101), only in a proceeding instituted for that purpose by the Land Commissioner.

      <p>
       Where Land Commissioner requested that suit to cancel patents issued by himself to purchasers of State land should be dismissed, court erred in denying request, since Commissioner has absolute control of suits in so far as interest of State is concerned and may dismiss suit whenever he sees fit to do so.

      If any person go or be upon any public land, and cut, fell, or otherwise injure any tree thereon or commit any other trespass on such land, the damages for such trespass shall not be assessed at less than the sum of two dollars ($2.00) per acre for each acre in every subdivision of forty (40) acres of land upon which any trespass was committed by the defendant, besides the statutory damages prescribed for trespass committed as to any tree or timber thereon. All such damages may be recovered in one (1) and the same action, and the secretary of state may institute suits for the recovery of any timber taken contrary to law; but this shall not apply to a person renting public land and having the license of the secretary of state to take trees or timber from contiguous woodland for fuel and the like.

       Former owner of land sold at invalid tax sale but which remained assessed to him, who continued to pay the taxes on the land for about 4 years after the tax sale without knowing that the land had been sold for taxes, was entitled to obtain patent upon payment of all taxes, damages and costs on such equitable terms as could be agreed upon by him and the Land Commissioner, subject to the approval of the Attorney General and the Governor.

If in his opinion such sale of said land is void, he shall so notify such chancery clerk in writing, and the said clerk shall strike such land from the list of lands sold to the state of record in his office, and shall report said land to the board of supervisors for a new assessment if the assessment is invalid, or for an order for resale if the assessment is valid.

    Void tax sales stricken.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      In all cases where it appears that the claim of title of the state to the lands on the records of the land office is void on account of uncertain description, or was acquired under tax sales which were void and which passed no title to the state, the land commissioner, with the written approval of the attorney general, is hereby authorized and directed to strike such lands from the lists in his office of lands sold to the state for delinquent taxes. The land commissioner shall transmit a list of the lands thus stricken from the records of forfeited state tax lands in his office to the clerk of the chancery court of the county in which such lands are situated, and the clerk of the chancery court shall note the same on the recorded lists in his office and shall file and preserve the list of lands thus stricken from the records in his office. The land commissioner shall at the same time give written notice to the assessor of the county that such lands have been stricken from the lists of lands held by the state for the nonpayment of taxes, and it shall be the duty of the assessor to assess such lands for taxes for the proper year or years at such valuation as the assessor may deem just. Such assessment shall be made in the manner provided by law for the assessment of property which has escaped taxation for former years. And the tax collector shall collect the taxes on such lands in the manner provided by law. The striking of such lands from the lists of forfeited state tax lands in the land commissioner’s office, as herein provided, shall cancel all title or claim of the state to such lands, except for taxes due thereon at the time of the sale and accruing after the sale.

       Where an action was brought in 1945 against the state to confirm a forfeited tax land patent and there was an adjudication of validity of the patent, and that though fraud had been perpetrated, the land commissioner and attorney general properly refused to cancel the tax sale to state and patent issued thereunder in an action brought therefor in 1949 by the heirs of the original owner of forfeited lands. Carney v. Anderson, 214 Miss. 504, 58 So. 2d 13, 1952 Miss. LEXIS 494 (Miss. 1952).
      </p>
      <p>
       Land Commissioner with written authority of attorney general has authority to cancel void tax sales, but state tax collector has no authority to cancel void tax sales by suit, as his authority is limited to institution of suits for taxes which are past due and unpaid. State v. Rogers, 206 Miss. 643, 39 So. 2d 533, 1949 Miss. LEXIS 289 (Miss. 1949).
      </p>
      <p>
       State tax collector is without authority to bring suit for taxes past due and unpaid, when there is outstanding a sale of lands to state for such taxes, regular and valid on its face, until tax sale is first cancelled by land commissioner, upon written authority from attorney general, or sale is cancelled by decree of court of competent jurisdiction, and decree rendered in suit brought by state tax collector without authority is void, is not res adjudicata against state or binding upon it. State v. Rogers, 206 Miss. 643, 39 So. 2d 533, 1949 Miss. LEXIS 289 (Miss. 1949).
      </p>
      <p>
       This statute [Code 1942, § 4073] is general and not void as violative of § 90(u), Constitution of 1890, prohibiting special, local or private laws granting any lands under control of State to any person or corporation, since it applies uniformly to all persons similarly situated throughout the state and to all sales of same nature, for delinquent taxes. State v. Southern Pine Co., 205 Miss. 80, 38 So. 2d 442, 1949 Miss. LEXIS 414 (Miss. 1949).
      </p>
      <p>
       This statute [Code 1942, § 4073] does not authorize donation of State’s lands since it provides for denunciation and renunciation of title to lands, retaining basis tax lien, which State never owned and over which it had no control. State v. Southern Pine Co., 205 Miss. 80, 38 So. 2d 442, 1949 Miss. LEXIS 414 (Miss. 1949).
      </p>
      <p>
       This statute [Code 1942, § 4073] does not empower attorney general to usurp function of courts, or to act judicially, but requires him to perform a constitutional duty of his office by making his legal learning and discretionary opinion available to proper state officer in exercise of state function in a matter of public policy and does not violate § 144, Constitution of 1890, providing that judicial power shall be vested in courts, and by § 2, that no person belonging to one department shall exercise power properly belonging to either of the others.

       Chancery court is without jurisdiction of bill by owners of land seeking cancellation of claim of State to lands by reason of pretended tax sales as cloud on complainants’ title after land commissioner, with written approval of attorney general, acting under this section [Code 1942, § 4073], has stricken lands from lists of lands sold to State for delinquent taxes because sales were void, since adjudication sought is, in effect, merely ratification of legal action of a state official, lawfully empowered to act, and statute does not provide for ratification thereof by any court.

    Sale price of tax lands.

     <p>
      The land commissioner with the approval of the governor is hereby authorized to sell to any bona fide purchaser any lands which may have been forfeited to the state for the nonpayment of taxes after the time allowed by law for redemption shall have expired, for such price as the land commissioner with the approval of the governor may fix; provided, however, that the minimum price for such forfeited tax land shall be two dollars ($2.00) per acre, except as otherwise provided herein. When the land commissioner has good reason to believe, however, that any of said lands are actually worth more than two dollars ($2.00) per acre, he shall cause a proper investigation to be made for the purpose of ascertaining the actual value of such lands, and such lands shall be sold for such price as the land commissioner with the approval of the governor may fix, provided that such sale price shall not be less than two dollars ($2.00) per acre as aforesaid. The land commissioner may fix different prices for separate tracts of land, but all such prices shall be subject to the approval of the governor.
     </p>
     <p>
      In cases where it reasonably appears that the actual value of any of said lands is less than two dollars ($2.00) per acre, such lands may be sold by the land commissioner, with the approval of the governor, at a price less than two dollars ($2.00) per acre; provided, however, that in no such case shall such lands be sold for less than the amount of the state, levee board (where the land is situated in a levee district), and county taxes (not including, however, the drainage district tax, if any) for which said lands were sold to the state, plus an amount equal to all penalties, fees, damages, and costs accrued up to and including the date of the sale of such lands to the state.
     </p>
     <p>
      In selling or contracting for the sale of state forfeited tax lands, it shall not be necessary that the land commissioner include in the sale price of such lands any state, drainage district, county, levee, or municipal taxes, or any special assessment.

       By virtue of Chapter 421, Laws of 1946, the following mineral reservation was included in this Section and affects all patents issued by the State from the effective date of that act (April 10, 1946) through the date of the repeal of that language (April 11, 1952):
      </p>

       “In all sales hereunder there shall be reserved unto the state an undivided 1/2 of the usual 1/8 royalty interest in and to any and all gas, oil, sulphur, clay, gravel or other minerals produced on or from such lands for a period of twenty-five (25) years immediately following the issuance by the state of a patent thereto, and for as long thereafter as any such minerals are produced thereon or therefrom if being produced at the expiration of the twenty-five (25) year period. Consent of the state to the leasing of such lands for oil, gas and mineral purposes shall not be required, nor shall the state be entitled to participate in the proceeds realized from the sale of any oil, gas and mineral lease covering any such lands nor in any delay rentals paid thereunder. This provision shall not apply, however, to lands reconveyed to original owners under the provisions of section 4072 of the Mississippi Code of 1942.”

       Public lands of the state are not subject to disposal by any officer, whatever his appointment or station may be, except as fixed by valid statutory provisions. State v. Harper, 195 Miss. 580, 15 So. 2d 680, 16 So. 2d 29, 1943 Miss. LEXIS 162 (Miss. 1943).
      </p>
      <p>
       Issuance by land commissioner of forfeited tax patent to land, having a value in excess of $1 per acre, to the original owner, who remained in possession thereof, at a price of 50 cents per acre was in contravention of this section [Code 1942, § 4078] and inoperative to convey the state’s valid tax title. State v. Harper, 195 Miss. 580, 15 So. 2d 680, 16 So. 2d 29, 1943 Miss. LEXIS 162 (Miss. 1943).
      </p>
      <p>
       Upon adjudication of invalidity of forfeited tax title in action to confirm such title, because of failure of land commissioner to exact the consideration provided by law, court was without power to ascertain correct amount of consideration and confirm patent but would dismiss bill without prejudice to petitioner’s privilege to pursue, and conform to, the statutory requirements in procuring another patent. State v. Harper, 195 Miss. 580, 15 So. 2d 680, 16 So. 2d 29, 1943 Miss. LEXIS 162 (Miss. 1943).
      </p>
      <p>
       Dismissal of suit to confirm forfeited tax patent, upon adjudication of invalidity, without cancelation of invalid patents, was proper, in absence of cross bill by state asking such affirmative relief.

       Sale of leasehold estate of sixteenth section lands to the state for nonpayment of taxes merged the unexpired term thereof in the greater fee simple title of the estate and extinguished it, so that the state land commissioner was without power to sell such leasehold and issue a patent therefor. McCullen v. Mercer, 192 Miss. 547, 6 So. 2d 465, 1942 Miss. LEXIS 38 (Miss. 1942).
      </p>
      <p>
       The issuance of a patent for tax forfeited lands must be canceled where there is a gross inadequacy in a consideration of less than one-fourth of the lowest estimate made by any qualified witness who made any estimate at all, and when the real facts show that such lowest estimate was itself one in extremity, notwithstanding evidence that the land commissioner himself set an appraisal value approximating that for which the land was sold.

       The fixing of the price of sale to the former owner and the issuance of a patent to him by the land commissioner with the approval of the governor, together with the delivery of such patent, upon the payment of the purchase price agreed upon, left such official without power or authority to thereafter approve, sign and deliver another patent to the same land on the same day to another, notwithstanding that the latter’s application therefor was first in point of time.

      <p>
       The 2003 amendment made a minor stylistic change in (1)(f); rewrote the first sentence and made other minor stylistic changes in the next-to-last paragraph of (1); and inserted “state agencies, counties, municipalities
   or other political subdivisions of the state” in the second sentence of the last paragraph of (1).
      </p>
      <p>
       The 2016 amendment added the exception at the beginning of (2); and added (3).
      </p>
      <p>
       The 2018 amendment, effective March 5, 2018, deleted the former last paragraph of (1), which read: “An application so filed shall remain on file with the Secretary of State at least thirty (30) days before it is acted upon and finally approved or disapproved. Applications made by state agencies, counties, municipalities or other political subdivisions of the state may be acted upon immediately after filing, and shall not be required to be on file the thirty (30) days herein provided”; and made minor stylistic changes throughout.

       The purpose of this statute [Code 1942, § 4079] was to set up a procedure by which the state would be protected from the perpetration of fraud against it in the purchase of tax forfeited land. State v. Lewis, 192 Miss. 890, 7 So. 2d 871, 1942 Miss. LEXIS 71 (Miss. 1942).
      </p>
      <p>
       In view of the fact that this section [Code 1942, § 4079] continues in full force and effect, the benefit of a statute (Code 1942, § 1315) relating to quieting title based on tax forfeited land patents would be available to purchasers who acquired land through patents issued subsequently to its enactment, as well as to those who acquired land through patents issued prior to its passage. State v. Lewis, 192 Miss. 890, 7 So. 2d 871, 1942 Miss. LEXIS 71 (Miss. 1942).

      <p>
       In a case in which appellant forfeited property to the State for failure to pay taxes, and never subsequently submitted an application to purchase the property, appellant was given all required notice of the State’s sale of the property because the 2015 version of the administrative code did not require the Secretary of State to notify the prior owner that an application to purchase had been submitted. Green Hills Dev. Co., LLC v. Sec'y of State, 275 So.3d 1077, 2019 Miss. LEXIS 254 (Miss. 2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       An application for a patent from the state to tax forfeited land is sufficient if sworn to in fact by the applicant even though the jurat of a notary is not shown. State v. Allen, 200 Miss. 494, 27 So. 2d 695, 1946 Miss. LEXIS 314 (Miss. 1946).
      </p>
      <p>
       Even assuming that this section [Code 1942, § 4079] permits several separate parcels of land to be included in one application for the purchase thereof, the affidavits thereto must cover the information required to be given by the applicant as to all the parcels, and as to those parcels not covered by the affidavit the applicant acquires no title, even though the Land Commissioner’s office may have advised the applicant to the contrary. State v. Austin, 198 Miss. 752, 23 So. 2d 919, 1945 Miss. LEXIS 242 (Miss. 1945).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where applicant filed with the State Land Commissioner six separate sheets or forms braided together, each containing an application for a separate parcel of land that had been forfeited to the state for taxes, but containing only one affidavit which was at the bottom of the first application which covered only one of the parcels and there was no indication that it was intended to cover all of the parcels, the applicant acquired no title to the other parcels not covered by the affidavit, notwithstanding that the Land Commissioner’s office had advised the applicant that the affidavit would cover all the applications. State v. Austin, 198 Miss. 752, 23 So. 2d 919, 1945 Miss. LEXIS 242 (Miss. 1945).
      </p>
      <p>
       A purchaser of state forfeited tax lands must first file a sworn written application which must give therein the detailed information mentioned in this section [Code 1942, § 4079], and such application is precedent to the right to obtain a patent to forfeited state tax lands, and when the application is taken by its four corners and considered in its material aspects, the averments thereof must be in a sufficient approximation to the substantial truth as not to amount to a palpable misrepresentation of the facts. State ex rel. McCullen v. Tate, 188 Miss. 865, 196 So. 755, 1940 Miss. LEXIS 87 (Miss. 1940).
      </p>
      <p>
       The filing of an application under oath giving the information called for therein is a condition precedent to the right to obtain a patent from the state to tax forfeited land, and such application constitutes a part of the patentee’s muniment of title with which a vendee of the patentee is charged with notice. State ex rel. McCullen v. Adams, 185 Miss. 606, 188 So. 551, 1939 Miss. LEXIS 174 (Miss. 1939).
      </p>
      <p>
       The land commissioner is without authority to waive the information called for by law to be contained in the application for a patent from the state to tax forfeited land. State ex rel. McCullen v. Adams, 185 Miss. 606, 188 So. 551, 1939 Miss. LEXIS 174 (Miss. 1939).

       The fact that the land commissioner is required to file the applications in the order in which they are received and to give each of them a serial number does not require the commissioner to issue a patent to the first applicant for the purchase of the land since an applicant does not become entitled to acquire a patent until the price of the land has been fixed and the sale has actually been made, with the approval of the governor.

       As to statute (Code 1942, § 1317) providing for suit to confirm patent issued for tax forfeited land and requiring the court to validate and perfect the title unless the patent was obtained by “actual fraud on the part of the patentee, or his representatives,” quoted phrase was to be construed to mean such fraud in the procurement of the patent as the making of false statements to, or intentional withholding important information from, the state land commissioner as to material facts in regard to which the applicant is required to make a disclosure under oath hereunder, and which false representations were either known to be false or were made in reckless disregard of whether the same were true or false. State v. Roell, 192 Miss. 873, 7 So. 2d 867, 1942 Miss. LEXIS 70 (Miss. 1942).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where an application for a patent from the state to tax forfeited land represented that the land was for the benefit of the applicant, when in fact it was purchased on behalf of another, that the land was “cut-over land” when in fact a good portion of it was cleared and opened, so that the land was sold for a grossly inadequate value, as apparent from the fact that thereafter the patentee sold it to another for an amount ten times that paid for the land to the state, the patent to the applicant and the applicant’s conveyance to a third person would be set aside for fraud, the latter not being an innocent purchaser for value. State ex rel. McCullen v. Adams, 185 Miss. 606, 188 So. 551, 1939 Miss. LEXIS 174 (Miss. 1939).
      </p>
      <p>
       The concealment, by omission thereof from the application for a patent from the state to tax forfeited land, of the fact that a good portion of the tract applied for had been cleared was the principal inducement to the sale at such a grossly inadequate price, and constituted a fraud upon the state warranting a cancelation of the patents issued to the defendant and also of the deed of conveyance from such defendant to the other defendant in the action. State ex rel. McCullen v. Adams, 185 Miss. 606, 188 So. 551, 1939 Miss. LEXIS 174 (Miss. 1939).

     <p>
      The Secretary of State with the approval of the Governor may contract to sell any state forfeited tax lands, including state lands lying within municipalities, even though said lands may have been subdivided into blocks, lots, divisions, or otherwise and sold to the state by such descriptions. The purchase price required in the contract for the sale of state forfeited tax land shall be the same as that required in direct sale of state forfeited tax lands. In the event the Secretary of State with the approval of the governor shall decide that any state forfeited tax land shall be contracted for sale, the Secretary of State with the approval of the governor shall fix a price for the sale of such lands. Said contract for the sale of such lands shall provide that a part of the purchase price shall be paid in cash, and that the balance of such purchase price shall be paid in equal annual installments extending over a period not to exceed five (5) years, said period to be fixed by the Secretary of State. The purchaser in said contract of sale shall agree that he shall pay all installments of the purchase price and all taxes and special assessments that may become due on said lands during the continuance or life of said contract, that he shall not cut any merchantable timber nor commit any waste of any kind on said land without the written permission of the Secretary of State and that he shall not allow any other person to cut any merchantable timber therefrom or permit any waste of any kind thereon until said purchaser has secured a patent from the state in accordance with his contract of sale. Contracts for sale of state forfeited tax lands shall not be transferred nor assigned without the written consent of the Secretary of State. All applications for contracts of sale shall be made on written forms prepared by the attorney general and approved by the Secretary of State and shall be kept on file in the office of the Secretary of State as public records. At such time as the purchaser shall have paid the entire purchase money under any contract of sale and shall have complied with all of the other provisions of said contract of sale, the Secretary of State shall issue a state land patent as in other cases of the sale of state lands.

     <p>
      When any contract for the sale of state forfeited tax lands shall be made, as provided in Section 29-1-39, such lands shall then become taxable in all respects and to the same extent and in like manner as where patents are issued, except that such lands under contract for sale shall not be sold for taxes while the state is the holder of the legal title. It shall be the duty of the land commissioner to give notice in writing to the clerk of the chancery court of the county in which the land is situated, and likewise the clerk of the municipality if such land be situated in a municipality, that such land is under contract for sale, giving the name of the purchaser and the price. The chancery clerk, and the municipal clerk where the land is located in a municipality, shall file said notices and enter the land upon the assessment rolls and shall clearly designate that such land is public land which has been contracted for sale. Such land shall thereupon be assessed for taxes as other lands are assessed, and the tax collector of the county, and the municipality where said land is located in a municipality, shall collect the taxes thereon as in cases of additional assessments, as provided by Section 29-1-83, with reference to patents.

    Cancellation of contract of sale.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      If taxes become delinquent on lands which are contracted for sale or on any part thereof, the tax collector shall, within thirty (30) days after such delinquency, certify such fact in writing to the Secretary of State and said tax collector shall neither advertise nor sell such land at a tax sale. If said land should be sold at a tax sale, the sale shall be void as against the state, and the state’s title thereto shall not be affected by said sale. Likewise, if such a tax sale is made, the tax collector shall be liable on his official bond to the purchaser at said sale in the penal sum of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) plus all actual damages suffered by said purchaser. Within fifteen (15) days after receipt of notice from the tax collector that said lands are delinquent for taxes, or if no notice is given by said tax collector then within thirty (30) days after the Secretary of State ascertains that there is a delinquency in the payment of taxes on said land, the Secretary of State shall cancel the contract of sale and shall, within said period of thirty (30) days, inform the contract purchaser of such cancellation by mail at the post office address contained in the application. The said notice shall be given by registered mail with return receipt requested. The Secretary of State shall likewise immediately notify the clerk of the board of supervisors of the county in which said land is situated of the cancellation and the clerk shall report said action to the board of supervisors of said county, who shall have said land stricken from the assessment roll and also stricken from the tax sale list, if the same is contained thereon. The land shall then be re-entered on the record in the Secretary of State’s office, the former entry of the contract of the purchase shall be marked “canceled” on the Secretary of State’s records, and the land shall become subject to disposition by the Secretary of State in the same manner as if no contract of sale had been made. In case the Secretary of State should fail to give notice of the cancellation of said contract or should fail to cancel said contract within the time stipulated herein, the Secretary of State may cancel and give said notice of cancellation on any subsequent date. If said land is located in a municipality, the acts and duties provided herein to be performed by the clerk of the board of supervisors and the board of supervisors shall be performed in like manner by the municipal clerk and the governing authorities of said municipality.

     <p>
      When it is sufficiently shown to the Governor and Secretary of State that any tax-forfeited or escheated lands owned by the state, whether within or without the corporate limits of any municipality if located within ten (10) miles thereof, are needed by any municipality in connection with any national defense project which such municipality is sponsoring, the Secretary of State with the approval of the Governor is hereby authorized to sell on an acreage basis any such lands so owned by the state to any municipality, without limit as to quantity or manner in which such land is subdivided, for such price as the Secretary of State with the approval of the Governor may fix. Provided, however, that the minimum price for such land shall be One Dollar ($1.00) per acre. The conveyance of such lands by the state shall be by patent executed by the Secretary of State under the seal of the land office, which patent shall contain all of the lands sold, and such patent shall convey to the municipality a fee simple title to the lands therein described.
     </p>

      In the event the price for which such land is sold is not sufficient to pay the fees and costs allowed to the county tax collector and chancery clerk, as in cases of the redemption of lands for tax sales, under the provisions of Section 25-7-21, Mississippi Code of 1972, the Secretary of State shall apportion the purchase money derived from the sale of such lands hereunder between the county tax collector and chancery clerk upon the basis of the amount of fees due each of them, and the sum thus allotted shall be paid in the manner provided in Section 29-1-95, Mississippi Code of 1972, and shall be in full settlement of all fees due such officers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Municipalities buying lands hereunder shall not be required to file the application required by Section 29-1-37, Mississippi Code of 1972, and such application as the municipality may file to purchase land hereunder may be promptly acted upon by the Governor and Secretary of State.

       Only state can raise question of invalidity of patent from state on ground that person obtaining patent had obtained in excess of 160 acres of land from state in one year, or that he has paid to state inadequate consideration for land obtained; and these questions cannot be raised by original owners of land in question. Perkins v. White, 208 Miss. 157, 43 So. 2d 897, 1950 Miss. LEXIS 237 (Miss. 1950).
      </p>
      <p>
       Good faith of bank in acquiring, pursuant to settlement of debt, 340 acres of land from vendee of patentees from state after tax sale thereof to state, would be presumed in view of provisions of banking law entitling a bank to own such real estate as should be purchased by or conveyed to the bank in satisfaction of or on account of debts previously contracted in the course of its business. Merchants & Mfgs. Bank v. State, 200 Miss. 291, 25 So. 2d 585, 1946 Miss. LEXIS 293 (Miss. 1946).
      </p>
      <p>
       Bank purchasing 340 acres of land from vendee of patentees from state after tax sale thereof to state, apparently in attempt to collect debt due it from such vendee, was not subject to forfeiture to the state of all moneys, fees, and costs paid by it in connection with the issuance of the patents, where, because of the invalidity of the tax sale to the state, state had no title to the land which the bank could acquire from the state, directly or indirectly, fraudulently or otherwise. Merchants & Mfgs. Bank v. State, 200 Miss. 291, 25 So. 2d 585, 1946 Miss. LEXIS 293 (Miss. 1946).
      </p>
      <p>
       As to statute (Code 1942, § 1317) providing for suit against the state to confirm title requiring the court to validate and perfect title based upon tax forfeited land patents unless the patent was obtained by “actual fraud on the part of the patentee, or his representative,” construction of the quoted phrase to mean such fraud in the procurement of the patent as the making of false statements to or intentionally withholding important information from, the state land commissioner as to material facts in regard to which the applicant is required to make a disclosure under oath, and which false representations were either known to be false, or were made in reckless disregard of whether the same were true or false, was not unconstitutional as suspending the operation of this section [Code 1942, § 4088]. State v. Roell, 192 Miss. 873, 7 So. 2d 867, 1942 Miss. LEXIS 70 (Miss. 1942).
      </p>
      <p>
       Word “enter” in Laws 1877 ch. 15, § 3, relating to the sale of swamp and overflowed lands by the state, and “purchase” in this section [Code 1942, § 4108] are convertible terms, and “escheat” as used in this section [Code 1942, § 4108] would be written into laws of 1877 by the law.

       It was not the intention of the legislature that Code 1942, § 1317 would in any way affect this section [Code 1942, § 4109]. State v. Magnolia Bank, 212 Miss. 47, 53 So. 2d 79, 1951 Miss. LEXIS 426 (Miss. 1951).
      </p>
      <p>
       In order for a bank to obtain a valid tax forfeited land patent it must appear that the bank owned the tax forfeited land or held a mortgage or deed of trust thereon at the time of sale, or, if holding a mortgage or a deed of trust thereon, that such mortgage or deed of trust was still in force and effect at the time of the application to purchase. State v. Magnolia Bank, 212 Miss. 47, 53 So. 2d 79, 1951 Miss. LEXIS 426 (Miss. 1951).
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that there was no fraud in the procurement of a land patent had no effect where the bank was not eligible and without authority to purchase land from the state unless it held a mortgage or deed of trust on the land which was in force and effect at the time of the application. State v. Magnolia Bank, 212 Miss. 47, 53 So. 2d 79, 1951 Miss. LEXIS 426 (Miss. 1951).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section [Code 1942, § 4109] does not provide for a forfeiture for violation of the provisions hereof, but merely prohibits a corporation from purchasing or becoming the owner of any of the public lands, except under the conditions herein enumerated. Merchants & Mfgs. Bank v. State, 200 Miss. 291, 25 So. 2d 585, 1946 Miss. LEXIS 293 (Miss. 1946).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section [Code 1942, § 4109] is inapplicable to a bank, purchasing 340 acres of land from vendee of patentees from state after tax sale thereof to state, so as to subject it to forfeiture of all moneys, fees and costs paid by it in connection with the issuance of the patents, since this section [Code 1942, § 4109] does not provide for forfeiture but merely prohibits a corporation from purchasing or becoming the owner of any public lands except under the conditions herein enumerated. Merchants & Mfgs. Bank v. State, 200 Miss. 291, 25 So. 2d 585, 1946 Miss. LEXIS 293 (Miss. 1946).

      <p>
       The operation of this section [Code 1942, § 4109] was not suspended or affected by construing a statute (Code 1942, § 1315), providing for suit against the state to confirm title and requiring the court to validate and perfect title based upon tax forfeited land patents unless the patent was obtained by “actual fraud on the part of the patentee, or his representative,” to mean such fraud in the procurement of the patent as the making of false statements to or intentionally withholding important information from, the state land commissioner as to material facts in regard to which the applicant is required to make a disclosure under oath, and which false representations were either known to be false, or were made in reckless disregard of whether the same were true or false.

       This statute [Code 1942, § 4109] does not violate the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution in granting privileges to banking corporations not granted to all corporations, since banking corporations are in a class by themselves and the statute treats all banking corporations in the state alike. State v. Bellinger, 202 Miss. 675, 32 So. 2d 286, 1947 Miss. LEXIS 330 (Miss. 1947).

       The fact that building and loan associations and insurance companies sustain somewhat similar relations to state policy, and also have some like functions and powers themselves, does not integrate them into the same classification with banks, so as to form the basis for a claimed discrimination against them by this section [Code 1942, § 4109].

       The rule that even where the debt secured by a mortgage is barred by the statute of limitations, the mortgagee cannot be deprived of possession by the mortgagor until the debt is paid does not apply in an action by a bank against the state to quiet title where the rights of the bank under a deed of trust were barred by the statute of limitations at the time the bank acquired a tax forfeited land patent and the patent was void.

       Where in 1931 a deed of trust on certain land was issued to a bank as security for a loan, and later that land was sold at a tax sale and not redeemed, in 1939 the bank’s remedy at law to recover the debt was barred by statute of limitations and direct remedy in equity was likewise barred.

       In an action by a bank against the state to quiet title where the rights and remedies of the bank under a deed of trust were barred by the statute of limitations at the time the bank acquired a tax forfeited land patent and where the patent was void, the absence of a specific plea of statute of limitations was not defective and the bank was not entitled to quiet title.

      <p>
       In a case in which appellant forfeited property to the State for failure to pay taxes, the chancellor erred in ruling that appellant lacked any standing to challenge the validity of the land patents because, if the land patents issued to appellee companies were void by operation of this statute - which prohibited a banking corporation that did not hold a mortgage or deed of trust on the property at the time it was forfeited to the State from directly or indirectly purchasing or becoming the owner of public land - then appellee companies did not own the property; and they could not prevent appellant from enforcing the protective covenants or divest appellant of title to common-area property within the development.

      <p>
       In a case in which appellant forfeited property to the State for failure to pay taxes, whether the bank, as trustee for the bondholders, could indirectly purchase the property through the companies was a material disputed fact; thus, summary judgment was improperly granted to the Secretary of State, the bank, and the companies on the issue of the validity of the land patents.

       The 2015 amendment rewrote the section, which read: “The land commissioner shall not receive the purchase money of lands; but the same shall be paid into the treasury on the receipt warrant of the auditor of public accounts, as in other cases; and the purchaser shall present to the land commissioner, in payment for the land, the treasurer’s receipt for the purchase money, which shall be filed in the land office.

      If the title to any public land sold by the state through the State Fiscal Officer or Secretary of State or by any municipality, except land forfeited to the state for the nonpayment of ad valorem taxes, shall fail, or shall have failed, the state or the municipality, as the case may be, shall refund the purchase-money to its vendee or his heirs or assigns; and if no profits have been received from the lands, then all taxes shall be returned also, and all fees paid, with interest at six percent (6%) per annum. Except as provided in this chapter, the question of failure of title can only be determined in a suit filed in the county in which the land is situated, and the Secretary of State or the municipality, as the case may be, shall be made a party to the suit. Where the failure of title shall have been caused by the cancellation of a contract or a patent issued by the state, or a deed from the municipality, under the requirements of any law or decree of a chancery court of this state, directing cancellation in favor of prior purchasers, or through the failure of the state’s title, or the title of the municipality, as the case may be, where the failure shall have been caused by the striking of the land from the state land rolls under the requirements of any law of this state, the failure of title so caused shall not be required to be determined by decree of court.

If the Secretary of State shall find that such lands or any part thereof had caved into the river before the issuance of the patent, or that the patentee did not acquire any land or title under the patent, he shall mark the patent or patents or, in case of the loss of the original, a certified copy of the patents, “cancelled,” and refund the purchaser the amount paid to and retained by the state for the cancelled patent or patents, if any.

       Code 1942, § 9697, exempting from taxation property belonging to the state or to any county, levee board or municipal corporation thereof, was never intended to abate an existing judgment lien as fixed by final decree of the chancery court against land subsequently purchased by the state or one of its subdivisions. Willis Creek Drainage Dist. v. Yazoo County, 209 Miss. 849, 48 So. 2d 498, 1950 Miss. LEXIS 449 (Miss. 1950).
      </p>
      <p>
       A county, on becoming a voluntary purchaser of drainage district lands encumbered by a statutory judgment for assessments, does not acquire such lands free of the lien despite the fact that the lands are to be used for a public purpose. Willis Creek Drainage Dist. v. Yazoo County, 209 Miss. 849, 48 So. 2d 498, 1950 Miss. LEXIS 449 (Miss. 1950).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section [Code 1942, § 4090] is designed for the protection of the drainage district and to prevent impairment of its contract with bondholders who may have supplied funds for draining and improvement of lands against which the lien attaches. Willis Creek Drainage Dist. v. Yazoo County, 209 Miss. 849, 48 So. 2d 498, 1950 Miss. LEXIS 449 (Miss. 1950).

       A statute providing for continuance of special municipal benefit assessment lien after sale of land subject to lien to the State and resale is within power of legislature, which has entire control of sale of State lands. City of Biloxi v. Lowery, 179 Miss. 364, 175 So. 200, 1937 Miss. LEXIS 35 (Miss. 1937).
      </p>
      <p>
       Provision of this seciton [Code 1942, § 4090] that the Act should not affect claim or right arising prior to adoption of the Act did not make the Act inapplicable to resale by State, after adoption of the Act, of land purchased prior thereto, since only right or claim affected was that of State, which was benefited by continuance of lien of its governmental agency. City of Jackson v. Howie, 179 Miss. 251, 175 So. 198, 1937 Miss. LEXIS 34 (Miss. 1937).

     <p>
      Immediately after March 26, 1936, it shall be the duty of the land commissioner to prepare or cause to be prepared accurate and complete lists of all lands in each county which have been forfeited to the state for the nonpayment of taxes, the title to which has matured in the state. Such lists shall be prepared for each county separately and embrace and include all lands heretofore sold to the state for delinquent taxes in such county and now held or claimed by the state; and such lists shall be made up in the regular order of townships, ranges, and sections as now appearing on the records of his office. Such lists shall show the date of the tax sale to the state, the amount of taxes, damages, costs, and special assessments of every kind whatsoever for which such lands were sold. No lands heretofore stricken by the land commissioner, with the approval of the Attorney General, from the lists of lands sold to the state for delinquent taxes in his office under the provisions of Section 29-1-31 of the Mississippi Code of 1972 shall be included in the lists of lands to be compiled under the provisions of this section.
     </p>
     <p>
      Such lists, when completed, shall be examined by the Attorney General; and the land commissioner, with the approval of the Attorney General, shall strike from such lists and from the land book or books in his office all lands which, by reason of insufficient description or other cause, in the opinion of the Attorney General are not the property of the state. The title to the state to such lands as may be thus stricken off shall be thereby relinquished. When such lists shall have been completed, they shall be duly recorded by the land commissioner in a record book provided by him for that purpose in his office, the lists of such lands for each county to be recorded in a separate book, and the land commissioner shall certify to the correctness of such lists as thus recorded.
     </p>
     <p>
      The land commissioner, after recording in his office such lists of lands sold to the state for delinquent taxes and held or claimed by the state, shall prepare and mail to the chancery clerk of the county in which such lands are situated a certified copy of such lists under the seal of the land office, and the chancery clerk shall record the same in a separate record book in his office provided for that purpose. In counties having two (2) judicial districts, such lists shall be recorded in the office of the chancery clerk of each such judicial district. For recording such lists, the chancery clerk shall be allowed Five Cents (5¢) for each tract of land formerly included as a single assessment embraced in such lists, to be paid out of the county treasury upon allowance of the board of supervisors.

The cost of the appraisal shall be paid from any available sixteenth section school funds or other school funds of the district. If no appeal is taken within twenty (20) days as provided hereunder, the lease shall be executed in accordance with said recommended rental value within thirty (30) days of the receipt of the appraisers’ report.

Such appeal shall be taken within twenty (20) days following the decision. The chancery court, on appeal, may review all of the proceedings, may receive additional evidence, and make findings of fact, as well as conclusions of law to insure that a fair and reasonable return may be obtained on the sixteenth section lands or lands in lieu thereof.

       Denial by a school board of a request to erect and construct an advertising billboard on the school district’s leasehold was appropriate because the agreement between the sublessee and the sub-lessor was a sublease, rather than a license, that required prior approval of the school board. Furthermore, once approval was sought, the school board did not act arbitrarily or capriciously in denying the request to construct the billboard because the board expressed concerns with safety.

       Mississippi Legislature did not violate supremacy clause or any provision of state constitution in granting title to right-of-way over Sixteenth Section School land to railroad pursuant to 1882 charter, and railroad and its successor in interest, rather than county board of education, owned right-of-way; state law placed no binding trust obligation or other burden on Sixteenth Section lands such as would bar legislature from enacting charter in 1882.

      <p>
       A 99-year lease of 3.5 acres of Sixteenth Section school trust land for a one-time fee of $150, amounting to approximately 46 cents per acre per year on a tract of land with a value of $3,575 at the time of the lease, was an unconstitutional donation due to inadequate consideration, and was therefore voidable at the option of the school board; the consideration paid for the leasehold was so unconscionably inadequate that it defeated any challenge by anyone claiming to be a bona fide purchaser. Board of Educ. v. Hudson, 585 So. 2d 683, 1991 Miss. LEXIS 460 (Miss. 1991).

       Appraisers of the value of sixteenth section lands were not disinterested freeholders since they held sixteenth section leases. Hill v. Thompson, 564 So. 2d 1, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 531 (Miss. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       A lease of school trust land was voidable for inadequate consideration as violative of the donation clause of Article IV, § 95 of the Mississippi Constitution where the consideration paid for the lease was so grossly inadequate as to shock the conscience and to defeat any challenge even of one otherwise claiming the status of a bona fide purchaser; the inadequate consideration was not a hidden title defect but was a matter of public record, so openly blatant as to put any purchaser on notice of a possible defect in the trustee’s title where the tax assessments of the city and the county gave notice of value that should have suggested that a far higher rental was required to meet the constitutional mandate of non-donation, and the appraiser’s report stated that only a nominal value was used. As a matter of law, a one-time gross sum payment which amounted to $.07575 per year consideration was grossly inadequate and amounted to a donation of public lands prohibited by the constitution and trust law. Mere compliance with statutory formalities and procedures did not vitiate substantive violation of constitutional prohibitions. The case would be remanded to the school district board of trustees for a new determination of the present rental value by a competent appraiser under the 1978 Reform Act. While the public policy of making all reasonable efforts to keep sixteenth section lands leased so that they might be developed and produce revenue from taxation is not an unworthy goal, and this policy may have influenced past officials in leasing sixteenth section lands for nominal rentals, its emphasis must not overshadow constitutional mandates. Hill v. Thompson, 564 So. 2d 1, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 531 (Miss. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       Miss Const § 211, as amended February 4, 1944, to increase the lease duration limit of Sixteenth Section lands reserved for the support of township schools from 25 years to 99 years, is not self-executing and, therefore, had no effect until 1946 when the legislature amended the Mississippi Code to conform to the provisions mandated by § 211. Thus, a 99-year lease of Sixteenth Section land executed in 1945 was void. Oktibbeha County Bd. of Education v. Sturgis, 531 So. 2d 585, 1988 Miss. LEXIS 436 (Miss. 1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       In managing sixteenth section school lands, board of education must exercise care and skill that person of ordinary prudence would exercise in dealing with own property; board may require lessees of sixteenth section land to sign leases and may include terms in leases that persons of ordinary prudence would include.

      </p>
      <p>
       Board of education may choose its own method of valuation for sixteenth section land so long as valuation results in fair market rental value; while board is not bound to use percentage of fair market sale value method, it is not precluded from doing so if that method best yields fair rental value.

       A lease of sixteenth section land was invalid where it had not been submitted to and approved by the district board of trustees as required by this section. Womack v. Nobles, 382 So. 2d 1081, 1980 Miss. LEXIS 1965 (Miss. 1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a dispute between a county board of supervisors and a school district’s board of trustees over whether or not to enter into a 25-year lease on certain sixteenth section lands, the trial court properly ordered the superintendent of education to execute the lease, notwithstanding the fact that a majority of the board of trustees had not approved it, where the board of supervisors was empowered by statute to determine the terms and conditions of all such leases and where the trustees’ statutory veto power was only a veto over the annual rental value and was subject to the statutory dispute resolution procedures. Surles v. State, 357 So. 2d 319, 1978 Miss. LEXIS 2506 (Miss. 1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       Facts alleged in the bill, if supported by proof, would be capable of supporting a finding that the lease of a 320 acre tract of sixteenth section land for an annual rental of $170, although the fair value of the lease was $4,000 per year, amounted to an unconstitutional donation as well as an appropriation of the property to an object not authorized by law. The remedy would be the voiding of the lease rather that its continuation for the remainder of the 25-year lease period with damages prospectively figured for each year of its future existence. Keys v. Carter, 318 So. 2d 862, 1975 Miss. LEXIS 1455 (Miss. 1975).
      </p>
      <p>
       A 25-year lease of 150 acres of 16th section land for an annual rent of $37.50 from county superintendent of education to himself was void on its face, and a subsequent three-year lease of the same land from the county superintendent to another for an annual rent of $900 showed on its face that the lease to the county superintendent was for a grossly inadequate consideration amounting to a donation of public property to a private individual. County Board of Supervisors, the surety on their bonds, and the county superintendent were liable for the difference between the $900 annual rental and the $37.50 annual rental for each of the three years of the second lease, plus legal interest, rather than its continuation for the remainder of the 25-year lease period with damages prospectively figured for each year of its future existence. Holmes v. Jones, 318 So. 2d 865, 1975 Miss. LEXIS 1456 (Miss. 1975); Keys v. Carter, 318 So. 2d 862, 1975 Miss. LEXIS 1455 (Miss. 1975).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where evidence showed that the county supervisors had leased unused school buildings located on “sixteenth section land” to a civic association in good faith and without any knowledge that it would subsequently be used to house a private segregated school, such lease was not set aside; however, the sublease by the civic association to the whites-only private academy had a “chilling effect” on the operation of recently desegregated public schools and was set aside. United States v. Mississippi, 499 F.2d 425, 1974 U.S. App. LEXIS 7103 (5th Cir. Miss. 1974).
      </p>
      <p>
       It is well established that the state, acting through its various local bodies, is charged with the affirmative duty to take whatever steps might be necessary to bring about a unitary educational system free of racial discrimination, and where the state is the lessor of a former public school converted into a segregated private school, located on property specifically designated for the benefit of the public schools, there is a state involvement with such schools, and under such circumstances the proscriptions of the Fourteenth Amendment against racial discrimination by the state must be complied with by the lessee and sublessee as certainly as though they were binding covenants written into the agreement itself. United States v. Mississippi, 476 F.2d 941, 1973 U.S. App. LEXIS 10578 (5th Cir. Miss. 1973), vacated, 499 F.2d 425, 1974 U.S. App. LEXIS 7103 (5th Cir. Miss. 1974).

       Because the State was the ultimate fee-holder of sixteenth Section lands, it was a necessary party to any action that might forever divest it of title in those lands; when the board of education filed a complaint to quiet and confirm title, and the landowners counterclaimed for clear title on their behalf, the suit became one that endangered the State’s interest in protecting its asserted title.

       Where accretions washed against and on and become attached to school land in lieu of sixteenth section and to plantation abutting on Mississippi River, and where the owners of the plantation and board of county supervisors entered into contracts fixing the lines and apportioning accretions between them this was not a sale of sixteenth section or new lands.

       Employment generally of counsel by the year by the board of supervisors, under Code 1892, § 293 (Code 1942, § 2958), in no way deprives it of specially employing a different lawyer to investigate the special matter of title to sixteenth section school lands and to bring suit to confirm title thereto. Warren County v. Dabney, 81 Miss. 273, 32 So. 908, 1902 Miss. LEXIS 116 (Miss. 1902).

      <p>
       Hence a lease made in conformity to the statutes of the state was valid without the previous assent of the inhabitants of the township, where the statute did not require this, notwithstanding Act of Congress of 1852, making the assent of the inhabitants of the township a prerequisite to the validity of leases and sales. Jones v. Madison County, 72 Miss. 777, 18 So. 87, 1895 Miss. LEXIS 33 (Miss. 1895).
      </p>
      <p>
       A decision of this state erroneously holding that the title to sixteenth section school lands was in the United States instead of the state did not establish a rule of property and, though followed for many years, the doctrine of stare decisis would not be applied. Jones v. Madison County, 72 Miss. 777, 18 So. 87, 1895 Miss. LEXIS 33 (Miss. 1895).
      </p>
      <p>
       The State of Georgia and not the United States was the donor of these school lands; The United States took no title except in trust for the states to be created, and after a survey of the sections and on the admission of Mississippi as a state the title and control of these sections vested in the state in trust for the inhabitants of the several townships. Jones v. Madison County, 72 Miss. 777, 18 So. 87, 1895 Miss. LEXIS 33 (Miss. 1895).
      </p>
      <p>
       A suit was maintainable by a county under the former statute where the defendant claimed the sixteenth section in fee simple under a deed from the lessee, though the land was not sold by the county officials. Carroll County v. Jones, 71 Miss. 947, 15 So. 106, 1894 Miss. LEXIS 14 (Miss. 1894).

       Evidence submitted by the landowners would not support a finding that the State actually conveyed the tracts during the pre-1890 window of opportunity; the skeletonized abstracts and other evidence did not support the landowners’ adverse possession claim. Bd. of Educ. v. Warner, 853 So. 2d 1159, 2003 Miss. LEXIS 311 (Miss. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       Adverse possession statute addressing sixteenth section lands is inapplicable to state, thus precluding relief on claim that, because 1/2 cent per square foot was paid for sixteenth section school trust land, derivative lessees had property rights in land which were being taken away. Morrow v. Vinson, 666 So. 2d 802, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 620 (Miss. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       Adverse possession statute addressing sixteenth section land only applies to make proof of adverse possession prima facie evidence of due execution, payment of consideration, and the like where lawful authority for conveyance exists and conditions of statute are met. Morrow v. Vinson, 666 So. 2d 802, 1995 Miss. LEXIS 620 (Miss. 1995).
      </p>

   The State, acting through its school board, could not be equitably estopped under §§<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t29c03s29-3-7" target="_self">29-3-7</a></cite> and<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t29c03s29-3-52" target="_self">29-3-52</a></cite> from asserting inadequacy of consideration in a lease of sixteenth section school lands. Hill v. Thompson, 564 So. 2d 1, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 531 (Miss. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       The statutes of limitation concerning adverse possession do not run against the state. Mississippi State Highway Com. v. New Albany Gas Systems, 534 So. 2d 204, 1988 Miss. LEXIS 544 (Miss. 1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
   The adverse possession statute may not run against a county; if there be any conflict between Article 4, § 104 of the Mississippi Constitution and §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t29c03s29-3-7" target="_self">29-3-7</a></cite>, the constitutional provision takes precedence. Board of Education v. Loague, 405 So. 2d 122, 1981 Miss. LEXIS 2278 (Miss. 1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       In an action for confirmation of title to certain sixteenth section lands that had long been adversely possessed by private individuals, the 25-year adverse possession statute was inapplicable and could not be invoked against the state where there was no presumption of lost grant and no written instrument evidencing a claim or color of title in claimant or her predecessors in title to the 80 acres of land at issue; in addition, the constitution prohibited the running of statutes of limitation against the state in civil causes. Gibson v. State Land Comm'r, 374 So. 2d 212, 1979 Miss. LEXIS 2417 (Miss. 1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       Title to lieu and sixteenth section school lands could not be acquired by adverse possession pursuant to this section where the Board of School Commissioners, the alleged grantor of the adverse claimants’ predecessor in title, did not have the authority to convey the school land at the time of the alleged conveyance. This statute only applies to make proof of adverse possession prima facie evidence of due execution, payment of consideration, and the like where lawful authority for the conveyance exists and the conditions of the statute are met. Adams County v. McCoy, 347 So. 2d 366, 1977 Miss. LEXIS 2046 (Miss. 1977).
      </p>
      <p>
       The plaintiffs could not establish adverse possession against the county by tacking on the time of possession of their predecessors in title where their predecessors had admitted the county’s ownership by petitioning the board of supervisors for the purchase of the timber on the land and accepting a timber deed, all within the time period relied on. Burrage v. Lauderdale County, 245 So. 2d 842, 1971 Miss. LEXIS 1385 (Miss. 1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       To establish absolute title to sixteenth section lands because of adverse possession, the possession must not be under a claim to an unexpired lease but under a claim to the absolute fee simple title. Sumrall v. State, 209 Miss. 761, 48 So. 2d 502, 1950 Miss. LEXIS 442 (Miss. 1950).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section [Code 1942, § 6596] is not applicable to substantiate claim of title by adverse possession by plaintiffs who base their rights on an admittedly valid 99-year lease, and the evidence shows that they were only lessees for the unexpired term of the original lease. Pilgrim v. Neshoba County, 206 Miss. 703, 40 So. 2d 598, 1949 Miss. LEXIS 294 (Miss. 1949).
      </p>
      <p>
       Deeds to defendants’ predecessors in title of school lands under a former statute authorizing sale of school lands (§§ 2015-2019, Code of 1871), evidenced a claim of right in their behalf, was color of title in fee simple, and their possession under that claim and color for more than twenty-five years after 1892, in the absence of an affirmative showing that no valid sale was in fact made, renders the title acquired by such adverse possession under claim of title such that it cannot be successfully assailed. Foster v. Jefferson County, 202 Miss. 629, 32 So. 2d 126, 1947 Miss. LEXIS 323 (Miss. 1947), overruled in part, Bd. of Educ. v. Warner, 853 So. 2d 1159, 2003 Miss. LEXIS 311 (Miss. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       The benefits of this statute cannot be denied to one who has been in undisputed continuous and actual occupancy of lands for the prescribed period under recorded deeds in fee simple purporting to have been executed by lawful authority because a record cannot be found verifying that all statutory steps were taken. Foster v. Jefferson County, 202 Miss. 629, 32 So. 2d 126, 1947 Miss. LEXIS 323 (Miss. 1947), overruled in part, Bd. of Educ. v. Warner, 853 So. 2d 1159, 2003 Miss. LEXIS 311 (Miss. 2003).

       Railroad’s title to right of way over sixteenth section lands under order of supervisors after 25 years adverse possession cannot be a sale. Yazoo & M. V. R. Co. v. Bolivar County, 146 Miss. 30, 111 So. 581, 1927 Miss. LEXIS 201 (Miss. 1927).
      </p>
      <p>
       The statute of limitations does not run against the reversion in a sixteenth section during the existence of a lease. Weiler v. Monroe County, 76 Miss. 492, 25 So. 352, 1898 Miss. LEXIS 141 (Miss. 1898).
      </p>
      <p>
       A sale in fee of the sixteenth section school lands has never been authorized by law in this state. Weiler v. Monroe County, 76 Miss. 492, 25 So. 352, 1898 Miss. LEXIS 141 (Miss. 1898).

      </p>
      <p>
       This section [Code 1942, § 6596] is not confined to cases in which a lease has in fact been made and such lease is attacked because of alleged infirmity growing out of absence of evidence in compliance with the law. Carroll County v. Estes, 72 Miss. 171, 16 So. 908, 1894 Miss. LEXIS 123 (Miss. 1894).

       Tax collectors deed to school lands leased by county conveyed only the unexpired rights of lessee. Creekmore v. Neshoba County, 216 Miss. 589, 63 So. 2d 45, 1953 Miss. LEXIS 672 (Miss. 1953).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a deed conveying school lands that had been sold at public sale, has been in existence over seven years and recited that the land was sold in accordance with the law, all preceding conditions were presumed to have been complied with. Burkley v. Jefferson County, 213 Miss. 836, 58 So. 2d 22, 1952 Miss. LEXIS 433 (Miss. 1952).
      </p>
      <p>
       Claimant could not claim title by adverse possession for 25 years where tax forfeited land patent did not show whether title conveyed was a fee simple one or unexpired leasehold interest and where claimant testified that none of his predecessors had ever claimed fee simple title, but claimed, as he did also, under unexpired 99-year lease. Sumrall v. State, 209 Miss. 761, 48 So. 2d 502, 1950 Miss. LEXIS 442 (Miss. 1950).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where forfeited tax land patent, executed and delivered on July 4, 1881, conveying an estate in fee simple and containing no words of limitation of grant to the effect that it was an unexpired lease, recited that the land described therein was sold on May 10, 1875, for the taxes due the state, and it appears that the present holder of title and his predecessors in title had been in possession for more than fifty years since 1892, the presumption arises that the state had parted with fee simple title before January 1, 1874, and that it was a fee simple title and not a lease. Jones v. State, 202 Miss. 705, 32 So. 2d 435, 1948 Miss. LEXIS 210 (Miss. 1948).
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no presumption that one holding an agreement for a lease upon payment of installment notes actually paid the notes in the absence of proof that he went into possession or otherwise exercised substantial rights over the land. Foster v. Jefferson County, 202 Miss. 629, 32 So. 2d 126, 1947 Miss. LEXIS 323 (Miss. 1947), overruled in part, Bd. of Educ. v. Warner, 853 So. 2d 1159, 2003 Miss. LEXIS 311 (Miss. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       There must be an affirmative showing that there was no valid sale or lease in order to displace the curative effect of this statute. Foster v. Jefferson County, 202 Miss. 629, 32 So. 2d 126, 1947 Miss. LEXIS 323 (Miss. 1947), overruled in part, Bd. of Educ. v. Warner, 853 So. 2d 1159, 2003 Miss. LEXIS 311 (Miss. 2003).

       No presumption that the sixteenth section has been leased will be indulged in support of a tax deed, Code 1892 § 1806 (Code 1942 § 1739), as to prima facie effect of tax deeds, being without application in such case.

      The proceeds of the sale in fee simple of any sixteenth section, or lands granted in lieu thereof, in whole or in part, or such part of said proceeds as may be required to purchase acreage of equivalent fair market value, shall be used by the board of education, to purchase other land in the county, which land shall be held in the name of and reserved by the State of Mississippi for the support of the township schools in lieu of the land thus sold, as other sixteenth section lieu land is held, and shall be subject to all laws applicable thereto. Every such sale and every such purchase of land in lieu thereof shall be reported by the secretary of the board of education to the Secretary of State and to the State Forestry Commission within ninety (90) days after the consummation of each such sale and purchase. Any funds from a sale in fee simple of any sixteenth section land, or land granted in lieu thereof, in excess of any amount used to purchase said land in lieu thereof, shall be treated as corpus and shall be invested by the board of education as provided by law. Only the income from such investment shall be expended for current operating expenses of the schools.

       Local and private legislation would not be effective to authorize the sale of sixteenth section lands or lands granted in lieu thereof situated within the county for wildlife habitat preservation when the Constitution and statutes provide that such lands can be sold only for industrial development thereon. See Section 29-3-29. Griffith, April 19, 1995, A.G. Op. #95-0249.

       Sixteenth Section Principal Fund Monies cannot be used to acquire two parcels of land for school purposes to enlarge a campus of a new school under construction except in the form of a loan subject to the requirements found in Section 29-3-113. Brown, April 30, 1996, A.G. Op. #96-0196.
      </p>
      <p>
       In order to qualify for a proposed transaction under Sections 29-3-27 and 29-3-29, the Board of Education must make the determination on its minutes, consistent with fact, that the lands at issue were the site of the founding of this organization and that this organization has since expanded to national and international importance in its membership, scope and influence. Only then could the Board proceed with an industrial sale under Section 29-3-29. Webster, May 10, 1996, A.G. Op. #96-0267.
      </p>
      <p>
       Based on the language of Sections 29-3-113 and 29-3-27, the County Board of Education may use interest and income derived from the proceeds of the sale of the sixteenth section land to the County Board of Supervisors toward the purchase of a 400-acre tract. The school board may not use money from the principal fund to purchase the 400 acres. Clifton, October 29, 1996, A.G. Op. #96-0685.
      </p>
      <p>
       The district’s lieu lands are school trust lands and differ from other real property because of the fiduciary duty of the State and the Board in regard to the management of the property. The only way school trust lands may be severed by the school board from the school trust is prescribed in Section 29-3-27. Randolph, October 29, 1996, A.G. Op. #96-0634.

    Sales for use as industrial parks.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Before any sixteenth section school land or land granted in lieu thereof may be sold or leased for industrial development thereon, therein or thereunder under the provisions of this chapter, the board of education controlling such land shall first determine that such sale or lease will be fair market value. In the determination of the fair market value of said land the comparative sales method shall be used, and the highest and best use of said sixteenth section lands shall be determined on the basis of finding that said land shall be susceptible to any use that comparative land in private ownership may be used, that there will be prompt and substantial industrial development on, in, or under said land after the sale or lease, that the acreage to be sold or leased is not in excess of the amount of land reasonably required for immediate use and for such future expansion as may be reasonably anticipated, and that such sale or lease will be beneficial to and in the best interest of the schools of the district for which said land is held. All of said findings, including the amount of the sale price or gross rental for said land, shall be spread on the minutes of the board of education. Also, if the board of education proposes to sell said land, said board shall first enter into a contract or obtain a legal option to purchase, for a specified price not in excess of fair market value, other land in the county of acreage of equivalent fair market value, and such contract or option shall be spread on the minutes of said board. However, not more than one hundred (100) acres in any one (1) sixteenth section school lands in any county may be sold under this chapter for the purpose of being made an industrial park or a part of such industrial park, provided the provisions of this section and Sections 57-5-1 and 57-5-23 are fully complied with.
     </p>
     <p>
      A certified copy of the resolution or order of the board of education, setting out the foregoing findings, together with a certified copy of the order approving and setting out the terms of the contract or option to purchase other lands where a sale of land is proposed and an application to the Mississippi Agricultural and Industrial Board for the certificate authorizing said sale or lease, shall be forwarded to the county board of supervisors, which board shall make an independent investigation of the proposed sale or lease and of the proposed purchase of other land.
     </p>
     <p>
      If said county board of supervisors shall concur in the finding of fact of the board of education, and shall find that it is to the best interests of the schools of the district to enter into such sale or lease, it may enter on its minutes a resolution or order approving the action of the board of education.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the said county board of supervisors shall not concur in the findings of the board of education, or shall find that the proposed sale or lease will not be in the best interest of the schools of the district, then it may, by resolution or order, disapprove the proposed sale or lease, and such action shall be final.
     </p>
     <p>
      Except as otherwise permitted by Section 57-75-37(4)(f), there shall be reserved all minerals in, on, and under any lands conveyed under the provisions hereof. Provided, however, that in any county bordering on the State of Alabama, traversed by the Tombigbee River, in which U.S. Highway 82 intersects U.S. Highway 45 and in which is situated a state supported institution of higher learning, upon the sale of any sixteenth section lands for industrial purposes as provided by law, the board of education, the superintendent of education and the Mississippi Agricultural and Industrial Board, may sell and convey all minerals except oil, gas, sulphur and casinghead gas on, in and under the said sixteenth section lands so sold for industrial purposes. Said oil, gas, sulphur and casinghead gas shall be reserved together with such rights of use, ingress and egress as shall not unreasonably interfere with the use of the lands by the purchaser. Prior written approval for such use, ingress and egress, shall be obtained from the surface owner or, if such approval is unreasonably withheld, may be obtained from the chancery court of the county in which said land is located.
     </p>
     <p>
      Certified copies of the resolutions or orders of the board of supervisors and of the board of education and of the application to the Mississippi Agricultural and Industrial Board shall be transmitted to the county superintendent of education, if there be one in the county, who, if he approves the proposed sale or lease, shall so certify and forward same to the Mississippi Agricultural and Industrial Board. If there be no county superintendent of education in the county, then the board of education whose district embraces the entire county shall so certify and transmit said copies to the Mississippi Agricultural and Industrial Board for further action.
     </p>
     <p>
      Upon receipt of the aforesaid application and certified copies of the said resolution and orders, the Mississippi Agricultural and Industrial Board shall make investigation to determine whether or not the proposed sale or lease of said land will promote prompt and substantial industrial development thereon, therein, or thereunder. If the board finds that such sale or lease will promote prompt and substantial industrial development thereon, therein or thereunder, and further finds that the person, firm or corporation who proposes to establish said industry is financially responsible, and that the acreage to be sold or leased is not in excess of the amount of land reasonably required for immediate use and for such future expansion as may be reasonably anticipated, then the board, in its discretion, may issue a certificate to the board of education of said district so certifying, and said certificate shall be the authority for the board of education to enter into the proposed sale or lease. If the Mississippi Agricultural and Industrial Board does not so find, then it shall decline to issue said certificate which action shall be final.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Mississippi Agricultural and Industrial Board, when issuing a certificate to the county board of education certifying its findings and authorizing said sale or lease, may, nevertheless, in its discretion, make such sale or lease conditioned on and subject to the vote of the qualified electors of said district. Upon receipt of a certificate so conditioned upon an election, or upon a petition as hereinafter provided for, the board of education, by resolution spread upon its minutes, shall forward a copy of the certificate to the board of supervisors who by resolution upon its minutes, shall call an election to be held in the manner now provided by law for holding county elections, and shall fix in such resolution a date upon which such an election shall be held, of which not less than three (3) weeks notice shall be given by the clerk of said board of supervisors by publishing a notice in a newspaper published in said county once each week for three (3) consecutive weeks preceding the same, or if no newspaper is published in said county, then in a newspaper having a general circulation therein, and by posting a notice for three (3) weeks preceding said election at three (3) public places in said county. At such election, all qualified voters of the county may vote, and the ballots used shall have printed thereon a brief statement of the proposed sale or lease of said land, including the description and price, together with the words “For the proposed sale or lease” and the words “Against the proposed sale or lease,” and the voter shall vote by placing a cross (x) or check (v) opposite his choice of the proposition. Should the election provided for herein result in favor of the proposed sale or lease by at least two-thirds (2/3) of the votes cast being in favor of the said proposition, the board of supervisors shall notify the board of education who may proceed forthwith to sell or lease said land in accordance with the proposition so submitted to the electors. If less than two-thirds (2/3) of those voting in such special election vote in favor of the said sale or lease, then said land shall not be sold or leased.
     </p>
     <p>
      The board of education shall further be required, prior to passing of a resolution expressing its intent to sell said land, to publish a notice of intent to sell said land for three (3) consecutive weeks in a newspaper published in said county or, if there be none, in a newspaper having a general circulation in said county, and to post three (3) notices thereof in three (3) public places in said county, one (1) of which shall be at the courthouse, for said time. If within the period of three (3) weeks following the first publication of said intent, a petition signed by twenty percent (20%) of the qualified electors of said county shall be filed with the board of supervisors requesting an election concerning the sale, then an election shall be called as hereinabove provided.

       Under § 6609, Code of 1942 now repealed but substantially re-enacted in § 7 of chapter 443, Laws of 1946 it was held that where notes were executed for the rental of sixteenth section school lands which were payable in middling cotton, and the notes were past due, although the notes were not negotiable they were good and enforceable as between the parties.

       This act did not contemplate a blanket waiver of the county’s right; but a release by the county of its lien must set forth the facts so that the board of supervisors may determine what is a reasonable sum and what are reasonable finances, so that a contract waiving absolutely and unconditionally the entire rights of the county to an undetermined amount of financial assistance, without any determination or finding by the board of supervisors as to the amount necessary, is not valid.

       Local and private legislation would not be effective to authorize the sale of sixteenth section lands or lands granted in lieu thereof situated within the county for wildlife habitat preservation when the Constitution and statutes provide that such lands can be sold only for industrial development thereon. Griffith, April 19, 1995, A.G. Op. #95-0249.
      </p>
      <p>
       In order to qualify for a proposed transaction under Sections 29-3-27 and 29-3-29, the Board of Education must make the determination on its minutes, consistent with fact, that the lands at issue were the site of the founding of this organization and that this organization has since expanded to national and international importance in its membership, scope and influence. Only then could the Board proceed with an industrial sale under Section 29-3-29. Webster, May 10, 1996, A.G. Op. #96-0267.

      <p>
       If sixteenth section land to be sold pursuant to the industrial development statutes is located in a shared township, an affected school district sharing in said revenue is not required to approve the sale; the board of education controlling such land would make the proposal to sell said land pursuant to the provisions of
   Section 29-3-29 and its decision must be made as a trustee for all of the school districts involved. Cheney, May 16, 2003, A.G. Op. 03-0163.

    Survey and classification of lands in Choctaw Purchase.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      It is hereby made the duty of the board of education, using the services of all appropriate public agencies, to survey and classify all sixteenth section lands in the Choctaw purchase and lands granted in lieu thereof reserved for the support of township schools. Said lands shall be classified into eight (8) categories, as follows: (1) forest land; (2) agricultural land; (3) industrial land; (4) commercial land; (5) farm-residential land; (6) residential land; (7) recreational land; and (8) other land. The classifications shall be applied to said lands based upon the finding of the highest and best use of each parcel or tract for producing a maximum of revenue by proper utilization. In determining the highest and best use of these lands, the same principles shall be followed as are applied in determining the highest and best use of land in private ownership. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, all land that is being used as “residential land” or “farm-residential land” shall continue to be classified as “residential land” or “farm-residential land” until such land ceases to be used as a residence.
     </p>
     <p>
      All sixteenth section lands in the Choctaw purchase and lands granted in lieu thereof, regardless of classification, shall be deemed to contain oil, gas and minerals, including the following: (a) oil, gas, carbon dioxide and other gaseous substances; (b) metals, compounds of metals or metal-bearing ores; (c) coal, including anthracite, bituminous, subbituminous, lignite and their constituent components and products and minerals intermingled or associated therewith; and (d) sulphur, salt, sand, gravel, fill dirt and clay.
     </p>
     <p>
      Such oil, gas and minerals shall be leased for exploration, mining, production and development as provided for in Section 29-3-99, regardless of the classifications of the lands in, on or under which such oil, gas and minerals are situated. Statutory procedures for the leasing of the surface of the land in such eight (8) classifications shall not apply to such oil, gas and minerals in, on or under such lands.
     </p>
     <p>
      Such oil, gas and minerals shall be deemed a separate classification of sixteenth section lands for the purpose of Section 211 of the Mississippi Constitution.

       Sixteenth section lands are not validly classified as “farm residential land” if the lease holder does not reside on the property or meet one of the exceptions in Miss. Code Section 29-3-33(f), and the board of education has a duty to reclassify the land based on its “highest and best use . . . for producing a maximum of revenue”. Frierson, July 18, 1997, A.G. Op. #97-0431.
      </p>
      <p>
       In connection with the lease by a school district of agricultural land to a developer under a residential development lease contract, the district may not reclassify a swamp and shallow lake on the property to “recreation” or “other” and lease that land for one dollar per acre because of the board’s obligation to the board of education as trustee to obtain the highest and best return possible from sixteenth section land. Chaney, Nov. 25, 2002, A.G. Op. #02-0629.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any reclassification of 16th section school trust land is impermissible if it results in a reduction in the annual rent. Furthermore, once 16th section land which has been classified as agricultural, it may not thereafter be reclassified as farm-residential. Cheney, Sept. 24, 2004, A.G. Op. 04-0457.

       Land that is presently classified as forest land which is to be leased to a county school district would require a reclassification of land use as is found in Sections 29-3-33 and 29-3-39. In evaluating the appropriate rental compensation to the city school district, the rental rate must comply with 29-3-63(2). Hilbun, August 23, 1995, A.G. Op. #95-0567.

      <p>
       A tract of land is properly classified as “farm residential land” only if the lease holder uses the property for agricultural purposes and resides directly upon the leased premises, the leaseholder resides on a residential tract for which there are “reasonable easements connecting the residential tracts” or resides on a “residential tract” that is “situated a distance not exceeding one and one-half (1-1/2) miles from the outlying tract”.

    Objections to classification.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      At any time when any or all portions of such land lying in a county shall have been classified as hereinabove required, a classification report shall be compiled by the board of education and filed with the public lands division of the secretary of state who shall provide forms for such purpose. The board of education shall immediately cause notice to be given of the completion of such classification, such notice to be published in a newspaper in said county once each week for three (3) consecutive weeks, or if no newspaper is published in said county then in a newspaper having a general circulation therein, listing all lands so classified and notifying all parties in interest that they will have a right to appeal and object to the classification as made. If no objections are made as to the classification of any particular parcel of said land by the public lands division of the secretary of state or any other party in interest, which objection must be reduced to writing and filed with the chancery clerk within thirty (30) days from the date of the final publication, the classification as to such parcel or parcels of land shall be final. A copy of such notice shall be mailed by the superintendent of education to each lessee of any part of such lands, such notice to be so mailed not later than the date of the first publication of the notice of the classification of such land, which notice shall also set forth the classification which has been established for all lands under lease by such lessee. If objections are filed, then the matter shall be heard by the chancery court in term time or in vacation, and the court shall either confirm or modify the classification as the circumstances shall demand. Upon the filing of such objection by an individual other than the public lands division of the secretary of state, the chancery clerk shall immediately forward a certified copy of such objection to the public lands division of the secretary of state and the appropriate board of education, along with any necessary service of process. The public lands division of the Secretary of State and any other person aggrieved by the order of the chancery court shall have the same rights of appeal as is provided by law for appeals from other orders of the chancery court, and such appeal shall be perfected as other appeals are now required to be so perfected.
     </p>
     <p>
      The cost of any such classification or reclassification under Section 29-3-39 shall be paid from any available sixteenth section school funds or other school funds of the district.

     <p>
      It shall be the duty of the board of education to survey periodically the classification of all sixteenth section land under its jurisdiction and to reclassify that land as it may deem advisable because of changes of conditions, and when any land is so reclassified, the board of education shall file a report thereof with the Secretary of State. From time to time the Secretary of State may institute proceedings to reclassify any sixteenth section lands which he may deem advisable and when any land is so reclassified, the Secretary of State shall file a report thereof with the board of education. When any land is reclassified under this section, notice thereof, rights to object thereto and rights to appeal therefrom shall be given in the same manner provided in Section 29-3-37 with reference to the original classification. However, all sixteenth section land shall be classified, or reclassified as is necessary, within one (1) year prior to the expiration date of any existing lease, and within sixty (60) days of the terminating of any lease of sixteenth section land by final court order. In all litigation which may result from the classification or reclassification of lands by the Secretary of State under Sections 29-3-31 through 29-3-39, the Secretary of State shall be represented by the Attorney General, who shall have control of the litigation except as otherwise authorized in Section 7-5-39, but it shall be the duty of the various boards of education to furnish local legal assistance when requested so to do by the Attorney General.

     <p>
      After any parcels of sixteenth section lands have been classified as hereinabove provided, all land which has been classified as forest land and which is not now under lease shall hereafter not be leased. The lands classified as forest lands which may be under a lease that has a fixed date of expiration shall not be re-leased when said lease expires; nor shall the lessee be permitted to cut or remove any timber therefrom except according to the terms of his lease. Such lands shall be reserved and kept as forest lands. Provided further, that the mineral rights in all such lands may be leased for oil, gas, or mineral purposes, and the board of education may grant leases to the surface of said lands classified as forest, which are limited to hunting and fishing rights and activities in relation thereto, and which shall not extend for a period longer than fifteen (15) years. It shall be the duty of the board of education to lease said hunting and fishing rights at public contract after having advertised same for rent in a newspaper published in said county or, if no newspaper be published in said county, then in a newspaper having a general circulation therein, for two (2) successive weeks, the first being at least ten (10) days prior to said public contract. Said hunting and fishing rights shall be leased to the person offering the highest annual rental. Bids received by the board of education in response to the advertisement shall be opened at a regular or special meeting of the board. The board of education, at its option, may reject all bids or accept the highest and best bid received in response to the advertisement, or the board of education may hold an auction among those who submitted bids in response to the advertisement, provided that three (3) or more persons who submitted bids in response to the advertisement participate in the auction. The opening bid at the auction shall be the highest bid received in response to the advertisement. Provided that if the board of education receives an acceptable bid or elects to hold an auction, the most recent holder of said hunting and fishing rights if it shall have made an offer, shall have the final right to extend its lease for the term advertised at the annual rental equal to said highest offer received by the board of education, or equal to the highest bid offered at the auction, as the case may be.
     </p>
     <p>
      If no bid acceptable to the board of education is received after said advertisement, the board of education may, within ninety (90) days, lease same by private contract for an amount greater than the highest bid previously rejected. If the board of education determines to lease the land by private contract, the most recent holder of said hunting and fishing rights, if it shall have made an offer, shall have the final right to extend its lease on the same terms and conditions as those contained in the private contract proposed to be accepted by the board of education.

         The board of education shall, by order placed upon its minutes, enter into an agreement with the State Forestry Commission for the general supervision and management of all lands classified as forest lands and of all timber or other forest products under the control of the board on sixteenth section lands, and lieu lands which have not been so classified. However, any school board may contract with private persons or businesses for the reforestation of sixteenth section lands and may contract with a registered forester to be paid from the 16th Section Interest Fund for a review of any forestry management decision or forestry practice including the sale of timber for sixteenth section forest land provided that any implementation of a forestry management decision or forestry practice to be taken as a result of the review described in this subsection shall be subject to the approval of both the commission and the Secretary of State. When such agreement has been entered into, no timber or other forest products shall be sold from any of the sixteenth section lands or lieu lands except such as have been marked or approved for cutting by the State Forestry Commission’s employees. The Forestry Commission, or its designated employee, shall fix the minimum total cash price or minimum price per unit, one thousand (1,000) feet or other measure, at which the marked timber or other forest products shall be sold. The sales may be made for a lump sum or upon a unit price as in the opinion of the board may be calculated to bring the greatest return. Sales shall be made upon such other terms and conditions as to manner of cutting, damages for cutting of unmarked trees, damages to trees not cut and other pertinent matters as the board of education shall approve.
        </li>
        <li id="t29c03s29-3-45ol11b">
         The State Forestry Commission shall have the sole authority and control in scheduling of all cutting and harvesting of timber or other forest products when such timber stands or other forest products are determined by the State Forestry Commission to be economically ready for cutting and harvesting.
        </li>
        <li id="t29c03s29-3-45ol11c">
         Should a school board disagree with the Forestry Commission concerning the time of cutting and harvesting, the board may make an appeal to the Forestry Commission at a regular monthly scheduled meeting of the commission. If the school board is not satisfied after the appeal to the commission, the board may then appeal to the Secretary of State who will make the final decision as to the time for cutting and harvesting. In the event that the local school board is divested of its management authority under subsection (3) hereof, the Secretary of State after due consultation with the Forestry Commission shall retain the right to make final decisions concerning the management and sale of timber and other forest products.
        </li>
        <li id="t29c03s29-3-45ol11d">
         It is hereby made the duty of the State Forestry Commission, from time to time, to mark timber which should be cut from the lands, to determine what planting, deadening or other forestry improvements should be made, giving due consideration to food and habitat for wildlife, and to report to the appropriate board of education. The State Forestry Commission and the board of education shall supervise the cutting of any timber or harvesting of other forest products sold from the lands herein designated and shall have authority to require any timber-cutting operations on the lands to cease until proper adjustment is made, whenever it shall appear that timber is being cut in violation of the terms of the sale. In the event that it is desired to lease any of such lands or standing timber for turpentine purposes, such lease shall only cover such trees as the State Forestry Commission shall designate, and the commission through its employees shall approve the number of faces, method of chipping and boxing of such timber, and shall fix a minimum total cash price or minimum price per unit.
        </li>
        <li id="t29c03s29-3-45ol11e">
         No sale of any timber, turpentine or other forest products lease shall be made until notice of same shall have been published once a week for three (3) consecutive weeks in at least one (1) newspaper published in such county. The first publication of such notice shall be made not less than twenty-one (21) days prior to the date fixed for the sale, and the last publication shall be made not more than seven (7) days prior to such date. If no newspaper is published in such county, then such notice shall be given by publishing the same for the required time in some newspaper having a general circulation in such county and, in addition thereto, by posting a copy of such notice for at least twenty-one (21) days next preceding such sale at three (3) public places in such county.
        </li>
        <li id="t29c03s29-3-45ol11f">
         Notwithstanding the above provision pertaining to the sale of any timber, turpentine or other forest products, in the event that timber must be cleared from an existing road or existing utility right-of-way, the public notice requirement may be waived. Prior to waiver of the public notice requirement, the State Forestry Commission must make a finding that, due to the small area of timber to be cleared, a public notice sale would not be in the best interest of the local board of education. If the State Forestry Commission makes such a finding, then it shall set the value of the timber to be paid to the local board of education by the party requesting the timber be removed.
        </li>
        <li id="t29c03s29-3-45ol11g">
         Provided, however, in the case of damage by fire, windstorm or other natural causes which would require immediate sale of the timber, because the time involved for advertisement as prescribed herein would allow decay, rot or destruction substantially decreasing the purchase price to be received had not such delay occurred, the advertisement provisions of this section shall not apply. The local board of education, with a written recommendation from a designated employee of the State Forestry Commission filed in the minutes of the local board of education, shall determine when immediate sale of the timber is required. When the board of education shall find an immediate sale necessary for the causes stated herein, it shall, in its discretion, set the time for receipt of bids on the purchase of the timber, but shall show due diligence in notifying competitive bidders so that a true competitive bid shall be received.

       The legislature has never authorized a lease of sixteenth section lands for the purpose of growing commercial timber thereon. Bernard v. Board of Sup'rs, 216 Miss. 387, 62 So. 2d 576, 1953 Miss. LEXIS 649 (Miss. 1953).
      </p>
      <p>
       A purchaser from one who purchased 16th section timber from a board of supervisors is presumed under the law to have known that the board was selling the timber as agent of the state which held it as trustee for the educable children of the township, and was in duty bound not to sell the same for a grossly inadequate consideration virtually amounting to a donation in violation of § 95 of the State Constitution. State ex rel. Kyle v. Dear, 209 Miss. 268, 47 So. 2d 150, 1950 Miss. LEXIS 387 (Miss. 1950).
      </p>
      <p>
       Grossly inadequate consideration for the sale of 16th section timber is shown prima facie by the fact that only $500 was received for the timber and th at at a subsequent sale, not too remote, and where no substantial change in the conditions or circumstances in the meantime is shown to have intervened, the property brought the sum of $4,000 in a resale to a purchaser of experience in valuing the quantity and quality of timber. State ex rel. Kyle v. Dear, 209 Miss. 268, 47 So. 2d 150, 1950 Miss. LEXIS 387 (Miss. 1950).
      </p>
      <p>
       The members of the board of supervisors, and the sureties on their official bonds, are not liable for the losses occasioned by their failure to exercise proper care in ascertaining the reasonable value of 16th section timber sold by them, since they are exercising a judicial function in determining the price at which the same should be sold. State ex rel. Kyle v. Dear, 209 Miss. 268, 47 So. 2d 150, 1950 Miss. LEXIS 387 (Miss. 1950).
      </p>
      <p>
       Board of Supervisors has no right to sell Sixteenth Section timber for grossly inadequate price, and this is true even though its action in so doing is due to negligence rather than fraud or bad faith. State ex rel. Kyle v. Dear, 209 Miss. 268, 47 So. 2d 150, 1950 Miss. LEXIS 387 (Miss. 1950).
      </p>
      <p>
       Board of Supervisors is prohibited by § 95 of State Constitution to make a sale of Sixteenth Section timber under authority of this section for such a grossly inadequate price as to virtually amount to a donation thereof. State ex rel. Kyle v. Dear, 209 Miss. 268, 47 So. 2d 150, 1950 Miss. LEXIS 387 (Miss. 1950).
      </p>
      <p>
       A board of supervisors, while acting as agent for the state which holds property as trustee, cannot bind the state by a sale of 16th section timber in violation of the Constitution, whether the action of the board is due to its negligence or due to fraud or collusion.

       Timber on school lands held under a 99-year agricultural lease could not be sold by the board of supervisors without the consent of the lessee, in view of the latter’s right to “estovers”; and where board of supervisors sold such timber without lessee’s consent, lessee was entitled to maintain a suit to enjoin removal of the timber.

       § 29-3-47.
    Forestry escrow fund.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      For its services the state forestry commission shall be entitled to receive its actual expenses incurred in the discharge of the duties herein imposed. In order to provide funds with which to pay for the general supervision and sale of forest products, fifteen percent (15%) of all receipts from the sales of forest products shall be placed by the board in a forestry escrow fund and reserved to pay for work performed by the state forestry commission. Such payments shall be equal to the actual expenses incurred by the commission as substantiated by itemized bills presented to the board.
     </p>
     <p>
      Money in the forestry escrow fund may be used to pay for any forestry work authorized during the period of the agreement and shall not be subject to lapse by reason of county budget limitations.
     </p>
     <p>
      In each school district having need of tree planting and timber stand improvement, the board of education is authorized to place additional amounts in the forestry escrow fund to reimburse the state forestry commission for actual expenses incurred in performing this work, or to pay for any work done under private contract under the supervision of said commission. Such additional amounts may be made available from forest products sales receipts, funds borrowed from the sixteenth section principal fund as is provided for in Section 29-3-113, or any other funds available to the board of education excluding minimum foundation program funds. Expenditures from the forestry escrow fund for tree planting, timber stand improvement, and other forestry work will be limited to payment for work recommended by the forestry commission and agreed to by the board of education.
     </p>
     <p>
      When it becomes evident that the amount of money in the forestry escrow fund is in excess of the amount necessary to accomplish the work needed to achieve the goals set by the board of education and the forestry commission, the state forestry commission shall advise said board to release any part of such funds as will not be needed, which may then be spent for any purpose authorized by law.

     <p>
      It shall be the duty of the State Forestry Commission, in the manner provided in Section 29-3-45, to enter into agreements for timber improvement purposes with the board of education upon the request of the board. The contract shall provide for the carrying out of a long-term program of timber improvement, including any or all of the following: The deadening of undesirable hardwoods, the planting of trees, the cutting and maintaining of fire lanes, and the establishment of marked boundaries on all lands classified as forest lands in the agreements, which provide for the reimbursement of all current costs incurred by the State Forestry Commission and the carrying out of the duties required by such agreements. In the alternative, the commission, in its discretion, may have the option to contract with a private contractor, subject to the approval of the board, to perform this work under the supervision of the commission. Payment of the reimbursements as hereinabove set forth to the Forestry Commission, or of compensation due under any such contract with private contractors shall be made upon presentation of itemized bills by the commission or the private contractors, as the case may be, and may be made out of any sixteenth section funds to the credit of, or accruing to, any school district in which such work shall be done, or out of any other funds available to such district, excluding minimum foundation program funds.

       This section does not vest power in the chancery court to make a lease of sixteenth section lands, since such power is vested by § 211 of the Constitution in the legislature, and the legislature has already enacted laws pursuant to such constitutional provision.

       Chancery court had jurisdiction under this section to entertain a suit by school trustees of a township, seeking the court’s approval of a proposed but unexecuted mineral lease of sixteenth section land, to determine whether such land was subject to lease by the proper authorities under any existing law, and, particularly, whether such land could be leased by the county supervisors under § 6762 (Code of 1930), and to determine the validity of ch 150, Laws, 1942 (§ 6600, Code of 1942), amending such section.

Hill v. Thompson, 564 So. 2d 1, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 531 (Miss. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       A lease of school trust land was voidable for inadequate consideration as violative of the donation clause of Article IV, § 95 of the Mississippi Constitution where the consideration paid for the lease was so grossly inadequate as to shock the conscience and to defeat any challenge even of one otherwise claiming the status of a bona fide purchaser; the inadequate consideration was not a hidden title defect but was a matter of public record, so openly blatant as to put any purchaser on notice of a possible defect in the trustee’s title where the tax assessments of the city and the county gave notice of value that should have suggested that a far higher rental was required to meet the constitutional mandate of non-donation, and the appraiser’s report stated that only a nominal value was used. As a matter of law, a one-time gross sum payment which amounted to $.07575 per year consideration was grossly inadequate and amounted to a donation of public lands prohibited by the constitution and trust law. Mere compliance with statutory formalities and procedures did not vitiate substantive violation of constitutional prohibitions. The case would be remanded to the school district board of trustees for a new determination of the present rental value by a competent appraiser under the 1978 Reform Act. While the public policy of making all reasonable efforts to keep sixteenth section lands leased so that they might be developed and produce revenue from taxation is not an unworthy goal, and this policy may have influenced past officials in leasing sixteenth section lands for nominal rentals, its emphasis must not overshadow constitutional mandates. Hill v. Thompson, 564 So. 2d 1, 1990 Miss. LEXIS 531 (Miss. 1990).

     </h3>
     <p>
      The superintendent of education shall keep a current docket as to the expiration date of all leases on sixteenth section lands; likewise, he shall keep a correct current docket upon the existing leases or any extensions thereof as to the amounts and time of payment of rentals provided for by such lease. It shall be the duty of the superintendent of education to collect promptly all rentals due and all principal and interest due upon loans and investments of sixteenth section funds. Upon a sixty (60) day default in payment of any rentals according to the terms of such lease, the lease shall be declared terminated unless the board of education finds extenuating circumstances were present, and the board shall inaugurate the proper legal proceedings to terminate such lease. The superintendent of education, with the approval of the board of education, may employ an attorney or other person to aid in collecting any such funds when in his opinion the same is necessary, and may pay reasonable compensation therefor out of funds collected, not to exceed in any case twenty-five percent (25%) of the amount actually collected. It shall be the duty of the superintendent of education to supervise generally the administration of all sixteenth section lands within his jurisdiction. In all cases where leases of sixteenth section lands are entered into, it shall be the duty of the superintendent of education to take the notes of the lessees for the rents provided by said lease and turn them over to the county depository and attend to their collection. In the case of the leasing of agricultural lands, the school district shall have the same rights and remedies for the security and collection of such rent as are given by law to agricultural landlords.

       A 25-year lease of 150 acres of sixteenth section land for an annual rent of $37.50 from county superintendent of education to himself was void on its face, and a subsequent three year lease of the same land from the county superintendent to another for an annual rent of $900 showed on its face that the lease to the county superintendent was for a grossly inadequate consideration amounting to a donation of public property to a private individual; County board of supervisors, the surety on their bonds, and the county superintendent were liable for the difference between the $900 annual rental and the $37.50 annual rental for each of the three years of the second lease, plus legal interest, rather than its continuation for the remainder of the 25-year lease period with damages prospectively figured for each year of its future existence.

   A chancellor’s ruling that the 25-year limitation of Mississippi Constitution Article VIII § 211 had no application to an oil or gas lease, which was based on the economic reality that a mineral lessee must be allowed to maintain a lease for an indefinite period of time to maximize profits and was an attempt to redress perceived economic hardships with equitable principles, would be reversed since § 211 clearly limits sixteenth section land leases (including mineral leases) to a maximum term of 25 years, and it the judiciary’s responsibility to interpret the law, not institute economic policies. Should the perceived economic hardships of § 211 be real, the onus is upon the legislature to redress such economic inadequacies, and Mississippi Constitution Article XV, § 273 provides the exclusive means for amendment. Additionally, §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t29c03s29-3-63" target="_self">29-3-63</a></cite>, which provides the holder of a lease of 16th section land with a prior right, exclusive of all other persons, to re-lease or extend an existing lease, diminishes the perceived harsh consequences which might result from the enforcement of § 211 against all oil, gas and mineral leases of 16th section land.

    Appraisal of lands; adjustment of rental amounts.

     </h3>
     <p>
      One (1) year prior to the date, when any such lands, not subject to competitive bid procedures, shall become available for lease, the board of education shall appoint a competent appraiser to appraise the land and report to the board his recommendation for the fair market rental amount. The board shall then determine whether the same be a reasonable amount, and shall grant the lease pursuant to Section 29-3-63. Provided that in the event any such land becomes available for lease prior to July 1, 1979, an appraisal shall be required prior to the granting of said lease.
     </p>
     <p>
      The board of education may use rent escalation clauses or other such devices to adjust rental amounts during the lease term. Owners of leaseholds under a lease granted prior to July 1, 1978, which have improvements constructed thereon, shall not be charged for such improvements in successive lease periods unless the lease contract clearly specifies otherwise. The cost of the appraisal under this section shall be paid from any available sixteenth section school funds or other school funds of the district.

     <p>
      The appraisal pertaining to renewal oil, gas and mineral leases executed pursuant to Section 29-3-63 may be made either before or after the expiration of the original lease and shall appraise the fair market value for the bonus to be paid for a renewal lease containing the terms and conditions agreed upon by the holder of the lease and the board of education.

       Substantial evidence supported chancellor’s findings that competent appraisals had been performed for land held in trust by county board of education and county board of supervisors, and that division of property into two parcels for leasing for shopping mall development was not significant change that would require separate appraisal of one of those tracts, regardless of chancellor’s mistaken belief that one of parcels was wholly part of original separate tract before property had been combined; competent and reliable update appraisal had been done on combined tract, which was then divided, and lease provided board of education with same revenue that it would have gotten had tract not been divided.

       The Board of Education has the final authority, duty and responsibility to determine the reasonable annual rental amount to be assessed on sixteenth section lands, and is not bound by a percentage of fair market sale value or fair market rental value of the land; the board is simply required to lease the sixteenth section land for the fair rental value thereof in order for the Board to absolve itself of liability for inadequate rentals.

       Where there were two suits pending against the superintendent of education for mandamus in connection with proposed lease of certain sixteenth section lands, one in the circuit court brought by the prospective lessees and the other in the Supreme Court brought by the county board of supervisors, the petition filed in the Supreme Court as an original suit would be dismissed because the appeal by the superintendent of education from the order of the board of supervisors directing the execution of the lease, pending before the Supreme Court, could not be cut off in this manner and, secondly, statutory jurisdiction of a mandamus suit against an official such as the superintendent of education was vested in the circuit court whose jurisdiction could not be circumvented by the filing of an independent and original case in the Supreme Court.

       Where sixteenth section lands, partly located in the municipality, were leased by the board of supervisors to a nonprofit corporation, and under a contract with the power company, the nonprofit corporation undertook the construction of a reservoir on the leased premises and the power company was to use the water therein in connection with the operation of his electric generating plant, and the capitalized value of the leased land per acre upon the completion of the proposed improvements would greatly exceed the present capitalized value per acre, and there was no taking or removing of the soil from the premises, the construction of the reservoir would not constitute waste; nor did the fact that the leased lands were formerly used almost exclusively for agricultural purposes mean that it would be unlawful to construct the proposed improvements, or that the land should be used for commercial or residential purposes, especially in view of the fact that there had been no development of the lands, so that the chancellor’s action in refusing to enjoin the construction of the proposed improvements and in confirming the lease was proper.

      The board of education may lease school trust lands classified as industrial, commercial, farm-residential, residential, recreational, catfish farming or other for a term not exceeding forty (40) years for a ground rental, payable annually. All leases, except leases of residential or farm-residential lands, made for a ground rental shall contain rent adjustment clauses or other such provisions requiring that the consideration for every lease of such lands shall be adjusted not less than once every ten (10) years from the date of the lease to reflect the current fair market rental value of the lands, exclusive of any improvements thereon. In leases of lands which are or which are to become residential or farm-residential land, the board of education may require a rent adjustment clause in which rents are to be adjusted, provided that such adjustments will not exceed the fair market rental value of the lands, exclusive of improvements thereon, as of the rental adjustment dates. If a rent adjustment clause is not contained in a lease of lands which are or which are to become residential or farm-residential land, the reasons for not including such clause in the lease shall be stated in the lease and entered on the minutes of the board. In the case of uncleared lands, the board of education may lease them for such short terms as may be deemed proper in consideration of the improvement thereof, with the right thereafter to lease or to hold on payment of a ground rental. The board of education may lease not more than three (3) acres of any such lands for a term not exceeding ninety-nine (99) years for a ground rental, payable annually, to any church having its principal place of worship situated on such lands, which has been in continuous operation at that location for not less than twenty-five (25) years at the time of the lease. The consideration for every lease of such lands to a church shall be renegotiated not less than once every twenty-five (25) years from the date of the lease to reflect the current fair market rental value of the lands, exclusive of any improvements thereon.
     </p>
     <p>
      The board of education may, at any time, by agreement with any lessee of lands, except for lands classified as forest or agricultural, cancel an existing lease and execute a new lease contract on such land where major capital improvements have been made or for the purpose of facilitating the addition of major capital improvements, provided that the rental amount of such new lease shall not be less than the rental amount in the prior lease. The term of such new lease shall not exceed forty (40) years for a ground rental, payable annually, provided that prior to the execution of such new lease contract, the provisions of all applicable statutes setting forth the procedure and requirements for the execution of a lease for sixteenth section lands or lieu lands have been satisfied.
     </p>
     <p>
      The board of education may find that in the interest of good trust management it may be necessary to grant in the original lease contract an option to renew any lease not subject to competitive bid procedures, for a term not to exceed twenty-five (25) years. If such a finding be made, it shall be entered on the minutes of the board and the option granted; provided that the execution of a new lease shall be required to effectuate the additional lease period and the provisions of all applicable statutes setting forth the procedure and requirements for the execution of a lease for sixteenth section lands or lieu lands have been satisfied.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subleasing or assignment of any lease of school trust lands executed after July 1, 1978, shall only be allowed when provided in the lease contract or at the discretion of the board of education; provided that permission to sublease or assign shall not be arbitrarily withheld.

       Where sixteenth section lands, partly located in the municipality, were leased by the board of supervisors to a nonprofit corporation, and under a contract with the power company, the nonprofit corporation undertook the construction of a reservoir on the leased premises and the power company was to use the water therein in connection with the operation of its electric generating plant, and the capitalized value of the leased land per acre upon the completion of the proposed improvements would greatly exceed the present capitalized value per acre, and there was no taking or removing of the soil from the premises, the construction of the reservoir would not constitute waste; nor did the fact that the leased lands were formerly used almost exclusively for agricultural purposes mean that it would be unlawful to construct the proposed improvements, or that the land should be used for commercial or residential purposes, especially in view of the fact that there had been no development of the lands, so that the chancellor’s action in refusing to enjoin the construction of the proposed improvements and in confirming the lease was proper.

       Leasehold interest in sixteenth section land is taxable and may be sold for failure to pay taxes; if leasehold interest was sold, county collected its taxes through that sale and there are no outstanding taxes, and taxes no longer accrue after purchase on remainder of leasehold interest.

       Since a sale for taxes of a sixteenth section land leasehold is deemed to pay the taxes, personal liability therefor is extinguished by such sale, and there is no subsequent duty upon a chancery clerk or a tax assessor and collector to collect said unpaid taxes.

     <p>
      Where any school land, generally known as sixteenth sections, reserved for the use of schools, or land reserved or granted in lieu of or substituted for sixteenth sections lies within or partly within any drainage district created under the laws of this state, and will be benefited by such drainage district, such land so benefited shall be liable for its pro rata share of the costs, expenses, taxes, and assessments relating to said district as if owned by an individual, and shall be assessed accordingly, as other lands are assessed. But in case of a sale of such lands for such taxes or assessments, only the title of the lessee holding such lands under lease at the time of the sale shall pass by the sale.
     </p>
     <p>
      Where such sixteenth section land, or land taken in lieu thereof, shall be held by any lessee, whether his lease shall have heretofore been acquired or shall hereafter be acquired, all such drainage taxes and assessments accruing thereon during such lease shall, in the discretion of the board of education, either be paid by the lessee, his grantees or assigns, or by the board of education, but the liability for such drainage taxes shall be fixed by the lease contract when said lands are leased. Where said lands have been leased by the superintendent of education, with the consent of the board of education in open session, and said lease contract provides that the lessee shall pay all such drainage taxes and assessments, and the lessee has actually entered upon and occupied said lands as lessee and is recognized as such, the school district in which said sixteenth section is located shall not be liable for such drainage taxes on account of the negligence of the secretary in failing to enter the order of the board approving said lease contract on its minutes. All such drainage taxes and assessments accruing on any such lands while the same are not leased shall be paid by the board of education of the school district in which such lands are situated, out of any sixteenth section funds belonging to the township in which such lands are located, which may be on hand at the time when such drainage taxes or assessments become due or which may be thereafter at any time collected or acquired. For the purpose of paying such drainage taxes and assessments, the board of education may borrow all money necessary to pay the same. When any such funds are borrowed as aforesaid, for the purposes aforesaid, the same shall be repaid out of the first sixteenth section fund thereafter derived from the sixteenth section lands so taxed and assessed.

Except in those cases when the holder of an existing lease on agricultural land elects to re-lease such land, as authorized under this subsection, it shall be the duty of the board of education to lease the sixteenth section or lieu lands at public contract after having advertised such lands for rent in a newspaper published in the county or, if no newspaper is published in the county, then in a newspaper having a general circulation therein, for two (2) successive weeks, the first being at least ten (10) days before the public contract. The lease form and the terms so prescribed shall be on file and available for inspection in the office of the superintendent from and after the public notice by advertisement and until finally accepted by the board. However, before the expiration of an existing lease of land classified as agricultural land, except as otherwise provided in subsection (2) for lands intended to be reclassified, the board of education, in its discretion and subject to the prior approval of the Secretary of State, may authorize the holder of the existing lease to re-lease the land, on no more than one (1) occasion, for a term not to exceed five (5) years and for a rental amount that is no less than one hundred twenty percent (120%) of the total rental value of the existing lease. If the holder of the existing lease elects not to re-lease the land, the board of education shall publish an advertisement of agricultural land for rent which publication shall be not more than four (4) months before the expiration of the term of an existing lease of the land. An election by the holder of the existing lease not to re-lease the land shall not preclude his participation in the bidding process established under this section. Subject to the classification of the land, the board of education shall enter into a new lease on agricultural land before the expiration of an existing lease on the same land, and the new lease shall take effect on the day immediately following the day on which the existing lease expires. The board of education may require bidders to furnish bond or submit evidence of financial ability.
       <p>
        Bids received by the board of education in response to the advertisement shall be opened at a regular or special meeting of the board. The board of education, at its option, may reject all bids or accept the highest and best bid received in response to the advertisement, or the board of education may hold an auction among those who submitted bids in response to the advertisement. If the board of education elects to hold an auction, no bidder shall be granted any preference. The opening bid at the auction shall be highest bid received in response to the advertisement.

       If, during the final year of an existing lease, the board of education notifies the holder of the existing lease that the board of education intends to reclassify the land under Section 29-3-39, the holder of the existing lease may re-lease the land for a term of five (5) years and for a rental amount that is equal to one hundred twenty percent (120%) of the total rental value of the then existing lease. Thereafter, the board of education shall have the option to proceed with the reclassification of the land or may re-lease the land for one (1) additional term of five (5) years after advertising for bids or holding an auction in the same manner as provided in subsection (1) of this section, and the new classification will be implemented upon the expiration of the then existing lease. This subsection does not apply if the board of education intends to reclassify the land under the “commercial” or “industrial” land classification based on a valid business proposal presented to and approved by the board of education.

However, no leaseholder may submit a second bid if: (i) any rent, taxes or other payment required under his lease are past due; or (ii) he is otherwise in default of any term or provision of the lease and such default has not been corrected or cured to the satisfaction of the board of education after more than thirty (30) days’ notice to the leaseholder of the default.

If no bids are received in response to the advertisement, the board of education may negotiate a private contract for a fair rental value, and the term of such contract shall expire on December 31 of the same calendar year in which the contract is made.

       Inasmuch as the leases of Sixteenth section lands situated in levee districts had to be approved by the county board of supervisors, the only practical way was to ask for sealed, written bids for leases in order that the same might be submitted to the board. Delta & Pine Land Co. v. Board of Supervisors, 228 So. 2d 893, 1969 Miss. LEXIS 1411 (Miss. 1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       The separate classification of the alluvial lands located in the levee districts is a reasonable classification, is germane to the leasing of Sixteenth section lands within such districts, and this section [Code 1942, § 6597-12] is constitutional and governs the leasing of those lands. Delta & Pine Land Co. v. Board of Supervisors, 228 So. 2d 893, 1969 Miss. LEXIS 1411 (Miss. 1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       The notice of the superintendent of education inviting bids for leases of Sixteenth section lands need not necessarily be published in the judicial district of a county having two judicial districts in which the land is located, for this section [Code 1942, § 6597-12] provides only that the notice be published in a newspaper published in the county.

       Agricultural land may be leased in accord with Section 29-3-81; there appears to be no provision in law for lessee to negotiate lower rental price after bid has been received and awarded and lease contract executed failing showing of mutual mistake wherein only court of competent jurisdiction may award equitable relief.

       A lessee of sixteenth section agricultural lands does hold hunting and fishing rights on those lands, absent a specific lease provision to the contrary; since no sixteenth section lands except forest lands can be leased separately for hunting and fishing purposes, the county board of education may not include a provision in its advertisement for bids or in a lease of agricultural lands to exclude hunting and fishing rights from the lease; the board also has the duty to impose such provisions in sixteenth section leases that a prudent lessor would require.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The following procedure shall be followed for the leasing of sixteenth section school lands or lands granted in lieu thereof which are not classified as agricultural land:
     </p>
     <p>
      Any present leaseholder who desires to renew his lease, or any person who desires to lease sixteenth section or lieu lands, shall make application to the superintendent of education.
     </p>
     <p>
      Upon receipt of an application for the lease of such lands, the superintendent of education shall promptly give consideration to the application and he shall record his recommendation in writing and present it to the board of education at the next regular meeting of the board.
     </p>
     <p>
      The board of education, at its meeting, shall consider the application and recommendation of the superintendent of education and may receive any other information which it considers bearing upon the approval of the application and lease of such land. Within thirty (30) days of the receipt of an application, the board shall act on the application and if such action is favorable, the board of education shall submit to the superintendent of education a suggested lease agreement.
     </p>
     <p>
      The superintendent of education shall then present the lease to the board of supervisors of the county where such land is located. Within thirty (30) days of the receipt of the lease, the board of supervisors shall accept or reject the proposed rental amount.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the board of supervisors accepts the lease as proposed by the board of education, the superintendent of education shall execute the lease to the applicant under the terms and conditions set forth in the lease.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the board of supervisors refuses to accept the rental value set by the board of education in the proposed lease, the rental value of the lease shall be determined under the provisions set forth in Section 29-3-1(2).
     </p>
     <p>
      All sixteenth section or lieu land leases shall be reduced to writing and signed in triplicate by the president of the board of supervisors, the president of the board of education and the superintendent of education. The chancery clerk shall certify one (1) copy of the lease to the superintendent of education and one (1) copy to the state land commissioner, and shall record the original on the deed records of the county, abstract the lease as a mesne conveyance, and record it on the minutes of the board of supervisors. The chancery clerk shall charge and collect from the lessee the full recording fees.

     <p>
      In all surface leases of sixteenth section land made by the board of education, whether such leases be original leases or extensions of existing leases, title to all timber, minerals, oil, and gas on such lands shall be reserved, together with the right of ingress and egress to remove same, whether such provisions be included in the terms of any such lease or not; and no timber shall be cut and used by the lessees except for fuel and necessary repairs and improvements on the leased premises. The board of education, notwithstanding the fact that such land may have been leased for other purposes, shall have the right, from time to time, to sell all merchantable timber on such lands in the manner hereinabove provided. In all cases where surface leases were outstanding on June 28, 1958, and have at least five (5) years remaining of the term thereof wherein the right to sell timber has not been reserved, either expressly or by operation of law, the board may, by agreement with the lessee, sell such timber under the procedure herein set out. In all such cases the forestry commission shall only cause to be marked for cutting such timber as, in its judgment, should be harvested in the best interest of the reversionary estate, and the board may agree to pay to the lessee a portion of the proceeds of such sales from time to time, not to exceed fifty percent (50%) thereof after the deduction of the fifteen percent (15%) escrow money, hereinbefore mentioned, and all other costs of the sale. In any surface lease, the board of education shall reserve the right to grant or sell rights-of-way across any of said land for a road, highway, railroad, or any public utility line, provided only that the leaseholder be paid a reasonable rental for the unexpired term of his lease by the grantee of such right-of-way. If any surface lessee of any such sixteenth section land shall commit, cause to be committed, or permit the commission of any act of waste on any sixteenth section lands under lease to such lessee, then such lease shall thereupon, as to such lessee, cease and terminate and shall thenceforth be null and void; and the board of education shall have the right to institute an action in any court of competent jurisdiction to secure the cancellation of same of record, to recover damages for such waste, and to maintain an action in ejectment to recover possession of the same. To this end, the board of education is hereby authorized and empowered to employ competent counsel to institute and maintain any such action or actions on behalf of the board.

       A lessee of sixteenth section agricultural lands does hold hunting and fishing rights on those lands, absent a specific lease provision to the contrary; since no sixteenth section lands except forest lands can be leased separately for hunting and fishing purposes, the county board of education may not include a provision in its advertisement for bids or in a lease of agricultural lands to exclude hunting and fishing rights from the lease; the board also has the duty to impose such provisions in sixteenth section leases that a prudent lessor would require.

      Notwithstanding the provisions of this or any other statute, the several boards of education are hereby authorized and empowered, in their discretion and by resolution spread upon the minutes, to set aside, reserve, and dedicate any available sixteenth section lands or lands in lieu thereof for use by such school district as a site for school buildings, which such dedication and reservation shall be for such length of time, not exceeding fifty (50) years, and upon such terms and conditions as the board of education, in its discretion, shall deem proper. Any such reservation or dedication of sixteenth section lands shall automatically cease and terminate if, at any time, the land involved shall cease to be used for the purpose for which the dedication or reservation is made. The reservation or dedication shall cover the surface of said lands only and shall not prevent the board of education from leasing said lands for oil, gas, and mineral exploration and development in a manner otherwise provided by law.

     <p>
      In the same manner and subject to the same provisions hereinabove set forth the board of education having a timber management and marketing agreement with the state forestry commission or National Forest Service, may set aside, reserve and dedicate any available sixteenth section lands or lands granted in lieu thereof, which has been classified as forest land under the provisions of Section 29-3-31 et seq., Mississippi Code of 1972, to be utilized for public parks and recreation areas. The board of supervisors or the governing authorities of any municipality wherein such lands or any portion thereof lie may expend any funds otherwise available for park or recreational areas in the construction and maintenance of improvements to be located thereon.
     </p>
     <p>
      The setting aside, reservation and dedication of any such sixteenth section lands, or lands granted in lieu thereof by a board of education to the state park commission for the purpose of locating a state park thereon may be for a length of time not exceeding ninety-nine (99) years.

     <p>
      No sixteenth section or lieu land which is subject to an existing lease shall be set aside, dedicated, and reserved as a school building site or for public park or recreational purposes under the provisions of this section unless the school district involved shall acquire the unexpired leasehold interest from the leaseholder, or unless such lease and leasehold interest shall be surrendered and relinquished by the leaseholder.

    Leases for oil, gas and mineral exploration, mining, production and development.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The board of education is hereby authorized and empowered, in its discretion, to let, demise and lease sixteenth section lands, included in the Choctaw Purchase, or the lands held in lieu of same whether located therein or elsewhere, reserved for the support of township schools, for exploration, mining, production and development by any method of oil, gas, and minerals, including (a) oil, gas, carbon dioxide and other gaseous substances, (b) metals, compounds of metals, or metal-bearing ores, (c) coal, including anthracite, bituminous, subbituminous, lignite and their constituent components and products and minerals intermingled or associated therewith, and (d) sulphur, salt, sand, gravel, fill dirt and clay, upon such terms and conditions and for such consideration as the board of education, in its discretion, shall deem proper and advisable. Such leasing shall, except as hereinafter provided, be done by competitive bids only, made upon at least three (3) weeks public notice given by advertisement in a newspaper published in the county wherein such lands are situated, or if no newspaper be published in said county then in a newspaper having general circulation therein. Such advertisement shall give an accurate legal description of the lands to be leased, inviting sealed proposals thereon to be filed with the superintendent of education. Before bids are requested, the board shall prescribe the form of the lease and shall prescribe the royalty to be retained by the lessor, the annual rental to be paid by the lessee during the primary term of the lease, and shall have as subject to bid only the bonus to be paid by lessee, and, for leases of coal, the bonus to be paid by lessee for any renewal term as hereinafter provided. The lease form and the terms so prescribed shall be on file and available for inspection in the office of the superintendent from and after the public notice by advertisement and until finally accepted by the board. The board of education shall award the lease to the highest bidder in the manner provided by law. Said school lands shall not be leased for oil, gas, and minerals, including metals, compounds of metals, or metal-bearing ores, coal and clay, exploration, mining, production, and development for a bonus of less than One Dollar ($1.00) per acre and a renewal rental or renewal bonus of less than One Dollar ($1.00) per acre per annum during the primary term. Such lands shall not be leased for oil, gas, and other minerals for a primary term of more than five (5) years and so long thereafter as oil, gas or other minerals are being produced and mined from said lands, or so long as the lease is being maintained by other lease provisions, except that a lease shall in no event extend longer than permitted by Section 211 of the Mississippi Constitution. Such lands shall not be leased for coal for a primary term of more than twenty (20) years and so long thereafter as coal is being mined and sold or utilized by lessee from such lands or from adjoining lands within a mine plan which includes such lands or so long as mining operations are being prosecuted on such lands on a continuous basis; provided, however, that any lease of coal may provide for one (1) renewal term of not more than twenty (20) years from and after expiration of the initial term upon payment by lessee of a renewal bonus of not less than One Dollar ($1.00) per acre. Any mine plan referred to in this paragraph shall not contain more than five thousand (5,000) acres. The royalties to be paid shall not be less than (a) on oil, one-eighth (1/8) of that produced and saved from said lands; (b) on gas, including casinghead gas or other gaseous substances produced from said land and sold or used off the premises or in the manufacture of gasoline or other products therefrom, the market value at the well of one-eighth (1/8) of the amount realized from such sale; (c) on coal mined on such land and sold or utilized by lessee, one-twentieth (1/20) of the market value at the mine of each ton of two thousand (2,000) pounds; (d) on all other minerals produced, mined and marketed, one-sixteenth (1/16) either in kind or value at the well or mine at lessor’s election, except that on sulphur mined and marketed, the royalty shall be not less than Fifty Cents (50¢) per long ton, except, further, that on salt the royalty shall be not less than Five Cents (5¢) per ton mined. Lessee shall have free use of oil, gas, coal, and water from said land, except water from lessor’s wells, unless lessor shall agree in writing to the use of water from lessor’s wells, for all operations hereunder, and the royalty on oil, gas, and coal shall be computed after deducting any so used. In leasing said lands for the mining and removal of clay, sand, gravel and fill dirt, the bid shall be by the cubic yard truck measure and to the highest and best bidder, provided that these materials shall not be sold therefrom for less than the regular market price thereof, such price to include the value of the royalty provided for herein. The board of education shall not lease any sixteenth section land that was sold and conveyed in fee simple forever by a board of supervisors prior to 1890.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is further specifically provided that such leases shall not be let at a special meeting of the board of education.
     </p>
     <p>
      Leases for metals, coals, sand, gravel, fill dirt or clay may be executed covering land upon which leases are outstanding for the exploration, mining, and development of oil, gas, and other minerals, provided proper safeguards are incorporated in the lease for the protection of the other leaseholders. All such leases shall contain suitable provisions for adequate compensation to the surface lessee, if any, for any damage done to the leasehold estate in such lands and for the use of a substantial portion of the surface thereof for such mining and/or developing or processing purposes, and for rights of ingress and egress, and all such leases shall further contain suitable provisions for adequate compensation to the board of education for any permanent damage done to the surface of the land or any timber thereon. Any future lease of said land after expiration of the present lease thereon will be subject to the rights of any lessee under provisions hereof.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the lessor commits any error in the leasing procedure which renders the lease void or voidable, the lessee shall be entitled to recover the consideration paid to secure the lease.
     </p>
     <p>
      No clay shall be leased nor removed within the boundary of any incorporated municipality as such boundary existed on January 1, 1964, nor within one hundred fifty (150) feet of any dwelling house which is either occupied or has been vacant less than ninety (90) days, without the written consent of the leaseholder of the surface from which such clay is to be leased or removed, regardless of classification of such lands.

       This section [Code 1942, § 6600] is not unconstitutional as being in violation of § 90(p) of the Constitution, prohibiting the passage of local, private or special laws for the management or support of any private or common school, on the theory that, being applicable only to school lands “in the Choctaw Purchase,” it applies specially to some but not all parts of the state, since the quoted language was intended to refer to all lands of the state outside of the Chickasaw Cession. Smith v. McCullen, 195 Miss. 34, 13 So. 2d 319, 1943 Miss. LEXIS 119 (Miss. 1943).
      </p>
      <p>
       The objection that statutory provision permitting lease of sixteenth section lands for oil, gas and mineral exploration and development, and for entry upon such lands for such purposes, was unconstitutional because the lease might under its terms remain in force so long as oil and gas should be produced from the land and therefore longer than the 25 years prescribed by a constitutional provision, is obviated by the statute providing that conveyances purporting to convey or pass a greater estate in the grantor might lawfully convey or pass, shall operate and pass such a right or estate as the grantor might lawfully convey. Pace v. State, 191 Miss. 780, 4 So. 2d 270, 1941 Miss. LEXIS 184 (Miss. 1941).
      </p>
      <p>
       Statutory provisions providing for the lease by county authorities upon approval of the state of sixteenth section lands for oil, gas and mineral exploration and development, and for entry on such lands for such purposes, were not unconstitutional, in that they authorized a sale of minerals in situ, as a part of the realty, and that the lease might under its terms remain in force so long as oil and gas were produced on the land which might be longer than 25 years, all in violation of the state constitution prohibiting either a sale of any part of the sixteenth section lands, or a lease thereof for a period of more than 25 years. Pace v. State, 191 Miss. 780, 4 So. 2d 270, 1941 Miss. LEXIS 184 (Miss. 1941).
      </p>
      <p>
       Statutes providing for the lease by county authorities upon approval of the state of sixteenth section school lands for oil, gas and mineral exploration and development and for entry on such lands for such purposes, were not unconstitutional as authorizing a sale of minerals in situ, as a part of the realty, in violation of the constitutional provisions prohibiting a sale of any part of the sixteenth section lands, since the constitutional prohibition extended only to lands, using the term in the restricted sense as meaning only the soil and not the soil and everything above and below it.

       On application to lease sixteenth section or lieu lands for oil, gas, and mineral exploration and development, an acceptance by the board of supervisors constituted a contract. Oliver v. Board of Supervisors, 211 Miss. 447, 51 So. 2d 766, 1951 Miss. LEXIS 375 (Miss. 1951).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where there was a lease of school lands for oil, gas, and mineral exploration and development and there was a mistake by both parties as to the number of acres in the lease, there being more acreage than described in lease, the lease would be reformed to include the additional acreage. Oliver v. Board of Supervisors, 211 Miss. 447, 51 So. 2d 766, 1951 Miss. LEXIS 375 (Miss. 1951).
      </p>
      <p>
       In leasing sixteenth section or lieu lands for oil, gas, and mineral exploration and development, a responsibility devolves upon a board of supervisors to determine the number of acres and that determination is requisite to the performance of duty, and in so doing, the supervisors were under the obligation to exercise a high degree of care. Oliver v. Board of Supervisors, 211 Miss. 447, 51 So. 2d 766, 1951 Miss. LEXIS 375 (Miss. 1951).
      </p>
      <p>
       Mineral leases under this section [Code 1942, § 6600] are limited to six-year terms, and neither board of supervisors nor county superintendent may lawfully make contract binding their successors, which begins after terms of office of board making it has expired. Humble Oil & Refining Co. v. State, 206 Miss. 847, 41 So. 2d 26, 1949 Miss. LEXIS 306 (Miss. 1949).
      </p>
      <p>
       Members of board of supervisors and county superintendent of education, whose terms of office expired December 31, 1947, had no power or authority on October 20, 1947, to execute new mineral lease under this section [Code 1942, § 6600] to go into effect on April 7, 1948 and continue effective for period of two years, though four of supervisors and county superintendent were reelected. Humble Oil & Refining Co. v. State, 206 Miss. 847, 41 So. 2d 26, 1949 Miss. LEXIS 306 (Miss. 1949).
      </p>
      <p>
       Plaintiffs were not entitled to cancelation of adverse claims to certain sixteenth section school lands and a mineral lease executed by board of supervisors, where they based their rights on an admittedly valid 99-year lease and the evidence showed that they were only lessees for the unexpired term of the original lease. Pilgrim v. Neshoba County, 206 Miss. 703, 40 So. 2d 598, 1949 Miss. LEXIS 294 (Miss. 1949).

      <p>
       The phrase “in the Choctaw purchase” was used to distinguish sixteenth sections of all lands in the state from sixteenth sections in the Chickasaw Cession and to refer to all lands in the state outside the Chickasaw Cession.

       Chancery court had jurisdiction under Code 1942, § 6613 to entertain a suit by school trustees of a township, seeking court’s approval of a proposed but unexecuted mineral lease of sixteenth section land, to determine whether such land was subject to lease by proper authorities under any existing law, and, particularly, whether such land could be leased by county supervisors under Code 1930, § 6762, and to determine the validity of this section [Code 1942, § 6600], amending said section of the 1930 Code. Smith v. McCullen, 195 Miss. 34, 13 So. 2d 319, 1943 Miss. LEXIS 119 (Miss. 1943).

       This section [Code 1942, § 6600] empowers the board of supervisors of Pearl River County, with the approval of the county superintendent of education, to lease school lands in township 3, range 17, of such county.

      <p>
       It would be contrary to every rule of reason to require that prior compensation be made to the surface lessees of their damages, as a condition precedent to the state’s right to enter upon these lands to explore for, drill and remove minerals, where it is known that the measure of such compensation cannot be ascertained until after the extent of such exploration and drilling operations shall have been determined, following such an entry. Pace v. State, 191 Miss. 780, 4 So. 2d 270, 1941 Miss. LEXIS 184 (Miss. 1941).
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the school trustees of township, who had executed 99-year agricultural leases on sixteenth section lands in the county, were without power to waive the right of the state to go upon such lands in the future and utilize any source of revenue that might be derived from them not disposed of by such agricultural or surface leases, it was not essential that the right to minerals be expressly reserved therein, since there was necessarily reserved that which the grantor was without power to convey or contract away. Pace v. State, 191 Miss. 780, 4 So. 2d 270, 1941 Miss. LEXIS 184 (Miss. 1941).
      </p>
      <p>
       Decision of the court below holding that the bill of complaint stated a good cause of action for confirming the title of a lessee from the state in the oil and gas upon sixteenth section lands, cancelling oil and gas easement contracts and leases executed by 99-year agricultural or surface lessees, and awarding injunctive relief to prevent such lessees from preventing the entry upon such lands by the lessee of the state in order to explore and develop such lands for oil and gas, should be affirmed; and that court was vested with plenary power on a final hearing under the complainants’ offer to do equity, and as a condition precedent to keeping the injunction in force, to make secure the rights of agricultural lessees and afford them an adequate remedy in equity, or at law if desired, to collect such damages as might be later sustained to their surface rights.

       Leases made under statute authorizing board of supervisors to lease sixteenth section land for oil, gas and mineral development confer on lessees no greater right to enter on lands than State has.

       The controlling statute a school board must follow to sell sand, gravel, fill dirt, or clay from sixteenth section school trust land is Section 29-3-99 and not Section 31-7-1 et seq. Section 29-3-99 is a specific statute which details the competitive bid requirements on sixteenth section lands for the sale of sands, gravel, fill dirt or clay. Section 31-7-1 et seq. are of a more general nature which deal with public purchasing requirements. McWhorter, November 27, 1995, A.G. Op. #95-0769.

       Statutory provisions providing for the lease by county authorities upon approval of the state of sixteenth section lands for oil, gas and mineral exploration and development, and for entry on such lands for such purposes, were not unconstitutional, in that they authorized a sale of minerals in situ, as a part of the realty, and that the lease might under its terms remain in force so long as oil and gas were produced on the land which might be longer than 25 years, all in violation of the state constitution prohibiting either a sale of any part of the sixteenth section lands, or a lease thereof for a period of more than 25 years. Pace v. State, 191 Miss. 780, 4 So. 2d 270, 1941 Miss. LEXIS 184 (Miss. 1941).
      </p>
      <p>
       The objection that statutory provision permitting lease of sixteenth section lands for oil, gas and mineral exploration and development, and for entry upon such lands for such purposes, was unconstitutional because the lease might under its terms remain in force so long as oil and gas should be produced from the land and therefore longer than the 25 years prescribed by a constitutional provision, is obviated by the statute providing that conveyances purporting to convey or pass a greater estate in the grantor might lawfully convey or pass, shall operate and pass such a right or estate as the grantor might lawfully convey. Pace v. State, 191 Miss. 780, 4 So. 2d 270, 1941 Miss. LEXIS 184 (Miss. 1941).
      </p>
      <p>
       Statutes providing for the lease by county authorities upon approval of the state of sixteenth section school lands for oil, gas and mineral exploration and development and for entry on such lands for such purposes, were not unconstitutional as authorizing a sale of minerals in situ, as a part of the realty, in violation of the constitutional provisions prohibiting a sale of any part of the sixteenth section lands, since the constitutional prohibition extended only to lands, using the term in the restricted sense as meaning only the soil and not the soil and everything above and below it.

       There is no such statute as this with reference to the purchaser of the timber on sixteenth section lands, and, accordingly, the timber on such lands, held under a 99-year agricultural lease, could not be sold without the consent of the lessee. Hood v. Foster, 194 Miss. 812, 13 So. 2d 652, 1943 Miss. LEXIS 109 (Miss. 1943).
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the school trustees of township, who had executed 99-year agricultural leases on sixteenth section lands in the county, were without power to waive the right of the state to go upon such lands in the future and utilize any source of revenue that might be derived from them not disposed of by such agricultural or surface leases, it was not essential that the right to minerals be expressly reserved therein, since there was necessarily reserved that which the grantor was without power to convey or contract away. Pace v. State, 191 Miss. 780, 4 So. 2d 270, 1941 Miss. LEXIS 184 (Miss. 1941).
      </p>
      <p>
       It would be contrary to every rule of reason to require that prior compensation be made to the surface lessees of their damages, as a condition precedent to the state’s right to enter upon these lands to explore for, drill and remove minerals, where it is known that the measure of such compensation cannot be ascertained until after the extent of such exploration and drilling operations shall have been determined, following such an entry. Pace v. State, 191 Miss. 780, 4 So. 2d 270, 1941 Miss. LEXIS 184 (Miss. 1941).
      </p>
      <p>
       Agricultural leases of sixteenth section lands did not pass any interest in the minerals, which remained in the state as trustee for the public, notwithstanding that there was no express reservation thereof in such leases, and the state has the right to enter upon such lands and remove the minerals. Pace v. State, 191 Miss. 780, 4 So. 2d 270, 1941 Miss. LEXIS 184 (Miss. 1941).
      </p>
      <p>
       Decision of the court below holding that the bill of complaint stated a good cause of action for confirming the title of a lessee from the state in the oil and gas upon sixteenth section lands, cancelling oil and gas easement contracts and leases executed by 99-year agricultural or surface lessees, and awarding injunctive relief to prevent such lessees from preventing the entry upon such lands by the lessee of the state in order to explore and develop such lands for oil and gas, should be affirmed; and that court was vested with plenary power on a final hearing under the complainants’ offer to do equity, and as a condition precedent to keeping the injunction in force, to make secure the rights of agricultural lessees and afford them an adequate remedy in equity, or at law if desired, to collect such damages as might be later sustained to their surface rights. Pace v. State, 191 Miss. 780, 4 So. 2d 270, 1941 Miss. LEXIS 184 (Miss. 1941).
      </p>
      <p>
       Leases made under statute authorizing board of supervisors to lease sixteenth section lands for oil, gas, and mineral development confer on lessees no greater right to enter on lands than State has.

      Any person holding or claiming any sixteenth section school land under a lease or extension thereof made by the board of education or by their authority or direction, may proceed by bill in chancery court to have such lease or extension thereof confirmed and quieted. He shall set forth in his bill his claim for title under the lease or extension thereof which he asks to have confirmed, the date of such lease or extension, to whom made, the consideration, and the amount paid and to be paid, if any. The superintendent of education of the district in which the bill is filed and in which the land may be located shall be made a party defendant, and process shall be served on him as in other cases in chancery. Such suits shall be brought in the county in which the sixteenth section or some part thereof is located, and shall be proceeded with as in other cases in chancery, except that the bill shall not be taken as confessed; and it shall be competent for the court to hear and consider evidence aliunde the records of the board of education as to whether the lease or extension thereof sought to be confirmed was legally made and whether the complainant is entitled to relief. If it is clearly proven that the requirements of law regulating such leases or extensions thereof were complied with, the proper relief shall be granted even though the records contain no such affirmative showing. The party claiming title under such lease or extension thereof shall be entitled to the benefits of this section whether the suit be filed by him or by the school district, as required by this chapter.

       In a taxpayer’s action seeking an adjudication that a county board of supervisors had leased 320 acres of sixteenth section land for an inadequate consideration in violation of the constitutional prohibition against the donation of state lands, the trial court erred in sustaining defendants’ plea of res judicata as a bar to the action, notwithstanding that the statutory procedure for confirmation of the lease had been followed. The doctrine of res judicata would yield to the constitution where the earlier confirmation proceedings had not given notice to the public and where defendant had not filed an answer, thus leading to the conclusion that the board had given its passive consent to the decree confirming the lease. Bragg v. Carter, 367 So. 2d 165, 1978 Miss. LEXIS 2443 (Miss. 1978).

       Taxpayers should have been admitted as parties in a suit brought to confirm title of a sixteenth section lease where they were not dilatory in filing their petition to set aside the lease, the interest of the taxpayers could not be protected by a final decree confirming title to the leasehold interest in the lands involved, and the taxpayers were not injecting new issues into the case, but were contending that the consideration paid for the lease was so inadequate as to amount to a donation. Edwards v. Harper, 321 So. 2d 301, 1975 Miss. LEXIS 1527 (Miss. 1975).

      <p>
       A petition filed by taxpayers in a cause brought to extend a lease on sixteenth section land, in which the taxpayers alleged that the rental provided for in the lease was so grossly inadequate as to render the lease a donation, was sufficient to withstand a general demurrer.

       Where sixteenth section lands, partly located in the municipality, were leased by the board of supervisors to a nonprofit corporation, and under a contract with the power company, the nonprofit corporation undertook the construction of a reservoir on the leased premises, and the power company was to use the water therein in connection with the operation of its electric generating plant, and the capitalized value of the leased land per acre upon the completion of the proposed improvements would greatly exceed the present capitalized value per acre, and there was no taking or removing of the soil from the premises, the construction of the reservoir would not constitute waste; nor did the fact that the leased lands were formerly used almost exclusively for agricultural purposes mean that it would be unlawful to construct the proposed improvements or that the land should be used for commercial or residential purposes, especially in view of the fact that there had been no development of the lands, and the chancellor’s action in refusing to enjoin the construction of the proposed improvements and in confirming the lease was proper.

       § 29-3-113.
    Investment and lending of funds.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The principal fund shall be a permanent township fund which shall consist of funds heretofore or hereafter derived from certain uses or for certain resources of school trust lands which shall be invested and, except as otherwise provided in this section, only the interest and income derived from such funds shall be expendable by the school district.
     </p>
     <p>
      The principal fund shall consist of:
     </p>
     <p>
      Funds received for easements and rights-of-way pursuant to Section 29-3-91;
     </p>
     <p>
      Funds received for sales of lieu land pursuant to Sections 29-3-15 through 29-3-25;
     </p>
     <p>
      Funds received from any permanent damage to the school trust land;
     </p>
     <p>
      Funds received from the sale of nonrenewable resources including, but not limited to, the sale of sand, gravel, dirt, clays and royalties received from the sale of mineral ores, coal, oil and gas;
     </p>
     <p>
      Funds received from the sale of buildings pursuant to Section 29-3-77;
     </p>
     <p>
      Funds received from the sale of timber; and
     </p>
     <p>
      Funds received pursuant to Section 29-3-23(2).
     </p>
     <p>
      It shall be the duty of the board of education to keep the principal fund invested in any direct obligation issued by or guaranteed in full as to principal and interest by the United States of America or in certificates of deposit issued by a qualified depository of the State of Mississippi as approved by the State Treasurer. The certificates of deposit may bear interest at any rate per annum which may be mutually agreed upon but in no case shall said rate be less than that paid on passbook savings.
     </p>
     <p>
      The board of education is authorized to invest the funds in interest bearing deposits or other obligations of the types described in Section 27-105-33 or in any other type investment in which any other political subdivision of the State of Mississippi may invest, except that one hundred percent (100%) of the funds are authorized to be invested. For the purposes of investment, the principal fund of each township may be combined into one or more district accounts; however, the docket book of the county superintendent shall at all times reflect the proper source of such funds. Provided that funds received from the sale of timber shall be placed in a separate principal fund account, and may be expended for any of the purposes authorized by law.
     </p>
     <p>
      The board of education shall have authority to borrow such funds at a rate of interest not less than four percent (4%) per annum and for a term not exceeding twenty (20) years, for the erection, equipment or repair of said district schools, to provide local funds for any building project approved by the State Board of Education or to provide additional funds for forest stand improvement as set forth in Section 29-3-47. In addition, the board may borrow the funds under the same interest restrictions for a term not exceeding ten (10) years to provide funds for the purchase of school buses. The board of education of any school district in any county that has an aggregate amount of assets in its principal fund in excess of Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000.00), may deduct an amount not to exceed Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000.00) for the purpose of covering the cost of asbestos removal from school district buildings. Such asbestos removal shall be construed to constitute the repair of school district facilities as prescribed in Section 29-3-115.
     </p>
     <p>
      No school land trust funds may be expended after the annual payment date until the payment is made on such loan. The annual payment can be made from any funds available to the school district except minimum foundation program funds.
     </p>
     <p>
      It shall be unlawful for the board of education to borrow any sixteenth section school funds in any other manner than that prescribed herein, and if any such funds shall be borrowed or invested in any other manner, any officer concerned in making such loan and investment or suffering the same to be made in violation of the provisions of this section, shall be liable personally and on his official bond for the safety of the funds so loaned.

       Loan by board of supervisors of sixteenth section township funds to individual executing trust deed held not invalid for failure to observe proceedings required in statute. Gully v. McClellan, 170 Miss. 405, 153 So. 524, 1934 Miss. LEXIS 91 (Miss. 1934).
      </p>
      <p>
       Under such statute board of supervisors might extend loan of sixteenth section township funds where security was adequate, since object of funds was to produce revenue for schools. Gully v. McClellan, 170 Miss. 405, 153 So. 524, 1934 Miss. LEXIS 91 (Miss. 1934).
      </p>
      <p>
       County supervisors, in making loan of sixteenth section township funds, were required to exercise discretion, and there was no personal liability merely because statutory directions were not followed in making loan. Gully v. McClellan, 170 Miss. 405, 153 So. 524, 1934 Miss. LEXIS 91 (Miss. 1934).
      </p>
      <p>
       County supervisors, not following statutory directions in making loan of sixteenth section township funds, would only be personally liable on official bonds if it developed that security was insufficient to bring amount of loan with interest. Gully v. McClellan, 170 Miss. 405, 153 So. 524, 1934 Miss. LEXIS 91 (Miss. 1934).

       County board of supervisors not making loan of sixteenth section township funds would not be liable for failure to collect funds loaned by predecessors in view of statute providing for collection by superintendent of education.

       Statute respecting loan by county supervisors of sixteenth section township funds imposed its own liability for violating statute, and statute regarding supervisors’ bonds does not apply where supervisors did not comply with statutory directions.

       Sixteenth section funds may not be invested in mutual funds since shares in such are not direct obligations of United States and are not guaranteed in full by United States as required by Miss. Code Ann. Section 29-3-113. Montgomery, Nov. 25, 1992, A.G. Op. #92-0851.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sixteenth Section principal fund monies cannot be used to acquire two parcels of land for school purposes to enlarge a campus of a new school under construction except in the form of a loan subject to the requirements found in Section 29-3-113. See also Section 29-3-27. Brown, April 30, 1996, A.G. Op. #96-0196.
      </p>
      <p>
       Based on the language of Sections 29-3-113 and 29-3-27, the County Board of Education may use interest and income derived from the proceeds of the sale of the sixteenth section land to the County Board of Supervisors toward the purchase of a 400-acre tract. The school board may not use money from the principal fund to purchase the 400 acres. Clifton, October 29, 1996, A.G. Op. #96-0685.
      </p>
      <p>
       A school board can choose to exercise its authority to invest school funds, including sixteenth section principal funds, by establishing a district investment plan and authorizing a particular school official to implement the plan by carrying out purchases and sales of securities and other investments authorized by Sections 29-3-113 and 37-59-43; the school board members would still be responsible for the safety of such funds and would not esape liability for their loss in the event they were lost through unlawful or negligent act of the designated school official. Turner, August 28, 1998, A.G. Op. #98-0475.
      </p>
      <p>
       A school district may purchase such securities and obligations as allowed by state law through brokers, who may charge an agreed fee for their services, provided the fee is found by the school board to be reasonable and commensurate with those services; there is no authority for a school district to pay more than the market value of securities by means of a mark up by a dealer.
   Turner, August 28, 1998, A.G. Op. #98-0475.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where revenue is shared with another school district from a section that is in a township containing more than one school district, any funds received from a shared section must be divided between the school districts based on the annual lists of school children. Cheney, May 16, 2003, A.G. Op. 03-0163.

    Superintendent of school district to make lists; recount; costs of recount.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      It shall be the duty of the superintendent of each school district to make or cause to be made annual lists of the children enrolled in the schools of such district and who reside in such district, which lists shall be based upon the end of the first month enrollment required to be reported to the State Department of Education for the then current school year. The lists shall be made separately as to the townships in which such children reside. Such lists shall be filed with the superintendent of the custodial school district on or before December 31 of each year, and the lists shall be used in making the division of the available funds of each township during the ensuing calendar year, as provided by Section 29-3-119. The superintendent of the custodial school district shall make such lists available, upon request, to each school district sharing in the revenues of the township. Any school district failing to timely provide the list to the superintendent of the custodial school district shall forfeit its right to such funds unless the school board of the custodial school district and the school board of the other district or districts entitled to such funds have executed a written agreement providing for the distribution of such funds in a manner agreed upon by the school districts. All such lists shall be retained and preserved by the superintendent of the custodial school district as a public record. Such lists shall not be made, however, as to any township which is wholly within one (1) school district. If any superintendent of a school district participating in the division of such funds shall challenge in writing the accuracy of any such list, the Office of the State Auditor, upon receipt of such challenge, may, in its discretion, order and arrange for and supervise a recount of the children enrolled in the schools of such district and who reside in such district. All costs incurred in conducting the recount shall be borne by the challenging district and the district in which the recount is conducted on a pro rata basis, as determined from the results of the recount. Such costs may be paid from the school district’s share of the available township funds. Such recount, when obtained, shall supersede the original list for the purposes of Sections 29-3-115 through 29-3-123.

      The board of supervisors of any county with a population of two hundred thousand (200,000) or more shall have the authority to create, by appropriate order spread on its minutes and approved by vote of at least three-fifths (3/5) of its members, a sixteenth section development authority for the purpose of developing all or any part of a sixteenth section, or lands granted in lieu thereof, controlled by the board; provided, however, that said authority shall not be created by said board unless and until the county school board and, in the event the sixteenth section or lands granted in lieu thereof is located within a municipal separate school district, the trustees of the municipal separate school district submit to the board a resolution, properly adopted, requesting the creation of said authority and designating the sixteenth section, or lands granted in lieu thereof, to be developed and leased. The order shall designate the sixteenth section, or lands granted in lieu thereof, to be developed in whole or in part by the authority; provided, however, that the order shall designate only one sixteenth section, or one section of land granted in lieu thereof, to be developed in whole or in part by the authority.

      The county school board and, in the event the sixteenth section or lands granted in lieu thereof is located within a municipal separate school district, the trustees of the municipal separate school district are specifically authorized to lend to the authority such funds for interim financing of development as may be available to the said board and trustees and deemed desirable. In the event that any such loan is made by the county school board and the trustees of the municipal separate school district, the participation of each in such loan shall be determined by the percentage of revenue from the sixteenth section, or lands granted in lieu thereof, to be developed by the authority which each received in the most prior year of receipt.

     <p>
      The board of trustees of the authority is hereby authorized and empowered to issue bonds of the authority for the purpose of paying the costs of acquiring, owning, constructing, operating, repairing and maintaining the projects and works specified herein, including related facilities, and including all financing and financial advisory charges, interest during construction, engineering, legal, and other expenses incidental to and necessary for the foregoing, or for the carrying out of any power conferred by Sections 29-3-151 through 29-3-183. Said board of trustees is authorized and empowered to issue such bonds at such times and in such amounts as shall be provided for by resolution of the said board of trustees.
     </p>
     <p>
      Provided, however, the bonds herein authorized shall not be issued until the board shall have published notice of its intention to issue same; said notice to be published once each week for three (3) consecutive weeks in some newspaper in the county, but not less than twenty-one (21) days nor more than sixty (60) days intervening between the time of the first notice and the meeting at which said board proposes to issue such bonds. If, within the time of giving notice, not less than fifteen hundred (1500) of the qualified electors of the county shall file a written petition with the board of trustees of the authority protesting the issuance of the bonds, the board of supervisors shall call an election on the question of issuing the bonds. Such election shall be held and conducted by the election commissioners of the county as nearly as may be in conformity with the provisions of Sections 19-9-13 through 19-9-17, Mississippi Code of 1972, governing bond elections, in which election all qualified electors of the county may vote.
     </p>
     <p>
      All such bonds so issued by said authority shall be secured solely by pledge of the net revenues which may now or hereafter come to the authority and by pledge of the rental income from the sixteenth section, or lands granted in lieu thereof, to be developed by the authority which may now or hereafter come to the county school board and/or the trustees of the municipal separate school district. Such bonds shall not constitute general obligations of the State of Mississippi, or of the county creating the authority, and such bonds shall not be secured by a pledge of the full faith, credit and resources of said state or of said county. “Revenues” as used in Sections 29-3-151 through 29-3-183 shall mean all charges, tolls, rates, gifts, grants, moneys, rentals and proceeds from the leasing for commercial and/or industrial use of the lands actually developed by the authority under said sections, and all other funds coming into the possession of the authority by virtue of the provisions of said sections, except the proceeds from the sale of the bonds issued hereunder. “Net revenues” as used in Sections 29-3-151 through 29-3-183 shall mean the revenues after payment of costs and expenses of management and maintenance of the project and related facilities. “Rental income” shall mean all rentals, moneys or funds derived pursuant to Sections 29-3-27 et seq., Mississippi Code of 1972, from the sixteenth section, or lands granted in lieu thereof, to be developed by the authority, except such rentals, moneys, or funds derived from the leasing for commercial and/or industrial use of the lands actually developed by the authority.

The county school board and the trustees of the municipal separate school district are hereby specifically authorized to pay, and shall pay, to the authority, if necessary, such sums as are sufficient to pay all or the remainder of said principal and interest from rental income, and the part of such sum to be paid by the said county school board and the trustees of the municipal separate school district, respectively, to the authority for this purpose shall be determined by the percentage of revenue from the sixteenth section, or lands granted in lieu thereof, to be developed by the authority which each received in the most prior year of receipt.

      On all revenue bonds issued pursuant to the provisions of Sections 29-3-151 through 29-3-183 and hereafter sold, the trustees shall advertise them for sale on sealed bids for at least two (2) times in a newspaper within the county in which the bonds are to be sold, the first publication to be made at least ten (10) days preceding the date fixed for the reception of bids, such notice to give the time and place of sale. The procedure further demands that each bid shall be accompanied by a cashier’s check, certified check, or exchange payable to the authority, issued or certified by a bank located in the state in the amount of not less than two percent (2%) of the par value of the bonds offered for sale, as a guaranty that the bidder will carry out his contract and purchase the bonds if the bid is accepted. If the successful bidder fails to purchase the bonds pursuant to his bid and contract, the amount of such good faith check shall be retained by the authority and covered into the proper fund as liquidated damages for such failure.

    General terms and conditions as to bonds.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      All such bonds provided for by Sections 29-3-151 through 29-3-183 shall be securities within the meaning of Article 8 of the Mississippi Uniform Commercial Code, being Sections 75-8-101 et seq. They shall be lithographed or engraved and printed in two (2) or more colors to prevent counterfeiting. They shall be in denominations of not less than One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00), and may be registered as issued. Each such bond shall specify on its face the purpose for which it was issued, the total amount authorized to be issued and the interest on the bond. Such bonds shall bear interest at such rate or rates as may be determined by the sale of such bonds, provided that the bonds of any issue shall not bear a greater overall maximum interest rate to maturity than that allowed in Section 75-17-103. They shall mature annually in such amounts and at such times as shall be provided by the resolution of the board of trustees. Provided, however, that no bonds shall have a longer maturity than twenty-five (25) years from date of issuance, and the first maturity date thereof shall be not more than five (5) years from the date of such bonds. The denomination, form and place or places of payment of such bonds shall be fixed in the resolution of the board of trustees of the authority. Such bonds shall be signed by the chairman and the secretary of the board of trustees, with the corporate seal affixed thereto, but the coupons may bear only the facsimile signatures of such chairman or secretary. No bond shall bear more than one (1) rate of interest; each bond shall bear interest from its date to its stated maturity date at the interest rate specified in the bid (all bonds of the same maturity shall bear the same rate of interest); all interest accruing on such bonds so issued shall be payable semiannually, or annually, except that the first interest coupon attached to any such bond may be for any period not exceeding one (1) year.
     </p>
     <p>
      No interest payment shall be evidenced by more than one (1) coupon and supplemental coupons will not be permitted; and no interest coupon shall vary more than twenty-five percent (25%) in interest rate from any other interest coupon in the same bond issue.
     </p>
     <p>
      Each interest rate specified in any bid must be in a multiple of one-eighth of one percent (1/8 of 1%) or one-tenth of one percent (1/10 of 1%) and a zero rate of interest cannot be named.
     </p>
     <p>
      Notice of the sale of any such bonds shall be published at least two (2) times, with the first publication not less than fourteen (14) days prior to the date of sale, and shall be so published in one or more newspapers having a general circulation in the area in which the development is located and in one or more other newspapers or financial journals with a large circulation. One (1) proof of publication shall be filed in the minutes of the board of trustees.
     </p>
     <p>
      Such bonds may be called in, paid and redeemed as authorized in the resolution authorizing the issue on any interest date prior to maturity upon not less than thirty (30) days’ notice to the paying agent or agents designated in such bonds. Provided, however, that in no case shall any premiums exceed seven percent (7%) of the face value of such bonds.
     </p>
     <p>
      All bonds issued by the authority shall contain in substance a statement to the effect that they are secured solely by a pledge of the net revenues and by pledge of rental income, and that they do not constitute general obligations of the State of Mississippi or of the county in which the development is located, and are not secured by a pledge of the full faith, credit and resources of said state or of such county.
     </p>
     <p>
      All such bonds as provided for herein shall be sold under the sealed bid procedure at public sale as now provided in Section 31-19-25, Mississippi Code of 1972. No such sale shall be at a price so low as to require the payment of interest on the money received therefor at more than a greater overall maximum interest rate to maturity than that allowed in Section 75-17-103.
     </p>
     <p>
      Sections 29-3-151 through 29-3-183 shall be full and complete authority for the issuance of the bonds provided for herein, and no restriction or limitation otherwise prescribed by law shall apply except as included in statutes governing and controlling issuance of all municipal bonds.
     </p>
     <p>
      Provided, however, the board of trustees shall have the authority to enter into cooperative agreements with the state or federal government, or both, and to execute and deliver at private sale notes or bonds as evidence of such indebtedness in the form and subject to the terms and conditions as may be imposed by the state or federal government, or both, and to pledge the income and revenues of the authority in payment thereof.
     </p>
     <p>
      Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section, bonds referred to hereinabove may be issued pursuant to the supplemental powers and authorizations conferred by the provisions of the Registered Bond Act, being Sections 31-21-1 through 31-21-7.

       § 29-7-3.
    Lease of state lands for minerals; exploration or testing permits; mineral royalties; Gulf and Wildlife Protection Fund; authority to lease; restrictions on offshore drilling.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      There shall be no development or extraction of oil, gas, or other minerals from state-owned lands by any private party without first obtaining a mineral lease therefor from the commission. The commission is hereby authorized and empowered, for and on behalf of the state, to lease any and all of the state land now owned (including that submerged or whereover the tide may ebb and flow) or hereafter acquired, to some reputable person, association, or company for oil and/or gas and/or other minerals in and under and which may be produced therefrom, excepting, however, sixteenth section school land, lieu lands, and such forfeited tax land and property the title to which is subject to any lawful redemption, for such consideration and upon such terms and conditions as the commission deems just and proper. No mineral lease of offshore lands shall allow offshore drilling operations north of the coastal barrier islands, except in Blocks 40, 41, 42, 43, 63, 64 and 66 through 98, inclusive. Further, surface offshore drilling operations will not be allowed within one (1) mile of Cat Island. The commission may only offer for lease the state-owned lands in Blocks 40, 41, 42, 43, 63, 64 and 66 through 98, inclusive, as shown on the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality Bureau of Geology Plat of Lease Blocks (Open File Report 151) on terms and conditions and for a length of time as determined by the commission. The commission may not lease any lands or submerged lands off the Mississippi Gulf Coast that have been leased by the Department of Marine Resources before January 1, 2004, for any public or private oyster reef lease or any lands or submerged lands within one (1) mile of that lease for the purposes of drilling offshore for oil, gas and other minerals.
     </p>
     <p>
      Consistent with the conservation policies of this state under Section 53-1-1 et seq., the commission may offer for public bid any tracts or blocks of state-owned lands not currently under lease, which have been identified to the commission as having development potential for oil or natural gas, not less than once a year. Upon consultation with the Office of Geology in the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality, the Secretary of State and any other state agency as the commission deems appropriate, the commission shall promulgate rules and regulations consistent with this chapter governing all aspects of the process of leasing state lands within its jurisdiction for mineral development, including the setting of all terms of the lease form to be used for leasing state-owned lands, any necessary fees, public bidding process, delay rental payments, shut-in royalty payments, and such other provisions as may be required. The Attorney General shall review the lease form adopted by the commission for legal sufficiency.
     </p>
     <p>
      There shall not be conducted any seismographic or other mineral exploration or testing activities on any state-owned lands within the mineral leasing jurisdiction of the commission without first obtaining a permit therefor from the commission. Upon consultation with the Office of Geology in the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality, the Secretary of State and any other state agency as the commission deems appropriate, the commission shall promulgate rules and regulations governing all aspects of seismographic or other mineral exploration activity on state lands within its jurisdiction, including the establishing of fees and issuance of permits for the conduct of such mineral exploration activities. The Attorney General shall review the permit form adopted by the commission for legal sufficiency. Provided, however, that persons obtaining permits from the commission for seismographic or other mineral exploration or testing activities on state-owned wildlife management areas, lakes and fish hatcheries, shall be subject to rules and regulations promulgated therefor by the Mississippi Commission on Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks which shall also receive all permit fees for such testing on said lands. In addition, persons obtaining permits from the commission for seismographic or other mineral exploration or testing activities on state-owned marine waters shall be subject to rules and regulations promulgated therefor by the Mississippi Department of Marine Resources which shall also receive all permit fees for such testing on those waters.
     </p>
     <p>
      Further, provided that each permit within the Mississippi Sound or tidelands shall be reviewed by the Mississippi Commission on Marine Resources and such special conditions as it may specify will be included in the permit. Information or data obtained in any mineral exploration activity on any and all state lands shall be disclosed to the state through the commission, upon demand. Such information or data shall be treated as confidential for a period of ten (10) years from the date of receipt thereof and shall not be disclosed to the public or to any firm, individual or agency other than officials or authorized employees of this state. Any person who makes unauthorized disclosure of such confidential information or data shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction thereof, be fined not more than Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000.00) or imprisoned in the county jail not more than one (1) year, or both.
     </p>
     <p>
      Whenever any such land or property is leased for oil and gas and/or other minerals, such lease contract shall provide for a lease royalty to the state of at least three-sixteenths (3/16) of such oil and gas or other minerals, same to be paid in the manner prescribed by the commission. Of the monies received in connection with the execution of such leases, five-tenths of one percent (5/10 of 1%) shall be retained in a special fund to be appropriated by the Legislature, One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000.00) of which amount to be used by the commission for the administration of the leasing and permitting under this section, and the remainder of such amount shall be deposited into the Education Trust Fund, created in Section 206A, Mississippi Constitution of 1890; and two percent (2%) shall be paid into a special fund to be designated as the “Gulf and Wildlife Protection Fund,” to be appropriated by the Legislature, one-half (1/2) thereof to be apportioned as follows: an amount which shall not exceed One Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) shall be used by the Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks and the Mississippi Department of Marine Resources solely for the purpose of cleanup, remedial or abatement actions involving pollution as a result of the exploration or production of oil or gas, and any amount in excess of such One Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) shall be deposited into the Education Trust Fund, created in Section 206A, Mississippi Constitution of 1890. The remaining one-half (1/2) of such Gulf and Wildlife Protection Fund to be apportioned as follows: an amount which shall not exceed One Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) shall be used by the Mississippi Commission on Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks and the Mississippi Department of Marine Resources for use first in the prudent management, preservation, protection and conservation of existing waters, lands and wildlife of this state and then, provided such purposes are accomplished, for the acquisition of additional waters and lands and any amount in excess of such One Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) shall be deposited into the Education Trust Fund, created in Section 206A, Mississippi Constitution of 1890. However, in the event that the Legislature is not in session to appropriate funds from the Gulf and Wildlife Protection Fund for the purpose of cleanup, remedial or abatement actions involving pollution as a result of the exploration or production of oil or gas, then the Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks and the Mississippi Department of Marine Resources may make expenditures from this special fund account solely for said purpose. The commission may lease the submerged beds for sand and gravel on such a basis as it may deem proper, but where the waters lie between this state and an adjoining state, there must be a cash realization to this state, including taxes paid for such sand and gravel, equal to that being had by such adjoining state, in all cases the requisite consents therefor being lawfully obtained from the United States.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Department of Environmental Quality is authorized to employ competent engineering personnel to survey the territorial waters of this state in the Mississippi Sound and the Gulf of Mexico and to prepare a map or plat of such territorial waters, divided into blocks of not more than six thousand (6,000) acres each with coordinates and reference points based upon longitude and latitude surveys. The commission is authorized to adopt such survey, plat or map for leasing of such submerged lands for mineral development; and such leases may, after the adoption of such plat or map, be made by reference to the map or plat, which shall be on permanent file with the commission and a copy thereof on file in the Office of the State Oil and Gas Board.

       Pursuant to Section 1-1-109, the Joint Legislative Committee on Compilation, Revision and Publication of Legislation corrected a typographical error. The word “of” was substituted for the word “on” so that “Department on Marine Resource” reads “Department of Marine Resources” everywhere it appears in the section. The Joint Committee ratified this correction at its August 5, 2008, meeting.

   Lands under nonnavigable waters subject to ebb and flow of tide are within public trust given to states upon their entry into Union; therefore, state had power to issue oil and gas leases for those lands despite claims of private claimants who traced their record title to lands to prestatehood Spanish land grants.

     </h3>
     <p>
      When any state land mentioned in this chapter is known to be within a well defined proven oil and/or gas field, is subject to waste or dissipation, has not been heretofore leased or under contract, is so situated that the production of such oil and/or gas is needed and useful to the state for any of its buildings and/or institutions and can be profitably used because any such state-owned building or institution is situated thereon or in the immediate vicinity thereof, or when the state needs to drill any well or wells to protect its mineral resources, the said commission is authorized and empowered, in its discretion, to make contracts within the limit of appropriations made for such purposes; said contracts to be let, in the manner now provided by law for letting public contracts, for drilling a well or wells on such land or lands mentioned in this section for oil and/or gas, completing the said well or wells as a producer of oil and/or gas, and connecting any such well or wells to any such state-owned property or institution for use of the production therefrom for fuel or other purposes.
     </p>
     <p>
      The commission is hereby further authorized and empowered in its discretion to proceed to drill under its own direction such well or wells on such state land as it may deem advisable, and to employ such drillers and employees as will be necessary in carrying on such operations; and said commission is further authorized in its discretion to purchase, lease, or hire any machinery, tools, and other equipment necessary for drilling such well or wells, to be paid for by the commission out of any funds appropriated by the legislature for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this chapter. The said commission may, in its discretion, sell or contract the sale of any surplus oil and/or gas not needed by any state building or institution produced from any such well or wells, or may exchange or dispose of any of same by reciprocal agreement in order to serve any distant state-owned institution, but any oil, gas and/or other mineral so disposed of shall not be so disposed of at any amount or value less than the market price thereof.
     </p>
     <p>
      Said commission shall determine in all cases whether it would be to the best interest of the state to dispose of said resources by lease or proceed by contract to drill to the actual exploration and exploitation of said resources by the state itself, and shall be governed entirely by a consideration of the best interest of the state.

After the filing of the petition, the appeal shall be perfected by the filing with the clerk of the chancery court to which the appeal is taken of bond in the sum of Five Hundred Dollars ($500.00) with two (2) sureties or with a surety company qualified to do business in Mississippi as the surety, conditioned to pay the cost of the appeal; the bond to be approved by any member of the commission, or by the clerk of the court to which the appeal is taken. The perfection of an appeal shall not stay or suspend the operation of any rule, regulation, permit or order of the board, but the judge of the chancery court to which the appeal is taken may award a writ of supersedeas to any rule, regulation, permit or order of the commission after five (5) days’ notice to the commission and after hearing. Any order or judgment staying the operation of any rule, regulation, permit or order of the commission shall contain a specific finding, based upon evidence submitted to the chancery judge and identified by reference thereto, that great or irreparable damage would result to the appellant if he is denied relief, and the stay shall not become effective until a supersedeas bond shall have been executed and filed with and approved by the clerk of the court or the chancery judge, payable to the state. The supersedeas bond shall be in an amount fixed by the chancery judge to protect the lessee or permittee from loss or damage from the stay and conditioned as the chancery judge may direct in the order granting the supersedeas. If the appeal is of a commission order concerning the lease of state lands for minerals, that appeal shall be given priority over other matters pending in the chancery court. If the appeal is of a commission permit, that appeal shall be given priority over other matters pending in chancery court.

       Laws of 1989, ch. 495, § 1, effective from and after March 31, 1989, provides as follows:
      </p>
      <p>
       “SECTION 1. The Legislature finds that certainty and stability of the land titles of riparian and littoral property owners along the banks of the navigable rivers and waterways on the borders and in the interior of the state and along the shores of the tidally affected waters of the state are essential to the economic welfare of the state and to the peace, tranquility and financial security of the many thousands of citizens who own such lands; that a dispute has developed with respect to such lands bordering on tidally affected waters, calling into question titles and legal issues believed secure and determined from the date of statehood; that this dispute has cast a doubt and cloud over the titles to all littoral lands and all riparian lands along the rivers and shorelines of the coastal area to such a degree that land sales are being prevented, business and home purchasing has been made difficult or impossible, industrial financing based on such titles has become unavailable, and homeowners and other owners have been rendered apprehensive as to their security in their ownership. Economic growth and development in the coastal counties is at a virtual standstill, creating a constantly increasing and incalculable loss of dollars to the area as well as the loss of countless new jobs for the average citizens of our state. The Legislature finds that this dispute has already caused extensive harm, is intolerable, and immediate resolution is required and would serve the higher public purpose, in order that public trust tidelands and submerged lands may be utilized through their normal interface with the fast lands in furtherance of all the usual purposes of the trust.
      </p>
      <p>
       “The Legislature recognizes that it serves the interests of all the citizens of the state as well as the interests of each individual area and that when controversies and problems arise between divergent interests it becomes the duty and responsibility of the Legislature to balance these interests and reach equitable solutions which will create the least amount of harm to the individual citizens and the state as a whole. The Legislature finds, in accordance with justice and sound policy, that resolving these problems in the manner herein set out would create far less harm and be of greater benefit to the state and its citizens in terms of preventing economic loss, loss of jobs, loss of development, use and enjoyment of the tidelands and submerged lands, loss of industry and loss of revenue to the state than any benefits which would be derived from any attempt to completely rectify unregulated wetlands use which has occurred in the past, that the amount of damage, harm or loss that has occurred to the lands held in public trust since statehood is negligible compared to the benefit of resolving the problem, that the cost of any other solution is far in excess of the amount of public gain.”

       The mere fact that the discretion granted to the Secretary of State in the Public Trust Tidelands Act could be interpreted in different lights, does not automatically render it vague; the procedure established by the tidelands legislation has a reasonable relation to the governmental purpose of establishing the boundary of public trust lands and as such is not vague.

      <li id="t29c15s29-15-7ol11">
       The Secretary of State, in cooperation with other state agencies, shall prepare a Preliminary Map of Public Trust Tidelands. The preliminary map shall depict the boundary as the current mean high water line where shoreline is undeveloped and in developed areas or where there have been encroachments, such maps shall depict the boundary as the determinable mean high water line nearest the effective date of the Coastal Wetlands Protection Act.
      </li>
      <li id="t29c15s29-15-7ol12">
       The state recognizes that the boundary of the public trust tidelands is ambulatory and that the natural inland expansion of tide waters over land not previously subject to the ebb and flow of the tide increases the land subject to the public trust, while natural accretion, the gradual and imperceptible accumulation of land by natural causes, and natural reliction, the increase of land by permanent withdrawal or retrocession of tidal waters by natural causes, diminish the land subject to the public trust and increase the property owned by the contiguous upland owner. Likewise, the state recognizes the common law doctrine as it pertains to such tidelands, submerged lands and riparian and littoral rights and declares such to be the law of this state.
      </li>
      <li id="t29c15s29-15-7ol13">
       The preliminary map shall be transmitted to each of the chancery clerks of the coastal counties, and each chancery clerk shall post such map in a public place in his office. The Secretary of State shall also cause to be published in a newspaper of general circulation within each coastal county a notice announcing that a copy of the Preliminary Map of Public Trust Tidelands is available for public inspection at the office of the chancery clerk of that county, and shall post a similar notice in at least three (3) public places in each coastal county in this state. The preliminary map shall also be open to public inspection at the office of the Secretary of State.
      </li>
      <li id="t29c15s29-15-7ol14">
       The Secretary of State shall allow sixty (60) days after publication of the preliminary map for submission of comments and/or additional documentation and may, at his discretion, revise the map accordingly. Within twenty (20) days of the completion of the period for submission of comments, the Secretary of State shall have incorporated any revisions to the Preliminary Map of Public Trust Tidelands and certify its final adoption. The certified map as finally adopted shall be published as provided hereinabove. The final certified map shall be duly recorded in the land records of the chancery clerks office in Hancock, Harrison and Jackson Counties. Upon recordation, the certified map shall be final to those properties not subject to the trust. The Secretary of State shall issue to all consenting property owners a certificate stating that the described property does not lie within the boundary of the public trust tidelands and is not subject to the trust. The Secretary of State shall duly file such certificates with the proper chancery clerks office for recordation. In addition, the certified map shall be placed in the Secretary of State’s permanent register which shall be open to public inspection. Within one hundred twenty (120) days of final adoption of the certified map, the Secretary of State shall determine those property owners whose lands are subject of the public trust and are in violation of such trust. The Secretary of State shall notify all such owners by certified mail and shall include an explanation of the procedure available to the occupant to resolve any dispute with respect to this map. The notice shall also inform occupants that after three (3) years the boundary as set forth in the certified map shall become final unless the occupant has submitted a contrary claim to the office of the Secretary of State. Such property owner shall have six (6) months to negotiate and settle differences with the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State may allow extensions at his discretion. A boundary determination shall be final upon agreement of the Secretary of State and the owner and an instrument setting forth the boundary agreement shall be duly executed and recorded in the chancery court where the property is located.

       Chancellor correctly determined that the question of whether or not East Beach was natural or artificial controlled the legal dispute as to the boundary of the tidelands. Ample evidence supported the chancellor’s determination that no natural beach existed on the shoreline prior to the construction of East Beach. Harris v. State, 256 So.3d 574, 2018 Miss. LEXIS 442 (Miss. 2018).

       Landowners’ inverse condemnation claim against the State of Mississippi did not fail as a matter of law due to the land in question being public trust tidelands because there was a factual dispute as to the boundary of the public trust tidelands, which a jury resolved.

       Trial court erred in granting partial summary judgment to the landowners in the action to confirm title to a sand beach because the State created genuine factual issues by producing evidence that the 1973 high water line, created pursuant to the Public Trust Tidelands Act of 1989, supported the conclusion that the beach was constructed by filling in tidelands and the landowners failed to show that there were no material issues of fact to be determined.

   The discretion granted the Secretary of State by §<cite class="ocms"><a href="#t29c15s29-15-7" target="_self">29-15-7</a></cite> was not unconstitutionally vague in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article 3, § 14 of the Mississippi Constitution, since the procedure established by the tidelands legislation had a reasonable relation to the governmental purpose of establishing the boundary of public trust lands; the mere fact that the discretion granted the Secretary of State could be interpreted in different lights did not automatically render it vague.
